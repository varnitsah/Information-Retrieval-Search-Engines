rises upon a drinking chorus   a crow who had flown away with a cheese from a dairywindow sate perched on a tree looking down at a great big frog in a pool underneath him the frogs hideous large eyes were goggling out of his head in a manner which appeared quite ridiculous to the old blackamoor who watched the splayfooted slimy wretch with that peculiar grim humour belonging to crows not far from the frog a fat ox was browsing whilst a few lambs frisked about the meadow or nibbled the grass and buttercups there  who should come in to the farther end of the field but a wolf he was so cunningly dressed up in sheeps clothing that the very lambs did not know master wolf nay one of them whose dam the wolf had just eaten after which he had thrown her skin over his shoulders ran up innocently towards the devouring monster mistaking him for her mamma  he he says a fox sneaking round the hedgepaling over which the tree grew whereupon the crow was perched looking down on the frog who was staring with his goggle eyes fit to burst with envy and croaking abuse at the ox how absurd those lambs are yonder silly little knockkneed baahling does not know the old wolf dressed in the sheeps fleece he is the same old rogue who gobbled up little red riding hoods grandmother for lunch and swallowed little red riding hood for supper tirez la bobinette et la chevillette cherra he he  an owl that was hidden in the hollow of the tree woke up oho master fox says she i cannot see you but i smell you if some folks like lambs other folks like geese says the owl  and your ladyship is fond of mice says the fox  the chinese eat them says the owl and i have read that they are very fond of dogs continued the old lady  i wish they would exterminate every cur of them off the face of the earth said the fox  and i have also read in works of travel that the french eat frogs continued the owl aha my friend crapaud are you there that was a very pretty concert we sang together last night  if the french devour my brethren the english eat beef croaked out the froggreat big brutal bellowing oxen  ho whoo says the owl i have heard that the english are toadeaters too  but who ever heard of them eating an owl or a fox madam says reynard or their sitting down and taking a crow to pick adds the polite rogue with a bow to the old crow who was perched above them with the cheese in his mouth we are privileged animals all of us at least we never furnish dishes for the odious orgies of man  i am the bird of wisdom says the owl i was the companion of pallas minerva i am frequently represented in the egyptian monuments  i have seen you over the british barndoors said the fox with a grin you have a deal of scholarship mrs owl i know a thing or two myself but am i confess it no scholara mere man of the worlda fellow that lives by his witsa mere country gentleman  you sneer at scholarship continues the owl with a sneer on her venerable face i read a good deal of a night  when i am engaged deciphering the cocks and hens at roost says the fox  its a pity for all that you cant read that board nailed over my head would give you some information  what does it say says the fox  i cant spell in the daylight answered the owl and giving a yawn went back to sleep till evening in the hollow of her tree  a fig for her hieroglyphics said the fox looking up at the crow in the tree what airs our slow neighbour gives herself she pretends to all the wisdom whereas your reverences the crows are endowed with gifts far superior to these benighted old bigwigs of owls who blink in the darkness and call their hooting singing how noble it is to hear a chorus of crows there are twentyfour brethren of the order of st corvinus who have builded themselves a convent near a wood which i frequent what a droning and a chanting they keep up i protest their reverences singing is nothing to yours you sing so deliciously in parts do for the love of harmony favour me with a solo  while this conversation was going on the ox was thumping the grass the frog was eyeing him in such a rage at his superior proportions that he would have spurted venom at him if he could and that he would have burst only that is impossible from sheer envy the little lambkin was lying unsuspiciously at the side of the wolf in fleecy hosiery who did not as yet molest her being replenished with the mutton her mamma but now the wolfs eyes began to glare and his sharp white teeth to show and he rose up with a growl and began to think he should like lamb for supper  what large eyes you have got bleated out the lamb with rather a timid look  the better to see you with my dear  what large teeth you have got  the better to  at this moment such a terrific yell filled the field that all its inhabitants started with terror it was from a donkey who had somehow got a lions skin and now came in at the hedge pursued by some men and boys with sticks and guns  when the wolf in sheeps clothing heard the bellow of the ass in the lions skin fancying that the monarch of the forest was near he ran away as fast as his disguise would let him when the ox heard the noise he dashed round the meadowditch and with one trample of his hoof squashed the frog who had been abusing him when the crow saw the people with guns coming he instantly dropped the cheese out of his mouth and took to wing when the fox saw the cheese drop he immediately made a jump at it for he knew the donkeys voice and that his asinine bray was not a bit like his royal masters roar and making for the cheese fell into a steel trap which snapped off his tail without which he was obliged to go into the world pretending forsooth that it was the fashion not to wear tails any more and that the foxparty were better without em  meanwhile a boy with a stick came up and belaboured master donkey until he roared louder than ever the wolf with the sheeps clothing draggling about his legs could not run fast and was detected and shot by one of the men the blind old owl whirring out of the hollow tree quite amazed at the disturbance flounced into the face of a ploughboy who knocked her down with a pitchfork the butcher came and quietly led off the ox and the lamb and the farmer finding the foxs brush in the trap hung it up over his mantelpiece and always bragged that he had been in at his death  what a farrago of old fables is this what a dressing up in old clothes says the critic i think i see such a onea solomon that sits in judgment over us authors and chops up our children as sure as i am just and wise modest learned and religious so surely i have read something very like this stuff and nonsense about jackasses and foxes before that wolf in sheeps clothingdo i not know him that fox discoursing with the crowhave i not previously heard of him yes in lafontaines fables let us get the dictionary and the fable and the biographie universelle article lafontaine and confound the impostor  then in what a contemptuous way may solomon go on to remark does this author speak of human nature there is scarce one of these characters he represents but is a villain the fox is a flatterer the frog is an emblem of impotence and envy the wolf in sheeps clothing a bloodthirsty hypocrite wearing the garb of innocence the ass in the lions skin a quack trying to terrify by assuming the appearance of a forest monarch does the writer writhing under merited castigation mean to sneer at critics in this character we laugh at the impertinent comparison the ox a stupid commonplace the only innocent being in the writers stolen apologue is a foolthe idiotic lamb who does not know his own mother and then the critic if in a virtuous mood may indulge in some fine writing regarding the holy beauteousness of maternal affection  why not if authors sneer it is the critics business to sneer at them for sneering he must pretend to be their superior or who would care about his opinion and his livelihood is to find fault besides he is right sometimes and the stories he reads and the characters drawn in them are old sure enough what stories are new all types of all characters march through all fables tremblers and boasters victims and bullies dupes and knaves longeared neddies giving themselves leonine airs tartuffes wearing virtuous clothing lovers and their trials their blindness their folly and constancy with the very first page of the human story do not love and lies too begin so the tales were told ages before aesop and asses under lions manes roared in hebrew and sly foxes flattered in etruscan and wolves in sheeps clothing gnashed their teeth in sanskrit no doubt the sun shines today as he did when he first began shining and the birds in the tree overhead while i am writing sing very much the same note they have sung ever since there were finches nay since last he besought goodnatured friends to listen once a month to his talking a friend of the writer has seen the new world and found the featherless birds there exceedingly like their brethren of europe there may be nothing new under and including the sun but it looks fresh every morning and we rise with it to toil hope scheme laugh struggle love suffer until the night comes and quiet and then will wake morrow and the eyes that look on it and so da capo  this then is to be a story may it please you in which jackdaws will wear peacocks feathers and awaken the just ridicule of the peacocks in which while every justice is done to the peacocks themselves the splendour of their plumage the gorgeousness of their dazzling necks and the magnificence of their tails exception will yet be taken to the absurdity of their rickety strut and the foolish discord of their pert squeaking in which lions in love will have their claws pared by sly virgins in which rogues will sometimes triumph and honest folks let us hope come by their own in which there will be black crape and white favours in which there will be tears under orangeflower wreaths and jokes in mourningcoaches in which there will be dinners of herbs with contentment and without and banquets of stalled oxen where there is care and hatreday and kindness and friendship too along with the feast it does not follow that all men are honest because they are poor and i have known some who were friendly and generous although they had plenty of money there are some great landlords who do not grind down their tenants there are actually bishops who are not hypocrites there are liberal men even among the whigs and the radicals themselves are not all aristocrats at heart but who ever heard of giving the moral before the fable children are only led to accept the one after their delectation over the other let us take care lest our readers skip both and so let us bring them on quicklyour wolves and lambs our foxes and lions our roaring donkeys our billing ringdoves our motherly partlets and crowing chanticleers   there was once a time when the sun used to shine brighter than it appears to do in this latter half of the nineteenth century when the zest of life was certainly keener when tavern wines seemed to be delicious and tavern dinners the perfection of cookery when the perusal of novels was productive of immense delight and the monthly advent of magazineday was hailed as an exciting holiday when to know thompson who had written a magazinearticle was an honour and a privilege and to see brown the author of the last romance in the flesh and actually walking in the park with his umbrella and mrs brown was an event remarkable and to the end of life to be perfectly well remembered when the women of this world were a thousand times more beautiful than those of the present time and the houris of the theatres especially so ravishing and angelic that to see them was to set the heart in motion and to see them again was to struggle for half an hour previously at the door of the pit when tailors called at a mans lodgings to dazzle him with cards of fancy waistcoats when it seemed necessary to purchase a grand silver dressingcase so as to be ready for the beard which was not yet born as yearling brides provide lace caps and work rich clothes for the expected darling when to ride in the park on a tenshilling hack seemed to be the height of fashionable enjoyment and to splash your college tutor as you were driving down regent street in a hired cab the triumph of satire when the acme of pleasure seemed to be to meet jones of trinity at the bedford and to make an arrangement with him and with king of corpus who was staying at the colonnade and martin of trinity hall who was with his family in bloomsbury square to dine at the piazza go to the play and see braham in fra diavolo and end the frolic evening by partaking of supper and a song at the cave of harmonyit was in the days of my own youth then that i met one or two of the characters who are to figure in this history and whom i must ask leave to accompany for a short while and until familiarised with the public they can make their own way as i recall them the roses bloom again and the nightingales sing by the calm bendemeer  going to the play then and to the pit as was the fashion in those honest days with some young fellows of my own age having listened delighted to the most cheerful and brilliant of operas and laughed enthusiastically at the farce we became naturally hungry at twelve oclock at night and a desire for welshrabbits and good old gleesinging led us to the cave of harmony then kept by the celebrated hoskins among whose friends we were proud to count  we enjoyed such intimacy with mr hoskins that he never failed to greet us with a kind nod and john the waiter made room for us near the president of the convivial meeting we knew the three admirable gleesingers and many a time they partook of brandyandwater at our expense one of us gave his call dinner at hoskinss and a merry time we had of it where are you o hoskins bird of the night do you warble your songs by acheron or troll your choruses by the banks of black avernus  the goes of stout the chough and crow the welshrabbit the redcross knight the hot brandyandwater the brown the strong the bloom is on the rye the bloom isnt on the rye any morethe song and the cup in a word passed round merrily and i daresay the songs and bumpers were encored it happened that there was a very small attendance at the cave that night and we were all more sociable and friendly because the company was select the songs were chiefly of the sentimental class such ditties were much in vogue at the time of which i speak  there came into the cave a gentleman with a lean brown face and long black mustachios dressed in very loose clothes and evidently a stranger to the place at least he had not visited it for a long time he was pointing out changes to a lad who was in his company and calling for sherryandwater he listened to the music and twirled his mustachios with great enthusiasm  at the very first glimpse of me the boy jumped up from the table bounded across the room ran to me with his hands out and blushing said dont you know me  it was little newcome my schoolfellow whom i had not seen for six years grown a fine tall young stripling now with the same bright blue eyes which i remembered when he was quite a little boy  what the deuce brings you here said i  he laughed and looked roguish my fatherthats my fatherwould come hes just come back from india he says all the wits used to come heremr sheridan captain morris colonel hanger professor porson i told him your name and that you used to be very kind to me when i first went to smithfield ive left now im to have a private tutor i say ive got such a jolly pony its better fun than old smile  here the whiskered gentleman newcomes father pointing to a waiter to follow him with his glass of sherryandwater strode across the room twirling his mustachios and came up to the table where we sate making a salutation with his hat in a very stately and polite manner so that hoskins himself was as it were obliged to bow the gleesingers murmured among themselves their eyes rolling over their glasses towards one another as they sucked brandyand water and that mischievous little wag little nadab the improvisatore who had just come in began to mimic him feeling his imaginary whiskers after the manner of the stranger and flapping about his pockethandkerchief in the most ludicrous manner hoskins checked this ribaldry by sternly looking towards nadab and at the same time called upon the gents to give their orders the waiter being in the room and mr bellew about to sing a song  newcomes father came up and held out his hand to me i dare say i blushed for i had been comparing him to the admirable harley in the critic and had christened him don ferolo whiskerandos  he spoke in a voice exceedingly soft and pleasant and with a cordiality so simple and sincere that my laughter shrank away ashamed and gave place to a feeling much more respectful and friendly in youth you see one is touched by kindness a man of the world may of course be grateful or not as he chooses  i have heard of your kindness sir says he to my boy and whoever is kind to him is kind to me will you allow me to sit down by you and may i beg you to try my cheroots we were friends in a minuteyoung newcome snuggling by my side his father opposite to whom after a minute or two of conversation i presented my three college friends  you have come here gentlemen to see the wits says the colonel are there any celebrated persons in the room i have been fiveandthirty years from home and want to see all that is to be seen  king of corpus who was an incorrigible wag was on the point of pulling some dreadful longbow and pointing out a halfdozen of people in the room as r and h and l etc the most celebrated wits of that day but i cut kings shins under the table and got the fellow to hold his tongue  maxima debetur pueris says jones a fellow of very kind feeling who has gone into the church since and writing on his card to hoskins hinted to him that a boy was in the room and a gentleman who was quite a greenhorn hence that the songs had better be carefully selected  and so they were a ladies school might have come in and but for the smell of the cigars and brandyandwater have taken no harm by what happened why should it not always be so if there are any caves of harmony now i warrant messieurs the landlords their interests would be better consulted by keeping their singers within bounds the very greatest scamps like pretty songs and are melted by them so are honest people it was worth a guinea to see the simple colonel and his delight at the music he forgot all about the distinguished wits whom he had expected to see in his ravishment over the glees  i say clive this is delightful this is better than your aunts concert with all the squallinis hey i shall come here often landlord may i venture to ask those gentlemen if they will take any refreshment what are their names to one of his neighbours i was scarcely allowed to hear any singing before i went out except an oratorio where i fell asleep but this by george is as fine as incledon he became quite excited over his sherryandwaterim sorry to see you gentlemen drinking brandypawnee says he it plays the deuce with our young men in india he joined in all the choruses with an exceedingly sweet voice he laughed at the derby ram so that it did you good to hear him and when hoskins sang as he did admirably the old english gentleman and described in measured cadence the death of that venerable aristocrat tears trickled down the honest warriors cheek while he held out his hand to hoskins and said thank you sir for that song it is an honour to human nature on which hoskins began to cry too  and now young nadab having been cautioned commenced one of those surprising feats of improvisation with which he used to charm audiences he took us all off and had rhymes pat about all the principal persons in the room kings pins which he wore very splendid martins red waistcoat etc the colonel was charmed with each feat and joined delighted with the chorusritolderol ritolderol ritolderolderay bis and when coming to the colonel himself he burst out      a military gent i seeand while his face i scan      i think youll all agree with mehe came from hindostan      and by his side sits laughing freea youth with curly head      i think youll all agree with methat he was best in bed           ritolderol etc the colonel laughed immensely at this sally and clapped his son young clive on the shoulder hear what he says of you sir clive best be off to bed my boyho ho no no we know a trick worth two of that we wont go home till morning till daylight does appear why should we why shouldnt my boy have innocent pleasure i was allowed none when i was a young chap and the severity was nearly the ruin of me i must go and speak with that young manthe most astonishing thing i ever heard in my life whats his name mr nadab mr nadab sir you have delighted me may i make so free as to ask you to come and dine with me tomorrow at six colonel newcome if you please nerots hotel clifford street i am always proud to make the acquaintance of men of genius and you are one or my name is not newcome  sir you do me hhonour says mr nadab pulling up his shirtcollar and perhaps the day will come when the world will do me justicemay i put down your hhonoured name for my book of poems  of course my dear sir says the enthusiastic colonel ill send them all over india put me down for six copies and do me the favour to bring them tomorrow when you come to dinner  and now mr hoskins asking if any gentleman would volunteer a song what was our amazement when the simple colonel offered to sing himself at which the room applauded vociferously whilst methought poor clive newcome hung down his head and blushed as red as a peony i felt for the young lad and thought what my own sensations would have been if in that place my own uncle major pendennis had suddenly proposed to exert his lyrical powers  the colonel selected the ditty of wapping old stairs a ballad so sweet and touching that surely any english poet might be proud to be the father of it and he sang this quaint and charming old song in an exceedingly pleasant voice with flourishes and roulades in the old incledon manner which has pretty nearly passed away the singer gave his heart and soul to the simple ballad and delivered mollys gentle appeal so pathetically that even the professional gentlemen hummed and buzzeda sincere applause and some wags who were inclined to jeer at the beginning of the performance clinked their glasses and rapped their sticks with quite a respectful enthusiasm when the song was over clive held up his head too after the shock of the first verse looked round with surprise and pleasure in his eyes and we i need not say backed our friend delighted to see him come out of his queer scrape so triumphantly the colonel bowed and smiled with very pleasant goodnature at our plaudits it was like dr primrose preaching his sermon in the prison there was something touching in the naivete and kindness of the placid and simple gentleman  great hoskins placed on high amidst the tuneful choir was pleased to signify his approbation and gave his guests health in his usual dignified manner i am much obliged to you sir says mr hoskins the room ought to be much obliged to you i drink your ealth and song sir and he bowed to the colonel politely over his glass of brandyandwater of which he absorbed a little in his customers honour i have not heard that song he was kind enough to say better performed since mr incledon sung it he was a great singer sir and i may say in the words of our immortal shakspeare that take him for all in all we shall not look upon his like again  the colonel blushed in his turn and turning round to his boy with an arch smile said i learnt it from incledon i used to slip out from grey friars to hear him heaven bless me forty years ago and i used to be flogged afterwards and serve me right too lord lord how the time passes he drank off his sherryandwater and fell back in his chair we could see he was thinking about his youththe golden timethe happy the bright the unforgotten i was myself nearly twoandtwenty years of age at that period and felt as old as ay older than the colonel  whilst he was singing his ballad there had walked or rather reeled into the room a gentleman in a military frockcoat and duck trousers of dubious hue with whose name and person some of my readers are perhaps already acquainted in fact it was my friend captain costigan in his usual condition at this hour of the night  holding on by various tables the captain had sidled up without accident to himself or any of the jugs and glasses round about him to the table where we sat and had taken his place near the writer his old acquaintance he warbled the refrain of the colonels song not inharmoniously and saluted its pathetic conclusion with a subdued hiccup and a plentiful effusion of tears bedad it is a beautiful song says he and many a time i heard poor harry incledon sing it  hes a great character whispered that unlucky king of corpus to his neighbour the colonel was a captain in the army we call him the general captain costigan will you take something to drink  bedad i will says the captain and ill sing ye a song tu  and having procured a glass of whiskyandwater from the passing waiter the poor old man settling his face into a horrid grin and leering as he was wont when he gave what he called one of his prime songs began his music  the unlucky wretch who scarcely knew what he was doing or saying selected one of the most outrageous performances of his repertoire fired off a tipsy howl by way of overture and away he went at the end of the second verse the colonel started up clapping on his hat seizing his stick and looking as ferocious as though he had been going to do battle with a pindaree  silence he roared out  hear hear cried certain wags at a farther table go on costigan said others  go on cries the colonel in his high voice trembling with anger does any gentleman say go on does any man who has a wife and sisters or children at home say go on to such disgusting ribaldry as this do you dare sir to call yourself a gentleman and to say that you hold the kings commission and to sit down amongst christians and men of honour and defile the ears of young boys with this wicked balderdash  why do you bring young boys here old boy cries a voice of the malcontents  why because i thought i was coming to a society of gentlemen cried out the indignant colonel because i never could have believed that englishmen could meet together and allow a man and an old man so to disgrace himself for shame you old wretch go home to your bed you hoary old sinner and for my part im not sorry that my son should see for once in his life to what shame and degradation and dishonour drunkenness and whisky may bring a man never mind the change sircurse the change says the colonel facing the amazed waiter keep it till you see me in this place again which will be neverby george never and shouldering his stick and scowling round at the company of scared bacchanalians the indignant gentleman stalked away his boy after him  clive seemed rather shamefaced but i fear the rest of the company looked still more foolish  aussi que diable venaitil faire dans cette galere says king of corpus to jones of trinity and jones gave a shrug of his shoulders which were smarting perhaps for that uplifted cane of the colonels had somehow fallen on the back of every man in the room     chapter ii colonel newcomes wild oats   as the young gentleman who has just gone to bed is to be the hero of the following pages we had best begin our account of him with his family history which luckily is not very long  when pigtails still grew on the backs of the british gentry and their wives wore cushions on their heads over which they tied their own hair and disguised it with powder and pomatum when ministers went in their stars and orders to the house of commons and the orators of the opposition attacked nightly the noble lord in the blue ribbon when mr washington was heading the american rebels with a courage it must be confessed worthy of a better cause there came up to london out of a northern county mr thomas newcome afterwards thomas newcome esq and sheriff of london afterwards mr alderman newcome the founder of the family whose name has given the title to this history it was but in the reign of george iii that mr newcome first made his appearance in cheapside having made his entry into london on a waggon which landed him and some bales of cloth all his fortune in bishopsgate street though if it could be proved that the normans wore pigtails under william the conqueror and mr washington fought against the english under king richard in palestine i am sure some of the present newcomes would pay the heralds office handsomely living as they do amongst the noblest of the land and giving entertainments to none but the very highest nobility and elite of the fashionable and diplomatic world as you may read any day in the newspapers for though these newcomes have got a pedigree from the college which is printed in budges landed aristocracy of great britain and which proves that the newcome of cromwells army the newcome who was among the last six who were hanged by queen mary for protestantism were ancestors of this house of which a member distinguished himself at bosworth field and the founder slain by king harolds side at hastings had been surgeonbarber to king edward the confessor yet between ourselves i think that sir brian newcome of newcome does not believe a word of the story any more than the rest of the world does although a number of his children bear names out of the saxon calendar  was thomas newcome a foundlinga workhouse child out of that village which has now become a great manufacturing town and which bears his name such was the report set about at the last election when sir brian in the conservative interest contested the borough and mr yapp the outandout liberal candidate had a picture of the old workhouse placarded over the town as the birthplace of the newcomes with placards ironically exciting freemen to vote for newcome and unionnewcome and the parish interests etc who cares for these local scandals it matters very little to those who have the good fortune to be invited to lady ann newcomes parties whether her beautiful daughters can trace their pedigrees no higher than to the alderman their grandfather or whether through the mythic ancestral barbersurgeon they hang on to the chin of edward confessor and king  thomas newcome who had been a weaver in his native village brought the very best character for honesty thrift and ingenuity with him to london where he was taken into the house of hobson brothers clothfactors afterwards hobson and newcome this fact may suffice to indicate thomas newcomes story like whittington and many other london apprentices he began poor and ended by marrying his masters daughter and becoming sheriff and alderman of the city of london  but it was only en secondes noces that he espoused the wealthy and religious and eminent such was the word applied to certain professing christians in those days sophia alethea hobsona woman who considerably older than mr newcome had the advantage of surviving him many years her mansion at clapham was long the resort of the most favoured amongst the religious world the most eloquent expounders the most gifted missionaries the most interesting converts from foreign islands were to be found at her sumptuous table spread with the produce of her magnificent gardens heaven indeed blessed those gardens with plenty as many reverend gentlemen remarked there were no finer grapes peaches or pineapples in all england mr whitfield himself christened her and it was said generally in the city and by her friends that miss hobsons two christian names sophia and alethea were two greek words which being interpreted meant wisdom and truth she her villa and gardens are now no more but sophia terrace upper and lower alethea road and hobsons buildings square etc show every quarterday that the ground sacred to her and freehold still bears plenteous fruit for the descendants of this eminent woman  we are however advancing matters when thomas newcome had been some time in london he quitted the house of hobson finding an opening though in a much smaller way for himself and no sooner did his business prosper than he went down into the north like a man to a pretty girl whom he had left there and whom he had promised to marry what seemed an imprudent match for his wife had nothing but a pale face that had grown older and paler with long waiting turned out a very lucky one for newcome the whole countryside was pleased to think of the prosperous london tradesman returning to keep his promise to the penniless girl whom he had loved in the days of his own poverty the great country clothiers who knew his prudence and honesty gave him much of their business when he went back to london susan newcome would have lived to be a rich woman had not fate ended her career within a year after her marriage when she died giving birth to a son  newcome had a nurse for the child and a cottage at clapham hard by mr hobsons house where he had often walked in the garden of a sunday and been invited to sit down to take a glass of wine since he had left their service the house had added a banking business which was greatly helped by the quakers and their religious connection and newcome keeping his account there and gradually increasing his business was held in very good esteem by his former employers and invited sometimes to tea at the hermitage for which entertainments he did not in truth much care at first being a city man a good deal tired with his business during the day and apt to go to sleep over the sermons expoundings and hymns with which the gifted preachers missionaries etc who were always at the hermitage used to wind up the evening before supper nor was he a supping man in which case he would have found the parties pleasanter for in egypt itself there were not more savoury fleshpots than at clapham he was very moderate in his meals of a bilious temperament and besides obliged to be in town early in the morning always setting off to walk an hour before the first coach  but when his poor susan died miss hobson by her fathers demise having now become a partner in the house as well as heiress to the pious and childless zachariah hobson her uncle mr newcome with his little boy in his hand met miss hobson as she was coming out of meeting one sunday and the child looked so pretty mr n was a very personable freshcoloured man himself he wore powder to the end and topboots and brass buttons in his later days after he had been sheriff indeed one of the finest specimens of the old london merchant miss hobson i say invited him and little tommy into the grounds of the hermitage did not quarrel with the innocent child for frisking about in the hay on the lawn which lay basking in the sabbath sunshine and at the end of the visit gave him a large piece of poundcake a quantity of the finest hothouse grapes and a tract in one syllable tommy was ill the next day but on the next sunday his father was at meeting  he became very soon after this an awakened man and the tittling and tattling and the sneering and gossiping all over clapham and the talk on change and the pokes in the waistcoat administered by the wags to newcomenewcome give you joy my boy newcome new partner in hobsons newcome just take in this paper to hobsons theyll do it i warrant etc etc and the groans of the rev gideon bawls of the rev athanasius ogrady that eminent convert from popery who quarrelling with each other yea striving one against another had yet two sentiments in common their love for miss hobson their dread their hatred of the worldly newcome all these squabbles and jokes and pribbles and prabbles look you may be omitted as gallantly as he had married a woman without a penny as gallantly as he had conquered his poverty and achieved his own independence so bravely he went in and won the great city prize with a fortune of a quarter of a million and every one of his old friends and every honesthearted fellow who likes to see shrewdness and honesty and courage succeed was glad of his good fortune and said newcome my boy or newcome my buck if they were old city cronies and very familiar i give you joy  of course mr newcome might have gone into parliament of course before the close of his life he might have been made a baronet but he eschewed honours senatorial or bloodred hands it wouldnt do with his good sense he said the quaker connection wouldnt like it his wife never cared about being called lady newcome to manage the great house of hobson brothers and newcome to attend to the interests of the enslaved negro to awaken the benighted hottentot to a sense of the truth to convert jews turks infidels and papists to arouse the indifferent and often blasphemous mariner to guide the washerwoman in the right way to head all the public charities of her sect and do a thousand secret kindnesses that none knew of to answer myriads of letters pension endless ministers and supply their teeming wives with continuous babylinen to hear preachers daily bawling for hours and listen untired on her knees after a long days labour while florid rhapsodists belaboured cushions above her with wearisome benedictions all these things had this woman to do and for near fourscore years she fought her fight womanfully imperious but deserving to rule hard but doing her duty severe but charitable and untiring in generosity as in labour unforgiving in one instancein that of her husbands eldest son thomas newcome the little boy who had played on the hay and whom at first she had loved very sternly and fondly  mr thomas newcome the father of his wifes twin boys the junior partner of the house of hobson brothers and co lived several years after winning the great prize about which all his friends so congratulated him but he was after all only the junior partner of the house his wife was manager in threadneedle street and at homewhen the clerical gentlemen prayed they importuned heaven for that sainted woman a long time before they thought of asking any favour for her husband the gardeners touched their hats the clerks at the bank brought him the books but they took their orders from her not from him i think he grew weary of the prayermeetings he yawned over the sufferings of the negroes and wished the converted jews at jericho about the time the french emperor was meeting with his russian reverses mr newcome died his mausoleum is in clapham churchyard near the modest grave where his first wife reposes  when his father married mr thomas newcome jun and sarah his nurse were transported from the cottage where they had lived in great comfort to the palace hard by surrounded by lawns and gardens pineries graperies aviaries luxuries of all kinds this paradise five miles from the standard at cornhill was separated from the outer world by a thick hedge of tall trees and an ivycovered portersgate through which they who travelled to london on the top of the clapham coach could only get a glimpse of the bliss within it was a serious paradise as you entered at the gate gravity fell on you and decorum wrapped you in a garment of starch the butcherboy who galloped his horse and cart madly about the adjoining lanes and common whistled wild melodies caught up in abominable playhouse galleries and joked with a hundred cookmaids on passing that lodge fell into an undertakers pace and delivered his joints and sweetbreads silently at the servants entrance the rooks in the elms cawed sermons at morning and evening the peacocks walked demurely on the terraces the guineafowls looked more quakerlike than those savoury birds usually do the lodgekeeper was serious and a clerk at a neighbouring chapel the pastors who entered at the gate and greeted his comely wife and children fed the little lambkins with tracts the headgardener was a scotch calvinist after the strictest order only occupying himself with the melons and pines provisionally and until the end of the world which event he could prove by infallible calculations was to come off in two or three years at farthest wherefore he asked should the butler brew strong ale to be drunken three years hence or the housekeeper a follower of joanna southcote make provisions of fine linen and lay up stores of jams on a sunday which good old saxon word was scarcely known at the hermitage the household marched away in separate couples or groups to at least half a dozen of religious edifices each to sit under his or her favourite minister the only man who went to church being thomas newcome accompanied by tommy his little son and sarah his nurse who was i believe also his aunt or at least his mothers first cousin tommy was taught hymns very soon after he could speak appropriate to his tender age pointing out to him the inevitable fate of wicked children and giving him the earliest possible warning and description of the punishment of little sinners he repeated these poems to his stepmother after dinner before a great shining mahogany table covered with grapes pineapples plumcake port wine and madeira and surrounded by stout men in black with baggy white neckcloths who took the little man between their knees and questioned him as to his right understanding of the place whither naughty boys were bound they patted his head with their fat hands if he said well or rebuked him if he was bold as he often was  nurse sarah or aunt sarah would have died had she remained many years in that stifling garden of eden she could not bear to part from the child whom her mistress and kinswoman had confided to her the women had worked in the same room at newcomes and loved each other always when susan became a merchants lady and sarah her servant she was nobody in the pompous new household but master tommys nurse the honest soul never mentioned her relationship to the boys mother nor indeed did mr newcome acquaint his new family with that circumstance the housekeeper called her an erastian mrs newcomes own serious maid informed against her for telling tommy stories of lancashire witches and believing in the same the black footman madams maid and the butler were of course privately united persecuted her with his addresses and was even encouraged by his mistress who thought of sending him as a missionary to the niger no little love and fidelity and constancy did honest sarah show and use during the years she passed at the hermitage and until tommy went to school her master with many private prayers and entreaties in which he passionately recalled his former wifes memory and affection implored his friend to stay with him and tommys fondness for her and artless caresses and the scrapes he got into and the howls he uttered over the hymns and catechisms which he was bidden to learn by rev t clack of highbury college his daily tutor who was commissioned to spare not the rod neither to spoil the child all these causes induced sarah to remain with her young master until such time as he was sent to school  meanwhile an event of prodigious importance a wonderment a blessing and a delight had happened at the hermitage about two years after mrs newcomes marriage the lady being then fortythree years of age no less than two little cherubs appeared in the clapham paradisethe twins hobson newcome and brian newcome called after their uncle and late grandfather whose name and rank they were destined to perpetuate and now there was no reason why young newcome should not go to school old mr hobson and his brother had been educated at that school of grey friars of which mention has been made in former works and to grey friars thomas newcome was accordingly sent exchangingo ye gods with what delightthe splendour of clapham for the rough plentiful fare of the place blacking his masters shoes with perfect readiness till he rose in the school and the time came when he should have a fag of his own tibbing out and receiving the penalty therefore bartering a black eye per bearer against a bloody nose drawn at sight with a schoolfellow and shaking hands the next day playing at cricket hockey prisoners base and football according to the season and gorging himself and friends with tarts when he had money and of this he had plenty to spend i have seen his name carved upon the gown boys arch but he was at school long before my time his son showed me the name when we were boys together in some year when george the fourth was king  the pleasures of this schoollife were such to tommy newcome that he did not care to go home for a holiday and indeed by insubordination and boisterousness by playing tricks and breaking windows by marauding upon the gardeners peaches and the housekeepers jam by upsetting his two little brothers in a gocart of which wanton and careless injury the present baronets nose bears marks to this very day by going to sleep during the sermons and treating reverend gentlemen with levity he drew down on himself the merited wrath of his stepmother and many punishments in this present life besides those of a future and much more durable kind which the good lady did not fail to point out that he must undoubtedly inherit his father at mrs newcomes instigation certainly whipped tommy for upsetting his little brothers in the gocart but upon being pressed to repeat the whipping for some other peccadillo performed soon after mr newcome refused at once using a wicked worldly expression which well might shock any serious lady saying in fact that he would be deed if he beat the boy any more and that he got flogging enough at school in which opinion master tommy fully coincided  the undaunted woman his stepmother was not to be made to forgo her plans for the boys reform by any such vulgar ribaldries and mr newcome being absent in the city on his business and tommy refractory as usual she summoned the serious butler and the black footman for the lashings of whose brethren she felt an unaffected pity to operate together in the chastisement of this young criminal but he dashed so furiously against the butlers shins as to draw blood from his comely limbs and to cause that serious and overfed menial to limp and suffer for many days after and seizing the decanter he swore he would demolish blackys ugly face with it nay he threatened to discharge it at mrs newcomes own head before he would submit to the coercion which she desired her agents to administer  high words took place between mr and mrs newcome that night on the gentlemans return home from the city and on his learning the events of the morning it is to be feared he made use of further oaths which hasty ejaculations need not be set down in this place at any rate he behaved with spirit and manliness as master of the house vowed that if any servant laid a hand on the child he would thrash him first and then discharge him and i dare say expressed himself with bitterness and regret that he had married a wife who would not be obedient to her husband and had entered a house of which he was not suffered to be the master friends were called inthe interference the supplications of the clapham clergy some of whom dined constantly at the hermitage prevailed to allay this domestic quarrel and no doubt the good sense of mrs newcomewho though imperious was yet not unkind and who excellent as she was yet could be brought to own that she was sometimes in faultinduced her to make at least a temporary submission to the man whom she had placed at the head of her house and whom it must be confessed she had vowed to love and honour when tommy fell ill of the scarlet fever which afflicting event occurred presently after the above dispute his own nurse sarah could not have been more tender watchful and affectionate than his stepmother showed herself to be she nursed him through his illness allowed his food and medicine to be administered by no other hand sat up with the boy through a night of his fever and uttered not one single reproach to her husband who watched with her when the twins took the disease from which we need not say they happily recovered and though young tommy in his temporary delirium mistaking her for nurse sarah addressed her as his dear fat sallywhereas no whippingpost to which she ever would have tied him could have been leaner than mrs newcomeand under this feverish delusion actually abused her to her face calling her an old cat an old methodist and jumping up in his little bed forgetful of his previous fancy vowing that he would put on his clothes and run away to sally sally was at her northern home by this time with a liberal pension which mr newcome gave her and which his son and his sons son after him through all their difficulties and distresses always found means to pay  what the boy threatened in his delirium he had thought of no doubt more than once in his solitary and unhappy holidays a year after he actually ran away not from school but from home and appeared one morning gaunt and hungry at sarahs cottage two hundred miles away from clapham who housed the poor prodigal and killed her calf for himwashed him with many tears and kisses and put him to bed and to sleep from which slumber he was aroused by the appearance of his father whose sure instinct backed by mrs newcomes own quick intelligence had made him at once aware whither the young runaway had fled the poor father came horsewhip in handhe knew of no other law or means to maintain his authority many and many a time had his own father the old weaver whose memory he loved and honoured strapped and beaten him seeing this instrument in the parents hand as mr newcome thrust out the weeping trembling sarah and closed the door upon her tommy scared out of a sweet sleep and a delightful dream of cricket knew his fate and getting up out of bed received his punishment without a word very likely the father suffered more than the child for when the punishment was over the little man yet trembling and quivering with the pain held out his little bleeding hand and said i cani can take it from you sir saying which his face flushed and his eyes filled for the first time whereupon the father burst into a passion of tears and embraced the boy and kissed him besought and prayed him to be rebellious no moreflung the whip away from him and swore come what would he would never strike him again the quarrel was the means of a great and happy reconciliation the three dined together in sarahs cottage perhaps the father would have liked to walk that evening in the lanes and fields where he had wandered as a young fellow where he had first courted and first kissed the young girl he lovedpoor childwho had waited for him so faithfully and fondly who had passed so many a day of patient want and meek expectance to be repaid by such a scant holiday and brief fruition  mrs newcome never made the slightest allusion to toms absence after his return but was quite gentle and affectionate with him and that night read the parable of the prodigal in a very low and quiet voice  this however was only a temporary truce war very soon broke out again between the impetuous lad and his rigid domineering motherinlaw it was not that he was very bad or she perhaps more stern than other ladies but the two could not agree the boy sulked and was miserable at home he fell to drinking with the grooms in the stables i think he went to epsom races and was discovered after that act of rebellion driving from a most interesting breakfast at roehampton where a delightful hebrew convert had spoken oh so graciously mrs newcomein her statecarriage with her bay horsesmet tom her soninlaw in a taxcart excited by drink and accompanied by all sorts of friends male and female john the black man was bidden to descend from the carriage and bring him to mrs newcome he came his voice was thick with drink he laughed wildly he described a fight at which he had been present it was not possible that such a castaway as this should continue in a house where her two little cherubs were growing up in innocence and grace  the boy had a great fancy for india and ormes history containing the exploits of clive and lawrence was his favourite book of all in his fathers library being offered a writership he scouted the idea of a civil appointment and would be contented with nothing but a uniform a cavalry cadetship was procured for thomas newcome and the young mans future career being thus determined and his stepmothers unwilling consent procured mr newcome thought fit to send his son to a tutor for military instruction and removed him from the london school where in truth he had made but very little progress in the humaner letters the lad was placed with a professor who prepared young men for the army and received rather a better professional education than fell to the lot of most young soldiers of his day he cultivated the mathematics and fortification with more assiduity than he had ever bestowed on greek and latin and especially made such a progress in the french tongue as was very uncommon among the british youth his contemporaries  in the study of this agreeable language over which young newcome spent a great deal of his time he unluckily had some instructors who were destined to bring the poor lad into yet further trouble at home his tutor an easy gentleman lived at blackheath and not far from thence on the road to woolwich dwelt the little chevalier de blois at whose house the young man much preferred to take his french lessons rather than to receive them under his tutors own roof  for the fact was that the little chevalier de blois had two pretty young daughters with whom he had fled from his country along with thousands of french gentlemen at the period of revolution and emigration he was a cadet of a very ancient family and his brother the marquis de blois was a fugitive like himself but with the army of the princes on the rhine or with his exiled sovereign at mittau the chevalier had seen the wars of the great frederick what man could be found better to teach young newcome the french language and the art military it was surprising with what assiduity he pursued his studies mademoiselle leonore the chevaliers daughter would carry on her little industry very undisturbedly in the same parlour with her father and his pupil she painted cardracks laboured at embroidery was ready to employ her quick little brain or fingers in any way by which she could find means to add a few shillings to the scanty store on which this exiled family supported themselves in their day of misfortune i suppose the chevalier was not in the least unquiet about her because she was promised in marriage to the comte de florac also of the emigrationa distinguished officer like the chevalier than whom he was a year olderand at the time of which we speak engaged in london in giving private lessons on the fiddle sometimes on a sunday he would walk to blackheath with that instrument in his hand and pay his court to his young fiancee and talk over happier days with his old companioninarms tom newcome took no french lessons on a sunday he passed that day at clapham generally where strange to say he never said a word about mademoiselle de blois  what happens when two young folks of eighteen handsome and ardent generous and impetuous alone in the world or without strong affections to bind them elsewherewhat happens when they meet daily over french dictionaries embroidery frames or indeed upon any business whatever no doubt mademoiselle leonore was a young lady perfectly bien elevee and ready as every wellelevated young frenchwoman should be to accept a husband of her parents choosing but while the elderly m de florac was fiddling in london there was that handsome young tom newcome ever present at blackheath to make a long matter short tom declared his passion and was for marrying leonore off hand if she would but come with him to the little catholic chapel at woolwich why should they not go out to india together and be happy ever after  the innocent little amour may have been several months in transaction and was discovered by mrs newcome whose keen spectacles nothing could escape it chanced that she drove to blackheath to toms tutors tom was absent taking his french and drawing lesson of m de blois thither toms stepmother followed him and found the young man sure enough with his instructor over his books and plans of fortification mademoiselle and her cardscreens were in the room but behind those screens she could not hide her blushes and confusion from mrs newcomes sharp glances in one moment the bankers wife saw the whole affairthe whole mystery which had been passing for months under poor m de blois nose without his having the least notion of the truth  mrs newcome said she wanted her son to return home with her upon private affairs and before they had reached the hermitage a fine battle had ensued between them his mother had charged him with being a wretch and a monster and he had replied fiercely denying the accusation with scorn and announcing his wish instantly to marry the most virtuous the most beautiful of her sex to marry a papist this was all that was wanted to make poor toms cup of bitterness run over mr newcome was called in and the two elders passed a great part of the night in an assault upon the lad he was grown too tall for the cane but mrs newcome thonged him with the lash of her indignation for many an hour that evening  he was forbidden to enter m de blois house a prohibition at which the spirited young fellow snapped his fingers and laughed in scorn nothing he swore but death should part him from the young lady on the next day his father came to him alone and plied him with entreaties but he was as obdurate as before he would have her nothing should prevent him he cocked his hat and walked out of the lodgegate as his father quite beaten by the young mans obstinacy with haggard face and tearful eyes went his own way into town he was not very angry himself in the course of their talk overnight the boy had spoken bravely and honestly and newcome could remember how in his own early life he too had courted and loved a young lass it was mrs newcome the father was afraid of who shall depict her wrath at the idea that a child of her house was about to marry a popish girl  so young newcome went his way to blackheath bent upon falling straightway down upon his knees before leonore and having the chevaliers blessing that old fiddler in london scarcely seemed to him to be an obstacle it seemed monstrous that a young creature should be given away to a man older than her own father he did not know the law of honour as it obtained amongst french gentlemen of those days or how religiously their daughters were bound by it  but mrs newcome had been beforehand with him and had visited the chevalier de blois almost at cockcrow she charged him insolently with being privy to the attachment between the young people pursued him with vulgar rebukes about beggary popery and french adventurers her husband had to make a very contrite apology afterwards for the language which his wife had thought fit to employ you forbid me said the chevalier you forbid mademoiselle de blois to marry your son mr thomas no madam she comes of a race which is not accustomed to ally itself with persons of your class and is promised to a gentleman whose ancestors were dukes and peers when mr newcomes were blacking shoes instead of finding his pretty blushing girl on arriving at woolwich poor tom only found his french master livid with rage and quivering under his ailes de pigeon we pass over the scenes that followed the young mans passionate entreaties and fury and despair in his own defence and to prove his honour to the world m de blois determined that his daughter should instantly marry the count the poor girl yielded without a word as became her and it was with this marriage effected almost before his eyes and frantic with wrath and despair that young newcome embarked for india and quitted the parents whom he was never more to see  toms name was no more mentioned at clapham his letters to his father were written to the city very pleasant they were and comforting to the fathers heart he sent tom liberal private remittances to india until the boy wrote to say that he wanted no more mr newcome would have liked to leave tom all his private fortune for the twins were only too well cared for but he dared not on account of his terror of sophia alethea his wife and he died and poor tom was only secretly forgiven     chapter iii colonel newcomes letterbox   i with the most heartfelt joy my dear major i take up my pen to announce to you the happy arrival of the ramchunder and the dearest and handsomest little boy who i am sure ever came from india little clive is in perfect health he speaks english wonderfully well he cried when he parted from mr sneid the supercargo who most kindly brought him from southampton in a postchaise but these tears in childhood are of very brief duration the voyage mr sneid states was most favourable occupying only four months and eleven days how different from that more lengthened and dangerous passage of eight months and almost perpetual seasickness in which my poor dear sister emma went to bengal to become the wife of the best of husbands and the mother of the dearest of little boys and to enjoy these inestimable blessings for so brief an interval she has quitted this wicked and wretched world for one where all is peace the misery and illtreatment which she endured from captain case her first odious husband were i am sure amply repaid my dear colonel by your subsequent affection if the most sumptuous dresses which london even paris could supply jewellery the most costly and elegant lace and everything lovely and fashionable could content a woman these i am sure during the last four years of her life the poor girl had of what avail are they when this scene of vanity is closed  mr sneid announces that the passage was most favourable they stayed a week at the cape and three days at st helena where they visited bonapartes tomb another instance of the vanity of all things and their voyage was enlivened off ascension by the taking of some delicious turtle  you may be sure that the most liberal sum which you have placed to my credit with the messrs hobson and co shall be faithfully expended on my dear little charge mrs newcome can scarcely be called his grandmamma i suppose and i daresay her methodistical ladyship will not care to see the daughter and grandson of a clergyman of the church of england my brother charles took leave to wait upon her when he presented your last most generous bill at the bank she received him most rudely and said a fool and his money are soon parted and when charles said madam i am the brother of the late mrs major newcome sir says she i judge nobody but from all accounts you are the brother of a very vain idle thoughtless extravagant woman and thomas newcome was as foolish about his wife as about his money of course unless mrs n writes to invite dear clive i shall not think of sending him to clapham  it is such hot weather that i cannot wear the beautiful shawl you have sent me and shall keep it in lavender till next winter my brother who thanks you for your continuous bounty will write next month and report progress as to his dear pupil clive will add a postscript of his own and i am my dear major with a thousand thanks for your kindness to meyour grateful and affectionate martha honeyman  in a round hand and on lines ruled with pencil  dearest papa i am very well i hope you are very well m sneed brought me in a postchaise i like mr sneed very much i like aunt martha i like hannah there are no ships here i am your affectionate son clive newcome   ii rue st

placed me in a position very different from that in which i knew you i have been the mother of many children my husband has recovered a portion of the property which the revolution tore from us and france in returning to its legitimate sovereign received once more the nobility which accompanied his august house into exile we however preceded his majesty more happy than many of our companions believing further resistance to be useless dazzled perhaps by the brilliancy of that genius which restored order submitted europe and governed france m de florac in the first days was reconciled to the conqueror of marengo and austerlitz and held a position in his imperial court this submission at first attributed to infidelity has subsequently been pardoned to my husband his sufferings during the hundred days made to pardon his adhesion to him who was emperor my husband is now an old man he was of the disastrous campaign of moscow as one of the chamberlains of napoleon withdrawn from the world he gives his time to his feeble healthto his familyto heaven  i have not forgotten a time before those days when according to promises given by my father i became the wife of m de florac sometimes i have heard of your career one of my parents m de f who took service in the english india has entertained me of you he informed me how yet a young man you won laurels at argom and bhartpour how you escaped to death at laswari i have followed them sir on the map i have taken part in your victories and your glory ah i am not so cold but my heart has trembled for your dangers not so aged but i remember the young man who learned from the pupil of frederick the first rudiments of war your great heart your love of truth your courage were your own none had to teach you those qualities of which a good god had endowed you my good father is dead since many years he too was permitted to see france before to die  i have read in the english journals not only that you are married but that you have a son permit me to send to your wife to your child these accompanying tokens of an old friendship i have seen that mistress newcome was widow and am not sorry of it my friend i hope there was not that difference of age between your wife and you that i have known in other unions i pray the good god to bless yours i hold you always in my memory as i write the past comes back to me i see a noble young man who has a soft voice and brown eyes i see the thames and the smiling plains of blackheath i listen and pray at my chamberdoor as my father talks to you in our little cabinet of studies i look from my window and see you depart  my sons are men one follows the profession of arms one has embraced the ecclesiastical state my daughter is herself a mother i remember this was your birthday i have made myself a little fete in celebrating it after how many years of absence of silence comtesse de florac nee l de blois   iii my dear thomasmr sneid supercargo of the ramchunder east indiaman handed over to us yesterday your letter and today i have purchased three thousand three hundred and twentythree pounds 6 and 8d three per cent consols in our joint names h and b newcome held for your little boy mr s gives a very favourable account of the little man and left him in perfect health two days since at the house of his aunt miss honeyman we have placed 200 pounds to that ladys credit at your desire  lady anne is charmed with the present which she received yesterday and says the white shawl is a great deal too handsome my mother is also greatly pleased with hers and has forwarded by the coach to brighton today a packet of books tracts etc suited for his tender age for your little boy she heard of you lately from the rev t sweatenham on his return from india he spoke of your kindnessand of the hospitable manner in which you had received him at your house and alluded to you in a very handsome way in the course of the thanksgiving that evening i dare say my mother will ask your little boy to the hermitage and when we have a house of our own i am sure anne and i will be very happy to see him yours affectionately major newcome b newcome   iv my dear coloneldid i not know the generosity of your heart and the bountiful means which heaven has put at your disposal in order to gratify that noble disposition were i not certain that the small sum i required will permanently place me beyond the reach of the difficulties of life and will infallibly be repaid before six months are over believe me i never would have ventured upon that bold step which our friendship carried on epistolarily as it has been our relationship and your admirable disposition have induced me to venture to take  that elegant and commodious chapel known as lady whittleseas denmark street mayfair being for sale i have determined on venturing my all in its acquisition and in laying as i hope the foundation of a competence for myself and excellent sister what is a lodginghouse at brighton but an uncertain maintenance the mariner on the sea before those cliffs is no more sure of wind and wave or of fish to his laborious net than the brighton houseowner bred in affluence she may have been and used to unremitting plenty to the support of the casual travellers who visit the city on one day they come in shoals it is true but where are they on the next for many months my poor sisters first floor was a desert until occupied by your noble little boy my nephew and pupil clive is everything that a fathers an uncles who loves him as a father a pastors a teachers affections could desire he is not one of those premature geniuses whose muchvaunted infantine talents disappear along with adolescence he is not i frankly own more advanced in his classical and mathematical studies than some children even younger than himself but he has acquired the rudiments of health he has laid in a store of honesty and goodhumour which are not less likely to advance him in life than mere science and language than the as in praesenti or the pons asinorum  but i forget in thinking of my dear little friend and pupil the subject of this letternamely the acquisition of the proprietary chapel to which i have alluded and the hopes nay certainty of a fortune if aught below is certain which that acquisition holds out what is a curacy but a synonym for starvation if we accuse the eremites of old of wasting their lives in unprofitable wildernesses what shall we say to many a hermit of protestant and socalled civilised times who hides his head in a solitude in yorkshire and buries his probably fine talents in a lincolnshire fen have i genius am i blessed with gifts of eloquence to thrill and soothe to arouse the sluggish to terrify the sinful to cheer and convince the timid to lead the blind groping in darkness and to trample the audacious sceptic in the dust my own conscience besides a hundred testimonials from places of popular most popular worship from reverend prelates from distinguished clergy tells me i have these gifts a voice within me cries go forth charles honeyman fight the good fight wipe the tears of the repentant sinner sing of hope to the agonised criminal whisper courage brother courage at the ghastly deathbed and strike down the infidel with the lance of evidence and the shield of reason in a pecuniary point of view i am confident nay the calculations may be established as irresistibly as an algebraic equation that i can realise as incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel the sum of not less than one thousand pounds per annum such a sum with economy and without it what sum were sufficient will enable me to provide amply for my wants to discharge my obligations to you to my sister and some other creditors very very unlike you and to place miss honeyman in a home more worthy of her than that which she now occupies only to vacate it at the beck of every passing stranger  my sister does not disapprove of my plan into which enter some modifications which i have not as yet submitted to her being anxious at first that they should be sanctioned by you from the income of the whittlesea chapel i propose to allow miss honeyman the sum of two hundred pounds per annum paid quarterly this with her private property which she has kept more thriftily than her unfortunate and confiding brother guarded his for whenever i had a guinea a tale of distress would melt it into half a sovereign will enable miss honeyman to live in a way becoming my fathers daughter  comforted with this provision as my sister will be i would suggest that our dearest young clive should be transferred from her petticoat government and given up to the care of his affectionate uncle and tutor his present allowance will most liberally suffice for his expenses board lodging and education while under my roof and i shall be able to exert a paternal a pastoral influence over his studies his conduct and his highest welfare which i cannot so conveniently exercise at brighton where i am but miss honeymans stipendiary and where i often have to submit in cases where i know for dearest clives own welfare it is i and not my sister should be paramount  i have given then to a friend the rev marcus flather a draft for two hundred and fifty pounds sterling drawn upon you at your agents in calcutta which sum will go in liquidation of dear clives first years board with me or upon my word of honour as a gentleman and clergyman shall be paid back at three months after sight if you will draw upon me as i neverno were it my last penny in the worldwould dishonour your draft i implore you my dear colonel not to refuse mine my credit in this city where credit is everything and the awful future so little thought of my engagements to mr flather my own prospects in life and the comfort of my dear sisters declining years allall depend upon this bold this eventful measure my ruin or my earthly happiness lies entirely in your hands can i doubt which way your kind heart will lead you and that you will come to the aid of your affectionate brotherinlaw charles honeyman  our little clive has been to london on a visit to his uncles and to the hermitage clapham to pay his duty to his stepgrandmother the wealthy mrs newcome i pass over words disparaging of myself which the child in his artless prattles subsequently narrated she was very gracious to him and presented him with a fivepound note a copy of kirk whites poems and a work called little henry and his bearer relating to india and the excellent catechism of our church clive is full of humour and i enclose you a rude scrap representing the bishopess of clapham as she is calledthe other figure is a rude though entertaining sketch of some other droll personage  lieutenantcolonel newcome etc   v my dear colonelthe rev marcus flather has just written me a letter at which i am greatly shocked and perplexed informing me that my brother charles has given him a draft upon you for two hundred and fifty pounds when goodness knows it is not you but we who are many many hundred pounds debtors to you charles has explained that he drew the bill at your desire that you wrote to say you would be glad to serve him in any way and that the money is wanted to make his fortune yet i dont knowpoor charles is always going to make his fortune and has never done it that school which he bought and for which you and me between us paid the purchasemoney turned out no good and the only pupils left at the end of the first halfyear were two woollyheaded poor little mulattos whose father was in gaol at st kitts and whom i kept actually in my own secondfloor back room whilst the lawyers were settling things and charles was away in france and until my dearest little clive came to live with me  then as he was too small for a great school i thought clive could not do better than stay with his old aunt and have his uncle charles for a tutor who is one of the finest scholars in the world i wish you could hear him in the pulpit his delivery is grander and more impressive than any divine now in england his sermons you have subscribed for and likewise his book of elegant poems which are pronounced to be very fine  when he returned from calais and those horrid lawyers had left off worriting him i thought as his frame was much shattered and he was too weak to take a curacy that he could not do better than become clives tutor and agreed to pay him out of your handsome donation of 250 pounds for clive a sum of one hundred pounds per year so that when the board of the two and clives clothing are taken into consideration i think you will see that no great profit is left to miss martha honeyman  charles talks to me of his new church in london and of making me some grand allowance the poor boy is very affectionate and always building castles in the air and of having clive to live with him in london now this mustnt be and i wont hear of it charles is too kind to be a schoolmaster and master clive laughs at him it was only the other day after his return from his grandmammas regarding which i wrote you per burrampooter the 23rd ult that i found a picture of mrs newcome and charles too and of both their spectacles quite like i put it away but some rogue i suppose has stolen it he has done me and hannah too mr speck the artist laughed and took it home and says he is a wonder at drawing  instead then of allowing clive to go with charles to london next month where my brother is bent on going i shall send clivey to dr timpanys school marine parade of which i hear the best account but i hope you will think of soon sending him to a great school my father always said it was the best place for boys and i have a brother to whom my poor mother spared the rod and who i fear has turned out but a spoilt child  i am dear colonel your most faithful servant martha honeyman  lieutenantcolonel newcome c b   vi my dear brotheri hasten to inform you of a calamity which though it might be looked for in the course of nature has occasioned deep grief not only in our family but in this city this morning at halfpast four oclock our beloved and respected mother sophia alethea newcome expired at the advanced age of eightythree years on the night of tuesdaywednesday the 1213th having been engaged reading and writing in her library until a late hour and having dismissed the servants whom she never would allow to sit up for her as well as my brother and his wife who always are in the habit of retiring early mrs newcome extinguished the lamps took a bedchamber candle to return to her room and must have fallen on the landing where she was discovered by the maids sitting with her head reclining against the balustrades and endeavouring to staunch a wound in her forehead which was bleeding profusely having struck in a fall against the stone step of the stair  when mrs newcome was found she was speechless but still sensible and medical aid being sent for she was carried to bed mr newcome and lady anne both hurried to her apartment and she knew them and took the hands of each but paralysis had probably ensued in consequence of the shock of the fall nor was her voice ever heard except in inarticulate moanings since the hour on the previous evening when she gave them her blessing and bade them goodnight thus perished this good and excellent woman the truest christian the most charitable friend to the poor and needful the head of this great house of business the best and most affectionate of mothers  the contents of her will have long been known to us and that document was dated one month after our lamented fathers death mr thomas newcomes property being divided equally amongst his three sons the property of his second wife naturally devolves upon her own issue my brother brian and myself there are very heavy legacies to servants and to charitable and religious institutions of which in life she was the munificent patroness and i regret my dear brother that no memorial to you should have been left by my mother because she often spoke of you latterly in terms of affection and on the very day on which she died commenced a letter to your little boy which was left unfinished on the library table my brother said that on that same day at breakfast she pointed to a volume of ormes hindostan the book she said which set poor dear tom wild to go to india i know you will be pleased to hear of these proofs of returning goodwill and affection in one who often spoke latterly of her early regard for you i have no more time under the weight of business which this present affliction entails than to say that i am yours dear brother very sincerely h newcome  lieutenantcolonel newcome etc     chapter iv in which the author and the hero resume their acquaintance   if we are to narrate the youthful history not only of the hero of this tale but of the heros father we shall never have done with nursery biography a gentlemans grandmother may delight in fond recapitulation of her darlings boyish frolics and early genius but shall we weary our kind readers by this infantile prattle and set down the revered british public for an old woman only to two or three persons in all the world are the reminiscences of a mans early youth interesting to the parent who nursed him to the fond wife or child mayhap afterwards who loves him to himself always and supremelywhatever may be his actual prosperity or illfortune his present age illness difficulties renown or disappointments the dawn of his life still shines brightly for him the early griefs and delights and attachments remain with him ever faithful and dear i shall ask leave to say regarding the juvenile biography of mr clive newcome of whose history i am the chronicler only so much as is sufficient to account for some peculiarities of his character and for his subsequent career in the world  although we were schoolfellows my acquaintance with young newcome at the seat of learning where we first met was very brief and casual he had the advantage of being six years the junior of his present biographer and such a difference of age between lads at a public school puts intimacy out of the questiona junior ensign being no more familiar with the commanderinchief at the horse guards or a barrister on his first circuit with my lord chief justice on the bench than the newly breeched infant in the petties with a senior boy in a tailed coat as we knew each other at home as our school phrase was and our families being somewhat acquainted newcomes maternal uncle the rev charles honeyman the highly gifted preacher and incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel denmark street mayfair when he brought the child after the christmas vacation of 182 to the grey friars school recommended him in a neat complimentary speech to my superintendence and protection my uncle major pendennis had for a while a seat in the chapel of this sweet and popular preacher and professed as a great number of persons of fashion did a great admiration for himan admiration which i shared in my early youth but which has been modified by maturer judgment  mr honeyman told me with an air of deep respect that his young nephews father colonel thomas newcome cb was a most gallant and distinguished officer in the bengal establishment of the honourable east india companyand that his uncles the colonels halfbrothers were the eminent bankers heads of the firm of hobson brothers and newcome hobson newcome esquire bryanstone square and marblehead sussex and sir brian newcome of newcome and park lane whom to name says mr honeyman with the fluent eloquence with which he decorated the commonest circumstances of life is to designate two of the merchant princes of the wealthiest city the world has ever known and one if not two of the leaders of that aristocracy which rallies round the throne of the most elegant and refined of european sovereigns i promised mr honeyman to do what i could for the boy and he proceeded to take leave of his little nephew in my presence in terms equally eloquent pulling out a long and very slender green purse from which he extracted the sum of twoandsixpence which he presented to the child who received the money with rather a queer twinkle in his blue eyes  after that days school i met my little protege in the neighbourhood of the pastrycooks regaling himself with raspberrytarts you must not spend all that money sir which your uncle gave you said i having perhaps even at that early age a slightly satirical turn in tarts and gingerbeer  the urchin rubbed the raspberryjam off his mouth and said it dont matter sir for ive got lots more  how much says the grand inquisitor for the formula of interrogation used to be when a new boy came to the school whats your name whos your father and how much money have you got  the little fellow pulled such a handful of sovereigns out of his pocket as might have made the tallest scholar feel a pang of envy uncle hobson says he gave me two aunt hobson gave me oneno aunt hobson gave me thirty shillings uncle newcome gave me three pound and aunt anne gave me one pound five and aunt honeyman sent me ten shillings in a letter and ethel wanted to give me a pound only i wouldnt have it you know because ethels younger than me and i have plenty  and who is ethel asks the senior boy smiling at the artless youths confessions  ethel is my cousin replies little newcome aunt annes daughter theres ethel and alice and aunt anne wanted the baby to be called boadicea only uncle wouldnt and theres barnes and egbert and little alfred only he dont count hes quite a baby you know egbert and me was at school at timpanys hes going to eton next half hes older than me but i can lick him  and how old is egbert asks the smiling senior  egberts ten and im nine and ethels seven replies the little chubbyfaced hero digging his hands deep into his trousers pockets and jingling all the sovereigns there i advised him to let me be his banker and keeping one out of his many gold pieces he handed over the others on which he drew with great liberality till his whole stock was expended the school hours of the upper and under boys were different at that time the little fellows coming out of their hall half an hour before the fifth and sixth forms and many a time i used to find my little blue jacket in waiting with his honest square face and white hair and bright blue eyes and i knew that he was come to draw on his bank ere long one of the pretty blue eyes was shut up and a fine black one substituted in its place he had been engaged it appeared in a pugilistic encounter with a giant of his own form whom he had worsted in the combat didnt i pitch into him thats all says he in the elation of victory and when i asked whence the quarrel arose he stoutly informed me that wolf minor his opponent had been bullying a little boy and that he the gigantic newcome wouldnt stand it  so being called away from the school i said farewell and god bless you to the brave little man who remained a while at the grey friars where his career and troubles had only just begun  nor did we meet again until i was myself a young man occupying chambers in the temple when our rencontre took place in the manner already described  poor costigans outrageous behaviour had caused my meeting with my schoolfellow of early days to terminate so abruptly and unpleasantly that i scarce expected to see clive again or at any rate to renew my acquaintance with the indignant east indian warrior who had quitted our company in such a huff breakfast however was scarcely over in my chambers the next morning when there came a knock at the outer door and my clerk introduced colonel newcome and mr newcome  perhaps the joint occupant of the chambers in lamb court temple felt a little pang of shame at hearing the name of the visitors for if the truth must be told i was engaged pretty much as i had been occupied on the night previous and was smoking a cigar over the times newspaper how many young men in the temple smoke a cigar after breakfast as they read the times my friend and companion of those days and all days mr george warrington was employed with his short pipe and was not in the least disconcerted at the appearance of the visitors as he would not have been had the archbishop of canterbury stepped in  little clive looked curiously about our queer premises while the colonel shook me cordially by the hand no traces of yesterdays wrath were visible on his face but a friendly smile lighted his bronzed countenance as he too looked round the old room with its dingy curtains and prints and bookcases its litter of proofsheets blotted manuscripts and books for review empty sodawater bottles cigarboxes and what not  i went off in a flame of fire last night says the colonel and being cooled this morning thought it but my duty to call on mr pendennis and apologise for my abrupt behaviour the conduct of that tipsy old captainwhat is his namewas so abominable that i could not bear that clive should be any longer in the same room with him and i went off without saying a word of thanks or goodnight to my sons old friend i owe you a shake of the hand for last night mr pendennis and so saying he was kind enough to give me his hand a second time  and this is the abode of the muses is it sir our guest went on i know your writings very well clive here used to send me the pall mall gazette every month  we took it at smiffle regular says clive always patronise grey friars men smiffle it must be explained is a fond abbreviation for smithfield near to which great mart of mutton and oxen our school is situated and old cistercians often playfully designate their place of education by the name of the neighbouring market  clive sent me the gazette every month and i read your romance of walter lorraine in my boat as i was coming down the river to calcutta  have pens immortal productions made their appearance on board bengalee budgerows and are their leaves floating on the yellow banks of jumna asks warrington that sceptic who respects no work of modern genius  i gave your book to mrs timmins at calcutta says the colonel simply i daresay you have heard of her she is one of the most dashing women in all india she was delighted with your work and i can tell you it is not with every mans writing that mrs timmins is pleased he added with a knowing air  its capital broke in clive i say that part you know where walter runs away with neaera and the general cant pursue them though he has got the postchaise at the door because tim otoole has hidden his wooden leg by jove its capitalall the funny parti dont like the sentimental stuff and suicide and that and as for poetry i hate poetry  pens is not first chop says warrington i am obliged to take the young man down from time to time colonel newcome otherwise he would grow so conceited there would be no bearing him  i say says clive  what were you about to remark asks mr warrington with an air of great interest  i say pendennis continued the artless youth i thought you were a great swell when we used to read about the grand parties in the pall mall gazette the fellows used to say you were at every one of them and you see i thought you must have chambers in the albany and lots of horses to ride and a valet and a groom and a cab at the very least  sir says the colonel i hope it is not your practice to measure and estimate gentlemen by such paltry standards as those a man of letters follows the noblest calling which any man can pursue i would rather be the author of a work of genius than be governorgeneral of india i admire genius i salute it wherever i meet it i like my own profession better than any in the world but then it is because i am suited to it i couldnt write four lines in verse no not to save me from being shot a man cannot have all the advantages of life who would not be poor if he could be sure of possessing genius and winning fame and immortality sir think of dr johnson what a genius he had and where did he live in apartments that i daresay were no better than these which i am sure gentlemen are most cheerful and pleasant says the colonel thinking he had offended us one of the great pleasures and delights which i had proposed to myself on coming home was to be allowed to have the honour of meeting with men of learning and genius with wits poets and historians if i may be so fortunate and of benefiting by their conversation i left england too young to have that privilege in my fathers house money was thought of i fear rather than intellect neither he nor i had the opportunities which i wish you to have and i am surprised you should think of reflecting upon mr pendenniss poverty or of feeling any sentiment but respect and admiration when you enter the apartments of the poet and the literary man i have never been in the rooms of a literary man before the colonel said turning away from his son to us excuse me is thatthat paper really a proofsheet we handed over to him that curiosity smiling at the enthusiasm of the honest gentleman who could admire what to us was as unpalatable as a tart to a pastrycook  being with men of letters he thought proper to make his conversation entirely literary and in the course of my subsequent more intimate acquaintance with him though i knew he had distinguished himself in twenty actions he never could be brought to talk of his military feats or experience but passed them by as if they were subjects utterly unworthy of notice  i found he believed dr johnson to be the greatest of men the doctors words were constantly in his mouth and he never travelled without boswells life besides these he read caesar and tacitus with translations sir with translationsim thankful that i kept some of my latin from grey friars and he quoted sentences from the latin grammar apropos of a hundred events of common life and with perfect simplicity and satisfaction to himself besides the abovenamed books the spectator don quixote and sir charles grandison formed a part of his travelling library i read these sir he used to say because i like to be in the company of gentlemen and sir roger de coverley and sir charles grandison and don quixote are the finest gentlemen in the world and when we asked him his opinion of fielding  tom jones sir joseph andrews sir he cried twirling his mustachios i read them when i was a boy when i kept other bad company and did other low and disgraceful things of which im ashamed now sir in my fathers library i happened to fall in with those books and i read them in secret just as i used to go in private and drink beer and fight cocks and smoke pipes with jack and tom the grooms in the stables mrs newcome found me i recollect with one of those books and thinking it might be by mrs hannah more or some of that sort for it was a gravelooking volume and though i wouldnt lie about that or anything elsenever did sir never before heaven have i told more than three lies in my lifei kept my own counsel i say she took it herself to read one evening and read on gravelyfor she had no more idea of a joke than i have of hebrewuntil she came to the part about lady b and joseph andrews and then she shut the book sir and you should have seen the look she gave me i own i burst out alaughing for i was a wild young rebel sir but she was in the right sir and i was in the wrong a book sir that tells the story of a parcel of servants of a pack of footmen and ladiesmaids fuddling in alehouses do you suppose i want to know what my kitmutgars and cousomahs are doing i am as little proud as any man in the world but there must be distinction sir and as it is my lot and clives lot to be a gentleman i wont sit in the kitchen and boose in the servantshall as for that tom jonesthat fellow that sells himself sirby heavens my blood boils when i think of him i wouldnt sit down in the same room with such a fellow sir if he came in at that door i would say how dare you you hireling ruffian to sully with your presence an apartment where my young friend and i are conversing together where two gentlemen i say are taking their wine after dinner how dare you you degraded villain i dont mean you sir iii beg your pardon  the colonel was striding about the room in his loose garments puffing his cigar fiercely anon and then waving his yellow bandana and it was by the arrival of larkins my clerk that his apostrophe to tom jones was interrupted he larkins taking care not to show his amazement having been schooled not to show or feel surprise at anything he might see or hear in our chambers  what is it larkins said i larkins other master had taken his leave some time before having business which called him away and leaving me with the honest colonel quite happy with his talk and cigar  its bretts man says larkins  i confounded bretts man and told the boy to bid him call again young larkins came grinning back in a moment and said  please sir he says his orders is not to go away without the money  confound him again i cried tell him i have no money in the house he must come tomorrow  as i spoke clive was looking in wonder and the colonels countenance assumed an appearance of the most dolorous sympathy nevertheless as with a great effort he fell to talking about tom jones again and continued  no sir i have no words to express my indignation against such a fellow as tom jones but i forgot that i need not speak the great and good dr johnson has settled that question you remember what he said to mr boswell about fielding  and yet gibbon praises him colonel said the colonels interlocutor and that is no small praise he says that mr fielding was of the family that drew its origin from the counts of hapsburg but  gibbon gibbon was an infidel and i would not give the end of this cigar for such a mans opinion if mr fielding was a gentleman by birth he ought to have known better and so much the worse for him that he did not but what am i talking of wasting your valuable time no more smoke thank you i must away into the city but would not pass the temple without calling on you and thanking my boys old protector you will have the kindness to come and dine with ustomorrow the next day your own day your friend is going out of town i hope on his return to have the pleasure of making his further acquaintance come clive  clive who had been deep in a volume of hogarths engravings during the above discussion or rather oration of his fathers started up and took leave beseeching me at the same time to come soon and see his pony and so with renewed greetings we parted  i was scarcely returned to my newspaper again when the knocker of our door was again agitated and the colonel ran back looking very much agitated and confused  i beg pardon says he i think i left mymy larkins had quitted the room by this time and then he began more unreservedly my dear young friend says he a thousand pardons for what i am going to say but as clives friend i know i may take that liberty i have left the boy in the court i know the fate of men of letters and genius when we were here just now there came a single knocka demandthat that you did not seem to be momentarily able to meet now do do pardon the liberty and let me be your banker you said you were engaged in a new work it will be a masterpiece i am sure if its like the last put me down for twenty copies and allow me to settle with you in advance i may be off you know im a bird of passagea restless old soldier  my dear colonel said i quite touched and pleased by this extreme kindness my dun was but the washerwomans boy and mrs brett is in my debt if i am not mistaken besides i already have a banker in your family  in my family my dear sir  messrs newcome in threadneedle street are good enough to keep my money for me when i have any and i am happy to say they have some of mine in hand now i am almost sorry that i am not in want in order that i might have the pleasure of receiving a kindness from you and we shook hands for the fourth time that morning and the kind gentleman left me to rejoin his son     chapter v clives uncles   the dinner so hospitably offered by the colonel was gladly accepted and followed by many more entertainments at the cost of that goodnatured friend he and an indian chum of his lived at this time at nerots hotel in clifford street where mr clive too found the good cheer a great deal more to his taste than the homely though plentiful fare at grey friars at which of course when boys we all turned up our noses though many a poor fellow in the struggles of afterlife has looked back with regret very likely to that wellspread youthful table thus my intimacy with the father and the son grew to be considerable and a great deal more to my liking than my relations with clives city uncles which have been mentioned in the last chapter and which were in truth exceedingly distant and awful  if all the private accounts kept by those worthy bankers were like mine where would have been newcome hall and park lane marblehead and bryanstone square i used by strong efforts of selfdenial to maintain a balance of two or three guineas untouched at the bank so that my account might still remain open and fancied the clerks and cashiers grinned when i went to draw for money rather than face that awful counter i would send larkins the clerk or mrs flanagan the laundress as for entering the private parlour at the back wherein behind the glazed partition i could see the bald heads of newcome brothers engaged with other capitalists or peering over the newspaper i would as soon have thought of walking into the doctors own library at grey friars or of volunteering to take an armchair in a dentists studio and have a tooth out as of entering into that awful precinct my good uncle on the other hand the late major pendennis who kept naturally but a very small account with hobsons would walk into the parlour and salute the two magnates who governed there with the ease and gravity of a rothschild my good fellow the kind old gentleman would say to his nephew and pupil il faut se faire valoir i tell you sir your bankers like to keep every gentlemans account and its a mistake to suppose they are only civil to their great moneyed clients look at me i go in to them and talk to them whenever i am in the city i hear the news of change and carry it to our end of the town it looks well sir to be well with your banker and at our end of london perhaps i can do a good turn for the newcomes  it is certain that in his own kingdom of mayfair and st jamess my revered uncle was at least the bankers equal on my coming to london he was kind enough to procure me invitations to some of lady anne newcomes evening parties in park lane as likewise to mrs newcomes entertainments in bryanstone square though i confess of these latter after a while i was a lax and negligent attendant between ourselves my good fellow the shrewd old mentor of those days would say mrs newcomes parties are not altogether select nor is she a lady of the very highest breeding but it gives a man a good air to be seen at his bankers house i recommend you to go for a few minutes whenever you are asked and go i accordingly did sometimes though i always fancied rightly or wrongly from mrs newcomes manner to me that she knew i had but thirty shillings left at the bank once and again in two or three years mr hobson newcome would meet me and ask me to fill a vacant place that day or the next evening at his table which invitation i might accept or otherwise but one does not eat a mans salt as it were at these dinners there is nothing sacred in this kind of london hospitality your white waistcoat fills a gap in a mans table and retires filled for its service of the evening gad the dear old major used to say if we were not to talk freely of those we dine with how mum london would be some of the pleasantest evenings i have ever spent have been when we have sate after a great dinner en petit comite and abused the people who are gone you have your turn mon cher but why not do you suppose i fancy my friends havent found out my little faults and peculiarities and as i cant help it i let myself be executed and offer up my oddities de bonne grace entre nous brother hobson newcome is a good fellow but a vulgar fellow and his wifehis wife exactly suits him  once a year lady anne newcome about whom my mentor was much more circumspect for i somehow used to remark that as the rank of persons grew higher major pendennis spoke of them with more caution and respectonce or twice in a year lady anne newcome opened her saloons for a concert and a ball at both of which the whole street was crowded with carriages and all the great world and some of the small were present mrs newcome had her ball too and her concert of english music in opposition to the italian singers of her sisterinlaw the music of her country mrs n said was good enough for her  the truth must be told that there was no love lost between the two ladies bryanstone square could not forget the superiority of park lanes rank and the catalogue of grandees at dear annes parties filled dear marias heart with envy there are people upon whom rank and worldly goods make such an impression that they naturally fall down on their knees and worship the owners there are others to whom the sight of prosperity is offensive and who never see dives chariot but to growl and hoot at it mrs newcome as far as my humble experience would lead me to suppose is not only envious but proud of her envy she mistakes it for honesty and public spirit she will not bow down to kiss the hand of a haughty aristocracy she is a merchants wife and an attorneys daughter there is no pride about her her brotherinlaw poor dear brianconsidering everybody knows everything in london was there ever such a delusion as hiswas welcome after bankinghours to forsake his own friends for his wifes fine relations and to dangle after lords and ladies in mayfair she had no such absurd vanitynot she she imparted these opinions pretty liberally to all her acquaintances in almost all her conversations it was clear that the two ladies were best apart there are some folks who will see insolence in persons of rank as there are others who will insist that all clergymen are hypocrites all reformers villains all placemen plunderers and so forth and mrs newcome never i am sure imagined that she had a prejudice or that she was other than an honest independent highspirited woman both of the ladies had command over their husbands who were of soft natures easily led by woman as in truth are all the males of this family accordingly when sir brian newcome voted for the tory candidate in the city mr hobson newcome plumped for the reformer while brian in the house of commons sat among the mild conservatives hobson unmasked traitors and thundered at aristocratic corruption so as to make the marylebone vestry thrill with enthusiasm when lady anne her husband and her flock of children fasted in lent and declared for the high church doctrines mrs hobson had paroxysms of alarm regarding the progress of popery and shuddered out of the chapel where she had a pew because the clergyman there for a very brief season appeared to preach in a surplice  poor bewildered honeyman it was a sad day for you when you appeared in your neat pulpit with your fragrant pockethandkerchief and your sermon likewise all millefleurs in a trim prim freshly mangled surplice which you thought became you how did you look aghast and pass your jewelled hand through your curls as you saw mrs newcome who had been as good as fiveandtwenty pounds a year to you look up from her pew seize hold of mr newcome fling open the pewdoor drive out with her parasol her little flock of children bewildered but not illpleased to get away from the sermon and summon john from the back seats to bring away the bag of prayerbooks many a good dinner did charles honeyman lose by assuming that unlucky ephod why did the highpriest of his diocese order him to put it on it was delightful to view him afterwards and the airs of martyrdom which he assumed had they been going to tear him to pieces with wild beasts next day he could scarcely have looked more meek or resigned himself more pathetically to the persecutors but i am advancing matters at this early time of which i write a period not twenty years since surplices were not even thought of in conjunction with sermons clerical gentlemen have appeared in them and under the heavy hand of persecution have sunk down in their pulpits again as jack pops back into his box charles honeymans elegant discourses were at this time preached in a rich silk master of arts gown presented to him along with a teapot full of sovereigns by his affectionate congregation at leatherhead  but that i may not be accused of prejudice in describing mrs newcome and her family and lest the reader should suppose that some slight offered to the writer by this wealthy and virtuous bankers lady was the secret reason for this unfavourable sketch of her character let me be allowed to report as accurately as i can remember them the words of a kinsman of her own  giles esquire whom i had the honour of meeting at her table and who as we walked away from bryanstone square was kind enough to discourse very freely about the relatives whom he had just left  that was a good dinner sir said mr giles puffing the cigar which i offered to him and disposed to be very social and communicative hobson newcomes table is about as good a one as any i ever put my legs under you didnt have twice of turtle sir i remarked thati always do at that house especially for i know where newcome gets it we belong to the same livery in the city hobson and i the oystermongers company sir and we like our turtle good i can tell yougood and a great deal of it you say hay hay not so bad  i suppose youre a young barrister sucking lawyer or that sort of thing because you was put at the end of the table and nobody took notice of you thats my place too im a relative and newcome asks me if he has got a place to spare he met me in the city today and says tom says he theres some dinner in the square at halfpast seven i wish you would go and fetch louisa whom we havent seen this ever so long louisa is my wife sirmarias sisternewcome married that gal from my house no no says i hobson louisas engaged nursing number eightthats our number sir the truth is between you and me sir my missis wont come any more at no price she cant stand it mrs newcomes dam patronising airs is enough to choke off anybody well hobson my boy says i a good dinners a good dinner and ill come though louisa wont that is cant  while mr giles who was considerably enlivened by claret was discoursing thus candidly his companion was thinking how he mr arthur pendennis had been met that very afternoon on the steps of the megatherium club by mr newcome and had accepted that dinner which mrs giles with more spirit had declined giles continued talkingim an old stager i am i dont mind the rows between the women i believe mrs newcome and lady newcomes just as bad too i know maria is always driving at her one way or the other and calling her proud and aristocratic and that and yet my wife says maria who pretends to be such a radical never asks us to meet the baronet and his lady and why should she loo my dear says i i dont want to meet lady newcome nor lord kew nor any of em lord kew aint it an odd name tearing young swell that lord kew tremendous wild fellow  i was a clerk in that house sir as a young man i was there in the old womans time and mr newcomesthe father of these young menas good a man as ever stood on change and then mr giles warming with his subject enters at large into the history of the house you see sir says he the bankinghouse of hobson brothers or newcome brothers as the partners of the firm really are is not one of the leading banking firms of the city of london but a most respectable house of many years standing and doing a most respectable business especially in the dissenting connection after the business came into the hands of the newcome brothers hobson newcome esq and sir brian newcome bart mp mr giles shows how a considerable west end connection was likewise established chiefly through the aristocratic friends and connections of the abovenamed bart  but the best man of business according to mr giles whom the firm of hobson brothers ever knew better than her father and uncle better than her husband sir t newcome better than her sons and successors above mentioned was the famous sophia alethea hobson afterwards newcomeof whom might be said what frederick the great said of his sister that she was sexu foemina vir ingenioin sex a woman and in mind a man nor was she my informant told me without even manly personal characteristics she had a very deep and gruff voice and in her old age a beard which many a young man might envy and as she came into the bank out of her carriage from clapham in her dark green pelisse with fur trimmings in her grey beaver hat beaver gloves and great gold spectacles not a clerk in that house did not tremble before her and it was said she only wanted a pipe in her mouth considerably to resemble the late fieldmarshal prince blucher  her funeral was one of the most imposing sights ever witnessed in clapham there was such a crowd you might have thought it was a derbyday the carriages of some of the greatest city firms and the wealthiest dissenting houses several coaches full of ministers of all denominations including the established church the carriage of the right honourable the earl of kew and that of his daughter lady anne newcome attended that revered ladys remains to their final restingplace no less than nine sermons were preached at various places of public worship regarding her end she fell upstairs at a very advanced age going from the library to the bedroom after all the household was gone to rest and was found by the maids in the morning inarticulate but still alive her head being cut frightfully with the bedroom candle with which she was retiring to her apartment and said mr giles with great energy besides the empty carriages at that funeral and the parson in black and the mutes and feathers and that there were hundreds and hundreds of people who wore no black and who werent present and who wept for their benefactress i can tell you she had her faults and many of em but the amount of that womans charities are unheard of sirunheard ofand they are put to the credit side of her account up yonder  the old lady had a will of her own my companion continued she would try and know about everybodys business out of business hours got to know from the young clerks what chapels they went to and from the clergymen whether they attended regular kept her sons years after they were grown men as if they were boys at schooland what was the consequence they had a quarrel with sir thomas newcomes own son a harumscarum lad who ran away and then was sent to india and between ourselves mr hobson and mr brian both the present baronet though at home they were as mum as quakers at a meeting used to go out on the sly sir and be off to the play sir and sowed their wild oats like any other young men sir like any other young men law bless me once as i was going away from the haymarket if i didnt see mr hobson coming out of the opera in tights and an operahat sir like froggy would wooing go of a saturdaynight too when his ma thought him safe in bed in the city i warrant he hadnt his operahat on when he went to chapel with her ladyship the next morningthat very morning as sure as my names john giles  when the old lady was gone mr hobson had no need of any more humbugging but took his pleasure freely fighting tandems fourinhand anything he and his brotherhis elder brother by a quarter of an hourwere always very good friends but after mr brian married and there was only courtcards at his table mr hobson couldnt stand it they werent of his suit he said and for some time he said he wasnt a marrying manquite the contrary but we all come to our fate you know and his time came as mine did you know we married sisters it was thought a fine match for polly smith when she married the great mr newcome but i doubt whether my old woman at home hasnt had the best of it after all and if ever you come bernard street way on a sunday about six oclock and would like a slice of beef and a glass of port i hope youll come and see us  do not let us be too angry with colonel newcomes two most respectable brothers if for some years they neglected their indian relative or held him in slight esteem their mother never pardoned him or at least by any actual words admitted his restoration to favour for many years as far as they knew poor tom was an unrepentant prodigal wallowing in bad company and cut off from all respectable sympathy their father had never had the courage to acquaint them with his more true and kind and charitable version of toms story so he passed at home for no better than a black sheep his marriage with a penniless young lady did not tend to raise him in the esteem of his relatives at clapham it was not until he was a widower until he had been mentioned several times in the gazette for distinguished military service until they began to speak very well of him in leadenhall street where the representatives of hobson brothers were of course east india proprietors and until he remitted considerable sums of money to england that the bankers his brethren began to be reconciled to him  i say do not let us be hard upon them no people are so ready to give a man a bad name as his own kinsfolk and having made him that present they are ever most unwilling to take it back again if they give him nothing else in the days of his difficulty he may be sure of their pity and that he is held up as an example to his young cousins to avoid if he loses his money they call him poor fellow and point morals out of him if he falls among thieves the respectable pharisees of his race turn their heads aside and leave him penniless and bleeding they clap him on the back kindly enough when he returns after shipwreck with money in his pocket how naturally josephs brothers made salaams to him and admired him and did him honour when they found the poor outcast a prime minister and worth ever so much money surely human nature is not much altered since the days of those primeval jews we would not thrust brother joseph down a well and sell him bodily butbut if he has scrambled out of a well of his own digging and got out of his early bondage into renown and credit at least we applaud him and respect him and are proud of joseph as a member of the family  little clive was the innocent and lucky object upon whom the increasing affection of the newcomes for their indian brother was exhibited when he was first brought home a sickly child consigned to his maternal aunt the kind old maiden lady at brighton hobson brothers scarce took any notice of the little man but left him to the entire superintendence of his own family then there came a large remittance from his father and the child was asked by uncle newcome at christmas then his fathers name was mentioned in general orders and uncle hobson asked little clive at midsummer then lord h a late governorgeneral coming home and meeting the brothers at a grand dinner at the albion given by the court of directors to his late excellency spoke to the bankers about that most distinguished officer their relative and mrs hobson drove over to see his aunt where the boy was gave him a sovereign out of her purse and advised strongly that he should be sent to timpanys along wit her own boy then clive went from one uncles house to another and was liked at both and much preferred ponies to ride going out after rabbits with the keeper money in his pocket charge to the debit of lieutcol t newcome and clothes from the london tailor to the homely quarters and conversation of poor kind old aunt honeyman at brighton clives uncles were not unkind they liked each other their wives who hated each other united in liking clive when they knew him and petting the wayward handsome boy they were only pursuing the way of the world which huzzas all prosperity and turns away from misfortune as from some contagious disease indeed how can we see a mans brilliant qualities if he is what we call in the shade  the gentlemen clives uncles who had their affairs to mind during the day society and the family to occupy them of evenings and holidays treated their young kinsman the indian colonels son as other wealthy british uncles treat other young kinsmen they received him in his vacations kindly enough they tipped him when he went to school when he had the hoopingcough a confidential young clerk went round by way of grey friars square to ask after him the sea being recommended to him mrs newcome gave him change of air in sussex and transferred him to his maternal aunt at brighton then it was bonjour as the lodgegates closed upon him mrs newcomes heart shut up too and confined itself within the firs laurels and palings which bound the home precincts had not she her own children and affairs her brood of fowls her sundayschool her melonbeds her rosegarden her quarrel with the parson etc to attend to mr newcome arriving on a saturday night hears he is gone says oh and begins to ask about the new gravelwalk along the cliff and whether it is completed and if the china pig fattens kindly upon the new feed  clive in the avuncular gig is driven over the downs to brighton to his maternal aunt there and there he is a king he has the best bedroom uncle honeyman turning out for him sweetbreads for dinner no end of jam for breakfast excuses from church on the plea of delicate health his aunts maid to see him to bed his aunt to come smiling in when he rings his bell of a morning he is made much of and coaxed and dandled and fondled as if he were a young duke so he is to miss honeyman he is the son of colonel newcome cb who sends her shawls ivory chessmen scented sandalwood workboxes and kincob scarfs who as she tells martha the maid has fifty servants in india at which martha constantly exclaims lor mum what can he do with em mum who when in consequence of her misfortunes she resolved on taking a house at brighton and letting part of the same furnished sent her an order for a hundred pounds towards the expenses thereof who gave mr honeyman her brother a much larger sum of money at the period of his calamity is it gratitude for past favours is it desire for more is it vanity of relationship is it love for the dead sisteror tender regard for her offspring which makes mrs martha honeyman so fond of her nephew i never could count how many causes went to produce any given effect or action in a persons life and have been for my own part many a time quite misled in my own case fancying some grand some magnanimous some virtuous reason for an act of which i was proud when lo some pert little satirical monitor springs up inwardly upsetting the fond humbug which i was cherishingthe peacocks tail wherein my absurd vanity had clad itselfand says away with this boasting i am the cause of your virtue my lad you are pleased that yesterday at dinner you refrained from the dry champagne my name is worldly prudence not selfdenial and i caused you to refrain you are pleased because you gave a guinea to diddler i am laziness not generosity which inspired you you hug yourself because you resisted other temptation coward it was because you dared not run the risk of the wrong out with your peacocks plumage walk off in the feathers which nature gave you and thank heaven they are not altogether black in a word aunt honeyman was a kind soul and such was the splendour of clives father of his gifts his generosity his military services and companionship of the battles that the lad did really appear a young duke to her and mrs newcome was not unkind and if clive had been really a young duke i am sure he would have had the best bedroom at marble hill and not one of the faroff little rooms in the boys wing i am sure he would have had jellies and charlottes russes instead of mere broth chicken and batterpudding as fell to his lot and when he was gone in the carriage mind you not in the gig driven by a groom i am sure mrs newcome would have written a letter that night to her grace the duchess dowager his mamma full of praise of the dear child his graciousness his beauty and his wit and declaring that she must love him henceforth and for ever after as a son of her own you toss down the page with scorn and say it is not true human nature is not so bad as this cynic would have it to be you would make no difference between the rich and the poor be it so you would not but own that your nextdoor neighbour would nor is this dear madam addressed to you no no we are not so rude as to talk about you to your face but if we may not speak of the lady who has just left the room what is to become of conversation and society  we forbear to describe the meeting between the colonel and his sonthe pretty boy from whom he had parted more than seven years before with such pangs of heart and of whom he had thought ever since with such a constant longing affection half an hour after the father left the boy and in his grief and loneliness was rowing back to shore clive was at play with a dozen of other children on the sunny deck of the ship when two bells rang for their dinner they were all hurrying to the cuddy table and busy over their meal what a sad repast their parents had that day how their hearts followed the careless young ones home across the great ocean mothers prayers go with them strong men alone on their knees with streaming eyes and broken accents implore heaven for those little ones who were prattling at their sides but a few hours since long after they are gone careless and happy recollections of the sweet past rise up and smite those who remain the flowers they had planted in their little gardens the toys they played with the little vacant cribs they slept in as fathers eyes looked blessings down on them most of us who have passed a couple of score of years in the world have had such sights as these to move us and those who have will think none the worse of my worthy colonel for his tender and faithful heart  with that fidelity which was an instinct of his nature this brave man thought ever of his absent child and longed after him he never forsook the native servants and nurses who had had charge of the child but endowed them with money sufficient and indeed little was wanted by people of that frugal race to make all their future lives comfortable no friends went to europe nor ship departed but newcome sent presents and remembrances to the boy and costly tokens of his love and thanks to all who were kind to his son what a strange pathos seems to me to accompany all our indian story besides that official history which fills gazettes and embroiders banners with names of victory which gives moralists and enemies cause to cry out at english rapine and enables patriots to boast of invincible british valourbesides the splendour and conquest the wealth and glory the crowned ambition the conquered danger the vast prize and the blood freely shed in winning itshould not one remember the tears too besides the lives of myriads of british men conquering on a hundred fields from plassey to meanee and bathing them cruore nostro think of the women and the tribute which they perforce must pay to those victorious achievements scarce a soldier goes to yonder shores but leaves a home and grief in it behind him the lords of the subject province find wives there but their children cannot live on the soil the parents bring their children to the shore and part from them the family must be broken upkeep the flowers of your home beyond a certain time and the sickening buds wither and die in america it is from the breast of a poor slave that a child is taken in india it is from the wife and from under the palace of a splendid proconsul  the experience of this grief made newcomes naturally kind heart only the more tender and hence he had a weakness for children which made him the laughingstock of old maids old bachelors and sensible persons but the darling of all nurseries to whose little inhabitants he was uniformly kind were they the collectors progeny in their palanquins or the sergeants children tumbling about the cantonment or the dusky little heathens in the huts of his servants round his gate  it is known that there is no part of the world where ladies are more fascinating than in british india perhaps the warmth of the sun kindles flames in the hearts of both sexes which would probably beat quite coolly in their native air else why should miss brown be engaged ten days after her landing at calcutta or why should miss smith have half a dozen proposals before she has been a week at the station and it is not only bachelors on whom the young ladies confer their affections they will take widowers without any difficulty and a man so generally liked as major newcome with such a good character with a private fortune of his own so chivalrous generous goodlooking eligible in a word you may be sure would have found a wife easily enough had he any mind for replacing the late mrs casey  the colonel as has been stated had an indian chum or companion with whom he shared his lodgings and from many jocular remarks of this latter gentleman who loved good jokes and uttered not a few i could gather that the honest widower colonel newcome had been often tempted to alter his condition and that the indian ladies had tried numberless attacks upon his bereaved heart and devised endless schemes of carrying it by assault treason or other mode of capture mrs casey his defunct wife had overcome it by sheer pity and helplessness he had found her so friendless that he took her into the vacant place and installed her there as he would have received a traveller into his bungalow he divided his meal with her and made her welcome to his best i believe tom newcome married her sly mr binnie used to say in order that he might have permission to pay her milliners bills and in this way he was amply gratified until the day of her death a feeble miniature of the lady with yellow ringlets and a guitar hung over the mantelpiece of the colonels bedchamber where i have often seen that work of art and subsequently when he and mr binnie took a house there was hung up in the spare bedroom a companion portrait to the miniaturethat of the colonels predecessor jack casey who in life used to fling plates at his emmas head and who perished from a fatal attachment to the bottle i am inclined to think that colonel newcome was not much cast down by the loss of his wife and that they lived but indifferently together clive used to say in his artless way that his father scarcely ever mentioned his mothers name and no doubt the union was not happy although newcome continued piously to acknowledge it long after death had brought it to a termination by constant benefactions and remembrances to the departed ladys kindred  those widows or virgins who endeavoured to fill emmas place found the door of newcombes heart fast and barred and assailed it in vain miss billing sat down before it with her piano and as the colonel was a practitioner on the flute hoped to make all life one harmonious duet with him but she played her most brilliant sonatas and variations in vain and as everybody knows subsequently carried her grand piano to lieutenant and adjutant hodgkins house whose name she now bears the lovely widow wilkins with two darling little children stopped at newcomes hospitable house on her way to calcutta and it was thought she might never leave it but her kind host as was his wont crammed her children with presents and good things consoled and entertained the fair widow and one morning after she had remained three months at the station the colonels palanquins and bearers made their appearance and elvira wilkins went away weeping as a widow should why did she abuse newcome ever after at calcutta bath cheltenham and wherever she went calling him selfish pompous quixotic and a bahawder i could mention half a dozen other names of ladies of most respectable families connected with leadenhall street who according to colonel newcomes chumthat wicked mr binniehad all conspired more or less to give clive newcome a stepmother  but he had had an unlucky experience in his own case and thought within himself no i wont give clive a stepmother as heaven has taken his own mother from him why i must try to be father and mother too to the lad he kept the child as long as ever the climate would allow of his remaining and then sent him home then his aim was to save money for the youngster he was of a nature so uncontrollably generous that to be sure he spent five rupees where another would save them and make a fine show besides but it is not a mans gifts or hospitalities that generally injure his fortune it is on themselves that prodigals spend most and as newcome had no personal extravagances and the smallest selfish wants could live almost as frugally as a hindoo kept his horses not to race but to ride wore his old clothes and uniforms until they were the laughter of his regiment did not care for show and had no longer an extravagant wife he managed to lay by considerably out of his liberal allowances and to find himself and clive growing richer every year  when clive has had five or six years at schoolthat was his schemehe will be a fine scholar and have at least as much classical learning as a gentleman in the world need possess then i will go to england and we will pass three or four years together in which he will learn to be intimate with me and i hope to like me i shall be his pupil for latin and greek and try and make up for lost time i know there is nothing like a knowledge of the classics to give a man good breedingingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollunt mores nec sinuisse feros i shall be able to help him with my knowledge of the world and to keep him out of the way of sharpers and a pack of rogues who commonly infest young men i will make myself his companion and pretend to no superiority for indeed isnt he my superior of course he is with his advantages he hasnt been an idle young scamp as i was and we will travel together first through england scotland and ireland for every man should know his own country and then we will make the grand tour then by the time he is eighteen he will be able to choose his profession he can go into the army and emulate the glorious man after whom i named him or if he prefers the church or the law they are open to him and when he goes to the university by which time i shall be in all probability a majorgeneral i can come back to india for a few years and return by the time he has a wife and a home for his old father or if i die i shall have done the best for him and my boy will be left with the best education a tolerable small fortune and the blessing of his old father  such were the plans of our kind schemer how fondly he dwelt on them how affectionately he wrote of them to his boy how he read books of travels and looked over the maps of europe and said rome sir glorious rome it wont be very long major before my boy and i see the colosseum and kiss the popes toe we shall go up the rhine to switzerland and over the simplon the work of the great napoleon by jove sir think of the turks before vienna and sobieski clearing eighty thousand of em off the face of the earth how my boy will rejoice in the picturegalleries there and in prince eugenes prints you know i suppose that prince eugene one of the greatest generals in the world was also one of the greatest lovers of the fine arts ingenuas didicisse hey doctor you know the restemollunt mores nec  emollunt mores colonel says doctor mctaggart who perhaps was too canny to correct the commanding officers latin dont ye noo that prence eugene was about as savage a turrk as iver was have ye niver rad the mimores of the prants de leen  well he was a great cavalry officer answers the colonel and he left a great collection of printsthat you know how clive will delight in them the boys talent for drawing is wonderful sir wonderful he sent me a picture of our old schoolthe very actual thing sir the cloisters the school the head gownboy going in with the rods and the doctor himself it would make you die of laughing  he regaled the ladies of the regiment with clives letters and those of miss honeyman which contained an account of the boy he even bored some of his bearers with this prattle and sporting young men would give or take odds that the colonel would mention clives name once before five minutes three times in ten minutes twentyfive times in the course of dinner and so on but they who laughed at the colonel laughed very kindly and everybody who knew him loved him everybody that is who loved modesty and generosity and honour  at last the happy time came for which the kind father had been longing more passionately than any prisoner for liberty or schoolboy for holiday colonel newcome has taken leave of his regiment leaving major tomkinson nothing loth in command he has travelled to calcutta and the commanderinchief in general orders has announced that in giving to lieutenantcolonel thomas newcome cb of the bengal cavalry leave for the first time after no less than thirtyfour years absence from home he sir george hustler cannot refrain from expressing his sense of the great and meritorious services of this most distinguished officer who has left his regiment in a state of the highest discipline and efficiency and now the ship has sailed the voyage is over and once more after so many long years the honest soldiers foot is on his native shore     chapter vi newcome brothers   besides his own boy whom he worshipped this kind colonel had a score at least of adopted children to whom he chose to stand in the light of a father he was for ever whirling away in postchaises to this school and that to see jack browns boys of the cavalry or mrs smiths girls of the civil service or poor tom hickss orphan who had nobody to look after him now that the cholera had carried off tom and his wife too on board the ship in which he returned from calcutta were a dozen of little children of both sexes some of whom he actually escorted to their friends before he visited his own and though his heart was longing for his boy at grey friars the children at the schools seen and largely rewarded out of his bounty his loose white trousers had great pockets always heavy with gold and silver which he jingled when he was not pulling his mustachiosto see the way in which he tipped children made one almost long to be a boy again and when he had visited miss pinkertons establishment or doctor ramshorns adjoining academy at chiswick and seen little tom davis or little fanny holmes the honest fellow would come home and write off straightway a long letter to toms or fannys parents far away in the indian country whose hearts he made happy by his accounts of their children as he had delighted the children themselves by his affection and bounty all the apple and orangewomen especially such as had babies as well as lollipops at their stalls all the streetsweepers on the road between nerots and the oriental knew him and were his pensioners his brothers in threadneedle street cast up their eyes at the cheques which he drew  one of the little people of whom the kind newcome had taken charge luckily dwelt near portsmouth and when the faithful colonel consigned miss fipps to her grandmother mrs admiral fipps at southampton miss fipps clung to her guardian and with tears and howls was torn away from him not until her maiden aunts had consoled her with strawberries which she never before had tasted was the little indian comforted for the departure of her dear colonel master cox tom coxs boy of the native infantry had to be carried asleep from the george to the mail that night master cox woke up at the dawn wondering as the coach passed through the pleasant green roads of bromley the good gentleman consigned the little chap to his uncle dr cox bloomsbury square before he went to his own quarters and then on the errand on which his fond heart was bent  he had written to his brothers from portsmouth announcing his arrival and three words to clive conveying the same intelligence the letter was served to the boy along with one bowl of tea and one buttered roll of eighty such which were distributed to fourscore other boys boarders of the same house with our young friend how the lads face must have flushed and his eyes brightened when he read the news when the master of the house the rev mr popkinson came into the longroom with a goodnatured face and said newcome youre wanted he knows who is come he does not heed that notorious bruiser old hodge who roars out confound you newcome ill give it you for upsetting your tea over my new trousers he runs to the room where the stranger is waiting for him we will shut the door if you please upon that scene  if clive had not been as fine and handsome a young lad as any in that school or country no doubt his fond father would have been just as well pleased and endowed him with a hundred fanciful graces but in truth in looks and manners he was every thing which his parent could desire and i hope the artist who illustrates this work will take care to do justice to his portrait mr clive himself let that painter be assured will not be too well pleased if his countenance and figure do not receive proper attention he is not yet endowed with those splendid mustachios and whiskers which he has himself subsequently depicted but he is the picture of health strength activity and goodhumour he has a good forehead shaded with a quantity of waving light hair a complexion which ladies might envy a mouth which seems accustomed to laughing and a pair of blue eyes that sparkle with intelligence and frank kindness no wonder the pleased father cannot refrain from looking at him he is in a word just such a youth as has a right to be the hero of a novel  the bell rings for second school and mr popkinson arrayed in cap and gown comes in to shake colonel newcome by the hand and to say he supposes its to be a holiday for newcome that day he does not say a word about clives scrape of the day before and that awful row in the bedrooms where the lad and three others were discovered making a supper off a porkpie and two bottles of prime old port from the red cow publichouse in grey friars lane when the bell has done ringing and all these busy little bees have swarmed into their hive there is a solitude in the place the colonel and his son walked the playground together that gravelly flat as destitute of herbage as the arabian desert but nevertheless in the language of the place called the green they walk the green and they pace the cloisters and clive shows his father his own name of thomas newcome carved upon one of the arches forty years ago as they talk the boy gives sidelong glances at his new friend and wonders at the colonels loose trousers long mustachios and yellow face he looks very odd clive thinks very odd and very kind and he looks like a gentleman every inch of himnot like martins father who came to see his son lately in highlows and a shocking bad hat and actually flung coppers amongst the boys for a scramble he bursts out alaughing at the exquisitely ludicrous idea of a gentleman of his fashion scrambling for coppers  and now enjoining the boy to be ready against his return and you may be sure mr clive was on the lookout long before his sire appeared the colonel whirled away in his cab to the city to shake hands with his brothers whom he had not seen since they were demure little men in blue jackets under charge of a serious tutor  he rushed through the clerks and the bankinghouse he broke into the parlour where the lords of the establishment were seated he astonished those trim quiet gentlemen by the warmth of his greeting by the vigour of his handshake and the loud high tones of his voice which penetrated the glass walls of the parlour and might actually be heard by the busy clerks in the hall without he knew brian from hobson at oncethat unlucky little accident in the gocart having left its mark for ever on the nose of sir brian newcome the elder of the twins sir brian had a bald head and light hair a short whisker cut to his cheek a buff waistcoat very neat boots and hands he looked like the portrait of a gentleman at the exhibition as the worthy is represented dignified in attitude bland smiling and statesmanlike sitting at a table unsealing letters with a despatchbox and a silver inkstand before him a column and a scarlet curtain behind and a park in the distance with a great thunderstorm lowering in the sky such a portrait in fact hangs over the great sideboard at newcome to this day and above the three great silver waiters which the gratitude of as many companies has presented to their respected director and chairman  in face hobson newcome esq was like his elder brother but was more portly in person he allowed his red whiskers to grow wherever nature had planted them on his cheeks and under his chin he wore thick shoes with nails in them or natty roundtoed boots with tight trousers and a single strap he affected the country gentleman in his appearance his hat had a broad brim and the ample pockets of his cutaway coat were never destitute of agricultural produce samples of beans or corn which he used to bite and chew even on change or a whiplash or balls for horses in fine he was a good old country gentleman if it was fine in threadneedle street he would say it was good weather for the hay if it rained the country wanted rain if it was frosty no hunting today tomkins my boy and so forth as he rode from bryanstone square to the city you would take himand he was pleased to be so takenfor a jolly country squire he was a better man of business than his more solemn and stately brother at whom he laughed in his jocular way and he said rightly that a gentleman must get up very early in the morning who wanted to take him in  the colonel breaks into the sanctum of these worthy gentlemen and each receives him in a manner consonant with his peculiar nature sir brian regretted that lady anne was away from london being at brighton with the children who were all ill of the measles hobson said maria cant treat you to such good company as my lady could give you but when will you take a day and come and dine with us lets see todays wednesday tomorrow weve a party no were engaged he meant that his table was full and that he did not care to crowd it but there was no use in imparting this circumstance to the colonel friday we dine at judge budgesqueer name judge budge aint it saturday im going down to marblehead to look after the hay come on monday tom and ill introduce you to the missus and the young uns  i will bring clive says colonel newcome rather disturbed at this reception after his illness my sisterinlaw was very kind to him  no hang it dont bring boys theres no good in boys they stop the talk downstairs and the ladies dont want em in the drawingroom send him to dine with the children on sunday if you like and come along down with me to marblehead and ill show you such a crop of hay as will make your eyes open are you fond of farming  i have not seen my boy for years says the colonel i had rather pass saturday and sunday with him if you please and some day we will go to marblehead together  well an offers an offer i dont know any pleasanter thing than getting out of this confounded city and smelling the hedges and looking at the crops coming up and passing the sunday in quiet and his own tastes being thus agricultural the honest gentleman thought that everybody else must delight in the same recreation  in the winter i hope we shall see you at newcome says the elder brother blandly smiling i cant give you any tigershooting but ill promise you that you shall find plenty of pheasants in our jungle and he laughed very gently at this mild sally  the colonel gave him a queer look i shall be at newcome before the winter i shall be there please god before many days are over  indeed says the baronet with an air of great surprise you are going down to look at the cradle of our race i believe the newcomes were there before the conqueror it was but a village in our grandfathers time and it is an immense flourishing town now for which i hope to geti expect to geta charter  do you says the colonel i am going down there to see a relation  a relation what relatives have we there cries the baronet my children with the exception of barnes barnes this is your uncle colonel thomas newcome i have great pleasure brother in introducing you to my eldest son  a fairhaired young gentleman languid and pale and arrayed in the very height of fashion made his appearance at this juncture in the parlour and returned colonel newcomes greeting with a smiling acknowledgment of his own very happy to see you im sure said the young man you find london very much changed since you were here very good time to comethe very full of the season  poor thomas newcome was quite abashed by this strange reception here was a man hungry for affection and one relation asked him to dinner next monday and another invited him to shoot pheasants at christmas here was a beardless young sprig who patronised him and vouchsafed to ask him whether he found london was changed  i dont know whether its changed says the colonel biting his nails i know its not what i expected to find it  today its really as hot as i should thing it must be in india says young mr barnes newcome  hot says the colonel with a grin it seems to me you are all cool enough here  just what sir thomas de boots said sir says barnes turning round to his father dont you remember when he came home from bombay i recollect his saying at lady featherstones one dooced hot night as it seemed to us i recklect his saying that he felt quite cold did you know him in india colonel newcome hes liked at the horse guards but hes hated in his regiment  colonel newcome here growled a wish regarding the ultimate fate of sir thomas de boots which we trust may never be realised by that distinguished cavalry officer  my brother says hes going to newcome barnes next week said the baronet wishing to make the conversation more interesting to the newly arrived colonel he was saying so just when you came in and i was asking him what took him there  did you ever hear of sarah mason says the colonel  really i never did the baronet answered  sarah mason no upon my word i dont think i ever did said the young man  well thats a pity too the colonel said with a sneer mrs mason is a relation of yoursat least by marriage she is my aunt or cousini used to call her aunt and she and my father and mother all worked in the same mill at newcome together  i remembergod bless my souli remember now cried the baronet we pay her forty pound a year on your accountdont you know brother look to colonel newcomes accounti recollect the name quite well but i thought she had been your nurse andand an old servant of my fathers  so she was my nurse and an old servant of my fathers answered the colonel but she was my mothers cousin too and very lucky was my mother to have such a servant or to have a servant at all there is not in the whole world a more faithful creature or a better woman  mr hobson rather enjoyed his brothers perplexity and to see when the baronet rode the high horse how he came down sometimes i am sure it does you very great credit gasped the courtly head of the firm to remember aa humble friend and connexion of our fathers so well  i think brother you might have recollected her too the colonel growled out his face was blushing he was quite angry and hurt at what seemed to him sir brians hardness of heart  pardon me if i dont see the necessity said sir brian i have no relationship with mrs mason and do not remember ever having seen her can i do anything for you brother can i be useful to you in any way pray command me and barnes here who after city hours will be delighted if he can be serviceable to youi am nailed to this counter all the morning and to the house of commons all nighti will be with you in one moment mr quilter goodbye my dear colonel how well india has agreed with you how young you look the hot winds are nothing to what we endure in parliamenthobson in a low voice you saw about that hm that power of attorneyand hm and hm will call here at twelve about that hmi am sorry i must say goodbyeit seems so hard after not meeting for so many years  very says the colonel  mind and send for me whenever you want me now  oh of course said the elder brother and thought when will that ever be  lady anne will be too delighted at hearing of your arrival give my love to clivea remarkable fine boy clivegood morning and the baronet was gone and his bald head might presently be seen alongside of mr quilters confidential grey poll both of their faces turned into an immense ledger  mr hobson accompanied the colonel to the door and shook him cordially by the hand as he got into his cab the man asked whither he should drive and poor newcome hardly knew where he was or whither he should go drive aohahdamme drive me anywhere away from this place was all he could say and very likely the cabman thought he was a disappointed debtor who had asked in vain to renew a bill in fact thomas newcome had overdrawn his little account there was no such balance of affection in that bank of his brothers as the simple creature had expected to find there  when he was gone sir brian went back to his parlour where sate young barnes perusing the paper my revered uncle seems to have brought back a quantity of cayenne pepper from india sir he said to his father  he seems a very kindhearted simple man the baronet said eccentric but he has been more than thirty years away from home of course you will call upon him tomorrow morning do everything you can to make him comfortable whom would he like to meet at dinner i will ask some of the direction ask him barnes for next wednesday or saturdayno saturday i dine with the speaker but see that every attention is paid him  does he intend to have our relation up to town sir i should like to meet mrs mason of all things a venerable washerwoman i daresay or perhaps keeps a publichouse simpered out young barnes  silence barnes you jest at everything you young men doyou do colonel newcomes affection for his old nurse does him the greatest honour said the baronet who really meant what he said  and i hope my mother will have her to stay a good deal at newcome im sure she must have been a washerwoman and mangled my uncle in early life his costume struck me with respectful astonishment he disdains the use of straps to his trousers and is seemingly unacquainted with gloves if he had died in india would my late aunt have had to perish on a funeral pile here mr quilter entering with a heap of bills put an end to these sarcastic remarks and young newcome applying himself to his business of which he was a perfect master forgot about his uncle till after city hours when he entertained some young gentlemen of bayss club with an account of his newly arrived relative  towards the city whither he wended his way whatever had been the ball or the dissipation of the night before young barnes newcome might be seen walking every morning resolutely and swiftly with his neat umbrella as he passed charing cross on his way westwards his little boots trailed slowly over the pavement his head hung languid bending lower still and smiling with faded sweetness as he doffed his hat and saluted a passing carriage his umbrella trailed after him not a dandy on all the pall mall pavement seemed to have less to do than he  heavyside a large young officer of the household troopsold sir thomas de bootsand horace fogey whom every one knowsare in the window of bayss yawning as widely as that window itself horses under the charge of men in red jackets are pacing

to sing with the duke of york and even against captain costigan but was beaten by that superior bacchanalian artist  sir thomas looks as if to ask what the dash is that to you but wanting still to go to india again and knowing how strong the newcomes are in leadenhall street he thinks it necessary to be civil to the young cub and swallows his wrath once more into his waistband  ive got an uncle come home from indiaupon my word i have says barnes newcome that is why i am so exhausted i am going to buy him a pair of gloves number fourteenand i want a tailor for himnot a young mans tailor fogeys tailor rather id take my fathers but he has all his things made in the countryallin the borough you knowhes a public man  is colonel newcome of the bengal cavalry your uncle asks sir thomas de

quixote  never heard of it upon my word and why do you wish i should be more like him i dont wish to be like him at all thank you  why because he is one of the bravest officers that ever lived roared out the old soldier because hes one of the kindest fellows because he gives himself no dashed airs although he has reason to be proud if he chose thats why mr newcome  a topper for you barney my boy remarks charles heavyside as the indignant general walks away gobbling and red barney calmly drinks the remains of his absinthe  i dont know what that old muff means he says innocently when he has finished his bitter draught hes always flying out at me the old turkeycock he quarrels with my play at whist the old idiot and can no more play than an old baby he pretends to teach me billiards and ill give him fifteen in twenty and beat his old head off why do they let such fellows into clubs lets have a game at piquet till dinner heavyside hallo thats my uncle that tall man with the mustachios and the short trousers walking with that boy of his i dare say they are going to dine in covent garden and going to the play howdydo nunkyand so the worthy pair went up to the cardroom where they sate at piquet until the hour of sunset and dinner arrived     chapter vii in which mr clives schooldays are over   our good colonel had luckily to look forward to a more pleasant meeting with his son than that unfortunate interview with his other near relatives he dismissed his cab at ludgate hill and walked thence by the dismal precincts of newgate and across the muddy pavement of smithfield on his way back to the old school where his son was a way which he had trodden many a time in his own early days there was cistercian street and the red cow of his youth there was the quaint old grey friars square with its blackened trees and garden surrounded by ancient houses of the build of the last century now slumbering like pensioners in the sunshine  under the great archway of the hospital he could look at the old gothic building and a blackgowned pensioner or two crawling over the quiet square or passing from one dark arch to another the boardinghouses of the school were situated in the square hard by the more ancient buildings of the hospital a great noise of shouting crying clapping forms and cupboards treble voices bass voices poured out of the schoolboys windows their life bustle and gaiety contrasted strangely with the quiet of those old men creeping along in their black gowns under the ancient arches yonder whose struggle of life was over whose hope and noise and bustle had sunk into that grey calm there was thomas newcome arrived at the middle of life standing between the shouting boys and the tottering seniors and in a situation to moralise upon both had not his son clive who has espied him from within mr hopkinsons or let us say at once hopkeys house come jumping down the steps to greet his sire clive was dressed in his very best not one of those four hundred young gentlemen had a better figure a better tailor or a neater boot schoolfellows grinning through the bars envied him as he walked away senior boys made remarks on colonel newcomes loose clothes and long mustachios his brown hands and unbrushed hat the colonel was smoking a cheroot as he walked and the gigantic smith the cock of the school who happened to be looking majestically out of window was pleased to say that he thought newcomes governor was a fine manlylooking fellow  tell me about your uncles clive said the colonel as they walked on arm in arm  what about them sir asks the boy i dont think i know much  you have been to stay with them you wrote about them were they kind to you  oh yes i suppose they are very kind they always tipped me only you know when i go there i scarcely ever see them mr newcome asks me the oftenesttwo or three times a quarter when hes in town and gives me a sovereign regular  well he must see you to give you the sovereign says clives father laughing  the boy blushed rather  yes when its time to go back to smithfield on a sunday night i go into the diningroom to shake hands and he gives it me but he dont speak to me much you know and i dont care about going to bryanstone square except for the tip of course thats important because i am made to dine with the children and they are quite little ones and a great cross french governess who is always crying and shrieking after them and finding fault with them my uncle generally has his dinnerparties on saturday or goes out and aunt gives me ten shillings and sends me to the play thats better fun than a dinnerparty here the lad blushed again i used says he when i was younger to stand on the stairs and prig things out of the dishes when they came out from dinner but im past that now maria thats my cousin used to take the sweet things and give em to the governess fancy she used to put lumps of sugar into her pocket and eat them in the schoolroom uncle hobson dont live in such good society as uncle newcome you see aunt hobson shes very kind you know and all that but i dont think shes what you call comme il faut  why how are you to judge asks the father amused at the lads candid prattle and where does the difference lie  i cant tell you what it is or how it is the boy answered only one cant help seeing the difference it isnt rank and that only somehow there are some men gentlemen and some not and some women ladies and some not theres jones now the fifth form master every man sees hes a gentleman though he wears ever so old clothes and theres mr brown who oils his hair and wears rings and white chokersmy eyes such white chokersand yet we call him the handsome snob and so about aunt maria shes very handsome and shes very finely dressed only somehow shes notshes not the ticket you see  oh shes not the ticket says the colonel much amused  well what i mean isbut never mind says the boy i cant tell you what i mean i dont like to make fun of her you know for after all she is very kind to me but aunt anne is different and it seems as if what she says is more natural and though she has funny ways of her own too yet somehow she looks granderand here the lad laughed again and do you know i often think that as good a lady as aunt anne herself is old aunt honeyman at brightonthat is in all essentials you know for she is not proud and she is not vain and she never says an unkind word behind anybodys back and she does a deal of kindness to the poor without appearing to crow over them you know and she is not a bit ashamed of letting lodgings or being poor herself as sometimes i think some of our family  i thought we were going to speak no ill of them says the colonel smiling  well it only slipped out unawares says clive laughing but at newcome when they go on about the newcomes and that great ass barnes newcome gives himself his airs it makes me die of laughing that time i went down to newcome i went to see old aunt sarah and she told me everything and showed me the room where my grandfatheryou know and do you know i was a little hurt at first for i thought we were swells till then and when i came back to school where perhaps i had been giving myself airs and bragging about newcome why you know i thought it was right to tell the fellows  thats a man said the colonel with delight though had he said thats a boy he had spoken more correctly indeed how many men do we know in the world without caring to know who their fathers were and how many more who wisely do not care to tell us thats a man cries the colonel never be ashamed of your father clive  ashamed of my father says clive looking up to him and walking on as proud as a peacock i say the lad resumed after a pause  say what you say said the father  is that all true whats in the peeragein the baronetage about uncle newcome and newcome about the newcome who was burned at smithfield about the one that was at the battle of bosworth and the old old newcome who was barthat is who was surgeon to edward the confessor and was killed at hastings i am afraid it isnt and yet i should like it to be true  i think every man would like to come of an ancient and honourable race said the colonel in his honest way as you like your father to be an honourable man why not your grandfather and his ancestors before him but if we cant inherit a good name at least we can do our best to leave one my boy and that is an ambition which please god you and i will both hold by  with this simple talk the old and young gentleman beguiled their way until they came into the western quarter of the town where the junior member of the firm of newcome brothers had his housea handsome and roomy mansion in bryanstone square colonel newcome was bent on paying a visit to his sisterinlaw and as he knocked at the door where the pair were kept waiting some little time he could remark through the opened windows of the diningroom that a great table was laid and every preparation made for a feast  my brother said he was engaged to dinner today said the colonel does mrs newcome give parties when he is away  she invites all the company answered clive my uncle never asks any one without aunts leave  the colonels countenance fell he has a great dinner and does not ask his own brother newcome thought why if he had come to me in india with all his family he might have stayed for a year and i should have been offended if he had gone elsewhere  a hot menial in a red waistcoat came and opened the door and without waiting for preparatory queries said not at home  its my father john said clive my aunt will see colonel newcome  missis not at home said the man missis is gone in carriagenot at this doortake them things down the area steps young man bawls out the domestic this latter speech was addressed to a pastrycooks boy with a large sugar temple and many conical papers containing delicacies for dessert mind the hice is here in time or therell be a blowup with your governorand john struggled back closing the door on the astonished colonel  upon my life they actually shut the door in our faces said the poor gentleman  the man is very busy sir theres a great dinner im sure my aunt would not refuse you clive interposed she is very kind i suppose its different here to what it is in india here are the children in the squarethose are the girls in bluethats the french governess the one with the mustachios and the yellow parasol how dye do mary how dye do fanny this is my fatherthis is your uncle  mesdemoiselles je vous ddfends de parler a qui que ce soit hors du squar screams out the lady of the mustachios and she strode forward to call back her young charges  the colonel addressed her in very good french i hope you will permit me to make acquaintance with my nieces he said and with their instructress of whom my son has given me such a favourable account  hem said mademoiselle lebrun remembering the last fight she and clive had had together and a portrait of herself with enormous whiskers which the young scapegrace had drawn monsieur is very good but one cannot too early inculcate retenue and decorum to young ladies in a country where demoiselles seem for ever to forget that they are young ladies of condition i am forced to keep the eyes of lynx upon these young persons otherwise heaven knows what would come to them only yesterday my back is turned for a moment i cast my eyes on a book having but little time for literature monsieurfor literature which i adorewhen a cry makes itself to hear i turn myself and what do i see mesdemoiselles your nieces playing at criquette with the messieurs smeessons of doctor smeesyoung galopins monsieur all this was shrieked with immense volubility and many actions of the hand and parasol across the squarerailings to the amused colonel at whom the little girls peered through the bars  well my dears i should like to have a game at cricket with you too says the kind gentleman reaching them each a brown hand  you monsieur cest differenta man of your age salute monsieur your uncle mesdemoiselles you conceive monsieur that i also must be cautious when i speak to a man so distinguished in a public squar and she cast down her great eyes and hid those radiant orbs from the colonel  meanwhile colonel newcome indifferent to the direction which miss lebruns eyes took whether towards his hat or his boots was surveying his little nieces with that kind expression which his face always wore when it was turned towards children have you heard of your uncle in india he asked them  no says maria  yes says fanny you know mademoiselle said mademoiselle at this moment was twittering her fingers and as it were kissing them in the direction of a grand barouche that was advancing along the squareyou know mademoiselle said that if we were mechantes we should be sent to our uncle in india i think i should like to go with you  o you silly child cries maria  yes i should if clive went too says little fanny  behold madam who arrives from her promenade miss lebrun exclaimed and turning round colonel newcome had the satisfaction of beholding for the first time his sisterinlaw  a stout lady with fair hair and a fine bonnet and pelisse who knows what were the fine bonnets and pelisses of the year 183 was reclining in the barouche the scarletplush integuments of her domestics blazing before and behind her a pretty little foot was on the cushion opposite to her feathers waved in her bonnet a book was in her lap an oval portrait of a gentleman reposed on her voluminous bosom she wore another picture of two darling heads with pink cheeks and golden hair on one of her wrists with many more chains bracelets bangles and knickknacks a pair of dirty gloves marred the splendour of this appearance a heap of books from the library strewed the back seat of the carriage and showed that her habits were literary springing down from his station behind his mistress the youth clad in the nether garments of red sammit discharged thunderclaps on the door of mrs newcomes house announcing to the whole square that his mistress had returned to her abode since the fort saluted the governorgeneral at  colonel newcome had never heard such a cannonading  clive with a queer twinkle of his eyes ran towards his aunt  she bent over the carriage languidly towards him she liked him what you clive she said how come you away from school of a thursday sir  it is a holiday says he my father is come and he is come to see you  she bowed her head with an expression of affable surprise and majestic satisfaction indeed clive she was good enough to exclaim and with an air which seemed to say let him come up and be presented to me the honest gentleman stepped forward and took off his hat and bowed and stood bareheaded she surveyed him blandly and with infinite grace put forward one of the pudgy little hands in one of the dirty gloves can you fancy a twopennyhalfpenny baroness of king franciss time patronising bayard can you imagine queen guinevers ladysmaids ladys maid being affable to sir lancelot i protest there is nothing like the virtue of english women  you have only arrived today and you came to see me that was very kind nestce pas que cetoit bong de mouseer le collonel mademoiselle madamaselle lebrun le collonel newcome mong frere in a whisper my childrens governess and my friend a most superior woman was it not kind of colonel newcome to come to see me have you had a pleasant voyage did you come by st helena oh how i envy you seeing the tomb of that great man nous parlong de napolleong mademoiselle dong voter pere a ete le general favvory  o dieu que nai je pu le voir interjaculates mademoiselle lui dont parle lunivers dont mon pere ma si souvent parle but this remark passes quite unnoticed by mademoiselles friend who continues  clive donnezmoi voter bras these are two of my girls my boys are at school i shall be so glad to introduce them to their uncle this naughty boy might never have seen you but that we took him home to marblehead after the scarlet fever and made him well didnt we clive and we are all very fond of him and you must not be jealous of his love for his aunt we feel that we quite know you through him and we know that you know us and we hope you will like us do you think your pa will like us clive or perhaps you will like lady anne best yes you have been to her first of course not been oh because she is not in town leaning fondly on the arm of clive mademoiselle standing grouped with the children hard by while john with his hat off stood at the opened door mr newcome slowly uttered the above remarkable remarks to the colonel on the threshold of her house which she never asked him to pass  if you will come in to us at about ten this evening she then said you will find some men not undistinguished who honour me of an evening perhaps they will be interesting to you colonel newcome as you are newly arrived in europe not men of worldly rank necessarily although some of them are amongst the noblest of europe but my maxim is that genius is an illustration and merit is better than any pedigree you have heard of professor bodgers count poski doctor mcguffog who is called in his native country the ezekiel of clackmannan mr shaloony the great irish patriot our papers have told you of him these and some more i have been good enough to promise me a visit tonight a stranger coming to london could scarcely have a better opportunity of seeing some of our great illustrations of science and literature and you will meet our own familynot sir brians whowho have other society and amusementsbut mine i hope mr newcome and myself will never forget them we have a few friends at dinner and now i must go in and consult with mrs hubbard my housekeeper goodbye for the present mind not later than ten as mr newcome must be up betimes in the morning and our parties break up early when clive is a little older i dare say we shall see him too goodbye and again the colonel was favoured with a shake of the glove and the lady and her suite sailed up the stair and passed in at the door  she had not the faintest idea but that the hospitality which she was offering to her kinsman was of the most cordial and pleasant kind she fancied everything she did was perfectly right and graceful she invited her husbands clerks to come through the rain at ten oclock from kentish town she asked artists to bring their sketchbooks from kensington or luckless pianists to trudge with their music from brompton she rewarded them with a smile and a cup of tea and thought they were made happy by her condescension if after two or three of these delightful evenings they ceased to attend her receptions she shook her little flaxen head and sadly intimated that mr a was getting into bad courses or feared that mr b found merely intellectual parties too quiet for him else what young man in his senses could refuse such entertainment and instruction     chapter viii mrs newcome at home a small early party   to push on in the crowd every male or female struggler must use his shoulders if a better place than yours presents itself just beyond your neighbour elbow him and take it look how a steadily purposed man or woman at court at a ball or exhibition wherever there is a competition and a squeeze gets the best place the nearest the sovereign if bent on kissing the royal hand the closest to the grand stand if minded to go to ascot the best view and hearing of the rev mr thumpington when all the town is rushing to hear that exciting divine the largest quantity of ice champagne and seltzer cold pate or other his or her favourite fleshpot if gluttonously minded at a supper whence hundreds of people come empty away a woman of the world will marry her daughter and have done with her get her carriage and be at home and asleep in bed whilst a timid mamma has still her girl in the nursery or is beseeching the servants in the cloakroom to look for her shawls with which some one else has whisked away an hour ago what a man has to do in society is to assert himself is there a good place at table take it at the treasury or the home office ask for it do you want to go to a party to which you are not invited ask to be asked ask a ask b ask mrs c ask everybody you know you will be thought a bore but you will have your way what matters if you are considered obtrusive provided that you obtrude by pushing steadily nine hundred and ninetynine people in a thousand will yield to you only command persons and you may be pretty sure that a good number will obey how well your money will have been laid out o gentle reader who purchase this and taking the maxim to heart follow it through life you may be sure of success if your neighbours foot obstructs you stamp on it and do you suppose he wont take it away  the proofs of the correctness of the above remarks i show in various members of the newcome family here was a vulgar little woman not clever nor pretty especially meeting mr newcome casually she ordered him to marry her and he obeyed as he obeyed her in everything else which she chose to order through life meeting colonel newcome on the steps of her house she orders him to come to her evening party and though he has not been to an evening party for fiveandthirty yearsthough he has not been to bed the night beforethough he has no mufticoat except one sent him out by messrs stultz to india in the year 1821he never once thinks of disobeying mrs newcomes order but is actually at her door at five minutes past ten having arrayed himself to the wonderment of clive and left the boy to talk with his friend and fellowpassenger mr binnie who has just arrived from portsmouth who has dined with him and who by previous arrangement has taken up his quarters at the same hotel  this stultz coat a blue swallowtail with yellow buttons now wearing a tinge of their native copper a very high velvet collar on a level with the tips of the captains ears with a high waist indicated by two lapelles and a pair of buttons high up in the wearers back a white waistcoat and scarlet underwaistcoat and a pair of the neverfailing duck trousers complete thomas newcomes costume along with the white hat in which we have seen him in the morning and which was one of two dozen purchased by him some years since at public outcry burrumtollah we have called him captain purposely while speaking of his coat for he held that rank when the garment came out to him and having been in the habit of considering it a splendid coat for twelve years past he has not the least idea of changing his opinion  the doctor mcguffog professor bodgers count poski and all the lions present at mrs newcomes reunion that evening were completely eclipsed by colonel newcome the worthy soul who cared not the least about adorning himself had a handsome diamond brooch of the year 1801given him by poor jack cutler who was knocked over by his side at argaumand wore this ornament in his desk for a thousand days and nights at a time in his shirtfrill on such parade evenings as he considered mrs newcomes to be the splendour of this jewel and of his flashing buttons caused all eyes to turn to him there were many pairs of mustachios present those of professor schnurr a very corpulent martyr just escaped from spandau and of maximilien tranchard french exile and apostle of liberty were the only whiskers in the room capable of vying in interest with colonel newcomes polish chieftains were at this time so common in london that nobody except one noble member for marylebone once a year the lord mayor took any interest in them the general opinion was that the stranger was the wallachian boyar whose arrival at mivarts the morning post had just announced mrs miles whose delicious every other wednesdays in montague square are supposed by some to be rival entertainments to mrs newcomes alternate thursdays in bryanstone square pinched her daughter mira engaged in a polyglot conversation with herr schnurr nor carabossi the guitarist and monsieur pivier the celebrated french chessplayer to point out the boyar mira miles wished she knew a little moldavian not so much that she might speak it but that she might be heard to speak it mrs miles who had not had the educational advantages of her daughter simpered up with madame newcome pas icivotre excellence nouvellement arriveavezvous fait ung bong voyage je recois chez moi mercredi prochaing lonnure de vous voirmadamasel miles ma fille and mira now reinforcing her mamma poured in a glib little oration in french somewhat to the astonishment of the colonel who began to think however that perhaps french was the language of the polite world into which he was now making his very first entree  mrs newcome had left her place at the door of her drawingroom to walk through her rooms with rummun loll the celebrated indian merchant otherwise his excellency rummun loll otherwise his highness rummun loll the chief proprietor of the diamondmines in golconda with a claim of three millions and ahalf upon the east india companywho smoked his hookah after dinner when the ladies were gone and in whose honour for his servants always brought a couple or more of hookahs with them many english gentlemen made themselves sick while trying to emulate the same practice mr newcome had been obliged to go to bed himself in consequence of the uncontrollable nausea produced by the chillum and doctor mcguffog in hopes of converting his highness had puffed his till he was as black in the face as the interesting indianand now having hung on his armalways in the dirty glovesflirting a fan whilst his excellency consumed betel out of a silver box and having promenaded him and his turban and his shawls and his kincab pelisse and his lacquered moustache and keen brown face and opal eyeballs through her rooms the hostess came back to her station at the drawingroom door  as soon as his excellency saw the colonel whom he perfectly well knew his highnesss princely air was exchanged for one of the deepest humility he bowed his head and put his two hands before his eyes and came creeping towards him submissively to the wonderment of mrs miles who was yet more astonished when the moldavian magnate exclaimed in perfectly good english what rummun you here  the rummun still bending and holding his hands before him uttered a number of rapid sentences in the hindustani language which colonel newcome received twirling his mustachios with much hauteur he turned on his heel rather abruptly and began to speak to mrs newcome who smiled and thanked him for coming on his first night after his return  the colonel said to whose house should he first come but to his brothers how mrs newcome wished she could have had room for him at dinner and there was room after all for mr shaloony was detained at the house the most interesting conversation the indian prince was so intelligent  the indian what asks colonel newcome the heathen gentleman had gone off and was seated by one of the handsomest young women in the room whose fair face was turned towards him whose blond ringlets touched his shoulder and who was listening to him as eagerly as desdemona listened to othello  the colonels rage was excited as he saw the indians behaviour he curled his mustachios up to his eyes in his wrath you dont mean that that man calls himself a prince that a fellow who wouldnt sit down in an officers presence is  how do you do mr honeymaneh bong soir monsieuryou are very late mr presslywhat barnes is it possible that you do me the honour to come all the way from mayfair to marylebone i thought you young men of fashion never crossed oxford street colonel newcome this is your nephew  how do you do sir says barnes surveying the colonels costume with inward wonder but without the least outward manifestation of surprise i suppose you dined here to meet the black prince i came to ask him and my uncle to meet you at dinner on wednesday wheres my uncle maam  your uncle is gone to bed ill he smoked one of those hookahs which the prince brings and it has made him very unwell indeed barnes how is lady anne is lord kew in london is your sister better for brighton air i see your cousin is appointed secretary of legation have you good accounts of your aunt lady fanny  lady fanny is as well as can be expected and the baby is going on perfectly well thank you barnes said drily and his aunt obstinately gracious with him turned away to some other new comet  its interesting isnt it sir says barnes turning to the colonel to see such union in families whenever i come here my aunt trots out all my relations and i send a man round in the mornin to ask how they all are so uncle hobson is gone to bed sick with a hookah i know there was a deuce of a row made when i smoked at marblehead you are promised to us for wednesday please is there anybody you would like to meet not our friend the rummun how the girls crowd round him by gad a fellow whos rich in london may have the pick of any galnot herenot in this sort of thing i mean in society you know says barnes confidentially ive seen the old dowagers crowdin round that fellow and the girls snugglin up to his indiarubber face hes known to have two wives already in india but by gad for a settlement i believe some of em here would marryi mean of the girls in society  but isnt this society asked the colonel  oh of course its very good society and that sort of thingbut its not you knowyou understand i give you my honour there are not three people in the room one meets anywhere except the rummun what is he at home sir i know he aint a prince you know any more than i am  i believe he is a rich man now said the colonel he began from very low beginnings and odd stories are told about the origin of his fortune  that may be says the young man of course as businessmen thats not our affair but has he got the fortune he keeps a large account with us and i think wants to have larger dealings with us still as one of the family we may ask you to stand by us and tell us anything you know my father has asked him down to newcome and weve taken him up wisely or not i cant say i think otherwise but im quite young in the house and of course the elders have the chief superintendence the young man of business had dropped his drawl or his languor and was speaking quite unaffectedly goodnaturedly and selfishly had you talked to him for a week you could not have made him understand the scorn and loathing with which the colonel regarded him here was a young fellow as keen as the oldest curmudgeon a lad with scarce a beard to his chin that would pursue his bond as rigidly as shylock if he is like this at twenty what will he be at fifty groaned the colonel id rather clive were dead than have him such a heartless woriding as this and yet the young man was not ungenerous not untruthtelling not unserviceable he thought his life was good enough it was as good as that of other folks he lived with you dont suppose he had any misgivings provided he was in the city early enough in the morning or slept badly unless he indulged too freely overnight or twinges of conscience that his life was misspent he thought his life a most lucky and reputable one he had a share in a good business and felt that he could increase it some day he would marry a good match with a good fortune meanwhile he could take his pleasure decorously and sow his wild oats as some of the young londoners sow them not broadcast after the fashion of careless scatterbrained youth but trimly and neatly in quiet places where the crop can come up unobserved and be taken in without bustle or scandal barnes newcome never missed going to church or dressing for dinner he never kept a tradesman waiting for his money he never drank too much except when other fellows did and in good company he never was late for business or huddled over his toilet however brief had been his sleep or severe his headache in a word he was as scrupulously whited as any sepulchre in the whole bills of mortality  whilst young barnes and his uncle were thus holding parley a slim gentleman of bland aspect with a roomy forehead or what his female admirers called a noble brow and a neat white neckcloth tied with clerical skill was surveying colonel newcome through his shining spectacles and waiting for an opportunity to address him the colonel remarked the eagerness with which the gentleman in black regarded him and asked mr barnes who was the padre mr barnes turned his eyeglass towards the spectacles and said he didnt know any more than the dead he didnt know two people in the room the spectacles nevertheless made the eyeglass a bow of which the latter took no sort of cognisance the spectacles advanced mr newcome fell back with a peevish exclamation of confound the fellow what is he coming to speak to me for he did not choose to be addressed by all sorts of persons in all houses  but he of the spectacles with an expression of delight in his pale blue eyes and smiles dimpling his countenance pressed onwards with outstretched hands and it was towards the colonel he turned these smiles and friendly salutations did i hear aright sir from mrs miles he said and have i the honour of speaking to colonel newcome  the same sir says the colonel at which the other tearing off a glove of lavendercoloured kid uttered the words charles honeyman and seized the hand of his brotherinlaw my poor sisters husband he continued my own benefactor clives father how strange are these meetings in the mighty world how i rejoice to see you and know you  you are charles are you cries the other i am very glad indeed to shake you by the hand honeyman clive and i should have beat up your quarters today but we were busy until dinnertime you put me in mind of poor emma charles he added sadly emma had not been a good wife to him a flighty silly little woman who had caused him when alive many a night of pain and day of anxiety  poor poor emma exclaimed the ecclesiastic casting his eyes towards the chandelier and passing a white cambric pockethandkerchief gracefully before them no man in london understood the ring business or the pockethandkerchief business better or smothered his emotion more beautifully in the gayest moments in the giddiest throng of fashion the thoughts of the past will rise the departed will be among us still but this is not the strain wherewith to greet the friend newly arrived on our shores how it rejoices me to behold you in old england how you must have joyed to see clive  d the humbug muttered barnes who knew him perfectly well the fellow is always in the pulpit  the incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel smiled and bowed to him you do not recognise me sir i have had the honour of seeing you in your public capacity in the city when i have called at the bank the bearer of my brotherinlaws generous  never mind that honeyman cried the colonel  but i do mind my dear colonel answers mr honeyman i should be a very bad man and a very ungrateful brother if i ever forgot your kindness  for gods sake leave my kindness alone  hell never leave it alone as long as he can use it muttered mr barnes in his teeth and turning to his uncle may i take you home sir my cab is at the door and i shall be glad to drive you but the colonel said he must talk to his brotherinlaw for a while and mr barnes bowing very respectfully to him slipped under a dowagers arm in the doorway and retreated silently downstairs  newcome was now thrown entirely upon the clergyman and the latter described the personages present to the stranger who was curious to know how the party was composed mrs newcome herself would have been pleased had she heard honeymans discourse regarding her guests and herself charles honeyman so spoke of most persons that you might fancy they were listening over his shoulder such an assemblage of learning genius and virtue might well delight and astonish a stranger that lady in the red turban with the handsome daughters is lady budge wife of the eminent judge of that nameeverybody was astonished that he was not made chief justice and elevated to the peeragethe only objection as i have heard confidentially was on the part of a late sovereign who said he never could consent to have a peer of the name of budge her ladyship was of humble i have heard even menial station originally but becomes her present rank dispenses the most elegant hospitality at her mansion in connaught terrace and is a pattern as a wife and a mother the young man talking to her daughter is a young barrister already becoming celebrated as a contributor to some of our principal reviews  who is that cavalry officer in a white waistcoat talking to the jew with the beard asks the colonel  he he that cavalry officer is another literary man of celebrity and by profession an attorney but he has quitted the law for the muses and it would appear that the nine are never wooed except by gentlemen with mustachios  never wrote a verse in my life says the colonel laughing and stroking his own  for i remark so many literary gentlemen with that decoration the jew with the beard as you call him is herr von lungen the eminent hautboyplayer the three next gentlemen are mr smee of the royal academy who is shaved as you perceive and mr moyes and mr cropper who are both very hairy about the chin at the piano singing accompanied by mademoiselle lebrun is signor mezzocaldo the great barytone from rome professor quartz and baron hammerstein celebrated geologists from germany are talking with their illustrious confrere sir robert craxton in the door do you see yonder that stout gentleman with stuff on his shirt the eloquent dr mcguffog of edinburgh talking to dr ettore who lately escaped from the inquisition at rome in the disguise of a washerwoman after undergoing the question several times the rack and the thumbscrew they say that he was to have been burned in the grand square the next morning but between ourselves my dear colonel i mistrust these stories of converts and martyrs did you ever see a more jollylooking man than professor schnurr who was locked up in spielberg and got out up a chimney and through a window had he waited a few months there are very few windows he could have passed through that splendid man in the red fez is kurbash pashaanother renegade i deeply lament to saya hairdresser from marseilles by name monsieur ferehaud who passed into egypt and laid aside the tongs for a turban he is talking with mr palmer one of our most delightful young poets and with desmond otara son of the late revered bishop of ballinafad who has lately quitted ours for the errors of the church of rome let me whisper to you that your kinswoman is rather a searcher after what we call here notabilities i heard talk of one i knew in better daysof one who was the comrade of my youth and the delight of oxfordpoor pidge of brasenose who got the newdigate in my third year and who under his present name of father bartolo was to have been here in his capuchin dress with a beard and bare feet but i presume he could not get permission from his superior that is mr huff the political economist talking with mr macduff the member for glenlivat that is the coroner for middlesex conversing with the great surgeon sir cutler sharp and that pretty laughing girl talking with them is no other than the celebrated miss pinnnifer whose novel of ralph the resurrectionist created such a sensation after it was abused in the trimestrial review it was a little bold certainlyi just looked at it at my clubafter hours devoted to parish duty a clergyman is sometimes allowed you know desipere in locothere are descriptions in it certainly startlingideas about marriage not exactly orthodox but the poor child wrote the book actually in the nursery and all england was ringing with it before dr pinnifer her father knew who was the author that is the doctor asleep in the corner by miss rudge the american authoress who i dare say is explaining to him the difference between the two governments my dear mrs newcome i am giving my brotherinlaw a little sketch of some of the celebrities who are crowding your salon tonight what a delightful evening you have given us  i try to do my best colonel newcome said the lady of the house i hope many a night we may see you here and as i said this morning clive when he is of an age to appreciate this kind of entertainment fashion i do not worship you may meet that amongst other branches of our family but genius and talent i do reverence and if i can be the meansthe humble meansto bring men of genius togethermind to associate with mindmen of all nations to mingle in friendly unisoni shall not have lived altogether in vain they call us women of the world frivolous colonel newcome so some may be i do not say there are not in our own family persons who worship mere worldly rank and think but of fashion and gaiety but such i trust will never be the objects in life of me and my children we are but merchants we seek to be no more if i can look around me and see as i doshe waves her fan round and points to the illustrations scintillating round the roomand see as i do nowa poski whose name is ever connected with polish historyan ettore who has exchanged a tonsure and a rack for our own free countrya hammerstein and a quartz a miss rudge our transatlantic sister who i trust will not mention this modest salon in her forthcoming work on europe and miss pinnifer whose genius i acknowledge though i deplore her opinions if i can gather together travellers poets and painters princes and distinguished soldiers from the east and clergymen remarkable for their eloquence my humble aim is attained and maria newcome is not altogether useless in her generation will you take a little refreshment allow your sister to go down to the diningroom supported by your gallant arm she looked round to the admiring congregation whereof honeyman as it were acted as clerk and flirting her fan and flinging up her little head consummate virtue walked down on the arm of the colonel  the refreshment was rather meagre the foreign artists generally dashed downstairs and absorbed all the ices creams etc to those coming late there were chickenbones tablecloths puddled with melted ice glasses hazy with sherry and broken bits of bread the colonel said he never supped and he and honeyman walked away together the former to bed the latter i am sorry to say to his club for he was a dainty feeder and loved lobster and talk late at night and a comfortable little glass of something wherewith to conclude the day  he agreed to come to breakfast with the colonel who named eight or nine for the meal nine mr honeyman agreed to with a sigh the incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel seldom rose before eleven for to tell the truth no french abbot of louis xv was more lazy and luxurious and effeminate than our polite bachelor preacher  one of colonel newcomes fellowpassengers from india was mr james binnie of the civil service a jolly young bachelor of two or threeandforty who having spent half of his past life in bengal was bent upon enjoying the remainder in britain or in europe if a residence at home should prove agreeable to him the nabob of books and tradition is a personage no longer to be found among us he is neither as wealthy nor as wicked as the jaundiced monster of romances and comedies who purchases the estates of brokendown english gentlemen with rupees tortured out of bleeding rajahs who smokes a hookah in public and in private carries about a guilty conscience diamonds of untold value and a diseased liver who has a vulgar wife with a retinue of black servants whom she maltreats and a gentle son and daughter with good impulses and an imperfect education desirous to amend their own and their parents lives and thoroughly ashamed of the follies of the old people if you go to the house of an indian gentleman now he does not say bring more curricles like the famous nabob of stanstead park he goes to leadenhall street in an omnibus and walks back from the city for exercise i have known some who have had maidservants to wait on them at dinner i have met scores who look as florid and rosy as any british squire who has never left his paternal beef and acres they do not wear nankeen jackets in summer their livers are not out of order any more and as for hookahs i dare swear there are not two now kept alight within the bills of mortality and that retired indians would as soon think of smoking them as their wives would of burning themselves on their husbands bodies at the cemetery kensal green near to the tyburnian quarter of the city which the indian world at present inhabits it used to be baker street and harley street it used to be portland place and in more early days bedford square where the indian magnates flourished districts which have fallen from their pristine state of splendour now even as agra and benares and lucknow and tippoo sultans city are fallen  after twoandtwenty years absence from london mr binnie returned to it on the top of the gosport coach with a hatbox and a little portmanteau a pink freshshaven face a perfect appetite a suit of clothes like everybody elses and not the shadow of a black servant he called a cab at the white horse cellar and drove to nerots hotel clifford street and he gave the cabman eightpence making the fellow who grumbled understand that clifford street was not two hundred yards from bond street and that he was paid at the rate of five shillings and fourpence per milecalculating the mile at only sixteen hundred yards he asked the waiter at what time colonel newcome had ordered dinner and finding there was an hour on his hands before the meal walked out to examine the neighbourhood for a lodging where he could live more quietly than in a hotel he called it a hotel mr binnie was a north briton his father having been a writer to the signet in edinburgh who had procured his son a writership in return for electioneering services done to an east indian director binnie had his retiring pension and besides had saved half his allowances ever since he had been in india he was a man of great reading no small ability considerable accomplishment excellent good sense and good humour the ostentatious said he was a screw but he gave away more money than far more extravagant people he was a disciple of david hume whom he admired more than any other mortal and the serious denounced him as a man of dangerous principles though there were among the serious men much more dangerous than james binnie  on returning to his hotel colonel newcome found this worthy gentleman installed in his room in the best armchair sleeping cosily the evening paper laid decently over his plump waistcoat and his little legs placed on an opposite chair mr binnie woke up briskly when the colonel entered it is you you gadabout is it cried the civilian how has the beau monde of london treated the indian adonis have you made a sensation newcome gad tom i remember you a buck of bucks when that coat first came out to calcuttajust a barrackpore brummellin lord mintos reign was it or when lord hastings was satrap over us  a man must have one good coat says the colonel i dont profess to be a dandy but get a coat from a good tailor and then have done with it he still thought his garment was as handsome as need be  done with ityere never done with it cries the civilian  an old coat is an old friend old binnie i dont want to be rid of one or the other how long did you and my boy sit up togetherisnt he a fine lad binnie i expect you are going to put him down for something handsome in your will  see what it is to have a real friend now colonel i sate up for ye or let us say more correctly i waited for youbecause i knew you would want to talk about that scapegrace of yours and if i had gone to bed i should have had you walking up to no 28 and waking me out of my first rosy slumber well now confess avoid not havent ye fallen in love with some young beauty on the very first night of your arrival in your sisters salong and selected a motherinlaw for young scapegrace  isnt he a fine fellow james says the colonel lighting a cheroot as he sits on the table was it joy or the bedroom candle with which he lighted his cigar which illuminated his honest features so and made them so to shine  i have been occupied sir in taking the lads moral measurement and have pumped him as successfully as ever i crossexamined a rogue in my court i place his qualities thuslove of approbation sixteen benevolence fourteen combativeness fourteen adhesiveness two amativeness is not yet of course fully developed but i expect will be prodeegiously strong the imaginative and reflective organs are very largethose of calculation weak he may make a poet or a painter or you may make a sojer of him though worse men than hims good enough for thatbut a bad merchant a lazy lawyer and a miserable mathematician he has wit and conscientiousness so ye mustnt think of making a clergyman of him  binnie says the colonel gravely you are always sneering at the cloth  when i think that but for my appointment to india i should have been a luminary of the faith and a pillar of the church grappling with the ghostly enemy in the pulpit and giving out the psawm eh sir what a loss scottish divinity has had in james binnie cries the little civilian with his most comical face but that is not the question my opinion colonel is that young scapegrace will give you a deal of trouble or would only you are so absurdly proud of him that you think everything he does is perfaction hell spend your money for you hell do as little work as need be hell get into scrapes with the sax hes almost as simple as his father and that is to say that any rogue will cheat him and he seems to me to have got your obstinate habit of telling the truth colonel which may prevet his getting on in the world but on the other hand will keep him from going very wrong so that though there is every fear for him theres some hope and some consolation  what do you think of his latin and greek asks the colonel before going out to his party newcome had laid a deep scheme with binnie and it had been agreed that the latter should examine the young fellow in his humanities  wall cries the scot i find that the lad knows as much about greek and latin as i knew myself when i was eighteen years of age  my dear binnie is it possible you the best scholar in all india  and which amounted to exactly nothing he has acquired in five years and by the admirable seestem purshood at your public schools just about as much knowledge of the ancient languages as he could get by three months application at home mind ye i dont say he would apply it is most probable he would do no such thing but at the cost ofhow much two hundred pounds annuallyfor five yearshe has acquired about fiveandtwenty guineas worth of classical leeteratureenough i dare say to enable him to quote horace respectably through life and what more do ye want from a young man of his expectations i think i should send him into the army thats the best place for himtheres the least to do and the handsomest clothes to wear acce segnum says the little wag daintily taking up the tail of his friends coat  theres never any knowing whether you are in jest or in earnest binnie the puzzled colonel said  how should you know when i dont know myself answered the scotchman in earnest now tom newcome i think your boy is as fine a lad as i ever set eyes on he seems to have intelligence and good temper he carries his letter of recommendation in his countenance and with the honestyand the rupees mind yewhich he inherits from his father the deuce is in it if he cant make his way what times the breakfast eh but it was a comfort this morning not to hear the holystoning on the deck we ought to go into lodgings and not fling our money out of the window of this hotel we must make the young chap take us about and show us the town in the morning tom i had but three days of it fiveandtwenty years ago and i propose to reshoome my observations tomorrow after breakfast well just go on deck and see hows her head before we turn in eh colonel and with this the jolly gentleman nodded over his candle to his friend and trotted off to bed  the colonel and his friend were light sleepers and early risers like most men that come from the country where they had both been so long sojourning and were awake and dressed long before the london waiters had thought of quitting their beds the housemaid was the only being stirring in the morning when little mr binnie blundered over her pail as she was washing the deck early as he was his fellowtraveller had preceded him binnie found the colonel in his sittingroom arrayed in what are called in scotland his stockingfeet already puffing the cigar which in truth was seldom out of his mouth at any hour of the day  he had a couple of bedrooms adjacent to this sittingroom and when binnie as brisk and rosy about the gills as chanticleer broke out in a morning salutation hush says the colonel putting a long finger up to his mouth and advancing towards him as noiselessly as a ghost  whats in the wind now asks the little scot and what for have ye not got your shoes on  clives asleep says the colonel with a countenance full of extreme anxiety  the darling boy slumbers does he said the wag maynt i just step in and look at his beautiful countenance whilst hes asleep colonel  you may if you take off those confounded creaking shoes the other answered quite gravely and binnie turned away to hide his jolly round face which was screwed up with laughter  have ye been breathing a prayer over your rosy infants slumbers tom asks mr binnie  and if i have james binnie the colonel said gravely and his sallow face blushing somewhat if i have i hope ive done no harm the last time i saw him asleep was nine years ago a sickly little palefaced boy in his little cot and now sir that i see him again strong and handsome and all that a fond father can wish to see a boy i should be an ungrateful villain james if i didntif i didnt do what you said just now and thank god almighty for restoring him to me  binnie did not laugh any more by george tom newcome said he youre just one of the saints of the earth if all men were like you thered be an end of both our trades there would be no fighting and no soldiering no rogues and no magistrates to catch them the colonel wondered at his friends enthusiasm who was not used to be complimentary indeed what so usual with him as that simple act of gratitude and devotion about which his comrade spoke to him to ask a blessing for his boy was as natural to him as to wake with the sunrise or to go to rest when the day was over his first and his last thought was always the child  the two gentlemen were home in time enough to find clive dressed and his uncle arrived for breakfast the colonel said a grace over that meal the life was begun which he had longed and prayed for and the son smiling before his eyes who had been in his thoughts for so many fond years     chapter ix miss honeymans   in steyne gardens brighton the lodginghouses are among the most frequented in that city of lodginghouses these mansions have bowwindows in front bulging out with gentle prominences and ornamented with neat verandahs from which you can behold the tide of humankind as it flows up and down the steyne and that blue ocean over which britannia is said to rule stretching brightly away eastward and westward the chainpier as every body knows runs intrepidly into the sea which sometimes in fine weather bathes its feet with laughing wavelets and anon on stormy days dashes over its sides with roaring foam here for the sum of twopence you can go out to sea and pace this vast deck without need of a steward with a basin you can watch the sun setting in splendour over worthing or illuminating with its rising glories the ups and downs of rottingdean you see the citizen with his family inveigled into the shallops of the mercenary native mariner and fancy that the motion cannot be pleasant and how the hirer of the boat otium et oppidi laudat rura sui haply sighs for ease and prefers richmond or hampstead you behold a hundred bathingmachines put to sea and your naughty fancy depicts the beauties splashing under their white awnings along the rippled sands stay are they rippled

sleepless mariner has ventured forth to seize the delicate whiting the greedy and foolish mackerel and the homely sole hark to the twanging horn it is the early coach going out to london your eye follows it and rests on the pinnacles built by the beloved george see the wornout london roue pacing the pier inhaling the sea air and casting furtive glances under the bonnets of the pretty girls who trot here before lessons mark the bilious lawyer escaped for a day from pump court and sniffing the fresh breezes before he goes back to breakfast and a bag full of briefs at the albion see that pretty string of prattling schoolgirls from the chubbycheeked flaxenheaded little maiden just toddling by the side of the second teacher to the arch damsel of fifteen giggling and conscious of her beauty whom miss griffin the stern headgoverness awfully reproves see tomkins with a telescope and marine jacket young nathan and young abrams already bedizened in jewellery and rivalling the sun in

londoners ought to thank him for inventing brighton one of the best of physicians our city has ever known is kind cheerful merry doctor brighton hail thou purveyor of shrimps and honest prescriber of southdown mutton there is no mutton so good as brighton mutton no flys so pleasant as brighton flys nor any cliff so pleasant to ride on no shops so beautiful to look at as the brighton gimcrack shops and the fruit shops and the market i fancy myself in mrs honeymans lodgings in steyne gardens and in enjoyment of all these things  if the gracious reader has had losses in life losses not so bad as to cause absolute want or inflict upon him or her the bodily injury of starvation let him confess that the evils of this poverty are by no means so great as his timorous fancy depicted say your money has been invested in west diddlesex bonds or other luckless speculationsthe news of the smash comes you pay your outlying bills with the balance at the bankers you assemble your family and make them a fine speech the wife of your bosom goes round and embraces the sons and daughters seriatim nestling in your own waistcoat finally in possession of which she says with tender tears and fond quotations from holy writ god bless her and of the darlings round about lies all her worldly treasure the weeping servants are dismissed their wages paid in full and with a present of prayer and hymnbooks from their mistress your elegant house in harley street is to let and you subside into lodgings in pentonville or kensington or brompton how unlike the mansion where you paid taxes and distributed elegant hospitality for so many years  you subside into lodgings i say and you find yourself very tolerably comfortable i am not sure that in her heart your wife is not happier than in what she calls her happy days she will be somebody hereafter she was nobody in harley street that is everybody else in her visitingbook take the names all round was as good as she they had the very same entrees plated ware men to wait etc at all the houses where you visited in the street your candlesticks might be handsomer and indeed they had a very fine effect upon the dinnertable but then mr joness silver or electroplated dishes were much finer you had more carriages at your door on the evening of your delightful soirees than mrs brown there is no phrase more elegant and to my taste than that in which people are described as seeing a great deal of carriage company but yet mrs brown from the circumstance of her being a baronets niece took precedence of your dear wife at most tables hence the latter charming womans scorn at the british baronetcy and her many jokes at the order in a word and in the height of your social prosperity there was always a lurking dissatisfaction and a something bitter in the midst of the fountain of delights at which you were permitted to drink  there is no good unless your taste is that way in living in a society where you are merely the equal of everybody else many people give themselves extreme pains to frequent company where all around them are their superiors and where do what you will you must be subject to continual mortificationas for instance when marchioness x forgets you and you cant help thinking that she cuts you on purpose when duchess z passes by in her diamonds etc the true pleasure of life is to live with your inferiors be the cock of your village the queen of your coterie and besides very great persons the people whom fate has specially endowed with this kindly consolation are those who have seen what are called better daysthose who have had losses i am like caesar and of a noble mind if i cannot be first in piccadilly let me try hatton garden and see whether i cannot lead the ton there if i cannot take the lead at whites or the travellers let me be president of the jolly bandboys at the bag of nails and blackball everybody who does not pay me honour if my darling bessy cannot go out of a drawingroom until a baronets niece ha ha a baronets niece forsooth has walked before her let us frequent company where we shall be the first and how can we be the first unless we select our inferiors for our associates this kind of pleasure is to be had by almost everybody and at scarce any cost with a shillingsworth of tea and muffins you can get as much adulation and respect as many people cannot purchase with a thousand pounds worth of plate and profusion hired footmen turning their houses topsyturvy and suppers from gunters adulationwhy the people who come to you give as good parties as you do respectthe very menials who wait behind your suppertable waited at a dukes yesterday and actually patronise you o you silly spendthrift you can buy flattery for twopence and you spend ever so much money in entertaining your equals and betters and nobody admires you  now aunt honeyman was a woman of a thousand virtues cheerful frugal honest laborious charitable goodhumoured truthtelling devoted to her family capable of any sacrifice for those she loved and when she came to have losses of money fortune straightway compensated her by many kindnesses which no income can supply the good old lady admired the word gentlewoman of all others in the english vocabulary and made all around her feel that such was her rank her mothers father was a naval captain her father had taken pupils got a living sent his son to college dined with the squire published his volume of sermons was liked in his parish where miss honeyman kept house for him was respected for his kindness and famous for his port wine and so died leaving about two hundred pounds a year to his two children nothing to clive newcomes mother who had displeased him by her first marriage an elopement with ensign casey and subsequent light courses charles honeyman spent his money elegantly in wineparties at oxford and afterwards in foreign travelspent his money and as much of miss honeymans as that worthy soul would give him she was a woman of spirit and resolution she brought her furniture to brighton believing that the whole place still fondly remembered her grandfather captain nokes who had resided there and his gallantry in lord rodneys action with the count de grasse took a house and let the upper floors to lodgers  the little brisk old lady brought a maidservant out of the country with her who was daughter to her fathers clerk and had learned her letters and worked her first sampler under miss honeymans own eye whom she adored all through her life no indian begum rolling in wealth no countess mistress of castles and townhouses ever had such a faithful toady as hannah hicks was to her mistress under hannah was a young lady from the workhouse who called hannah mrs hicks mum and who bowed in awe as much before that domestic as hannah did before miss honeyman at five oclock in summer at seven in winter for miss honeyman a good economist was chary of candlelight hannah woke up little sally and these three women rose i leave you to imagine what a row there was in the establishment if sally appeared with flowers under her bonnet gave signs of levity or insubordination prolonged her absence when sent forth for the beer or was discovered in flirtation with the bakers boy or the grocers young man sally was frequently renewed miss honeyman called all her young persons sally and a great number of sallies were consumed in her house the qualities of the sally for the timebeing formed a constant and delightful subject of conversation between hannah and her mistress the few friends who visited miss honeyman in her backparlour had their sallies in discussing whose peculiarities of disposition these good ladies passed the hours agreeably over their tea  many persons who let lodgings in brighton have been servants themselvesare retired housekeepers tradesfolk and the like with these surrounding individuals hannah treated on a footing of equality bringing to her mistress accounts of their various goings on how no 6 was let how no 9 had not paid his rent again how the first floor at 27 had game almost every day and madedishes from muttons how the family who had taken mrs bugsbys had left as usual after the very first night the poor little infant blistered all over with bites on its little dear face how the miss learys was going on shameful with the two young men actially in their settingroom mum where one of them offered miss laura leary a cigar how mrs cribb still went cuttin pounds and pounds of meat off the lodgers jints emptying their teacaddies actially reading their letters sally had been told so by polly the cribbs maid who was kep how that poor child was kep hearing language perfectly hawful these tales and anecdotes not altogether redounding to their neighbours credit hannah copiously collected and brought to her mistresss teatable or served at her frugal little supper when miss honeyman the labours of the day over partook of that cheerful meal i need not say that such horrors as occurred at mrs bugsbys never befell in mrs honeymans establishment every room was fiercely swept and sprinkled and watched by cunning eyes which nothing could escape curtains were taken down mattresses explored every bone in bed dislocated and washed as soon as a lodger took his departure and as for cribbing meat or sugar sally might occasionally abstract a lump or two or pop a vealcutlet into her mouth while bringing the dishes downstairssallies wouldgiddy creatures bred in workhouses but hannah might be entrusted with untold gold and uncorked brandy and miss honeyman would as soon think of cutting a slice off hannahs nose and devouring it as of poaching on her lodgers mutton the best muttonbroth the best vealcutlets the best necks of mutton and french beans the best fried fish and plumpest partridges in all brighton were to be had at miss honeymansand for her favourites the best indian curry and rice coming from a distinguished relative at present an officer in bengal but very few were admitted to this mark of miss honeymans confidence if a family did not go to church they were not in favour if they went to a dissenting meeting she had no opinion of them at all once there came to her house a quiet staffordshire family who ate no meat on fridays and whom miss honeyman pitied as belonging to the romish superstition but when they were visited by two corpulent gentlemen in black one of whom wore a purple underwaistcoat before whom the staffordshire lady absolutely sank down on her knees as he went into the drawingroommiss honeyman sternly gave warning to these idolaters she would have no jesuits in her premises she showed hannah the picture in howells medulla of the martyrs burning at smithfield who said lord bless you mum and hoped it was a long time ago she called on the curate and many and many a time for years after pointed out to her friends and sometimes to her lodgers the spot on the carpet where the poor benighted creature had knelt down so she went on respected by all her friends by all her tradesmen by herself not a little talking of her previous misfortunes with amusing equanimity as if her fathers parsonagehouse had been a palace of splendour and the onehorse chaise with the lamps for evenings from which she had descended a noble equipage but i know it is for the best clive she would say to her nephew in describing those grandeurs and thank heaven can be resigned in that station in life to which it has pleased god to call me  the good lady was called the duchess by her fellowtradesfolk in the square in which she lived i dont know what would have come to her had she been told she was a tradeswoman her butchers bakers and marketpeople paid her as much respect as though she had been a grandees housekeeper out of kemp town knowing her station she yet was kind to those inferior beings she held affable conversations with them she patronised mr rogers who was said to be worth a hundred thousandtwohundredthousand pounds or lbs was it and who said law bless the old duchess she do make as much of a pound of veal cutlet as some would of a score of bullocks but you see shes a lady born and a lady bred shed die before shed owe a farden and shes seen better days you know she went to see the grocers wife on an interesting occasion and won the heart of the family by tasting their candle her fishmonger it was fine to hear her talk of my fishmonger would sell her a whiting as respectfully as if she had called for a dozen turbots and lobsters it was believed by those good folks that her father had been a bishop at the very least and the better days which she had known were supposed to signify some almost unearthly prosperity i have always found hannah the simple soul would say that people know their place or can be very very easily made to find it if they lose it and if a gentlewoman does not forget herself her inferiors will not forget that she is a gentlewoman no indeed mum and im sure they would do no such thing mum says hannah who carries away the teapot for her own breakfast to be transmitted to sally for her subsequent refection whilst her mistress washes her cup and saucer as her mother had washed her own china many scores of years ago  if some of the surrounding lodginghouse keepers as i have no doubt they did disliked the little duchess for the airs which she gave herself as they averred they must have envied her too her superior prosperity for there was scarcely ever a card in her window whilst those ensigns in her neighbours houses would remain exposed to the flies and the weather and disregarded by passersby for months together she had many regular customers or what should be rather called constant friends deaf old mr cricklade came every winter for fourteen years and stopped until the hunting was over an invaluable man giving little trouble passing all day on horseback and all night over his rubber at the club the misses barkham barkhambury tunbridge wells whose father had been at college with mr honeyman came regularly in june for sea air letting barkhambury for the summer season then for many years she had her nephew as we have seen and kind recommendations from the clergymen of brighton and a constant friend in the celebrated dr goodenough of london who had been her fathers private pupil and of his college afterwards who sent his patients from time to time down to her and his fellowphysician dr h who on his part would never take any fee from miss honeyman except a packet of india currypowder a ham cured as she only knew how to cure them and once a year or so a dish of her tea  was there ever such luck as that confounded old duchesss says mr gawler coalmerchant and lodginghouse keeper next door but two whose apartments were more odious in some respects than mrs bugsbys own was there ever such devils own luck mrs g its only a fortnight ago as i read in the sussex advertiser the death of miss barkham of barkhambury tunbridge wells and thinks i theres a spoke in your wheel you stuckup little old duchess with your cussed airs and impudence and she aint put her card up three days and look yere yeres two carriages two maids three children one of them wrapped up in a hinjar shawlman hout a liverylooks like a foring cove i thinklady in satin pelisse and of course they go to the duchess be hanged to her of course its our luck nothing ever was like our luck im blowed if i dont put a pistol to my ead and end it mrs g there they go inthree four six seven on em and the man thats the precious childs physic i suppose hes acarryin in the basket just look at the luggage i say theres a bloody hand on the first carriage its a baronet is it i ope your ladyships very well and i ope sir john will soon be down yere to join his family mr gawler makes sarcastic bows over the card in his bowwindow whilst making this speech the little gawlers rush on to the drawingroom verandah themselves to examine the new arrivals  this is mrs honeymans asks the gentleman designated by mr gawler as the foring cove and hands in a card on which the words miss honeyman 110 steyne gardens j goodenough are written in that celebrated physicians handwriting we want five betrooms six bets two or dree sittingrooms have you got dese  will you speak to my mistress says hannah and if it is a fact that miss honeyman does happen to be in the front parlour looking at the carriages what harm is there in the circumstance pray is not gawler looking and the people next door are not half a dozen little boys already gathered in the street as if they started up out of the trapdoors for the coals and the nursery maids in the stunted little garden are not they looking through the bars of the square please to speak to mistress says hannah opening the parlourdoor and with a curtsey a gentleman about the apartments mum  five betrooms says the man entering six bets two or dree sittingrooms we gome from dr goodenough  are the apartments for you sir says the little duchess looking up at the large gentleman  for my lady answers the man  had you not better take off your hat asks the duchess pointing out of one of her little mittens to the foring coves beaver which he has neglected to remove  the man grins and takes off the hat i beck your bardon maam says he have you fife betrooms etc the doctor has cured the german of an illness as well as his employers and especially recommended miss honeyman to mr kuhn  i have such a number of apartments my servant will show them to you and she walks back with great state to her chair by the window and resumes her station and work there  mr kuhn reports to his mistress who descends to inspect the apartments accompanied through them by hannah the rooms are pronounced to be exceedingly neat and pleasant and exactly what are wanted for the family the baggage is forthwith ordered to be brought from the carriages the little invalid wrapped in his shawl is brought upstairs by the affectionate mr kuhn who carries him as gently as if he had been bred all his life to nurse babies the smiling sally the sally for the timebeing happens to be a very fresh pinkcheeked pretty little sally emerges from the kitchen and introduces the young ladies the governess the maids to their apartments the eldest a slim blackhaired young lass of thirteen frisks about the rooms looks at all the pictures runs in and out of the verandah tries the piano and bursts out laughing at its wheezy jingle it had been poor emmas piano bought for her on her seventeenth birthday three weeks before she ran away with the ensign her music is still in the stand by it the rev charles honeyman has warbled sacred melodies over it and miss honeyman considers it a delightful instrument kisses her languid little brother laid on the sofa and performs a hundred gay and agile motions suited to her age  oh what a piano why it is as cracked as miss quigleys voice  my dear says mamma the little languid boy bursts out into a jolly laugh  what funny pictures mamma action with count de grasse the death of general wolfe a portrait of an officer an old officer in blue like grandpapa brazen nose college oxford what a funny name  at the idea of brazen nose college another laugh comes from the invalid i suppose theyve all got brass noses there he says and explodes at this joke the poor little laugh ends in a cough and mammas travellingbasket which contains everything produces a bottle of syrup labelled master a newcome a teaspoonful to be taken when the cough is troublesome  oh the delightful sea the blue the fresh the ever free sings the young lady with a shake i suppose the maritime song from which she quoted was just written at this time how much better this is than going home and seeing those horrid factories and chimneys i love doctor goodenough for sending us here what a sweet house it is everybody is happy in it even miss quigley is happy mamma what nice rooms what pretty chintz what aoh what acomfortable sofa and she falls down on the sofa which truth to say was the rev charles honeymans luxurious sofa from oxford presented to him by young cibber wright of christchurch when that gentlemancommoner was eliminated from the university  the person of the house mamma says hardly comes up to dr goodenoughs description of her he says he remembers her a pretty little woman when her father was his private tutor  she has grown very much since says the girl and an explosion takes place from the sofa where the little man is always ready to laugh at any joke or anything like a joke uttered by himself or by any of his family or friends as for doctor goodenough he says laughing has saved that boys life  she looks quite like a maid continues the lady she has hard hands and she called me mum always i was quite disappointed in her and she subsides into a novel with many of which kind of works and with other volumes and with workboxes and with wonderful inkstands portfolios portable days of the month scentbottles scissorcases gilt miniature easels displaying portraits and countless gimcracks of travel the rapid kuhn has covered the tables in the twinkling of an eye  the person supposed to be the landlady enters the room at this juncture and the lady rises to receive her the little wag on the sofa puts his arm round his sisters neck and whispers i say eth isnt she a pretty girl i shall write to doctor goodenough and tell him how much shes grown convulsions follow this sally to the surprise of hannah who says pooty little dearwhat time will he have his dinner mum  thank you mrs honeyman at two oclock says the lady with a bow of her head there is a clergyman of your name in london is he a relation the lady in her turn is astonished for the tall person breaks out into a grin and says law mum youre speakin of master charles hes in london  indeedof master charles  and you take me for missis mum i beg your pardon mum cries hannah the invalid hits his sister in the side with a weak little fist if laughter can cure salva est res doctor goodenoughs patient is safe master charles is mississ brother mum ive got no brother mumnever had no brother only one son whos in the police mum thank you and law bless me i was going to forget if you please mum missis says if you are quite rested she will pay her duty to you mum  oh indeed says the lady rather stiffly and taking this for an acceptance of her mistresss visit hannah retires  this miss honeyman seems to be a great personage says the lady if people let lodgings why do they give themselves such airs  we never saw monsieur de boigne at boulogne mamma interposes the girl  monsieur de boigne my dear ethel monsieur de boigne is very well but here the door opens and in a large cap bristling with ribbons with her best chestnut front and her best black silk gown on which her gold watch shines very splendidly little miss honeyman makes her appearance and a dignified curtsey to her lodger  that lady vouchsafes a very slight inclination of the head indeed which she repeats when miss honeyman says i am glad to hear your ladyship is pleased with the apartments  yes they will do very well thank you answers the latter person gravely  and they have such a beautiful view of the sea cries ethel  as if all the houses hadnt a view of the sea ethel the price has been arranged i think my servants will require a comfortable room to dine inby themselves maam if you please my governess and the younger children will dine together my daughter dines with meand my little boys dinner will be ready at two oclock precisely if you please it is now near one  am i to understand interposed miss honeyman  oh i have no doubt we shall understand each other maam cried lady anne newcome whose noble presence the acute reader has no doubt ere this divined and saluted doctor goodenough has given me a most satisfactory account of youmore satisfactory perhaps thanthan you are aware of perhaps lady annes sentence was not going to end in a very satisfactory way for miss honeyman but awed by a peculiar look of resolution in the little lady her lodger of an hour paused in whatever offensive remark she might have been about to make it is as well that i at last have the pleasure of seeing you that i may state what i want and that we may as you say understand each other breakfast and tea if you please will be served in the same manner as dinner and you will have the kindness to order fresh milk every morning for my little boyasss milkdoctor goodenough has ordered asss milk anything further i want i will communicate through the person who spoke to youkuhn mr kuhn and that will do  a heavy shower of rain was descending at this moment and little mrs honeyman looking at her lodger who had sate down and taken up her book said have your ladyships servants unpacked your trunks  what on earth madam have youhas that to do with the question  they will be put to the trouble of packing again i fear i cannot providethree times five are fifteenfifteen separate meals for seven personsbesides those of my own family if your servants cannot eat with mine or in my kitchen they and their mistress must go elsewhere and the sooner the better madam the sooner the better says mrs honeyman trembling with indignation and sitting down in a chair spreading her silks  do you know who i am asks lady anne rising  perfectly well madam says the other and had i known you should never have come into my house thats more  madam cries the lady on which the poor little invalid scared and nervous and hungry for his dinner began to cry from his sofa  it will be a pity that the dear little boy should be disturbed dear little child i have often heard of him and of you miss says the little householder rising i will get you some dinner my dear for clives sake and meanwhile your ladyship will have the kindness to seek for some other apartmentsfor not a bit shall my fire cook for any one else of your company and with this the indignant little landlady sailed out of the room  gracious goodness who is the woman cries lady anne i never was so insulted in my life  oh mamma it was you began says downright ethel that ishush alfred dearhush my darling  oh it was mamma began im so hungry im so hungry howled the little man on the sofaor off it ratherfor he was now down on the ground kicking away the shawls which enveloped him  what is it my boy what is it my blessed darling you shall have your dinner give her all ethel there are the keys of my desktheres my watchthere are my rings let her take my all the monster the child must live it cant go away in such a storm as this give me a cloak a parasol anythingill go forth and get a lodging ill

out noits not nice its naaasty i wont have syrup i will have dinner the mother whose embraces the child repelled with infantine kicks plunged madly at the bells rang them all four vehemently and ran downstairs towards the parlour whence miss honeyman was issuing  the good lady had not at first known the names of her lodgers but had taken them in willingly enough on dr goodenoughs recommendation and it was not until one of the nurses entrusted with the care of master alfreds dinner informed miss honeyman of the name of her guest that she knew she was entertaining lady anne newcome and that the pretty girl was the fair miss ethel the little sick boy the little alfred of whom his cousin spoke and of whom clive had made a hundred little drawings in his rude way as he drew everybody then bidding sally run off to st jamess street for a chickenshe saw it put on the spit and prepared a bread sauce and composed a batterpudding as she only knew how to make batterpuddings then she went to array herself in her best clothes as we have seenas we have heard rather goodness forbid that we should see miss honeyman arraying herself or penetrate that chaste mystery her toilettethen she came to wait upon lady anne not a little flurried as to the result of that queer interview then she whisked out of the drawingroom as before has been shown and finding the chicken roasted to a turn the napkin and tray ready spread by hannah the neathanded she was bearing them up to the little patient when the frantic parent met her on the stair  is itis it for my child cried lady anne reeling against the bannister  yes its for the child says miss honeyman tossing up her head but nobody else has anything in the house  god bless yougod bless you a mothers bllessings go with you gurgled the lady who was not it must be confessed a woman of strong moral character  it was good to see the little man eating the fowl ethel who had never cut anything in her young existence except her fingers now and then with her brothers and her governesss penknives bethought her of asking miss honeyman to carve the chicken lady anne with clasped hands and streaming eyes sate looking on at the ravishing scene  why did you not let us know you were clives aunt ethel asked putting out her hand the old lady took hers very kindly and said because you didnt give me time and do you love clive my dear  the reconciliation between miss honeyman and her lodger was perfect lady anne wrote a quire of notepaper off to sir brian for that days postonly she was too late as she always was mr kuhn perfectly delighted miss honeyman that evening by his droll sayings jokes and pronunciation and by his praises of master glife as he called him he lived out of the house did everything for everybody was never out of the way when wanted and never in the way when not wanted ere long miss honeyman got out a bottle of the famous madeira which her colonel sent her and treated him to a glass in her own room kuhn smacked his lips and held out the glass again the honest rogue knew good wine     chapter x ethel and her relations   for fourandtwenty successive hours lady anne newcome was perfectly in raptures with her new lodgings and every person and thing which they contained the drawingrooms were fitted with the greatest taste the dinner was exquisite were there ever such delicious vealcutlets such verdant french beans why do we have those odious french cooks my dear with their shocking principlesthe principles of all frenchmen are shockingand the dreadful bills they bring us in and their consequential airs and graces i am determined to part with brignol i have written to your father this evening to give brignol warning when did he ever give us vealcutlets what can be nicer  indeed they were very good said miss ethel who had mutton five times a week at one oclock i am so glad you like the house and clive and mrs honeyman  like her the dear little old woman i feel as if she had been my friend all my life i feel quite drawn towards her what a wonderful coincidence that dr goodenough should direct us to this very house i have written to your father about it and to think that i should have written to clive at this very house and quite forgotten mrs honeymans nameand such an odd name too i forget everything everything you know i forgot your aunt louisas husbands name and when i was godmother to her baby and the clergyman said what is the infants name i said really i forget and so i did he was a london clergyman but i forget at what church suppose it should be this very mr honeyman it may have been you know and then the coincidence would be still more droll that tall old nicelooking respectable person with a mark on her nose the housekeeperwhat is her nameseems a most invaluable person i think i shall ask her to come to us i am sure she would save me i dont know how much money every week and i am certain mrs trotter is making a fortune by us i shall write to your papa and ask him permission to ask this person ethels mother was constantly falling in love with her new acquaintances their manservants and their maidservants their horses and ponies and the visitor within their gates she would ask strangers to newcome hug and embrace them on sunday not speak to them on monday and on tuesday behave so rudely to them that they were gone before wednesday her daughter had had so many governessesall darlings during the first week and monsters afterwardsthat the poor child possessed none of the accomplishments of her age she could not play on the piano she could not speak french well she could not tell you when gunpowder was invented she had not the faintest idea of the date of the norman conquest or whether the earth went round the sun or vice versa she did not know the number of counties in england scotland and wales let alone ireland she did not know the difference between latitude and longitude she had had so many governesses their accounts differed poor ethel was bewildered by a multiplicity of teachers and thought herself a monster of ignorance they gave her a book at a sunday school and little girls of eight years old answered questions of which she knew nothing the place swam before her she could not see the sun shining on their fair flaxen heads and pretty faces the rosy little children holding up their eager hands and crying the answer to this question and that seemed mocking her she seemed to read in the book o ethel you dunce dunce dunce she went home silent in the carriage and burst into bitter tears on her bed naturally a haughty girl of the highest spirit resolute and imperious this little visit to the parish school taught ethel lessons more valuable than ever so much arithmetic and geography clive has told me a story of her in her youth which perhaps may apply to some others of the youthful female aristocracy she used to walk with other select young ladies and gentlemen their nurses and governesses in a certain reserved plot of ground railed off from hyde park whereof some of the lucky dwellers in the neighbourhood of apsley house have a key in this garden at the age of nine or thereabout she had contracted an intimate friendship with the lord hercules oryanas every one of my gentle readers knows one of the sons of the marquis of ballyshannon the lord hercules was a year younger than miss ethel newcome which may account for the passion which grew up between these young persons it being a provision in nature that a boy always falls in love with a girl older than himself or rather perhaps that a girl bestows her affections on a little boy who submits to receive them  one day sir brian newcome announced his intention to go to newcome that very morning taking his family and of course ethel with him she was inconsolable what will lord hercules do when he finds i am gone she asked of her nurse  the nurse endeavouring to soothe her said perhaps his lordship would know nothing about the circumstance he will said miss ethelhell read it in the newspaper my lord hercules it is to be hoped strangled this infant passion in the cradle having long since married isabella only daughter of  grains esq of drayton windsor a partner in the great brewery of foker and co  when ethel was thirteen years old she had grown to be such a tall girl that she overtopped her companions by a head or more and morally perhaps also felt herself too tall for their society fancy myself she thought dressing a doll like lily putland or wearing a pinafore like lucy tucker she did not care for their sports she could not walk with them it seemed as if every one stared nor dance with them at the academy nor attend the cours de litterature universelle et de science comprehensive of the professor then the modethe smallest girls took her up in the class she was bewildered by the multitude of things they bade her learn at the youthful little assemblies of her sex when under the guide of their respected governesses the girls came to tea at six oclock dancing charades and so forth ethel herded not with the children of her own age nor yet with the teachers who sit apart at these assemblies imparting to each other their little wrongs but ethel romped with the little childrenthe rosy little trotsand took them on her knees and told them a thousand stories by these she was adored and loved like a mother almost for as such the hearty kindly girl showed herself to them but at home she was alone farouche and intractable and did battle with the governesses and overcame them one after another i break the promise of a former page and am obliged to describe the youthful days of more than one person who is to take a share in this story not always doth the writer know whither the divine muse leadeth him but of this be sureshe is as inexorable as truth we must tell our tale as she imparts it to us and go on or turn aside at her bidding  here she ordains that we should speak of other members of the family whose history we chronicle and it behoves us to say a word regarding the earl of kew the head of the noble house into which sir brian newcome had married  when we read in the fairy stories that the king and queen who lived once upon a time build a castle of steel defended by moats and sentinels innumerable in which they place their darling only child the prince or princess whose birth has blessed them after so many years of marriage and whose christening feast has been interrupted by the cantankerous humour of that notorious old fairy who always persists in coming although she has not received any invitation to the baptismal ceremony when prince prettyman is locked up in the steel tower provided only with the most wholesome food the most edifying educational works and the most venerable old tutor to instruct and to bore him we know as a matter of course that the steel bolts and brazen bars one day will be of no avail the old tutor will go off in a doze and the moats and drawbridges will either be passed by his royal highnesss implacable enemies or crossed by the young scapegrace himself who is determined to outwit his guardians and see the wicked world the old king and queen always come in and find the chambers empty the saucy heirapparent flown the porter and sentinels drunk the ancient tutor asleep they tear their venerable wigs in anguish they kick the majordomo downstairs they turn the duenna out of doorsthe toothless old dragon there is no resisting fate the princess will slip out of window by the ropeladder the prince will be off to pursue his pleasures and sow his wild oats at the appointed season how many of our english princes have been coddled at home by their fond papas and mammas walled up in inaccessible castles with a tutor and a library guarded by cordons of sentinels sermoners old aunts old women from the world without and have nevertheless escaped from all these guardians and astonished the world by their extravagance and their frolics what a wild rogue was that prince harry son of the austere sovereign who robbed richard the second of his crownthe youth who took purses on gadshill frequented eastcheap taverns with colonel falstaff and worse company and boxed chief justice gascoignes ears what must have been the venerable queen charlottes state of mind when she heard of the courses of her beautiful young prince of his punting at gamblingtables of his dealings with horsejockeys of his awful doings with perdita besides instances taken from our royal family could we not draw examples from our respected nobility there was that young lord warwick mr addisons stepson we know that his mother was severe and his stepfather a most eloquent moralist yet the young gentlemans career was shocking positively shocking he boxed the watch he fuddled himself at taverns he was no better than a mohock the chronicles of that day contain accounts of many a mad prank which he played as we have legends of a still earlier date of the lawless freaks of the wild prince and poins our people has never looked very unkindly on these frolics a young nobleman full of life and spirits generous of his money jovial in his humour ready with his sword frank handsome prodigal courageous always finds favour young scapegrace rides a steeplechase or beats a bargeman and the crowd applauds him sages and seniors shake their heads and look at him not unkindly even stern old female moralists are disarmed at the sight of youth and gallantry and beauty i know very well that charles surface is a sad dog and tom jones no better than he should be but in spite of such critics as dr johnson and colonel newcome most of us have a sneaking regard for honest tom and hope sophia will be happy and tom will end well at last  fiveandtwenty years ago the young earl of kew came upon the town which speedily rang with the feats of his lordship he began life time enough to enjoy certain pleasures from which our young aristocracy of the present day seem alas to be cut off so much more peaceable and polished do we grow so much does the spirit of the age appear to equalise all ranks so strongly has the good sense of society to which in the end gentlemen of the very highest fashion must bow put its veto upon practices and amusements with which our fathers were familiar at that time the sunday newspapers contained many and many exciting reports of boxingmatches bruising was considered a fine manly old english custom boys at public schools fondly perused histories of the noble science from the redoubtable days of broughton and slack to the heroic times of dutch sam and the game chicken young gentlemen went eagerly to moulsey to see the slasher punch the pets head or the negro beat the jews nose to a jelly the island rang as yet with the tooting horns and rattling teams of mailcoaches a gay sight was the road in merry england in those days before steamengines arose and flung its hostelry and chivalry over to travel in coaches to drive coaches to know coachmen and guards to be familiar with inns along the road to laugh with the jolly hostess in the bar to chuck the pretty chambermaid under the chin were the delight of men who were young not very long ago who ever thought of writing to the times then biffin i warrant did not grudge his money and a thirsty soul paid cheerfully for his drink the road was an institution the ring was an institution men rallied round them and not without a kind conservatism expatiated upon the benefits with which they endowed the country and the evils which would occur when they should be no moredecay of english spirit decay of manly pluck ruin of the breed of horses and so forth and so forth to give and take a black eye was not unusual nor derogatory in a gentleman to drive a stagecoach the enjoyment the emulation of generous youth is there any young fellow of the present time who aspires to take the place of a stoker you see occasionally in hyde park one dismal old drag with a lonely driver where are you charioteers where are you o rattling quicksilver o swift defiance you are passed by racers stronger and swifter than you your lamps are out and the music of your horns has died away  just at the ending of that old time lord kews life began that kindly middleaged gentleman whom his county knows that good landlord and friend of all his tenantry round about that builder of churches and indefatigable visitor of schools that writer of letters to the farmers of his shire so full of sense and benevolence who wins prizes at agricultural shows and even lectures at county town institutes in his modest pleasant way was the wild young lord kew of a quarter of a century back who kept racehorses patronised boxers fought a duel thrashed a life guardsman gambled furiously at crockfords and did who knows what besides  his mother a devout lady nursed her son and his property carefully during the young gentlemans minority keeping him and his younger brother away from all mischief under the eyes of the most careful pastors and masters she learnt latin with the boys she taught them to play on the piano she enraged old lady kew the childrens grandmother who prophesied that her daughterinlaw would make milksops of her sons to whom the old lady was never reconciled until after my lords entry at christchurch where he began to distinguish himself very soon after his first term he drove tandems kept hunters gave dinners scandalised the dean screwed up the tutors door and agonised his mother at home by his lawless proceedings he quitted the university after a very brief sojourn at that seat of learning it may be the oxford authorities requested his lordship to retire let bygones be bygones his youthful son the present lord walham is now at christchurch reading with the greatest assiduity let us not be too particular in narrating his fathers unedifying frolics of a quarter of a century ago  old lady kew who in conjunction with mrs newcome had made the marriage between mr brian newcome and her daughter always despised her soninlaw and being a frank open person uttering her mind always took little pains to conceal her opinion regarding him or any other individual sir brian newcome she would say is one of the most stupid and respectable of men anne is clever but has not a grain of common sense they make a very well assorted couple her flightiness would have driven any man crazy who had an opinion of his own she would have ruined any poor man of her own rank as it is i have given her a husband exactly suited for her he pays the bills does not see how absurd she is keeps order in the establishment and checks her follies she wanted to marry her cousin tom poyntz when they were both very young and proposed to die of a broken heart when i arranged her match with mr newcome a broken fiddlestick she would have ruined tom poyntz in a year and has no more idea of the cost of a leg of mutton than i have of algebra  the countess of kew loved brighton and preferred living there even at the season when londoners find such especial charms in their own city london after easter the old lady said was intolerable pleasure becomes a business then so oppressive that all good company is destroyed by it half the men are sick with the feasts which they eat day after day the women are thinking of the halfdozen parties they have to go to in the course of the night the young girls are thinking of their partners and their toilettes intimacy becomes impossible and quiet enjoyment of life on the other hand the crowd of bourgeois has not invaded brighton the drive is not blocked up by flys full of stockbrokers wives and children and you can take the air in your chair upon the chainpier without being stifled by the cigars of the odious shopboys from london so lady kews name was usually amongst the earliest which the brighton newspapers recorded amongst the arrivals  her only unmarried daughter lady julia lived with her ladyship poor lady julia had suffered early from a spine disease which had kept her for many years to her couch being always at home and under her mothers eyes she was the old ladys victim her pincushion into which lady kew plunged a hundred little points of sarcasm daily as children are sometimes brought before magistrates and their poor little backs and shoulders laid bare covered with bruises and lashes which brutal parents have inflicted so i dare say if there had been any tribunal or judge before whom this poor patient ladys heart could have been exposed it would have been found scarred all over with numberless ancient wounds and bleeding from yesterdays castigation old lady kews tongue was a dreadful thong which made numbers of people wince she was not altogether cruel but she knew the dexterity with which she wielded her lash and liked to exercise it poor lady julia was always at hand when her mother was minded to try her powers  lady kew had just made herself comfortable at brighton when her little grandsons illness brought lady anne newcome and her family down to the sea lady kew was almost scared back to london again or blown over the water to dieppe she had never had the measles why did not anne carry the child to some other place julia you will on no account go and see that little pestiferous swarm of newcomes unless you want to send me out of the worldwhich i dare say you do for i am a dreadful plague to you i know and my death would be a release to you  you see doctor h who visits the child every day cries poor pincushion you are not afraid when he comes  doctor h doctor h comes to cure me or to tell me the news or to flatter me or to feel my pulse and to pretend to prescribe or to take his guinea of course dr h must go to see all sorts of people in all sorts of diseases you would not have me be such a brute as to order him not to attend my own grandson i forbid you to go to annes house you will send one of the men every day to inquire let the groom goyes charleshe will not go into the house he will ring the bell and wait outside he had better ring the bell at the areai suppose there is an areaand speak to the servants through the bars and bring us word how alfred is poor pincushion felt fresh compunctions she had met the children and kissed the baby and held kind ethels hand in hers that day as she was out in her chair there was no use however to make this confession is she the only good woman or man of whom domestic tyranny has made a hypocrite  charles the groom brings back perfectly favourable reports of master alfreds health that day which doctor h in the course of his visit confirms the child is getting well rapidly eating like a little ogre his cousin lord kew has been to see him he is the kindest of men lord kew he brought the little man tom and jerry with the pictures the boy is delighted with the pictures  why has not kew come to see me when did he come write him a note and send for him instantly julia did you know he was here  julia says that she had but that moment read in the brighton papers the arrival of the earl of kew and the honourable j belsize at the albion  i am sure they are here for some mischief cries the old lady delighted whenever george and john belsize are together i know there is some wickedness planning what do you know doctor i see by your face you know something do tell it me that i may write it to his odious psalmsinging mother  doctor hs face does indeed wear a knowing look he simpers and says i did see lord kew driving this morning first with the honourable mr belsize and afterwardshere he glances towards lady julia as if to say before an unmarried lady i do not like to tell your ladyship with whom i saw lord kew driving after he had left the honourable mr belsize who went to play a match with captain huxtable at tennis  are you afraid to speak before julia cries the elder lady why bless my soul she is forty years old and has heard everything that can be heard tell me about kew this instant doctor h  the doctor blandly acknowledges that lord kew had been driving madame pozzoprofondo the famous contralto of the italian opera in his phaeton for two hours in the face of all brighton  yes doctor interposes lady julia blushing but signor pozzoprofondo was in the carriage tooaasitting behind with the groom he was indeed mamma  julia vous netes quune panache says lady kew shrugging her shoulders and looking at her daughter from under her bushy black eyebrows her ladyship a sister of the late lamented marquis of steyne possessed no small share of the wit and intelligence and a considerable resemblance to the features of that distinguished nobleman  lady kew bids her daughter take a pen and writemonsieur le mauvais sujetgentlemen who wish to take the sea air in private or to avoid their relations had best go to other places than brighton where their names are printed in the newspapers if you are not drowned in a pozzo  mamma interposes the secretary  in a pozzoprofondo you will please come to dine with two old women at halfpast seven you may bring mr belsize and must tell us a hundred storiesyours etc l kew  julia wrote all the letter as her mother dictated it save only one sentence and the note was sealed and despatched to my lord kew who came to dinner with jack belsize jack belsize liked to dine with lady kew he said she was an old dear and the wickedest old woman in all england and he liked to dine with lady julia who was a poor suffering dear and the best woman in all england jack belsize liked every one and every one liked him  two evenings afterwards the young men repeated their visit to lady kew and this time lord kew was loud in praises of his cousins of the house of newcome  not of the eldest barnes surely my dear cries lady kew  no confound him not barnes  no d it not barnes i beg your pardon lady julia broke in jack belsize i can get on with most men but that little barney is too odious a little snob  a little whatmr belsize  a little snob maam i have no other word though he is your grandson i never heard him say a good word of any mortal soul or do a kind action  thank you mr belsize says the lady  but the others are capital there is that little chap who has just had the measleshes a clear little brick and as for miss ethel  ethel is a trump maam says lord kew slapping his hand on his knee  ethel is a brick and alfred is a trump i think you say remarks lady kew nodding approval and barnes is a snob this is very satisfactory to know  we met the children out today cries the enthusiastic kew as i was driving jack in the drag and i got out and talked to em  governess an uncommonly nice womanoldish buti beg your pardon lady julia cries the inopportune jack belsizeim always putting my foot in it  putting your foot into what go on kew  well we met the whole posse of children and the little fellow wanted a drive and i said i would drive him and ethel too if she would come upon my word she is as pretty a girl as you can see on a summers day and the governess said no of course governesses always do but i said i was her uncle and jack paid her such a fine compliment that the young woman was mollified and the children took their seats beside me and jack went behind  where monsieur pozzoprofondo sits bon  we drove on to the downs and we were nearly coming to grief my horses are young and when they get on the grass they are as if they were mad it was very wrong i know it was  dd rash interposes jack he had nearly broken all our necks  and my brother frank would have been lord kew continued the young earl with a quiet smile what an escape for him the horses ran awayever so farand i thought the carriage must upset the poor little boy who has lost his pluck in the fever began to cry but that young girl though she was as white as a sheet never gave up for a moment and sate in her place like a man we met nothing luckily and i pulled the horses in after a mile or two and i drove em into brighton as quiet as if i had been driving a hearse and that little trump of an ethel what do you think she said she said i was not frightened but you must not tell mamma my aunt it appears was in a dreadful commotioni ought to have thought of that  lady anne is a ridiculous old dear i beg your pardon lady kew here breaks in jack the apologiser  there is a brother of sir brian newcomes staying with them lord kew proceeds an east india colonela very finelooking old boy  smokes awfully row about it in the hotel go on kew beg your  this gentleman was on the lookout for us it appears for when we came in sight he despatched a boy who was with him running like a lamplighter back to my aunt to say all was well and he took little alfred out of the carriage and then helped out ethel and said my dear you are too pretty to scold but you have given us all a belle peur and then he made me and jack a low bow and stalked into the lodgings  i think you do deserve to be whipped both of you cries lady kew  we went up and made our peace with my aunt and were presented in form to the colonel and his youthful cub  as fine a fellow as ever i saw and as fine a boy as ever i saw cries jack belsize the young chap is a great hand at drawingupon my life the best drawings i ever saw and he was making a picture for little whatdyoucallem and miss newcome was looking over them and lady anne pointed out the group to me and said how pretty it was she is uncommonly sentimental you know lady anne  my daughter anne is the greatest fool in the three kingdoms cried lady kew looking fiercely over her spectacles and julia was instructed to write that night to her sister and desire that ethel should be sent to see her grandmotherethel who rebelled against her grandmother and always fought on her aunt julias side when the weaker was oppressed by the older and stronger lady     chapter xi at mrs ridleys   saint peter of alcantara as i have read in a life of st theresa informed that devout lady that he had passed forty years of his life sleeping only an hour and a half each day his cell was but four feet and a half long so that he never lay down his pillow was a wooden log in the stone wall he ate but once in three days he was for three years in a convent of his order without knowing any one of his brethren except by the sound of their voices for he never during this period took his eyes off the ground he always walked barefoot and was but skin and bone when he died the eating only once in three days so he told his sister saint was by no means impossible if you began the regimen in your youth to conquer sleep was the hardest of all austerities which he practisedi fancy the pious individual so employed day after day night after night on his knees or standing up in devout meditation in the cupboardhis dwellingplace bareheaded and barefooted walking over rocks briars mud sharp stones picking out the very worst places let us trust with his downcast eyes under the bitter snow or the drifting rain or the scorching sunshinei fancy saint peter of alcantara and contrast him with such a personage as the incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel mayfair  his hermitage is situated in walpole street let us say on the second floor of a quiet mansion let out to hermits by a noblemans butler whose wife takes care of the lodgings his cells consist of a refectory a dormitory and an adjacent oratory where he keeps his showerbath and bootsthe pretty boots trimly stretched on boottrees and blacked to a nicety not varnished by the boy who waits on him the barefooted business may suit superstitious ages and gentlemen of alcantara but does not become mayfair and the nineteenth century if st pedro walked the earth now with his eyes to the ground he would know fashionable divines by the way in which they were shod charles honeymans is a sweet foot i have no doubt as delicate and plump and rosy as the white hand with its two rings which he passes in impassioned moments through his slender flaxen hair  a sweet odour pervades his sleeping apartmentnot that peculiar and delicious fragrance with which the saints of the roman church are said to gratify the neighbourhood where they reposebut oils redolent of the richest perfumes of macassar essences from truefitts or delcroixs into which a thousand flowers have expressed their sweetest breath await his meek head on rising and infuse the pockethandkerchief with which he dries and draws so many tears for he cries a good deal in his sermons to which the ladies about him contribute showers of sympathy  by his bedside are slippers lined with blue silk and worked of an ecclesiastical pattern by some of the faithful who sit at his feet they come to him in anonymous parcels they come to him in silver paper boys in buttons pages who minister to female grace leave them at the door for the rev c honeyman and slip away without a word purses are sent to himpenwipersa portfolio with the honeyman arms yea braces have been known to reach him by the post in his days of popularity and flowers and grapes and jelly when he was ill and throat comforters and lozenges for his dear bronchitis in one of his drawers is the rich silk cassock presented to him by his congregation at leatherhead when the young curate quitted that parish for london duty and on his breakfasttable the silver teapot once filled with sovereigns and presented by the same devotees the devoteapot he has but the sovereigns where are they  what a different life this is from our honest friend of alcantara who eats once in three days at one time if honeyman could have drunk tea three times in an evening he might have had it the glass on his chimneypiece is crowded with invitations not merely cards of ceremony of which there are plenty but dear little confidential notes from sweet friends of his congregation ob dear mr honeyman writes blanche what a sermon that was i cannot go to bed tonight without thanking you for it do do dear mr honeyman writes beatrice lend me that delightful sermon and can you come and drink tea with me and selina and my aunt papa and mamma dine out but you know i am always your faithful chesterfield street and so on he has all the domestic accomplishments he plays on the violoncello he sings a delicious second not only in sacred but in secular music he has a thousand anecdotes laughable riddles droll stories of the utmost correctness you understand with which he entertains females of all ages suiting his conversation to stately matrons deaf old dowagers who can hear his clear voice better than the loudest roar of their stupid sonsinlaw mature spinsters young beauties dancing through the season even rosy little slips out of the nursery who cluster round his beloved feet societies fight for him to preach their charity sermon you read in the papers the wapping hospital for woodenlegged seamenon sunday the 23rd sermons will be preached in behalf of this charity by the lord bishop of tobago in the morning in the afternoon by the rev c honeyman am incumbent of etc clergymens grandmothers fundsermons in aid of this admirable institution will be preached on sunday 4th may by the very rev the dean of pimlico and the rev c honeyman am when the dean of pimlico has his illness many people think honeyman will have the deanery that he ought to have it a hundred female voices vow and declare though it is said that a right reverend head at headquarters shakes dubiously when his name is mentioned for preferment his name is spread wide and not only women but men come to hear him members of parliament even cabinet ministers sit under him lord dozeley of course is seen in a front pew where was a public meeting without lord dozeley the men come away from his sermons and say its very pleasant but i dont know what the deuce makes all you women crowd so to hear the man oh charles if you would but go oftener sighs lady anna maria cant you speak to the home secretary cant you do something for him we can ask him to dinner next wednesday if you like says charles they say hes a pleasant fellow out of the wood besides there is no use in doing anything for him charles goes on he cant make less than a thousand a year out of his chapel and that is better than anything any one can give him a thousand a year besides the rent of the winevaults below the chapel  dont charles says his wife with a solemn look dont ridicule things in that way  confound it there are winevaults under the chapel answers downright charles i saw the name sherrick and co offices a green door and a brass plate its better to sit over vaults with wine in them than coffins i wonder whether its the sherrick with whom kew and jack belsize had that ugly row  what ugly rowdont say ugly row it is not a nice word to hear the children use go on my darlings what was the dispute of lord kew and mr belsize and this mr sherrick  it was all about pictures and about horses and about money and about one other subject which enters into every row that i ever heard of  and what is that dear asks the innocent lady hanging on her husbands arm and quite pleased to have led him to church and brought him thence and what is it that enters into every row as you call it charles  a woman my love answers the gentleman behind whom we have been in imagination walking out from charles honeymans church on a sunday in june as the whole pavement blooms with artificial flowers and fresh bonnets as there is a buzz and cackle all around regarding the sermon as carriages drive off as ladydowagers walk home as prayerbooks and footmens sticks gleam in the sun as little boys with baked mutton and potatoes pass from the courts as children issue from the publichouses with pots of beer as the reverend charles honeyman who has been drawing tears in the sermon and has seen not without complacent throbs a secretary of state in the pew beneath him divests himself of his rich silk cassock in the vestry before he walks away to his neighbouring hermitagewhere have we placed itin walpole street i wish st pedro of alcantara could have some of that shoulder of mutton with the baked potatoes and a drink of that frothing beer see yonder trots little lord dozeley who has been asleep for an hour with his head against the wood like st pedro of alcantara  an east indian gentleman and his son wait until the whole chapel is clear and survey lady whittleseas monument at their leisure and other hideous slabs erected in memory of defunct frequenters of the chapel whose was that face which colonel newcome thought he recognisedthat of a stout man who came down from the organgallery could it be broff the bass singer who delivered the red cross knight with such applause at the cave of melody and who has been singing in this place there are some chapels in london where the function over one almost expects to see the sextons put brown hollands over the pews and galleries as they do at the theatre royal covent garden  the writer of these veracious pages was once walking through a splendid english palace standing amidst parks and gardens than which none more magnificent has been seen since the days of aladdin in company with a melancholy friend who viewed all things darkly through his gloomy eyes the housekeeper pattering on before us from chamber to chamber was expatiating upon the magnificence of this picture the beauty of that statue the marvellous richness of these hangings and carpets the admirable likeness of the late marquis by sir thomas of his father the fifth earl by sir joshua and so on when in the very richest room of the whole castle hickssuch was my melancholy companions namestopped the cicerone in her prattle saying in a hollow voice and now madam will you show us the closet where the skeleton is the seared functionary paused in the midst of her harangue that article was not inserted in the catalogue which she daily utters to visitors for their halfcrown hickss question brought a darkness down upon the hall where we were standing we did not see the room and yet i have no doubt there is such an one and ever after when i have thought of the splendid castle towering in the midst of shady trees under which the dappled deer are browsing of the terraces gleaming with statues and bright with a hundred thousand flowers of the bridges and shining fountains and rivers wherein the castle windows reflect their festive gleams when the halls are filled with happy feasters and over the darkling woods comes the sound of musicalways i say when i think of castle bluebeardit is to think of that dark little closet which i know is there and which the lordly owner opens shudderingafter midnightwhen he is sleepless and must go unlock it when the palace is hushed when beauties are sleeping around him unconscious and revellers are at rest o mrs housekeeper all the other keys hast thou but that key thou hast not  have we not all such closets my jolly friend as well as the noble marquis of carabas at night when all the house is asleep but you dont you get up and peep into yours when you in your turn are slumbering up gets mrs brown from your side steals downstairs like amina to her ghoul clicks open the secret door and looks into her dark depository did she tell you of that little affair with smith long before she knew you psha who knows any one save himself alone who in showing his house to the closest and dearest doesnt keep back the key of a closet or two i think of a lovely reader laying down the page and looking over at her unconscious husband asleep perhaps after dinner yes madam a closet he hath and you who pry into everything shall never have the key of it i think of some honest othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage and stealthily gazing at desdemona opposite to him innocently administering sandwiches to their little boyi am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke you seei feel it is growing too dreadful too serious  and to what pray do these serious these disagreeable these almost personal observations tend to this simply that charles honeyman the beloved and popular preacher the elegant divine to whom miss blanche writes sonnets and whom miss beatrice invites to tea who comes with smiles on his lip gentle sympathy in his tones innocent gaiety in his accent who melts rouses terrifies in the pulpit who charms over the teaurn and the bland breadandbutter charles honeyman has one or two skeleton closets in his lodgings walpole street mayfair and many a wakeful night whilst mrs ridley his landlady and her tired husband the noblemans majordomo whilst the lodger on the first floor whilst the cook and housemaid and weary little bootboy are at rest mind you they have all got their closets which they open with their skeletonkeys he wakes up and looks at the ghastly occupant of that receptacle one of the reverend charles honeymans grisly nighthaunters isbut stop let us give a little account of the lodgings and of some of the people frequenting the same  first floor mr bagshot member for a norfolk borough stout jolly gentlemandines at the carlton club greatly addicted to greenwich and richmond in the season bets in a moderate way does not go into society except now and again to the chiefs of his party when they give great entertainments and once or twice to the houses of great country dons who dwell near him in the country is not of very good family was in fact an apothecary married a woman with money much older than himself who does not like london and stops at home at hummingham not much to the displeasure of bagshot gives every now and then nice little quiet dinners which mrs ridley cooks admirably to exceedingly stupid jolly old parliamentary fogies who absorb with much silence and cheerfulness a vast quantity of wine they have just begun to drink 24 claret now that of 15 being scarce and almost drunk up writes daily and hears every morning from mrs bagshot does not read her letters always does not rise till long past eleven oclock of a sunday and has john bull and bells life in bed frequents the blue posts sometimes rides a stout cob out of his county and pays like the bank of england  the house is a norfolk house mrs ridley was housekeeper to the great squire bayham who had the estate before the conqueror and who came to such a dreadful crash in the year 1825 the year of the panic bayhams still belongs to the family but in what a state as those can say who recollect it in its palmy days fifteen hundred acres of the best land in england were sold off all the timber cut down as level as a billiardboard mr bayham now lives up in one corner of the house which used to be filled with the finest company in europe law bless you the bayhams have seen almost all the nobility of england come in and go out and were gentlefolks when many a fine lords father of the present day was sweeping a countinghouse  the house will hold genteelly no more than these two inmates but in the season it manages to accommodate miss cann who too was from bayhams having been a governess there to the young lady who is dead and who now makes such a livelihood as she can best raise by going out as a daily teacher miss cann dines with mrs ridley in the adjoining little backparlour ridley but seldom can be spared to partake of the family dinner his duties in the house and about the person of my lord todmorden keeping him constantly near that nobleman how little miss cann can go on and keep alive on the crumb she eats for breakfast and the scrap she picks at dinner du astonish mrs ridley that it du she declares that the two canarybirds encaged in her window whence is a cheerful prospect of the back of lady whittleseas chapel eat more than miss cann the two birds set up a tremendous singing and chorussing when miss cann spying the occasion of the firstfloor lodgers absence begins practising her musicpieces such trills roulades and flourishes go on from the birds and the lodger it is a wonder how any fingers can move over the jingling ivory so quickly as miss canns excellent a woman as she is admirably virtuous frugal brisk honest and cheerful i would not like to live in lodgings where there was a lady so addicted to playing variations no more does honeyman on a saturday when he is composing his valuable sermons the rogue you may be sure leaves his work to the last day and there are i am given to understand among the clergy many better men than honeyman who are as dilatory as he he begs he entreats with tears in his eyes that miss canns music may cease i would back little cann to write a sermon against him for all his reputation as a popular preacher  old and weazened as that piano is feeble and cracked her voice it is wonderful what a pleasant concert she can give in that parlour of a saturday evening to mrs ridley who generally dozes a good deal and to a lad who listens with all his soul with tears sometimes in his great eyes with crowding fancies filling his brain and throbbing at his heart as the artist plies her humble instrument she plays old music of handel and haydn and the little chamber anon swells into a cathedral and he who listens beholds altars lighted priests ministering fair children swinging censers great oriel windows gleaming in sunset and seen through arched columns and avenues of twilight marble the young fellow who hears her has been often and often to the opera and the theatres as she plays don juan zerlina comes tripping over the meadows and masetto after her with a crowd of peasants and maidens and they sing the sweetest of all music and the heart beats with happiness and kindness and pleasure piano pianissimo the city is hushed the towers of the great cathedral rise in the distance its spires lighted by the broad moon the statues in the moonlit place cast long shadows athwart the pavement but the fountain in the midst is dressed out like cinderella for the night and sings and wears a crest of diamonds that great sombre street all in shade can it be the famous toledoor is it the corsoor is it the great street in madrid the one which leads to the escurial where the rubens and velasquez are it is fancy streetpoetry streetimagination streetthe street where lovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiery swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid the pifferari play to their dancing blow bagpipes a storm of harmony become trumpets trombones ophicleides fiddles and bassoons fire guns sound tocsins shout people louder shriller and sweeter than all sing thou ravishing heroine and see on his creamcoloured charger massaniello prances in and fra diavolo leaps down the balcony carabine in hand and sir huon of bordeaux sails up to the quay with the sultans daughter of babylon all these delights and sights and joys and glories these thrills of sympathy movements of unknown longing and visions of beauty a young sickly lad of eighteen enjoys in a little dark room where there is a bed disguised in the shape of a wardrobe and a little old woman is playing under a gaslamp on the jingling keys of an old piano  for a long time mr samuel ridley butler and confidential valet to the right honourable john james baron todmorden was in a state of the greatest despair and gloom about his only son the little john jamesa sickly and almost deformed child of whom there was no making nothink as mr ridley said his figure precluded him from following his fathers profession and waiting upon the british nobility who naturally require large and handsome men to skip up behind their rolling carriages and hand their plates at dinner when john james was six years old his father remarked with tears in his eyes he wasnt higher than a platebasket the boys jeered at him in the streetssome whopped him spite of his diminutive size at school he made but little progress he was always sickly and dirty and timid and crying whimpering in the kitchen away from his mother who though she loved him took mr ridleys view of his character and thought him little better than an idiot until such time as little miss cann took him in hand when at length there was some hope of him  halfwitted you great stupid big man says miss cann who had a fine spirit of her own that boy halfwitted he has got more wit in his little finger than you have in all your great person you are a very good man ridley very goodnatured im sure and bear with the teasing of a waspish old woman but you are not the wisest of mankind tut tut dont tell me you know you spell out the words when you read the newspaper still and what would your bills look like if i did not write them in my nice little hand i tell you that boy is a genius i tell you that one day the world will hear of him his heart is made of pure gold you think that all the wit belongs to the big people look at me you great tall man am i not a hundred times cleverer than you are yes and john james is worth a thousand such insignificant little chits as i am and he is as tall as me too sir do you hear that one day i am determined he shall dine at lord todmordens table and he shall get the prize at the royal academy and be famous sirfamous  well miss c i wish he may get it thats all i say answers mr ridley the poor fellow does no harm that i acknowledge but i never see the good he was up to yet i wish hed begin it i du wish he would now and the honest gentleman relapses into the study of his paper  all those beautiful sounds and thoughts which miss cann conveys to him out of her charmed piano the young artist straightway translates into forms and knights in armour with plume and shield and battleaxe and splendid young noblemen with flowing ringlets and bounteous plumes of feathers and rapiers and russet boots and fierce banditti with crimson tights doublets profusely illustrated with large brass buttons and the dumpy baskethilted claymores known to be the favourite weapon with which these whiskered ruffians do battle waspwaisted peasant girls and young

lollipops theatrical characters and gingerbeer for the boys in little craggs buildings hard by the running footman publichouse where father and other gentlemens gentlemen have their club this good soul also sells sunday newspapers to the footmen of the neighbouring gentry and besides has a stock of novels for the ladies of the upper servants table next to miss cann miss flinders is john jamess greatest friend and benefactor she has remarked him when he was quite a little man and used to bring his fathers beer of a sunday out of her novels he has taught himself to read dull boy at the dayschool though he was and always the last in his class there hours happy hours has he spent cowering behind her counter or hugging her books under his pinafore when he had leave to carry them home the whole library has passed through his hands his long lean tremulous hands and under his eager eyes he has made illustrations to every one of those books and been frightened at his own pictures of manfroni or the onehanded monk abellino the terrific bravo of venice and rinaldo rinaldini captain of robbers how he has blistered thaddeus of warsaw with his tears and drawn him in his polish cap and tights and hessians william wallace the hero of scotland how nobly he has depicted him with what whiskers and bushy ostrich plumesin a tight kilt and with what magnificent calves to his legs laying about him with his battleaxe and bestriding the bodies of king edwards prostrate cavaliers at this time mr honeyman comes to lodge in walpole street and brings a set of scotts novels for which he subscribed when at oxford and young john james who at first waits upon him and does little odd jobs for the reverend gentleman lights upon the volumes and reads them with such a delight and passion of pleasure as all the delights of future days will scarce equal a fool is hean idle feller out of whom no good will ever come as his father says there was a time when in despair of any better chance for him his parents thought of apprenticing him to a tailor and john james was waked up from a dream of rebecca and informed of the cruelty meditated against him i forbear to describe the tears and terror and frantic desperation in which the poor boy was plunged little miss cann rescued him from that awful board and honeyman likewise interceded for him and mr bagshot promised that as soon as his party came in he would ask the minister for a tidewaitership for him for everybody liked the solemn softhearted willing little lad and no one knew him less than his pompous and stupid and respectable father  miss cann painted flowers and cardscreens elegantly and finished pencildrawings most elaborately for her pupils she could copy prints so that at a little distance you would scarcely know that the copy in stumped chalk was not a bad mezzotinto engraving she even had a little old paintbox and showed you one or two ivory miniatures out of the drawer she gave john james what little knowledge of drawing she had and handed him over her invaluable recipes for mixing watercoloursfor trees in foregrounds burnt sienna and indigofor very dark foliage ivory black and gambogefor fleshcolour etc etc john james went through her poor little course but not so brilliantly as she expected she was forced to own that several of her pupils pieces were executed much more dexterously than johnny ridleys honeyman looked at the boys drawings from time to time and said hm havery clevera great deal of fancy really but honeyman knew no more of the subject than a deaf and dumb man knows of music he could talk the art cant very glibly and had a set of morghens and madonnas as became a clergyman and a man of taste but he saw not with eyes such as those wherewith heaven had endowed the humble little butlers boy to whom splendours of nature were revealed to vulgar sights invisible and beauties manifest in forms colours shadows of common objects where most of the world saw only what was dull and gross and familiar one reads in the magic storybooks of a charm or a flower which the wizard gives and which enables the bearer to see the fairies o enchanting boon of nature which reveals to the possessor the hidden spirits of beauty round about him spirits which the strongest and most gifted masters compel into painting or song to others it is granted but to have fleeting glimpses of that fair artworld and tempted by ambition or barred by faintheartedness or driven by necessity to turn away thence to the vulgar lifetrack and the light of common day  the reader who has passed through walpole street scores of times knows the discomfortable architecture of all save the great houses built in queen annes and george the firsts time and while some of the neighbouring streets to wit great craggs street bolingbroke street and others contain mansions fairly coped with stone with little obelisks before the doors and great extinguishers wherein the torches of the nobilitys running footmen were put out a hundred and thirty or forty years agohouses which still remain abodes of the quality and where you shall see a hundred carriages gather of a public night walpole street has quite faded away into lodgings private hotels doctors houses and the like nor is no 23 ridleys by any means the best house in the street the parlour furnished and tenanted by miss cann as has been described the first floor bagshot esq mp the second floor honeyman what remains but the garrets and the ample staircase and the kitchens and the family being all put to bed how can you imagine there is room for any more inhabitants  and yet there is one lodger more and one who like almost all the other personages mentioned up to the present time and some of whom you have no idea yet will play a definite part in the ensuing history at night when honeyman comes in he finds on the halltable three wax bedroom candleshis own bagshots and another as for miss cann she is locked into the parlour in bed long ago her stout little walkingshoes being on the mat at the door at 12 oclock at noon sometimes at 1 nay at 2 and 3long after bagshot is gone to his committees and little cann to her pupilsa voice issues from the very topmost floor from a room where there is no bell a voice of thunder calling out slavey julia julia my love mrs ridley and this summons not being obeyed it will not unfrequently happen that a pair of trousers enclosing a pair of boots with iron heels and known by the name of the celebrated prussian general who came up to help the other christener of boots at waterloo will be flung down from the topmost story even to the marble floor of the resounding hall then the boy thomas otherwise called slavey may say there he goes again or mrs ridleys own backparlour bell rings vehemently and julia the cook will exclaim lor its mr frederick  if the breeches and boots are not understood the owner himself appears in great wrath dancing on the upper story dancing down to the lower floor and loosely enveloped in a ragged and flowing robe de chambre in this costume and condition he will dance into honeymans apartment where that meek divine may be sitting with a headache or over a novel or a newspaper dance up to the fire flapping his robetails poke it and warm himself there dance up to the cupboard where his reverence keeps his sherry and help himself to a glass  salve spes fidei lumen ecclesiae he will say heres towards you my buck i knows the tap sherricks marsala bottled three months after date at two hundred and fortysix shillings the dozen  indeed indeed its not and now we are coming to an idea of the skeleton in poor honeymans closetnot that this huge handsome jolly fred bayham is the skeleton far from it mr frederick weighs fourteen stone indeed indeed it isnt fred im sure sighs the other you exaggerate indeed you do the wine is not dear not by any means so expensive as you say  how much a glass think you says fred filling another bumper a halfcrown think yea halfcrown honeyman by cock and pye it is not worth a bender he says this in the manner of the most celebrated tragedian of the day he can imitate any actor tragic or comic any known parliamentary orator or clergyman any saw cock cloop of a cork wrenched from a bottle and guggling of wine into the decanter afterwards bee buzzing little boy up a chimney etc he imitates people being ill on board a steampacket so well that he makes you die of laughing his uncle the bishop could not resist this comic exhibition and gave fred a cheque for a comfortable sum of money and fred getting cash for the cheque at the cave of harmony imitated his uncle the bishop and his chaplain winding up with his lordship and chaplain being unwell at seathe chaplain and bishop quite natural and distinct  how much does a glass of this sack cost thee charley resumes fred after this parenthesis you say it is not dear charles honeyman you had even from your youth up a villainous habit and i perfectly well remember sir in boyhoods breezy hour when i was the delight of his school that you used to tell lies to your venerable father you did charles excuse the frankness of an early friend its my belief youd rather lie than not hmhe looks at the cards in the chimneyglass invitations to dinner proffers of muffins do lend me your sermon oh you old impostor you hoary old

sofa as the door opens  ha dost thou come with murderous intent and he now advances in an approved offensive attitude caitiff come on come on and he walks off with a tragic laugh crying ha ha ha tis but the slavey  the slavey has mr fredericks hot water and a bottle of sodawater on the same tray he has been instructed to bring soda whenever he hears the word slavey pronounced from above the bottle explodes and frederick drinks and hisses after his drink as though he had been all hot within  whats oclock now slaveyhalfpast three let me see i breakfasted exactly ten hours ago in the rosy morning off a modest cup of coffee in covent garden market coffee a penny bread a simple halfpenny what has mrs ridley for dinner  please sir roast pork  get me some bring it into my room unless

shirts and one of his razors adieu charles amend remember me and he vanishes into the upper chambers     chapter xii in which everybody is asked to dinner   john james had opened the door hastening to welcome a friend and patron the sight of whom always gladdened the youths eyes no other than clive newcomein young ridleys opinion the most splendid fortunate beautiful highborn and gifted youth this island contained what generous boy in his time has not worshipped somebody before the female enslaver makes her appearance every lad has a friend of friends a crony of cronies to whom he writes immense letters in vacation whom he cherishes in his heart of hearts whose sister he proposes to marry in after life whose purse he shares for whom he will take a thrashing if need be who is his hero clive was john jamess youthful divinity when he wanted to draw thaddeus of warsaw a prince ivanhoe or some one splendid and egregious it was clive he took for a model his heart leapt when he saw the young fellow he would walk cheerfully to grey friars with a letter or message for clive on the chance of seeing him and getting a kind word from him or a shake of the hand an exbutler of lord todmorden was a pensioner in the grey friars hospital it has been said that at that ancient establishment is a college for old men as well as for boys and this old man would come sometimes to his successors sunday dinner and grumble from the hour of that meal until nine oclock when he was forced to depart so as to be within grey friars gates before ten grumble about his dinnergrumble about his beergrumble about the number of chapels he had to attend about the gown he wore about the masters treatment of him about the want of plums in the pudding as old men and schoolboys grumble it was wonderful what a liking john james took to this odious querulous graceless stupid and snuffy old man and how he would find pretexts for visiting him at his lodging in the old hospital he actually took that journey that he might have a chance of seeing clive he sent clive notes and packets of drawings thanked him for books lent asked advice about future readinganything so that he might have a sight of his pride his patron his paragon  i am afraid clive newcome employed him to smuggle rumshrub and cigars into the premises giving him appointments in the school precincts where young clive would come and stealthily receive the forbidden goods the poor lad was known by the boys and called newcomes punch he was all but hunchbacked long and lean in the arm sallow with a great forehead and waving black hair and large melancholy eyes  what is it you j j cries clive gaily when his humble friend appears at the door father this is my friend ridley this is the fellow what can draw  i know who i will back against any young man of his size at that says the colonel looking at clive fondly he considered there was not such a genius in the world and had already thought of having some of clives drawings published by mlean of the haymarket  this is my father just come from indiaand mr pendennis an old grey friars man is my uncle at home both these gentlemen bestow rather patronising nods of the head on the lad introduced to them as j j his exterior is but meanlooking colonel newcome one of the humblestminded men alive has yet his oldfashioned military notions and speaks to a butlers son as to a private soldier kindly but not familiarly  mr honeyman is at home gentlemen the young lad says humbly shall i show you up to his room and we walk up the stairs after our guide we find mr honeyman deep in study on his sofa with pearson on the creed before him the novel has been whipped under the pillow clive found it there some short time afterwards during his uncles temporary absence in his dressingroom he has agreed to suspend his theological studies and go out with his brotherinlaw to dine  as clive and his friends were at honeymans door and just as we were entering to see the divine seated in state before his folio clive whispers j j come along old fellow and show us some drawings what are you doing  i was doing some arabian nights says j j up in my room and hearing a knock which i thought was yours i came down  show us the pictures lets go up into your room cries clive whatwill you says the other it is but a very small place  never mind come along says clive and the two lads disappear together leaving the three grown gentlemen to discourse together or rather two of us to listen to honeyman who expatiates upon the beauty of the weather the difficulties of the clerical calling the honour colonel newcome does him by a visit etc with his usual eloquence  after a while clive comes down without j j from the upper regions he is greatly excited oh sir he says to his father you talk about my drawingsyou should see j js by jove that fellow is a genius they are beautiful sir you seem actually to read the arabian nights you know only in pictures there is scheherazade telling the stories andwhat do you call herdinarzade and the sultan sitting in bed and listening such a grim old cove you see he has cut off ever so many of his wives heads i cant think where that chap gets his ideas from i can beat him in drawing horses i know and dogs but i can only draw what i see somehow he seems to see things we dont dont you know oh father im determined id rather be a painter than anything and he falls to drawing horses and dogs at his uncles table round which the elders are seated  ive settled it upstairs with j j says clive working away with his pen we shall take a studio together perhaps we will go abroad together wont that be fun father  my dear clive remarks mr honeyman with bland dignity there are degrees in society which we must respect you surely cannot think of being a professional artist such a profession is very well for your young protege but for you  what for me cries clive we are no such great folks that i know of and if we were i say a painter is as good as a lawyer or a doctor or even a soldier in dr johnstons lifewhich my father is always readingi like to read about sir joshua reynolds best i think he is the best gentleman of all in the book my wouldnt i like to paint a picture like lord heathfield in the national gallery wouldnt i just i think i would sooner have done that than have fought at gibraltar and those three gracesoh arent they graceful and that cardinal beaufort at dulwichit frightens me so i darent look at it wasnt reynolds a clipper thats all and wasnt rubens a brick he was an ambassador and knight of the bath so was vandyck and titian and raphael and velasquezill just trouble you to show me better gentlemen than them uncle charles  far be it from me to say that the pictorial calling is not honourable says uncle charles but as the world goes there are other professions in greater repute and i should have thought colonel newcomes son  he shall follow his own bent said the colonel as long as his calling is honest it becomes a gentleman and if he were to take a fancy to play on the fiddleactually on the fiddlei shouldnt object  such a rum chap there was upstairs clive resumes looking up from his scribbling he was walking up and down on the landing in a dressinggown with scarcely any other clothes on holding a plate in one hand and a porkchop he was munching with the other like this and clive draws a figure what do you think sir he was in the cave of harmony he says that night you flared up about captain costigan he knew me at once and he says sir your father acted like a gentleman a christian and a man of honour maxima debetur puero reverentia give him my compliments i dont know his highly respectable name his highly respectable name says clive cracking with laughterthose were his very words and inform him that i am an orphan myselfin needy circumstanceshe said he was in needy circumstances and i heartily wish hed adopt me  the lad puffed out his face made his voice as loud and as deep as he could and from his imitation and the picture he had drawn i knew at once that fred bayham was the man he mimicked  and does the red rover live here cried mr pendennis and have we earthed him at last  he sometimes comes here mr honeyman said with a careless manner my landlord and landlady were butler and housekeeper to his father bayham of bayham one of the oldest families in europe and mr frederick bayham the exceedingly eccentric person of whom you speak was a private pupil of my own dear father in our happy days at borehambury  he had scarcely spoken when a knock was heard at the door and before the occupant of the lodgings could say come in mr frederick bayham made his appearance arrayed in that peculiar costume which he affected in those days we wore very tall stocks only a very few poetic and eccentric persons venturing on the byron collar but fred bayham confined his neck by a simple ribbon which allowed his great red whiskers to curl freely round his capacious jowl he wore a black frock and a large broadbrimmed hat and looked somewhat like a dissenting preacher at other periods you would see him in a green coat and a blue neckcloth as if the turf or the driving of coaches was his occupation  i have heard from the young man of the house who you were colonel newcome he said with the greatest gravity and happened to be present sir the other night for i was aweary having been toiling all the day in literary labour and needed some refreshment i happened to be present sir at a scene which did you the greatest honour and of which i spoke not knowing you with something like levity to your son he is an ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudorispendennis how are you and i thought sir i would come down and tender an apology if i had said any words that might savour of offence to a gentleman who was in the right as i told the room when you quitted it as mr pendennis i am sure will remember  mr pendennis looked surprise and perhaps negation  you forget pendennis those who quit that room sir often forget on the morrow what occurred during the revelry of the night you did right in refusing to return to that scene we public men are obliged often to seek our refreshment at hours when luckier individuals are lapt in slumber  and what may be your occupation mr bayham asks the colonel rather gloomily for he had an idea that bayham was adopting a strain of persiflage which the indian gentleman by no means relished never saying aught but a kind word to any one he was on fire at the notion that any should take a liberty with him  a barrister sir but without businessa literary man who can but seldom find an opportunity to sell the works of his brainsa gentleman sir who has met with neglect perhaps merited perhaps undeserved from his family i get my bread as best i may on that evening i had been lecturing on the genius of some of our comic writers at the parthenopoeon hackney my audience was scanty perhaps equal to my deserts i came home on foot to an egg and a glass of beer after midnight and witnessed the scene which did you so much honour what is this i fancy a ludicrous picture of myselfhe had taken up the sketch which clive had been drawingi like fun even at my own expense and can afford to laugh at a joke which is meant in goodhumour this speech quite reconciled the honest colonel i am sure the author of that mr bayham means you or any man no harm why the rascal sir has drawn me his own father and i have sent the drawing to major hobbs who is in command of my regiment chinnery himself sir couldnt hit off a likeness better he has drawn me on horseback and he has drawn me on foot and he has drawn my friend mr binnie who lives with me we have scores of his drawings at my lodgings and if you will favour us by dining with us today and these gentlemen you shall see that you are not the only person caricatured by clive here  i just took some little dinner upstairs sir i am a moderate man and can live if need be like a spartan but to join such good company i will gladly use the knife and fork again you will excuse the travellers dress i keep a room here which i use only occasionally and am at present lodgingin the country  when honeyman was ready the colonel who had the greatest respect for the church would not hear of going out of the room before the clergyman and took his arm to walk bayham then fell to mr pendenniss lot and they went together through hill street and berkeley square their course was straight enough but at hay hill mr bayham made an abrupt tack larboard engaging in a labyrinth of stables and walking a long way round from clifford street whither we were bound he hinted at a cab but pendennis refused to ride being in truth anxious to see which way his eccentric companion would steer there are reasons growled bayham which need not be explained to one of your experience why bond street must be avoided by some men peculiarly situated the smell of truefitts pomatum makes me ill tell me pendennis is this indian warrior a rajah of large wealth could he do you think recommend me to a situation in the east india company i would gladly take any honest post in which fidelity might be useful genius might be appreciated and courage rewarded here we are the hotel seems comfortable i never was in it before  when we entered the colonels sittingroom at nerots we found the waiter engaged in extending the table we are a larger party than i expected our host said i met my brother brian on horseback leaving cards at that great house in  street  the russian embassy says mr honeyman who knew the town quite well  and he said he was disengaged and would dine with us continues the colonel  am i to understand colonel newcome says mr frederick bayham that you are related to the eminent banker sir brian newcome who gives such uncommonly swell parties in park lane  what is a swell party asks the colonel laughing i dined with my brother last wednesday and it was a very grand dinner certainly the governorgeneral himself could not give a more splendid entertainment but do you know i scarcely had enough to eat i dont eat side dishes and as for the roast beef of old england why the meat was put on the table and whisked away like sanchos inauguration feast at barataria we did not dine till nine oclock i like a few glasses of claret and a cosy talk after dinner butwell wellno doubt the worthy gentleman was accusing himself of telling tales out of school and had come to a timely repentance our dinner i hope will be different jack binnie will take care of that that fellow is full of anecdote and fun you will meet one or two more of our service sir thomas de boots who is not a bad chap over a glass of wine mr pendenniss chum mr warrington and my nephew barnes newcomea dry fellow at first but i dare say he has good about him when you know him almost every man has said the goodnatured philosopher clive you rogue mind and be moderate with the champagne sir  champagnes for women says clive i stick to claret  i say pendennis here bayham remarked it is my deliberate opinion that f b has got into a good thing  mr pendennis seeing there was a great party was for going home to his chambers to dress hm says mr bayham dont see the necessity what rightminded man looks at the exterior of his neighbour he looks here sir and examines there and bayham tapped his forehead which was expansive and then his heart which he considered to be in the right place  what is this i hear about dressing asks our host dine in your frock my good friend and welcome if your dresscoat is in the country  it is at present at an uncles mr bayham said with great gravity and i take your hospitality as you offer it colonel newcome cordially and frankly  honest mr binnie made his appearance a short time before the appointed hour for receiving the guests arrayed in a tight little pair of trousers and white silk stockings and pumps his bald head shining like a billiardball his jolly gills rosy with goodhumour he was bent on pleasure hey lads says he but well make a night of it we havent had a night since the farewell dinner off plymouth  and a jolly night it was james ejaculates the colonel  egad what a song that tom norris sings  and your jock o hazeldean is as good as a play jack  and i think you beat iny one i iver hard in tom bowling yourself tom cries the colonels delighted chum mr pendennis opened the eyes of astonishment at the idea of the possibility of renewing these festivities but he kept the lips of prudence closed and now the carriages began to drive up and the guests of colonel newcome to arrive     chapter xiii in which thomas newcome sings his last song   the earliest comers were the first mate and the medical officer of the ship in which the two gentlemen had come to england the mate was a scotchman the doctor was a scotchman of the gentlemen from the oriental club three were scotchmen  the southrons with one exception were the last to arrive and for a while we stood looking out of the windows awaiting their coming the first mate pulled out a penknife and arranged his nails the doctor and mr binnie talked of the progress of medicine binnie had walked the hospitals of edinburgh before getting his civil appointment to india the three gentlemen from hanover square and the colonel had plenty to say about tom smith of the cavalry and harry hall of the engineers how topham was going to marry poor little bob walliss widow how many lakhs barber had brought home and the like the tall greyheaded englishman who had been in the east too in the kings service joined for a while in this conversation but presently left it and came and talked with clive i knew your father in india said the gentleman to the lad there is not a more gallant or respected officer in that service i have a boy too a stepson who has just gone into the army he is older than you he was born at the end of the waterloo year and so was a great friend of his and mine who was at your school sir rawdon crawley  he was in gown boys i know says the boy succeeded his uncle pitt fourth baronet i dont know how his motherher who wrote the hymns you know and goes to mr honeymans chapelcomes to be rebecca lady crawley his father colonel rawdon crawley died at coventry island in august 182 and his uncle sir pitt not till september here i remember we used to talk about it at grey friars when i was quite a little chap and there were bets whether crawley i mean the young one was a baronet or not  when i sailed to rigy cornel the first mate was speakingnor can any spelling nor combination of letters of which i am master reproduce this gentlemans accent when he was talking his besti racklackt they used always to sairve us a drem before denner and as your frinds are kipping the denner and as ive no watch tonight ill jist do as we used to do at rigy james my fine fellow jist look alive and breng me a small glass of brandy will ye did ye iver try a brandy cocktail cornel whin i sailed on the new york line we used jest to make bits before denner andthank ye james and he tossed off a glass of brandy  here a waiter announces in a loud voice sir thomas de boots and the general enters scowling round the room according to his fashion very red in the face very tight in the girth splendidly attired with a choking white neckcloth a voluminous waistcoat and his orders on  stars and garters by jingo cries mr frederick bayham i say pendennis have you any idea is the duke coming i wouldnt have come in these bluchers if i had known it confound it nohoby himself my own bootmaker wouldnt have allowed poor f b to appear in bluchers if he had known that i was going to meet the duke my linens all right anyhow  f b breathed a thankful prayer for that indeed who but the very curious could tell that not f bs but c hscharles honeymanswas the mark upon that decorous linen  colonel newcome introduced sir thomas to every one in the room as he had introduced us all to each other previously and as sir thomas looked at one after another his face was kind enough to assume an expression which seemed to ask and who the devil are you sir as clearly as though the general himself had given utterance to the words with the gentleman in the window talking to clive he seemed to have some acquaintance and said not unkindly how dyou do dobbin  the carriage of sir brian newcome now drove up from which the baronet descended in state leaning upon the arm of the apollo in plush and powder who closed the shutters of the great coach and mounted by the side of the coachman laced and periwigged the bench of bishops has given up its wigs cannot the box too be made to resign that insane decoration is it necessary for our comfort that the men who do our work in stable or household should be dressed like merryandrews enter sir brian newcome smiling blandly he greets his brother affectionately sir thomas gaily he nods and smiles to clive and graciously permits mr pendennis to take hold of two fingers of his extended right hand that gentleman is charmed of course with the condescension what man could be otherwise than happy to be allowed a momentary embrace of two such precious fingers when a gentleman so favours me i always ask mentally why he has taken the trouble at all and regret that i have not had the presence of mind to poke one finger against his two if i were worth ten thousand a year i cannot help inwardly reflecting and kept a large account in threadneedle street i cannot help thinking he would have favoured me with the whole palm  the arrival of these two grandees has somehow cast a solemnity over the company the weather is talked about brilliant in itself it does not occasion very brilliant remarks among colonel newcomes guests sir brian really thinks it must be as hot as it is in india sir thomas de boots swelling in his white waistcoat in the armholes of which his thumbs are engaged smiles scornfully and wishes sir brian had ever felt a good sweltering day in the hot winds in india sir brian withdraws the untenable proposition that london is as hot as calcutta mr binnie looks at his watch and at the colonel we have only your nephew tom to wait for he says i think we may make so bold as to order the dinnera proposal heartily seconded by mr frederick bayham  the dinner appears steaming borne by steaming waiters the grandees take their places one on each side of the colonel he begs mr honeyman to say grace and stands reverentially during that brief ceremony while de boots looks queerly at him from over his napkin all the young men take their places at the farther end of the table round about mr binnie and at the end of the second course mr barnes newcome makes his appearance  mr barnes does not show the slightest degree of disturbance although he disturbs all the company soup and fish are brought for him and meat which he leisurely eats while twelve other gentlemen are kept waiting we mark mr binnies twinkling eyes as they watch the young man eh he seems to say but thats just about as freeandeasy a young chap as ever i set eyes on and so mr barnes was a cool young chap that dish is so good he must really have some more he discusses the second supply leisurely and turning round simpering to his neighbour says i really hope im not keeping everybody waiting  hem grunts the neighbour mr bayham it doesnt much matter for we had all pretty well done dinner barnes takes a note of mr bayhams dresshis long frockcoat the ribbon round his neck and surveys him with an admirable impudence who are these people thinks he my uncle has got together he bows graciously to the honest colonel who asks him to take wine he is so insufferably affable that every man near him would like to give him a beating  all the time of the dinner the host was challenging everybody to drink wine in his honest oldfashioned way and mr binnie seconding the chief entertainer such was the way in england and scotland when they were young men and when binnie asking sir brian receives for reply from the baronetthank you no my dear sir i have exceeded already positively exceeded the poor discomfited gentleman hardly knows whither to apply but luckily tom norris the first mate comes to his rescue and cries out mr binnie ive not had enough and ill drink a glass of anything ye like with ye the fact is that mr norris has had enough he has drunk bumpers to the health of every member of the company his glass has been filled scores of times by watchful waiters so has mr bayham absorbed great quantities of drink but without any visible effect on that veteran toper so has young clive taken more than is good for him his cheeks are flushed and burning he is chattering and laughing loudly at his end of the table mr warrington eyes the lad with some curiosity and then regards mr barnes with a look of scorn which does not scorch that affable young person  i am obliged to confess that the mate of the indiaman at an early period of the dessert and when nobody had asked him for any such public expression of his opinion insisted on rising and proposing the health of colonel newcome whose virtues he lauded outrageously and whom he pronounced to be one of the best of mortal men sir brian looked very much alarmed at the commencement of this speech which the mate delivered with immense shrieks and gesticulation but the baronet recovered during the course of the rambling oration and at its conclusion gracefully tapped the table with one of those patronising fingers and lifting up a glass containing at least a thimbleful of claret said my dear brother i drink your health with all my heart im suah the youthful barnes had uttered many hear hears during the discourse with an irony which with every fresh glass of wine he drank he cared less to conceal and though barnes had come late he had drunk largely making up for lost time  those ironical cheers and all his cousins behaviour during dinner had struck young clive who was growing very angry he growled out remarks uncomplimentary to barnes his eyes as he looked towards his kinsman flashed out challenges of which we who were watching him could see the warlike purport warrington looked at bayham and pendennis with glances of apprehension we saw that danger was brooding unless the one young man could be restrained from his impertinence and the other from his wine  colonel newcome said a very few words in reply to his honest friend the chief mate and there the matter might have ended but i am sorry to say mr binnie now thought it necessary to rise and deliver himself of some remarks regarding the kings service coupled with the name of majorgeneral sir thomas de boots kcb etcthe receipt of which that gallant officer was obliged to acknowledge in a confusion amounting almost to apoplexy the glasses went whack whack upon the hospitable board the evening set in for public speaking encouraged by his last effort mr binnie now proposed sir brian newcomes health and that baronet rose and uttered an exceedingly lengthy speech delivered with his wineglass on his bosom  then that sad rogue bayham must get up and call earnestly and respectfully for silence and the chairmans hearty sympathy for the few observations which he had to propose our armies had been drunk with proper enthusiasmsuch men as he beheld around him deserved the applause of all honest hearts and merited the cheers with which their names had been received hear hear from barnes newcome sarcastically hear hear hear fiercely from clive but whilst we applauded our army should we forget a profession still more exalted yes still more exalted i say in the face of the gallant general opposite and that profession i need not say is the church applause gentlemen we have among us one who while partaking largely of the dainties on this festive board drinking freely of the sparkling winecup which our gallant hospitality administers to us sanctifies by his presence the feast of which he partakes inaugurates with appropriate benedictions and graces it i may say both before and after meat gentlemen charles honeyman was the friend of my childhood his father the instructor of my early days if frederick bayhams latter life has been chequered by misfortune it may be that i have forgotten the precepts which the venerable parent of charles honeyman poured into an inattentive ear he too as a child was not exempt from faults as a young man i am told not quite free from youthful indiscretions but in this present anno domini we hail charles honeyman as a precept and an example as a decus fidei and a lumen ecclesiae as i told him in the confidence of the private circle this morning and ere i ever thought to publish my opinion in this distinguished company colonel newcome and mr binnie i drink to the health of the reverend charles honeyman am may we listen to many more of his sermons as well as to that admirable discourse with which i am sure he is about to electrify us now may we profit by his eloquence and cherish in our memories the truths which come mended from his tongue he ceased poor honeyman had to rise on his legs and gasp out a few incoherent remarks in reply without a book before him the incumbent of lady whittleseas chapel was no prophet and the truth is he made poor work of his oration  at the end of it he sir brian colonel dobbin and one of the indian gentlemen quitted the room in spite of the loud outcries of our generous host who insisted that the party should not break up close up gentlemen called out honest newcome we are not going to part just yet let me fill your glass general you used to have no objection to a glass of wine and he poured out a bumper for his friend which the old campaigner sucked in with fitting gusto who will give us a song binnie give us the laird of cockpen its capital my dear general capital the colonel whispered to his neighbour  mr binnie struck up the laird of cockpen without i am bound to say the least reluctance he bobbed to one man and he winked to another and he tossed his glass and gave all the points of his song in a manner which did credit to his simplicity and his humour you haughty southerners little know how a jolly scotch gentleman can desipere in loco and how he chirrups over his honest cups i do not say whether it was with the song or with mr binnie that we were most amused it was a good commonty as christopher sly says nor were we sorry when it was done  him the first mate succeeded after which came a song from the redoubted f bayham which he sang with a bass voice which lablache might envy and of which the chorus was frantically sung by the whole company the cry was then for the colonel on which barnes newcome who had been drinking much started up with something like an oath crying oh i cant stand this  then leave it confound you said young clive with fury in his face if our company is not good for you why do you come into it  whats that asks barnes who was evidently affected by wine bayham roared silence and barnes newcome looking round with a tipsy toss of the head finally sate down  the colonel sang as we have said with a very high voice using freely the falsetto after the manner of the tenor singers of his day he chose one of his maritime songs and got through the first verse very well barnes wagging his head at the chorus with a bravo so offensive that fred bayham his neighbour gripped the young mans arm and told him to hold his confounded tongue  the colonel began his second verse and here as will often happen to amateur singers his falsetto broke down he was not in the least annoyed for i saw him smile very goodnaturedly and he was going to try the verse again when that unlucky barnes first gave a sort of crowing imitation of the song and then burst into a yell of laughter clive dashed a glass of wine in his face at the next minute glass and all and no one who had watched the young mans behaviour was sorry for the insult  i never saw a kind face express more terror than colonel newcomes he started back as if he had himself received the blow from his son gracious god he cried out my boy insult a gentleman at my table  id like to do it again says clive whose whole body was trembling with anger  are you drunk sir shouted his father  the boy served the young fellow right sir growled fred bayham in his deepest voice come along young man stand up straight and keep a civil tongue in your head next time mind you when you dine with gentlemen its easy to see says fred looking round with a knowing air that this young man hasnt got the usages of societyhes not been accustomed to it and he led the dandy out  others had meanwhile explained the state of the case to the colonelincluding sir thomas de boots who was highly energetic and delighted with clives spirit and some were for having the song to continue but the colonel puffing his cigar said no my pipe is out i will never sing again so this history will record no more of thomas newcomes musical performances     chapter xiv park lane   clive woke up the next morning to be aware of a racking headache and by the dim light of his throbbing eyes to behold his father with solemn face at his bedfoota reproving conscience to greet his waking  you drank too much wine last night and disgraced yourself sir the old soldier said you must get up and eat humble pie this morning my boy  humble what father asked the lad hardly aware of his words or the scene before him oh ive got such a headache  serve you right sir many a young fellow has had to go on parade in the morning with a headache earned overnight drink this water now jump up now dash the water well over your head there you come make your toilette quickly and let us be off and find cousin barnes before he has left home  clive obeyed the paternal orders dressed himself quickly and descending found his father smoking his morning cigar in the apartment where they had dined the night before and where the tables still were covered with the relics of yesterdays feastthe emptied bottles the blank lamps the scattered ashes and fruits the wretched heeltaps that have been lying exposed all night to the air who does not know the aspect of an expired feast  the field of action strewed with the dead my boy says clives father see heres the glass on the floor yet and a great stain of claret on the carpet  oh father says clive hanging his head down i know i shouldnt have done it but barnes newcome would provoke the patience of job and i couldnt bear to have my father insulted  i am big enough to fight my own battles my boy the colonel said goodnaturedly putting his hand on the lads damp head how your head throbs if barnes laughed at my singing depend upon it sir there was something ridiculous in it and he laughed because he could not help it if he behaved ill we should not and to a man who is eating our salt too and is of our blood  he is ashamed of our blood father cries clive still indignant  we ought to be ashamed of doing wrong we must go and ask his pardon once when i was a young man in india the father continued very gravely some hot words passed at messnot such an insult as that of last night i dont think i could have quite borne thatand people found fault with me for forgiving the youngster who had uttered the offensive expressions over his wine some of my acquaintance sneered at my courage and that is a hard imputation for a young fellow of spirit to bear but providentially you see it was wartime and very soon after i had the good luck to show that i was not a poule mouillee as the french call it and the man who insulted me and whom i forgave became my fastest friend and died by my sideit was poor jack cutlerat argaum we must go and ask barnes newcomes pardon sir and forgive other peoples trespasses my boy if we hope forgiveness of our own his voice sank down as he spoke and he bowed his honest head reverently i have heard his son tell the simple story years afterwards with tears in his eyes  piccadilly was hardly yet awake the next morning and the sparkling dews and the poor homeless vagabonds still had possession of the grass of hyde park as the pair walked up to sir brian newcomes house where the shutters were just opening to let in the day the housemaid who was scrubbing the steps of the house and washing its trim feet in a manner which became such a polite mansions morning toilet knew master clive and smiled at him from under her blousy curlpapers admitting the two gentlemen into sir brians diningroom where they proposed to wait until mr barnes should appear there they sate for an hour looking at lawrences picture of lady anne leaning over a harp attired in white muslin at harlowes portrait of mrs newcome with her two sons simpering at her knees painted at a time when the newcome brothers were not the baldheaded redwhiskered british merchants with whom the reader has made acquaintance but chubby children with hair flowing down their backs and quaint little swallowtailed jackets and nankeen trousers a splendid portrait of the late earl of kew in his peers robes hangs opposite his daughter and her harp we are writing of george the fourths reign i dare say there hung in the room a fine framed print of that great sovereign the chandelier is in a canvas bag the vast sideboard whereon are erected open frames for the support of sir brian newcomes grand silver trays which on dinner days gleam on that festive board now groans under the weight of sir brians bluebooks an immense receptacle for wine shaped like a roman sarcophagus lurks under the sideboard two people sitting at that large diningtable must talk very loud so as to make themselves heard across those great slabs of mahogany covered with damask the butler and servants who attend at the table take a long time walking round it i picture to myself two persons of ordinary size sitting in that great room at that great table far apart in neat evening costume sipping a little sherry silent genteel and glum and think the great and wealthy are not always to be envied and that there may be more comfort and happiness in a snug parlour where you are served by a brisk little maid than in a great dark dreary dininghall where a funereal majordomo and a couple of stealthy footmen minister to you your muttonchops they come and lay the cloth presently wide as the mainsheet of some tall ammiral a pile of newspapers and letters for the master of the house the newcome sentinel old county paper moderate conservative in which our worthy townsman and member is praised his benefactions are recorded and his speeches given at full length the newcome independent in which our precious member is weekly described as a ninny and informed almost every thursday morning that he is a bloated aristocrat as he munches his dry toast heaps of letters county papers times and morning herald for sir brian newcome little heaps of letters dinner and soiree cards most of these and morning post for mr barnes punctually as eight oclock strikes that young gentleman comes to breakfast his father will lie yet for another hour the baronets prodigious labours in the house of commons keeping him frequently out of bed till sunrise  as his cousin entered the room clive turned very red and perhaps a faint blush might appear on barness pallid countenance he came in a handkerchief in one hand a pamphlet in the other and both hands being thus engaged he could offer neither to his kinsmen  you are come to breakfast i hope he saidcalling it weakfast and pronouncing the words with a most languid drawlor perhaps you want to see my father he is never out of his room till halfpast nine harper did sir brian come in last night before or after me harper the butler thinks sir brian came in after mr barnes  when that functionary had quitted the room barnes turned round to his uncle in a candid smiling way and said the fact is sir i dont know when i came home myself very distinctly and cant of course tell about my father generally you know there are two candles left in the hall you know and if there are two you know i know of course that my father is still at the house but last night after that capital song you sang hang me if i know what happened to me i beg your pardon sir im shocked at having been so overtaken such a confounded thing doesnt happen to me once in ten years i do trust i didnt do anything rude to anybody for i thought some of your friends the pleasantest fellows i ever met in my life and as for the claret gad as if i hadnt had enough after dinner i brought a quantity of it away with me on my shirtfront and waistcoat  i beg your pardon barnes clive said blushing deeply and im very sorry indeed for what passed i threw it  the colonel who had been listening with a queer expression of wonder and doubt on his face here interrupted mr barnes it was clive thatthat spilled the wine over you last night thomas newcome said the young rascal had drunk a great deal too much wine and had neither the use of his head nor his hands and this morning i have given him a lecture and he has come to ask your pardon for his clumsiness and if you have forgotten your share in the nights transaction i hope you have forgotten his and will accept his hand and his apology  apology theres no apology cries barnes holding out a couple of fingers of his hand but looking towards the colonel i dont know what happened any more than the dead did we have a row were there any glasses broken the best way in such cases is to sweep em up we cant mend them  the colonel said gravelythat he was thankful to find that the disturbance of the night before had no worse result he pulled the tail of clives coat when that unlucky young blunderer was about to trouble his cousin with indiscreet questions or explanations and checked his talk the other night you saw an old man in drink my boy he said and to what shame and degradation the old wretch had brought himself wine has given you a warning too which i hope you will remember all your life no one has seen me the worse for drink these forty years and i hope both you young gentlemen will take counsel by an old soldier who fully preaches what he practises and beseeches you to beware of the bottle  after quitting their kinsman the kind colonel further improved the occasion with his son and told him out of his own experience many stories of quarrels and duels and winehow the wine had occasioned the brawls and the foolish speech overnight the bloody meeting at morning how he had known widows and orphans made by hot words uttered in idle orgies how the truest honour was the manly confession of wrong and the best courage the courage to avoid temptation the humbleminded speaker whose advice contained the best of all wisdom that which comes from a gentle and reverent spirit and a pure and generous heart never for once thought of the effect which he might be producing but uttered his simple say according to the truth within him indeed he spoke out his mind pretty resolutely on all subjects which moved or interested him and clive his son and his honest chum mr binnie who had a great deal more reading and much keener intelligence than the colonel were amused often at his naive opinion about men or books or morals mr clive had a very fine natural sense of humour which played perpetually round his fathers simple philosophy with kind and smiling comments between this pair of friends the superiority of wit lay almost from the very first on the younger mans side but on the other hand clive felt a tender admiration for his fathers goodness a loving delight in contemplating his elders character which he has never lost and which in the trials of their future life inexpressibly cheered and consoled both of them beati illi o man of the world whose wearied eyes may glance over this page may those who come after you so regard you o generous boy who read in it may you have such a friend to trust and cherish in youth and in future days fondly and proudly to remember  some four or five weeks after the quasireconciliation between clive and his kinsman the chief part of sir brian newcomes family were assembled at the breakfasttable together where the meal was taken in common and at the early hour of eight unless the senator was kept too late in the house of commons overnight and lady anne and her nursery were now returned to london again little alfred being perfectly set up by a month of brighton air it was a thursday morning on which day of the week it has been said the newcome independent and the newcome sentinel both made their appearance upon the baronets table the household from above and from below the maids and footmen from the basement the nurses children and governesses from the attics all poured into the room at the sound of a certain bell  i do not sneer at the purpose for which at that chiming eightoclock bell the household is called together the urns are hissing the plate is shining the father of the house standing up reads from a gilt book for three or four minutes in a measured cadence the members of the family are around the table in an attitude of decent reverence the younger children whisper responses at their mothers knees the governess worships a little apart the maids and the large footmen are in a cluster before their chairs the upper servants performing their devotion on the other side of the sideboard the nurse whisks about the unconscious lastborn and tosses it up and down during the ceremony i do not sneer at thatat the act at which all these people are assembledit is at the rest of the day i marvel at the rest of the day and what it brings at the very instant when the voice has ceased speaking and the gilded book is shut the world begins again and for the next twentythree hours and fiftyseven minutes all that household is given up to it the servile squad rises up and marches away to its basement whence should it happen to be a galaday those tall gentlemen at present attired in oxford mixture will issue forth with flour plastered on their heads yellow coats pink breeches skyblue waistcoats silver lace buckles in their shoes black silk bags on their backs and i dont know what insane emblems of servility and absurd bedizenments of folly their very manner of speaking to what we call their masters and mistresses will be a like monstrous masquerade you know no more of that race which inhabits the basement floor than of the men and brethren of timbuctoo to whom some among us send missionaries if you met some of your servants in the streets i respectfully suppose for a moment that the reader is a person of high fashion and a great establishment you would not know their faces you might sleep under the same roof for half a century and know nothing about them if they were ill you would not visit them though you would send them an apothecary and of course order that they lacked for nothing you are not unkind you are not worse than your neighbours nay perhaps if you did go into the kitchen or to take the tea in the servantshall you would do little good and only bore the folks assembled there but so it is with those fellowchristians who have been just saying amen to your prayers you have scarcely the community of charity they come you dont know whence they think and talk you dont know what they die and you dont care or vice versa they answer the bell for prayers as they answer the bell for coals for exactly three minutes in the day you all kneel together on one carpetand the desires and petitions of the servants and masters over the rite called family worship is ended  exeunt servants save those two who warm the newspaper administer the muffins and serve out the tea sir brian reads his letters and chumps his dry toast ethel whispers to her mother she thinks eliza is looking very ill lady anne asks which is eliza is it the woman that was ill before they left town if she is ill mrs trotter had better send her away mrs trotter is only a great deal too goodnatured she is always keeping people who are ill then her ladyship begins to read the morning post and glances over the names of the persons who were present at baroness boscos ball and mrs toddle tompkynss soiree dansante in belgrave square  everybody was there says barnes looking over from his paper  but who is mrs toddle tompkyns asks mamma who ever heard of a mrs toddle tompkyns what do people mean by going to such a person  lady popinjoy asked the people barnes says gravely the thing was really doosed well done the woman looked frightened but shes pretty and i am told the daughter will have a great lot of money  is she pretty and did you dance with her asks ethel  me dance says mr barnes we are speaking of a time before casinos were and when the british youth were by no means so active in dancing practice as at this present period barnes resumed the reading of his county paper but presently laid it down with an execration so brisk and loud that his mother gave a little outcry and even his father looked up from his letters to ask the meaning of an oath so unexpected and ungenteel  my uncle the colonel of sepoys and his amiable son have been paying a visit to newcomethats the news which i have the pleasure to announce to you says mr barnes  you are always sneering about our uncle breaks in ethel with impetuous voice and saying unkind things about clive our uncle is a dear good kind man and i love him he came to brighton to see us and went out every day for hours and hours with alfred and clive too drew pictures for him and he is good and kind and generous and honest as his father and barnes is always speaking ill of him behind his back  and his aunt lets very nice lodgings and is altogether a most desirable acquaintance says mr barnes what a shame it is that we have not cultivated that branch of the family  my dear fellow cries sir brian i have no doubt miss honeyman is a most respectable person nothing is so ungenerous as to rebuke a gentleman or a lady on account of their poverty and i coincide with ethel in thinking that you speak of your uncle and his son in terms which to say the least are disrespectful  miss honeyman is a dear little old woman breaks in ethel was not she kind to alfred mamma and did not she make him nice jelly and a doctor of divinityyou know clives grandfather was a doctor of divinity mamma theres a picture of him in a wigis just as good as a banker you know he is  did you bring some of miss honeymans lodginghouse cards with you ethel says her brother and had we not better hang up one or two in lombard street hers and our other relations mrs mason  my darling love who is mrs mason asks lady anne  another member of the family maam she was cousin  she was no such thing sir roars sir brian  she was relative and housemaid of my grandfather during his first marriage she acted i believe as dry nurse to the distinguished colonel of sepoys my uncle she has retired into private life in her native town of newcome and occupies her latter days by the management of a mangle the colonel and young pothouse have gone down to spend a few days with their elderly relative its all here in the paper by jove mr barnes clenched his fist and stamped upon the newspaper with much energy  and so they should go down and see her and so the colonel should love his nurse and not forget his relations if they are old and poor cries ethel with a flush on her face and tears starting into her eyes  hear what the newcome papers say about it shrieks out mr barnes his voice quivering his little eyes flashing out scorn its in both the papers i dare say it will be in the times tomorrow by  its delightful our paper only mentions the gratifying circumstance here is the paragraph lieutenantcolonel newcome cb a distinguished indian officer and younger brother of our respected townsman and representative sir brian newcome bart has been staying for the last week at the kings arms in our city he has been visited by the principal inhabitants and leading gentlemen of newcome and has come among us as we understand in order to pass a few days with an elderly relative who has been living for many years past in great retirement in this place  well i see no great harm in that paragraph says sir brian i wish my brother had gone to the roebuck and not to the kings arms as the roebuck is our house but he could not be expected to know much about the newcome inns as he is a new comer himself and i think it was very right of the people to call on him  now hear what the independent says and see if you like that sir cries barnes grinning fiercely and he began to read as follows  mr independenti was born and bred a screwcomite and am naturally proud of everybody and everything which bears the revered name of screwcome i am a briton and a man though i have not the honour of a vote for my native borough if i had you may be sure i would give it to our admired and talented representative don pomposo lickspittle grindpauper poor house agincourt screwcome whose ancestors fought with julius caesar against william the conqueror and whose father certainly wielded a cloth yard shaft in london not fifty years ago   don pomposo as you know seldom favours the town o screwcome with a visitour gentry are not of ancient birth enough to be welcome to a lady screwcome our manufacturers make their money by trade oh fie i how can it be supposed that such vulgarians should be received among the aristocratic society of screwcome house two balls in the season and ten dozen o gooseberry are enough for them  its that scoundrel parrot burst out sir brian because i wouldnt have any more wine of himno its vidler the apothecary by heavens lady anne i told you it would be so why didnt you ask the miss vidlers to your ball  they were on the list cries lady anne three of them i did everything i could i consulted mr vidler for poor alfred and he actually stopped and saw the dear child take the physic why were they not asked to the ball cries her ladyship bewildered i declare to gracious goodness i dont know  barnes scratched their names cries ethel out of the list mamma you know you did barnes you said you had gallipots enough  i dont think it is like vidlers writing said mr barnes perhaps willing to turn the conversation i think it must be that villain duff the baker who made the song about us at the last electionbut hear the rest of the paragraph and he continued to read  the screwcomites are at this moment favoured with a visit from a gentleman of the screwcome family who having passed all his life abroad is somewhat different from his relatives whom we all so love and honour this distinguished gentleman this gallant soldier has come among us not merely to see our manufacturesin which screwcome can vie with any city in the northbut an old servant and relation of his family whom he is not above recognising who nursed him in his early days who has been living in her native place for many years supported by the generous bounty of colonel n the gallant officer accompanied by his son a fine youth has taken repeated drives round our beautiful environs in one of friend taplows of the kings arms open drags and accompanied by mrs  now an aged lady who speaks with tears in her eyes of the goodness and gratitude of her gallant soldier  one day last week they drove to screwcome house will it be believed that though the house is only four miles distant from our citythough don pomposos family have inhabited it these twelve years for four or five months every yearmrs m saw her cousins house for the first time has never set eyes upon those grandees except in public places since the day when they honoured the county by purchasing the estate which they own  i have as i repeat no vote for the borough but if i had oh wouldnt i show my respectful gratitude at the next election and plump for pomposo i shall keep my eye upon him and am mr independentyour constant reader peeping tom  the spirit of radicalism abroad in this country said sir brian newcome crushing his eggshell desperately is dreadful really dreadful we are on the edge of a positive volcano down went the eggspoon into its crater the worst sentiments are everywhere publicly advocated the licentiousness of the press has reached a pinnacle which menaces us with ruin there is no law which these shameless newspapers respect no rank which is safe from their attacks no ancient landmark which the lavaflood of democracy does not threaten to overwhelm and destroy  when i was at spielburg barnes newcome remarked kindly i saw three longbearded puttyfaced blaguards pacin up and down a little courtyard and count keppenheimer told me they were three damned editors of milanese newspapers who had had seven years of imprisonment already and last year when keppenheimer came to shoot at newcome i showed him that old thief old batters the proprietor of the independent and potts his infernal ally driving in a dogcart and i said to him keppenheimer i wish we had a place where we could lock up some of our infernal radicals of the press or that you could take off those two villains to spielburg and as we were passin that infernal potts burst out laughin in my face and cut one of my pointers over the head with his whip we must do something with that independent sir  we must says the father solemnly we must put it down barnes we must put it down  i think says barnes we had best give the railway advertisements to batters  but that makes the man of the sentinel so angry says the elder persecutor of the press  then let us give tom potts some shootin at any rate the ruffian is always poachin about our covers as it is speers should be written to sir to keep a lookout upon batters and that villain his accomplice and to be civil to them and that sort of thing and damn it to be down upon them whenever he sees the opportunity  during the above conspiracy for bribing or crushing the independence of a great organ of british opinion miss ethel newcome held her tongue but when her papa closed the conversation by announcing solemnly that he would communicate with speers ethel turning to her mother said mamma is it true that grandpapa has a relation living at newcome who is old and poor  my darling child how on earth should i know says lady anne i daresay mr newcome had plenty of poor relations  i am sure some on your side anne have been good enough to visit me at the bank said sir brian who thought his wifes ejaculation was a reflection upon his family whereas it was the statement of a simple fact in natural history this person was no relation of my fathers at all she was remotely connected with his first wife i believe she acted as servant to him and has been most handsomely pensioned by the colonel  who went to her like a kind dear good brave uncle as he is cried ethel the very day i go to newcome ill go to see her she caught a look of negation in her fathers eyei will gothat is if papa will give me leave says miss ethel  by gad sir says barnes i think it is the very best thing she could do and the best way of doing it ethel can go with one of the boys and take mrs whatdoyoucallem a gown or a tract or that sort of thing and stop that infernal independents mouth  if we had gone sooner said miss ethel simply there would not have been all this abuse of us in the paper to which statement her worldly father and brother perforce agreeing we may congratulate good old mrs mason upon the new and polite acquaintances she is about to make     chapter xv the old ladies   the above letter and conversation will show what our active colonels movements and history had been since the last chapter in which they were recorded he and clive took the liverpool mail and travelled from liverpool to newcome with a postchaise and a pair of horses which landed them at the kings arms the colonel delighted in postchaisingthe rapid transit through the country amused him and cheered his spirits besides had he not dr johnsons word for it that a swift journey in a postchaise was one of the greatest enjoyments in life and a sojourn in a comfortable inn one of its chief pleasures in travelling he was as happy and noisy as a boy he talked to the waiters and made friends with the landlord got all the information which he could gather regarding the towns into which he came and drove about from one sight or curiosity to another with indefatigable goodhumour and interest it was good for clive to see men and cities to visit mills manufactories country seats cathedrals he asked a hundred questions regarding all things round about him and any one caring to know who thomas newcome was and what his rank and business found no difficulty in having his questions answered by the simple and kindly traveller  mine host of the kings arms mr taplow aforesaid knew in five minutes who his guest was and the errand on which he came was not colonel newcomes name painted on all his trunks and boxes was not his servant ready to answer all questions regarding the colonel and his son newcome pretty generally introduced clive to my landlord when the latter brought his guest his bottle of wine with oldfashioned cordiality the colonel would bid the landlord drink a glass of his own liquor and seldom failed to say to him this is my son sir we are travelling together to see the country every english gentleman should see his own country first before he goes abroad as we intend to do afterwardsto make the grand tour and i will thank you to tell me what there is remarkable in your town and what we ought to seeantiquities manufactures and seats in the neighbourhood we wish to see everything sireverything elaborate diaries of these home tours are still extant in clives boyish manuscript and the colonels dashing handwritingquaint records of places visited and alarming accounts of inn bills paid  so mr taplow knew in five minutes that his guest was a brother of sir brian their member and saw the note despatched by an ostler to mrs sarah mason jubilee row announcing that the colonel had arrived and would be with her after his dinner mr taplow did not think fit to tell his guest that the house sir brian usedthe blue housewas the roebuck not the kings arms might not the gentlemen be of different politics mr taplows wine knew none  some of the jolliest fellows in all newcome use the boscawen room at the kings arms as their club and pass numberless merry evenings and crack countless jokes there  duff the baker old mr vidler when he can get away from his medical labours and his hand shakes it must be owned very much now and his nose is very red parrot the auctioneer and that amusing dog tom potts the talented reporter of the independentwere pretty constant attendants at the kings arms and colonel newcomes dinner was not over before some of these gentlemen knew what dishes he had had how he had called for a bottle of sherry and a bottle of claret like a gentleman how he had paid the postboys and travelled with a servant like a topsawyer that he was come to shake hands with an old nurse and relative of his family every one of those jolly britons thought well of the colonel for his affectionateness and liberality and contrasted it with the behaviour of the tory baronettheir representative  his arrival made a sensation in the place the blue club at the roebuck discussed it as well as the uncompromising liberals at the kings arms mr speers sir brians agent did not know how to act and advised sir brian by the next nights mail the reverend dr bulders the rector left his card  meanwhile it was not gain or business but only love and gratitude which brought thomas newcome to his fathers native town their dinner over away went the colonel and clive guided by the ostler their previous messenger to the humble little tenement which thomas newcomes earliest friend inhabited the good old woman put her spectacles into her bible and flung herself into her boys armsher boy who was more than fifty years old she embraced clive still more eagerly and frequently than she kissed his father she did not know her colonel with them whiskers clive was the very picture of the dear boy as he had left her almost twoscore years ago and as fondly as she hung on the boy her memory had ever clung round that early time when they were together the good soul told endless tales of her darlings childhood his frolics and beauty today was uncertain to her but the past was still bright and clear as they sat prattling together over the bright teatable attended by the trim little maid whose services the colonels bounty secured for his old nurse the kind old creature insisted on having clive by her side again and again she would think he was actually her own boy forgetting in that sweet and pious hallucination that the bronzed face and thinned hair and melancholy eyes of the veteran before her were those of her nursling of old days so for near half the space of mans allotted life he had been absent from her and day and night wherever he was in sickness or health in sorrow or danger her innocent love and prayers had attended the absent darling not in vain not in vain does he live whose course is so befriended let us be thankful for our race as we think of the love that blesses some of us surely it has something of heaven in it and angels celestial may rejoice in it and admire it  having nothing whatever to do our colonels movements are of course exceedingly rapid and he has the very shortest time to spend in any single place that evening saturday and the next day sunday when he will faithfully accompany his dear old nurse to church and what a festival is that day for her when she has her colonel and that beautiful brilliant boy of his by her side and mr hicks the curate looking at him and the venerable dr bulders himself eyeing him from the pulpit and all the neighbours fluttering and whispering to be sure who can be that fine military gentleman and that splendid young man sitting by old mrs mason and leading her so affectionately out of church that saturday and sunday the colonel will pass with good old mason but on monday he must be off on tuesday he must be in london he has important business in londonin fact tom hamilton of his regiment comes up for election at the oriental on that day and on such an occasion could thomas newcome be absent he drives away from the kings arms through a row of smirking chambermaids smiling waiters and thankful ostlers accompanied to the postchaise of which the obsequious taplow shuts the door and the boscawen room pronounces him that night to be a trump and the whole of the busy town ere the next day is over has heard of his coming and departure praised his kindliness and generosity and no doubt contrasted it with the different behaviour of the baronet his brother who has gone for some time by the ignominious sobriquet of screwcome in the neighbourhood of his ancestral hall  dear old nurse mason will have a score of visits to make and to receive at all of which you may be sure that triumphal advent of the colonels will be discussed and admired mrs mason will show her beautiful new india shawl and her splendid bible with the large print and the affectionate inscription from thomas newcome to his dearest old friend her little maid will exhibit her new gown the curate will see the bible and mrs bulders will admire the shawl and the old friends and humble companions of the good old lady as they take their sunday walks by the pompous lodgegates of newcome park which stand with the baronets newfangled arms over them gilded and filagreed and barred will tell their stories too about the kind colonel and his hard brother when did sir brian ever visit a poor old womans cottage or his bailiff exempt from the rent what good action except a few thin blankets and beggarly coal and soup tickets did newcome park ever do for the poor and as for the colonels wealth lord bless you hes been in india these fiveandthirty years the baronets money is a drop in the sea to his the colonel is the kindest the best the richest of men these facts and opinions doubtless inspired the eloquent pen of peeping tom when he indited the sarcastic epistle to the newcome independent which we perused over sir brian newcomes shoulder in the last chapter  and you may be sure thomas newcome had not been many weeks in england before good little miss honeyman at brighton was favoured with a visit from her dear colonel the envious gawler scowling out of his bowwindow where the flyblown card still proclaimed that his lodgings were unoccupied had the mortification to behold a yellow postchaise drive up to miss honeymans door and having discharged two gentlemen from within trot away with servant and baggage to some house of entertainment other than gawlers whilst this wretch was cursing his own ill fate and execrating yet more deeply miss honeymans better fortune the worthy little lady was treating her colonel to a sisterly embrace and a solemn reception hannah the faithful housekeeper was presented and had a shake of the hand the colonel knew all about hannah ere he had been in england a week a basket containing pots of jam of her confection and a tongue of hannahs curing had arrived for the colonel that very night when his servant had lodged colonel newcomes effects at the neighbouring hotel hannah was in possession of one of the colonels shirts she and her mistress having previously conspired to make a dozen of those garments for the family benefactor  all the presents which newcome had ever transmitted to his sisterinlaw from india had been taken out of the cotton and lavender in which the faithful creature kept them it was a fine hot day in june but i promise you miss honeyman wore her blazing scarlet cashmere shawl her great brooch representing the taj of agra was in her collar and her bracelets she used to say i am given to understand they are called bangles my dear by the natives decorated the sleeves round her lean old hands which trembled with pleasure as they received the kind grasp of the colonel of colonels how busy those hands had been that morning what custards they had whippedwhat a triumph of piecrusts they had achieved before colonel newcome had been ten minutes in the house the celebrated vealcutlets made their appearance was not the whole house adorned in expectation of his coming had not mr kuhn the affable foreign gentleman of the firstfloor lodgers prepared a french dish was not betty on the lookout and instructed to put the cutlets on the fire at the very moment when the colonels carriage drove up to her mistresss door the good womans eyes twinkled the kind old hand and voice shook as holding up a bright glass of madeira miss honeyman drank the colonels health i promise you my dear colonel says she nodding her head adorned with a bristling superstructure of lace and ribbons i promise you that i can drink your health in good wine the wine was of his own sending and so were the china firescreens and the sandalwood workbox and the ivory cardcase and those magnificent pink and white chessmen carved like little sepoys and mandarins with the castles on elephants backs george the third and his queen in pink ivory against the emperor of china and lady in whitethe delight of clives childhood the chief ornament of the old spinsters sittingroom  miss honeymans little feast was pronounced to be the perfection of cookery and when the meal was over came a noise of little feet at the parlour door which being opened there appeared first a tall nurse with a dancing baby second and third two little girls with little frocks little trousers long ringlets blue eyes and blue ribbons to match fourth master alfred now quite recovered from his illness and holding by the hand fifth miss ethel newcome blushing like a rose  hannah grinning acted as mistress of the ceremonies calling out the names of miss newcomes master newcomes to see the colonel if you please maam bobbing a curtsey and giving a knowing nod to master clive as she smoothed her new silk apron hannah too was in new attire all crisp and rustling in the colonels honour miss ethel did not cease blushing as she advanced towards her uncle and the honest campaigner started up blushing too mr clive rose also as little alfred of whom he was a great friend ran towards him clive rose laughed nodded at ethel and ate gingerbread nuts all at the same time as for colonel thomas newcome and his niece they fell in love with each other instantaneously like prince camaralzaman and the princess of china  i have turned away one artist the poor creature was utterly incompetent to depict the sublime graceful and pathetic personages and events with which this history will most assuredly abound and i doubt whether even the designer engaged in his place can make such a portrait of miss ethel newcome as shall satisfy her friends and her own sense of justice that blush which we have indicated he cannot render how are you to copy it with a steel point and a ball of printers ink that kindness which lights up the colonels eyes gives an expression to the very wrinkles round about them shines as a halo round his facewhat artist can paint it the painters of old when they portrayed sainted personages were fain to have recourse to compasses and gold leafas if celestial splendour could be represented by dutch metal as our artist cannot come up to this task the reader will be pleased to let his fancy paint for itself the look of courtesy for a woman admiration for a young beauty protection for an innocent child all of which are expressed upon the colonels kind face as his eyes are set upon ethel newcome  mamma has sent us to bid you welcome to england uncle says miss ethel advancing and never thinking for a moment of laying aside that fine blush which she brought into the room and which is her pretty symbol of youth and modesty and beauty  he took a little slim white hand and laid it down on his brown palm where it looked all the whiter he cleared the grizzled mustachio from his mouth and stooping down he kissed the little white hand with a great deal of grace and dignity there was no point of resemblance and yet a something in the girls look voice and movements which caused his heart to thrill and an image out of the past to rise up and salute him the eyes which had brightened his youth and which he saw in his dreams and thoughts for faithful years afterwards as though they looked at him out of heaven seemed to shine upon him after fiveandthirty years he remembered such a fair bending neck and clustering hair such a light foot and airy figure such a slim hand lying in his ownand now parted from it with a gap of ten thousand long days between it is an old saying that we forget nothing as people in fever begin suddenly to talk the language of their infancy we are stricken by memory sometimes and old affections rush back on us as vivid as in the time when they were our daily talk when their presence gladdened our eyes when their accents thrilled in our ears when with passionate tears and grief we flung ourselves upon their hopeless corpses parting is death at least as far as life is concerned a passion comes to an end it is carried off in a coffin or weeping in a postchaise it drops out of life one way or other and the earthclods close over it and we see it no more but it has been part of our souls and it is eternal does a mother not love her dead infant a man his lost mistress with the fond wife nestling at his sideyes with twenty children smiling round her knee no doubt as the old soldier held the girls hand in his the little talisman led him back to hades and he saw leonora  how do you do uncle say girls nos 2 and 3 in a pretty little infantile chorus he drops the talisman he is back in common life againthe dancing baby in the arms of the bobbing nurse babbles a welcome alfred looks up for a while at his uncle in the white trousers and then instantly proposes that clive should make him some drawings and is on his knees at the next moment he is always climbing on somebody or something or winding over chairs curling through banisters standing on somebodys head or his own headas his convalescence advances his breakages are fearful miss honeyman and hannah will talk about his dilapidations for years after the little chap has left them when he is a jolly young officer in the guards and comes to see them at brighton they will show him the bluedragon chayny jar on which he would sit and which he cried so fearfully upon breaking  when this little party has gone out smiling to take its walk on the seashore the colonel sits down and resumes the interrupted dessert miss honeyman talks of the children and their mother and the merits of mr kuhn and the beauty of miss ethel glancing significantly towards clive who has had enough of gingerbread nuts and dessert and wine and whose youthful nose is by this time at the window what kindhearted woman young or old does not love matchmaking  the colonel without lifting his eyes from the table says she reminds him ofof somebody he knew once  indeed cries miss honeyman and thinks emma must have altered very much after going to india for she had fair hair and white eyelashes and not a pretty foot certainlybut my dear good lady the colonel is not thinking of the late mrs casey  he has taken a fitting quantity of the madeira the artless greeting of the people here young and old has warmed his heart and he goes upstairs to pay a visit to his sisterinlaw to whom he makes his most courteous bow as becomes a lady of her rank ethel takes her place quite naturally beside him during his visit where did he learn those fine manners which all of us who knew him admired in him he had a natural simplicity an habitual practice of kind and generous thoughts a pure mind and therefore above hypocrisy and affectationperhaps those french people with whom he had been intimate in early life had imparted to him some of the traditional graces of their vieille tourcertainly his halfbrothers had inherited none such what is this that barnes has written about his uncle that the colonel is ridiculous lady anne said to her daughter that night your uncle is adorable i have never seen a more perfect grand seigneur he puts me in mind of my grandfather though grandpapas grand manner was more artificial and his voice spoiled by snuff see the colonel he smokes round the garden but with what perfect grace this is the man uncle hobson and your poor dear papa have represented to us as a species of bear mr newcome who has himself the ton of a waiter the colonel is perfect what can barnes mean by ridiculing him i wish barnes had such a distinguished air but he is like his poor dear papa que voulezvous my love the newcomes are honourable the newcomes are wealthy but distinguishedno i never deluded myself with that notion when i married your poor dear papa at once i pronounce colonel newcome a person to be in every way distinguished by us on our return to london i shall present him to all our family poor good man let him see that his family have some presentable relations besides those whom he will meet at mrs newcomes in bryanstone square you must go to bryanstone square immediately we return to london you must ask your cousins and their governess and we will give them a little party mrs newcome is insupportable but we must never forsake our relatives ethel when you come out you will have to dine there and to go to her ball every young lady in your position in the world has sacrifices to make and duties to her family to perform look at me why did i marry your poor dear papa from duty has your aunt fanny who ran away with captain canonbury been happy they have eleven children and are starving at boulogne think of three of fannys boys in yellow stockings at the bluecoat school your papa got them appointed i am sure my papa would have gone mad if he had seen that day she came with one of the poor wretches to park lane but i could not see them my feelings would not allow me when my maidi had a french maid then louise you remember her conduct was abominable so was previlleswhen she came and said that my lady fanny was below with a young gentleman qui portait des bas jaunes i could not see the child i begged her to come up in my room and absolutely that i might not offend her i went to bed that wretch louise met her at boulogne and told her afterwards good night we must not stand chattering here any more heaven bless you my darling those are the colonels windows look he is smoking on his balconythat must be clives room clive is a good kind boy it was very kind of him to draw so many pictures for alfred put the drawings away ethel mr smee saw some in park lane and said they showed remarkable genius what a genius your aunt emily had for drawing but it was flowers i had no genius in particular so mamma used to sayand doctor belper said my dear lady walham it was before my grandpapas death has miss anne a genius for sewing buttons and making puddenspuddens he pronounced it goodnight my own love blessings blessings on my ethel  the colonel from his balcony saw the slim figure of the retreating girl and looked fondly after her and as the smoke of his cigar floated in the air he formed a fine castle in it whereof clive was lord and that pretty ethel lady what a frank generous bright young creature is yonder thought he how cheery and gay she is how good to miss honeyman to whom she behaved with just the respect that was the old ladys duehow affectionate with her brothers and sisters what a sweet voice she has what a pretty little white hand it is when she gave it me it looked like a little white bird lying in mine i must wear gloves by jove i must and my coat is oldfashioned as binnie says what a fine match might be made between that child and clive she reminds me of a pair of eyes i havent seen these forty years i would like to have clive married to her to see him out of the scrapes and dangers that young fellows encounter and safe with such a sweet girl as that if god had so willed it i might have been happy myself and could have made a woman happy but the fates were against me i should like to see clive happy and then say nunc dimittis i shant want anything more tonight kean and you can go to bed  thank you colonel says kean who enters having prepared his masters bedchamber and is retiring when the colonel calls after him  i say kean is that blue coat of mine very old  uncommon white about the seams colonel says the man  is it older than other peoples coatskean is obliged gravely to confess that the colonels coat is very queer  get me another coat thensee that i dont do anything or wear anything unusual i have been so long out of europe that i dont know the customs here and am not above learning  kean retires vowing that his master is an old trump which opinion he had already expressed to mr kuhn lady hannes man over a long potation which those two gentlemen had taken together and as all of us in one way or another are subject to this domestic criticism from which not the most exalted can escape i say lucky is the man whose servants speak well of him     chapter xvi in which mr sherrick lets his house in fitzroy square   in spite of the sneers of the newcome independent and the colonels unlucky visit to his nurses native place he still remained in high favour in park lane where the worthy gentleman paid almost daily visits and was received with welcome and almost affection at least by the ladies and the children of the house who was it that took the children to astleys but uncle newcome i saw him there in the midst of a cluster of these little people all children together he laughed delighted at mr merrymans jokes in the ring he beheld the battle of waterloo with breathless interest and was amazedamazed by jove sirat the prodigious likeness of the principal actor to the emperor napoleon whose tomb he had visited on his return from india as it pleased him to tell his little audience who sat clustering round him the little girls sir brians daughters holding each by a finger of his honest hands young masters alfred and edward clapping and hurrahing by his side while mr clive and miss ethel sat in the back of the box enjoying the scene but with that decorum which belonged to their superior age and gravity as for clive he was in these matters much older than the grizzled old warrior his father it did one good to hear the colonels honest laughs at clowns jokes and to see the tenderness and simplicity with which he watched over this happy brood of young ones how lavishly did he supply them with sweetmeats between the acts there he sat in the midst of them and ate an orange himself with perfect satisfaction i wonder what sum of money mr barnes newcome would have taken to sit for five hours with his young brothers and sisters in a public box at the theatre and eat an orange in the face of the audience when little alfred went to harrow you may be sure colonel newcome and clive galloped over to see the little man and tipped him royally what money is better bestowed than that of a schoolboys tip how the kindness is recalled by the recipient in after days it blesses him that gives and him that takes remember how happy such benefactions made you in your own early time and go off on the very first fine day and tip your nephew at school  the colonels organ of benevolence was so large that he would have liked to administer bounties to the young folks his nephews and nieces in bryanstone square as well as to their cousins in park lane but mrs newcome was a great deal too virtuous to admit of such spoiling of children she took the poor gentleman to task for an attempt upon her boys when those lads came home for their holidays and caused them ruefully to give back the shining gold sovereign with which their uncle had thought to give them a treat  i do not quarrel with other families says she i do not allude to other families meaning of course that she did not allude to park lane there may be children who are allowed to receive money from their fathers grownup friends there may be children who hold out their hands for presents and thus become mercenary in early life i make no reflections with regard to other households i only look and think and pray for the welfare of my own beloved ones they want for nothing heaven has bounteously furnished us with every comfort with every elegance with every luxury why need we be bounden to others who have been ourselves so amply provided i should consider it ingratitude colonel newcome want of proper spirit to allow my boys to accept money mind i make no allusions when they go to school they receive a sovereign apiece from their father and a shilling a week which is ample pocketmoney when they are at home i desire that they may have rational amusements i send them to the polytechnic with professor hickson who kindly explains to them some of the marvels of science and the wonders of machinery i send them to the picturegalleries and the british museum i go with them myself to the delightful lectures at the institution in albemarle street i do not desire that they should attend theatrical exhibitions i do not quarrel with those who go to plays far from it who am i that i should venture to judge the conduct of others when you wrote from india expressing a wish that your boy should be made acquainted with the works of shakspeare i gave up my own opinion at once should i interpose between a child and his father i encouraged the boy to go to the play and sent him to the pit with one of our footmen  and you tipped him very handsomely my dear maria too said the goodnatured colonel breaking in upon her sermon but virtue was not to be put off in that way  and why colonel newcome virtue exclaimed laying a pudgy little hand on its heart why did i treat clive so because i stood towards him in loco parentis because he was as a child to me and i to him as a mother i indulged him more than my own i loved him with a true maternal tenderness then he was happy to come to our house then perhaps park lane was not so often open to him as bryanstone square but i make no allusions then he did not go six times to another house for once that he came to mine he was a simple confiding generous boy was not dazzled by worldly rank or titles of splendour he could not find these in bryanstone square a merchants wife a country lawyers daughteri could not be expected to have my humble board surrounded by titled aristocracy i would not if i could i love my own family too well i am too honest too simplelet me own it at once colonel newcome too proud and now now his father has come to england and i have resigned him and he meets with no titled aristocrats at my house and he does not come here any more  tears rolled out of her little eyes as she spoke and she covered her round face with her pockethandkerchief  had colonel newcome read the paper that morning he might have seen amongst what are called the fashionable announcements the cause perhaps why his sisterinlaw had exhibited so much anger and virtue the morning post stated that yesterday sir brian and lady newcome entertained at dinner his excellency the persian ambassador and bucksheesh bey the right honourable cannon rowe president of the board of control and lady louisa rowe the earl of h the countess of kew the earl of kew sir currey baughton majorgeneral and mrs hooker colonel newcome and mr horace fogey afterwards her ladyship had an assembly which was attended by etc etc  this catalogue of illustrious names had been read by mr newcome to her spouse at breakfast with such comments as she was in the habit of making  the president of the board of control the chairman of the court of directors and exgovernorgeneral of india and a whole regiment of kews by jove maria the colonel is in good company cries mr newcome with a laugh thats the sort of dinner you should have given him some people to talk about india when he dined with us he was put between old lady wormely and professor roots i dont wonder at his going to sleep after dinner i was off myself once or twice during that confounded long argument between professor roots and dr windus that windus is the deuce to talk  dr windus is a man of science and his name is of european celebrity says maria solemnly any intellectual person would prefer such company to the titled nobodies into whose family your brother has married  there you go polly you are always having a shy at lady anne and her relations says mr newcome goodnaturedly  a shy how can you use such vulgar words mr newcome what have i to do with sir brians titled relations i do not value nobility i prefer people of sciencepeople of intellectto all the rank in the world  so you do says hobson her spouse you have your partylady anne has her party you take your linelady anne takes her line you are a superior woman my dear polly every one knows that im a plain country farmer i am as long as you are happy i am happy too the people you get to dine here may talk greek or algebra for what i care by jove my dear i think you can hold your own with the best of them  i have endeavoured by assiduity to make up for time lost and an early imperfect education says mrs newcome you married a poor country lawyers daughter you did not seek a partner in the peerage mr newcome  no no not such a confounded flat as that cries mr newcome surveying his plump partner behind her silver teapot with eyes of admiration  i had an imperfect education but i knew its blessings and have i trust endeavoured to cultivate the humble talents which heaven has given me mr newcome  humble by jove exclaims the husband no gammon of that sort polly you know well enough that you are a superior woman i aint a superior man i know that one is enough in a family i leave the reading to you my dear here comes my horses i say i wish youd call on lady anne today do go and see her now thats a good girl i know she is flighty and that and brians back is up a little but he aint a bad fellow and i wish i could see you and his wife better friends  on his way to the city mr newcome rode to look at the new house no 120 fitzroy square which his brother the colonel had taken in conjunction with that indian friend of his mr binnie shrewd old cock mr binnie has brought home a good bit of money from india is looking out for safe investments has been introduced to newcome brothers mr newcome thinks very well of the colonels friend  the house is vast but it must be owned melancholy not long since it was a ladies school in an unprosperous condition the scar left by madame latours brass plate may still be seen on the tall black door cheerfully ornamented in the style of the end of the last century with a funereal urn in the centre of the entry and garlands and the skulls of rams at each corner madame latour who at one time actually kept a large yellow coach and drove her parlour young ladies in the regents park was an exile from her native country islington was her birthplace and grigson her paternal name and an outlaw at the suit of samuel sherrick that mr sherrick whose winevaults undermine lady whittleseas chapel where the eloquent honeyman preaches  the house is mr sherricks house some say his name is shadrach and pretend to have known him as an orangeboy afterwards as a chorussinger in the theatres afterwards as secretary to a great tragedian i know nothing of these stories he may or he may not be a partner of mr campion of shepherds inn he has a handsome villa abbey road st johns wood entertains good company rather loud of the sporting sort rides and drives very showy horses has boxes at the opera whenever he likes and free access behind the scenes is handsome dark brighteyed with a quantity of jewellery and a tuft to his chin sings sweetly sentimental songs after dinner who cares a fig what was the religion of mr sherricks ancestry or what the occupation of his youth mr honeyman a most respectable man surely introduced sherrick to the colonel and binnie  mr sherrick stocked their cellar with some of the wine over which honeyman preached such lovely sermons it was not dear it was not bad when you dealt with mr sherrick for wine alone going into his market with ready money in your hand as our simple friends did you were pretty fairly treated by mr sherrick  the house being taken we may be certain there was fine amusement for clive mr binnie and the colonel in frequenting the sales in the inspection of upholsterers shops and the purchase of furniture for the new mansion it was like nobody elses house there were three masters with four or five servants over them kean for the colonel and his son a smart boy with boots for mr binnie mrs kean to cook and keep house with a couple of maids under her the colonel himself was great at making hash mutton hotpot curry and pillau what cosy pipes did we not smoke in the diningroom in the drawingroom or where we would what pleasant evenings did we not have with mr binnies books and schiedam then there were the solemn state dinners at most of which the writer of this biography had a corner  clive had a tutorcirindey of corpuswhom we recommended to him and with whom the young gentleman did not fatigue his brains very much but his great forte decidedly lay in drawing he sketched the horses he sketched the dogs all the servants from the bleareyed bootboy to the rosycheeked lass mrs keans niece whom that virtuous housekeeper was always calling to come downstairs he drew his father in all posturesasleep on foot on horseback and jolly little mr binnie with his plump legs on a chair or jumping briskly on the back of the cob which he rode he should have drawn the pictures for this book but that he no longer condescends to make sketches young ridley was his daily friend now and grindley his classics and mathematics over in the morning and the ride with father over this pair of young men would constantly attend gandishs drawing academy where to be sure ridley passed many hours at work on his art before his young friend and patron could be spared from his books to his pencil  oh says clive if you talk to him now about those early days it was a jolly time i do not believe there was any young fellow in london so happy and there hangs up in his paintingroom now a head painted at one sitting of a man rather bald with hair touched with grey with a large moustache and a sweet mouth half smiling beneath it and melancholy eyes and clive shows that portrait of their grandfather to his children and tells them that the whole world never saw a nobler gentleman     chapter xvii a school of art   british art either finds her peculiar nourishment in melancholy and loves to fix her abode in desert places or it may be her purse is but slenderly furnished and she is forced to put up with accommodations rejected by more prosperous callings some of the most dismal quarters of the town are colonised by her disciples and professors in walking through streets which may have been gay and polite when ladies chairmen jostled each other on the pavement and linkboys with their torches lighted the beaux over the mud who has not remarked the artists invasion of those regions once devoted to fashion and gaiety centre windows of drawingrooms are enlarged so as to reach up into bedroomsbedrooms where lady betty has had her hair powdered and where the painters northlight now takes possession of the place which her toilettable occupied a hundred years ago there are degrees in decadence after the fashion chooses to emigrate and retreats from soho or bloomsbury let us say to cavendish square physicians come and occupy the vacant houses which still have a respectable look the windows being cleaned and the knockers and plates kept bright and the doctors carriage rolling round the square almost as fine as the countesss which has whisked away her ladyship to other regions a boardinghouse mayhap succeeds the physician who has followed after his sick folks into the new country and then dick tinto comes with his dingy brass plate and breaks in his north window and sets up his sitters throne i love his honest moustache and jaunty velvet jacket his queer figure his queer vanities and his kind heart why should he not suffer his ruddy ringlets to fall over his shirtcollar why should he deny himself his velvet it is but a kind of fustian which costs him eighteenpence a yard he is naturally what he is and breaks out into costume as spontaneously as a bird sings or a bulb bears a tulip and as dick under yonder terrific appearance of waving cloak bristling beard and shadowy sombrero is a good kindly simple creature got up at a very cheap rate his life is so consistent with his dress he gives his genius a darkling swagger and a romantic envelope which being removed you find not a bravo but a kind chirping soul not a moody poet avoiding mankind for the better company of his own great thoughts but a jolly little chap who has an aptitude for painting brocade gowns a bit of armour with figures inside them or trees and cattle or gondolas and buildings or what not an instinct for the picturesque which exhibits itself in his works and outwardly on his person beyond this a gentle creature loving his friends his cups feasts merrymakings and all good things the kindest folks alive i have found among those scowling whiskeradoes they open oysters with their yataghans toast muffins on their rapiers and fill their venice glasses with halfandhalf if they have money in their lean purses be sure they have a friend to share it what innocent gaiety what jovial suppers on threadbare cloths and wonderful songs after what pathos merriment humour does not a man enjoy who frequents their company mr clive newcome who has long since shaved his beard who has become a family man and has seen the world in a thousand different phases avers that his life as an artstudent at home and abroad was the pleasantest part of his whole existence it may not be more amusing in the telling than the chronicle of a feast or the accurate report of two lovers conversation but the biographer having brought his hero to the period of his life is bound to relate it before passing to other occurrences which are to be narrated in their turn  we may be sure the boy had many conversations with his affectionate guardian as to the profession which he should follow as regarded mathematical and classical learning the elder newcome was forced to admit that out of every hundred boys there were fifty as clever as his own and at least fifty more industrious the army in time of peace colonel newcome thought a bad trade for a young fellow so fond of ease and pleasure as his son his delight in the pencil was manifest to all were not his schoolbooks full of caricatures of the masters whilst his tutor grindley was lecturing him did he not draw grindley instinctively under his very nose a painter clive was determined to be and nothing else and clive being then some sixteen years of age began to study the art en regle under the eminent mr gandish of soho  it was that wellknown portraitpainter alfred smee esq ra who recommended gandish to colonel newcome one day when the two gentlemen met at dinner at lady anne newcomes table mr smee happened to examine some of clives drawings which the young fellow had executed for his cousins clive found no better amusement than in making pictures for them and would cheerfully pass evening after evening in that diversion he had made a thousand sketches of ethel before a year was over a year every day of which seemed to increase the attractions of the fair young creature develop her nymphlike form and give her figure fresh graces he also of course drew alfred and the nursery in general aunt anne and the blenheim spaniels and mr kuhn and his earrings the majestic john bringing in the coalscuttle and all persons or objects in that establishment with which he was familiar what a genius the lad has the complimentary mr smee averred what a force and individuality there is in all his drawings look at his horses capital by jove capital and alfred on his pony and miss ethel in her spanish hat with her hair flowing in the wind i must take this sketch i positively must now and show it to landseer and the courtly artist daintily enveloped the drawing in a sheet of paper put it away in his hat and vowed subsequently that the great painter had been delighted with the young mans performance smee was not only charmed with clives skill as an artist but thought his head would be an admirable one to paint such a rich complexion such fine turns in his hair such eyes to see real blue eyes was so rare nowadays and the colonel too if the colonel would but give him a few sittings the grey uniform of the bengal cavalry the silver lace the little bit of red ribbon just to warm up the picture it was seldom mr smee declared that an artist could get such an opportunity for colour with our hideous vermilion uniforms there was no chance of doing anything rubens himself could scarcely manage scarlet look at the horseman in cuyps famous picture at the louvre the red was a positive blot upon the whole picture there was nothing like french grey and silver all which did not prevent mr smee from painting sir brian in a flaring deputylieutenants uniform and entreating all military men whom he met to sit to him in scarlet clive newcome the academician succeeded in painting of course for mere friendships sake and because he liked the subject though he could not refuse the cheque which colonel newcome sent him for the frame and picture but no cajoleries could induce the old campaigner to sit to any artist save one he said he should be ashamed to pay fifty guineas for the likeness of his homely face he jocularly proposed to james binnie to have his head put on the canvas and mr smee enthusiastically caught at the idea but honest james winked his droll eyes saying his was a beauty that did not want any paint and when mr smee took his leave after dinner in fitzroy square where this conversation was held james binnie hinted that the academician was no better than an old humbug in which surmise he was probably not altogether incorrect certain young men who frequented the kind colonels house were also somewhat of this opinion and made endless jokes at the painters expense smee plastered his sitters with adulation as methodically as he covered his canvas he waylaid gentlemen at dinner he inveigled unsuspecting folks into his studio and had their heads off their shoulders before they were aware one day on our way from the temple through howland street to the colonels house we beheld majorgeneral sir thomas de boots in full uniform rushing from smees door to his brougham the coachman was absent refreshing himself at a neighbouring tap the little streetboys cheered and hurrayed sir thomas as arrayed in gold and scarlet he sate in his chariot he blushed purple when he beheld us no artist would have dared to imitate those purple tones he was one of the numerous victims of mr smee  one day then day to be noted with a white stone colonel newcome with his son and mr smee ra walked from the colonels house to gandishs which was not far removed thence and young clive who was a perfect mimic described to his friends and illustrated as was his wont by diagrams the interview which he had with that professor by jove you must see gandish pa cries clive gandish is worth the whole world come and be an artstudent youll find such jolly fellows there gandish calls it hartstudent and says hars est celare hartemby jove he does he treated us to a little latin as he brought out a cake and a bottle of wine you know  the governor was splendid sir he wore gloves you know he only puts them on on parade days and turned out for the occasion spick and span he ought to be a general officer he looks like a fieldmarshaldont he you should have seen him bowing to mrs gandish and the miss gandishes dressed all in their best round the caketray he takes his glass of wine and sweeps them all round with a bow i hope young ladies says he you dont often go to the students room im afraid the young gentlemen would leave off looking at the statues if you came in and so they would for you never saw such guys but the dear old boy fancies every woman is a beauty  mr smee you are looking at my picture of boadishia says gandish wouldnt he have caught it for his quantities at grey friars thats all  yesahyes says mr smee putting his hand over his eyes and standing before it looking steady you know as if he was going to see whereabouts he should hit boadishia  it was painted when you were a young man four years before you were an associate smee had some success in its time and theres good pints about that picture gandish goes on but i never could get my price for it and here it hangs in my own room igh art wont do in this country colonelits a melancholy fact  high art i should think it

friendwhat did you say was his name i told him rigby for my dear old governor has promised to pay for j j too you know mr chivers is the senior pupil and custos of the room in the absence of my son mr

steps across the courtyard to my own studio there gentlemenand pulling aside a curtain gandish says there  and what was the masterpiece behind it we ask of clive after we have done laughing at his imitation  hand round the hat j j cries clive now ladies and gentlemen pay your money now walk in for the performance is just agoing to begin nor would the rogue ever tell us what gandishs curtained picture was  not a successful painter mr gandish was an excellent master and regarding all artists save one perhaps a good critic clive and his friend j j came soon after and commenced their studies under him the one took his humble seat at the drawingboard a poor meanlooking lad with worn clothes downcast features and a figure almost deformed the other adorned by good health good looks and the best of tailors ushered into the studio with his father and mr smee as his aidesdecamp on his entry and previously announced there with all the eloquence of honest gandish i bet hes ad cake and wine says one youthful student of an epicurean and satirical turn i bet he might have it every day if he liked in fact gandish was always handing him sweetmeats of compliments and cordials of approbation he had coatsleeves with silk liningshe had studs in his shirt how different was the texture and colour of that garment to the sleeves bob grimes displayed when he took his coat off to put on his working jacket horses used actually to come for him to gandishs door which was situated in a certain lofty street in soho the miss gs would smile at him from the parlour window as he mounted and rode splendidly off and those opposition beauties the miss levisons daughters of the professor of dancing over the way seldom failed to greet the young gentleman with an admiring ogle from their great black eyes master clive was pronounced an outandouter a swell and no mistake and complimented with scarce one dissentient voice by the simple academy at gandishs besides he drew very well there could be no doubt about that caricatures of the students of course were passing constantly among them and in revenge for one which a huge redhaired scotch student mr sandy mcollop had made of john james clive perpetrated a picture of sandy which set the whole room in a roar and when the caledonian giant uttered satirical remarks against the assembled company averring that they were a parcel of sneaks a set of lickspittles and using epithets still more vulgar clive slipped off his fine silksleeved coat in an instant invited mr mcollop into the backyard instructed him in a science which the lad himself had acquired at grey friars and administered two black eyes to sandy which prevented the young artist from seeing for some days after the head of the laocoon which he was copying the scotchmans superior weight and age might have given the combat a different conclusion had it endured long after clives brilliant opening attack with his right and left but professor gandish came out of his paintingroom at the sound of battle and could scarcely credit his own eyes when he saw those of poor mcollop so darkened to do the scotchman justice he bore clive no rancour they became friends there and afterwards at rome whither they subsequently went to pursue their studies the fame of mr mcollop as an artist has long since been established his pictures of lord lovat in prison and hogarth painting him of the blowing up of the kirk of field painted for mcollop of mcollop of the torture of the covenanters the murder of the regent the murder of rizzio and other historical pieces all of course from scotch history have established his reputation in south as well as in north britain no one would suppose from the gloomy character of his works that sandy mcollop is one of the most jovial souls alive within six months after their little difference clive and he were the greatest of friends and it was by the formers suggestion that mr james binnie gave sandy his first commission who selected the cheerful subject of the young duke of rothsay starving in prison  during this period mr clive assumed the toga virilis and beheld with inexpressible satisfaction the first growth of those mustachios which have since given him such a marked appearance  being at gandishs and so near the dancing academy what must he do but take lessons in the terpsichorean art toomaking himself as popular with the dancing folks as with the drawing folks and the jolly king of his company everywhere he gave entertainments to his fellowstudents in the upper chambers in fitzroy square which were devoted to his use inviting his father and mr binnie to those parties now and then and songs were sung and pipes were smoked and many a pleasant supper eaten there was no stint but no excess no young man was ever seen to quit those apartments the worse as it is called for liquor fred bayhams uncle the bishop could not be more decorous than f b as he left the colonels house for the colonel made that one of the conditions of his sons hospitality that nothing like intoxication should ensue from it the good gentleman did not frequent the parties of the juniors he saw that his presence rather silenced the young men and left them to themselves confiding in clives parole and went away to play his honest rubber of whist at the club and many a time he heard the young fellows steps tramping by his bedchamber door as he lay wakeful within happy to think his son was happy     chapter xviii new companions   clive used to give droll accounts of the young disciples at gandishs who were of various ages and conditions and in whose company the young fellow took his place with that good temper and gaiety which have seldom deserted him in life and have put him at ease wherever his fate has led him he is in truth as much at home in a fine drawingroom as in a publichouse parlour and can talk as pleasantly to the polite mistress of the mansion as to the jolly landlady dispensing her drinks from her bar not one of the gandishites but was after a while well inclined to the young fellow from mr chivers the senior pupil down to the little imp harry hooker who knew as much mischief at twelve years old and could draw as cleverly as many a student of fiveandtwenty and bob trotter the diminutive fag of the studio who ran on all the young mens errands and fetched them in apples oranges and walnuts clive opened his eyes with wonder when he first beheld these simple feasts and the pleasure with which some of the young men partook of them they were addicted to polonies they did not disguise their love for banbury cakes they made bets in gingerbeer and gave and took the odds in that frothing liquor there was a young hebrew amongst the pupils upon whom his brotherstudents used playfully to press ham sandwiches pork sausages and the like this young man who has risen to great wealth subsequently and was bankrupt only three months since actually bought cocoanuts and sold them at a profit amongst the lads his pockets were never without pencilcases french chalk garnet brooches for which he was willing to bargain he behaved very rudely to gandish who seemed to be afraid before him it was whispered that the professor was not altogether easy in his circumstances and that the elder moss had some mysterious hold over him honeyman and bayham who once came to see clive at the studio seemed each disturbed at beholding young moss seated there making a copy of the marsyas pa knows both those gents he informed clive afterwards with a wicked twinkle of his oriental eyes step in mr newcome any day you are passing down wardour street and see if you dont want anything in our way he pronounced the words in his own way saying step id bister doocob ady day idto vordor street etc this young gentleman could get tickets for almost all the theatres which he gave or sold and gave splendid accounts at cavendishs of the brilliant masquerades clive was greatly diverted at beholding mr moss at one of these entertainments dressed in a scarlet coat and topboots and calling out yoicks hark forward fitfully to another orientalist his younger brother attired like a midshipman once clive bought a halfdozen of theatre tickets from mr moss which he distributed to the young fellows of the studio but when this nice young man tried further to tempt him on the next day mr moss clive said to him with much dignity i am very much obliged to you for your offer but when i go to the play i prefer paying at the doors  mr chivers used to sit in one corner of the room occupied over a lithographic stone he was an uncouth and peevish young man for ever finding fault with the younger pupils whose butt he was next in rank and age was mcollop before named and these two were at first more than usually harsh and captious with clive whose prosperity offended them and whose dandified manners freeandeasy ways and evident influence over the younger scholars gave umbrage to these elderly apprentices clive at first returned mr chivers war for war controlment for controlment but when he found chivers was the son of a helpless widow that he maintained her by his lithographic vignettes for the musicsellers and by the scanty remuneration of some lessons which he gave at a school at highgatewhen clive saw or fancied he saw the lonely senior eyeing with hungry eyes the luncheons of cheese and bread and sweetstuff which the young lads of the studio enjoyed i promise you mr clives wrath against chivers was speedily turned into compassion and kindness and he sought and no doubt found means of feeding chivers without offending his testy independence  nigh to gandishs was and perhaps is another establishment for teaching the art of designbarkers which had the additional dignity of a life academy and costume frequented by a class of students more advanced than those of gandishs between these and the barkerites there was a constant rivalry and emulation in and out of doors gandish sent more pupils to the royal academy gandish had brought up three medallists and the last ra student sent to rome was a gandishite barker on the contrary scorned and loathed trafalgar square and laughed at its art barker exhibited in pall mall and suffolk street he laughed at old gandish and his pictures made mincemeat of his angli and angeli and tore king alfred and his muffins to pieces the young men of the respective schools used to meet at lundys coffeehouse and billiardroom and smoke there and do battle before clive and his friend j j came to gandishs the barkerites were having the best of that constant match which the two academies were playing fred bayham who knew every coffeehouse in town and whose initials were scored on a thousand tavern doors was for a while a constant visitor at lundys played pool with the young men and did not disdain to dip his beard into their porterpots when invited to partake of their drink treated them handsomely when he was in cash himself and was an honorary member of barkers academy nay when the guardsman was not forthcoming who was standing for one of barkers heroic pictures bayham bared his immense arms and brawny shoulders and stood as prince edward with philippa sucking the poisoned wound he would take his friends up to the picture in the exhibition and proudly point to it look at that biceps sir and now look at thisthats barkers masterpiece sir and thats the muscle of f b sir in no company was f b greater than in the society of the artists in whose smoky haunts and airy parlours he might often be found it was from f b that clive heard of mr chivers struggles and honest industry a great deal of shrewd advice could f b give on occasion and many a kind action and gentle office of charity was this jolly outlaw known to do and cause to be done his advice to clive was most edifying at this time of our young gentlemans life and he owns that he was kept from much mischief by this queer counsellor  a few months after clive and j j had entered at gandishs that academy began to hold its own against its rival the silent young disciple was pronounced to be a genius his copies were beautiful in delicacy and finish his designs were for exquisite grace and richness of fancy mr gandish took to himself the credit for j js genius clive ever and fondly acknowledged the benefit he got from his friends taste and bright enthusiasm and sure skill as for clive if he was successful in the academy he was doubly victorious out of it his person was handsome his courage high his gaiety and frankness delightful and winning his money was plenty and he spent it like a young king he could speedily beat all the club at lundys at billiards and give points to the redoubted f b himself he sang a famous song at their jolly supperparties and j j had no greater delight than to listen to his fresh voice and watch the young conqueror at the billiardtable where the balls seemed to obey him  clive was not the most docile of mr gandishs pupils if he had not come to the studio on horseback several of the young students averred gandish would not always have been praising him and quoting him as that professor certainly did it must be confessed that the young ladies read the history of clives uncle in the book of baronets and that gandish jun probably with an eye to business made a design of a picture in which according to that veracious volume one of the newcomes was represented as going cheerfully to the stake at smithfield surrounded by some very illfavoured dominicans whose arguments did not appear to make the least impression upon the martyr of the newcome family sandy mcollop devised a counter picture wherein the barbersurgeon of king edward the confessor was drawn operating upon the beard of that monarch to which piece of satire clive gallantly replied by a design representing sawney bean mcollop chief of the clan of that name descending from his mountains into edinburgh and his astonishment at beholding a pair of breeches for the first time these playful jokes passed constantly amongst the young men of gandishs studio there was no one there who was not caricatured in one way or another he whose eyes looked not very straight was depicted with a most awful squint the youth whom nature had endowed with somewhat lengthy nose was drawn by the caricaturists with a prodigious proboscis little bobby moss the young hebrew artist from wardour street was delineated with three hats and an oldclothes bag nor were poor j js round shoulders spared until clive indignantly remonstrated at the hideous hunchback pictures which the boys made of his friend and vowed it was a shame to make jokes at such a deformity  our friend if the truth must be told regarding him though one of the most frank generous and kindhearted persons is of a nature somewhat haughty and imperious and very likely the course of life which he now led and the society which he was compelled to keep served to increase some original defects in his character and to fortify a certain disposition to think well of himself with which his enemies not unjustly reproach him he has been known very pathetically to lament that he was withdrawn from school too early where a couple of years further course of thrashings from his tyrant old hodge he avers would have done him good he laments that he was not sent to college where if a young man receives no other discipline at least he acquires that of meeting with his equals in society and of assuredly finding his betters whereas in poor mr gandishs studio of art our young gentleman scarcely found a comrade that was not in one way or other his flatterer his inferior his honest or dishonest admirer the influence of his familys rank and wealth acted more or less on all those simple folks who would run on his errands and vied with each other in winning the young nabobs favour his very goodness of heart rendered him a more easy prey to their flattery and his kind and jovial disposition led him into company from which he had been much better away i am afraid that artful young moss whose parents dealt in pictures furniture gimcracks and jewellery victimised clive sadly with rings and chains shirtstuds and flaming shirtpins and such vanities which the poor young rogue locked up in his desk generally only venturing to wear them when he was out of his fathers sight or of mr binnies whose shrewd eyes watched him very keenly  mr clive used to leave home every day shortly after noon when he was supposed to betake himself to gandishs studio but was the young gentleman always at the drawingboard copying from the antique when his father supposed him to be so devotedly engaged i fear his place was sometimes vacant his friend j j worked every day and all day many a time the steady little student remarked his patrons absence and no doubt gently remonstrated with him but when clive did come to his work he executed it with remarkable skill and rapidity and ridley was too fond of him to say a word at home regarding the shortcomings of the youthful scapegrace candid readers may sometimes have heard their friend joness mother lament that her darling was working too hard at college or harrys sisters express their anxiety lest his too rigorous attendance in chambers after which he will persist in sitting up all night reading those dreary law books which cost such an immense sum of money should undermine dear henrys health and to such acute persons a word is sufficient to indicate young mr clive newcomes proceedings meanwhile his father who knew no more of the world than harrys simple sisters or joness fond mother never doubted that all clives doings were right and that his boy was the best of boys  if that young man goes on as charmingly as he has begun clives cousin barnes newcome said of his kinsman he will be a paragon i saw him last night at vauxhall in company with young moss whose father does bills and keeps the bricabrac shop in wardour street two or three other gentlemen probably young oldclothesmen who had concluded for the day the labours of the bag joined mr newcome and his friend and they partook of rackpunch in an arbour he is a delightful youth cousin clive and i feel sure he is about to be an honour to our family     chapter xix the colonel at home   our good colonels house had received a coat of paint which like madame latours rouge in her latter days only served to make her careworn face look more ghastly the kitchens were gloomy the stables were gloomy great black passages cracked conservatory dilapidated bathroom with melancholy waters moaning and fizzing from the cistern the great large blank stone staircasewere all so many melancholy features in the general countenance of the house but the colonel thought it perfectly cheerful and pleasant and furnished it in his roughandready way one day a cartload of chairs the next a waggonful of fenders fireirons and glass and crockerya quantity of supplies in a word he poured into the place there were a yellow curtain in the back drawingroom and green curtains in the front the carpet was an immense bargain bought dirt cheap sir at a sale in euston square he was against the purchase of a carpet for the stairs what was the good of it what did men want with staircarpets his own apartment contained a wonderful assortment of lumber shelves which he nailed himself old indian garments camphor trunks what did he want with gewgaws anything was good enough for an old soldier but the spare bedroom was endowed with all sorts of splendour a bed as big as a generals tent a cheval glasswhereas the colonel shaved in a little cracked mirror which cost him no more than king stephens breechesand a handsome new carpet while the boards of the colonels bedchamber were as bareas bare as old miss scraggs shoulders which would be so much more comfortable were they covered up mr binnies bedchamber was neat snug and appropriate and clive had a study and bedroom at the top of the house which he was allowed to furnish entirely according to his own taste how he and ridley revelled in wardour street what delightful coloured prints of hunting racing and beautiful ladies did they not purchase mount with their own hands cut out for screens frame and glaze and hang up on the walls when the rooms were ready they gave a party inviting the colonel and mr binnie by note of hand two gentlemen from lamb court temple mr honeyman and fred bayham we must have fred bayham fred bayham frankly asked is mr sherrick with whom you have become rather intimate latelyand mind you i say nothing but i recommend strangers in london to be cautious about their friendsis mr sherrick coming to you young un because if he is f b must respectfully decline  mr sherrick was not invited and accordingly f b came but sherrick was invited on other days and a very queer society did our honest colonel gather together in that queer house so dreary so dingy so comfortless so pleasant he who was one of the most hospitable men alive loved to have his friends around him and it must be confessed that the evening parties now occasionally given in fitzroy square were of the oddest assemblage of people the correct east india gentlemen from hanover square the artists clives friends gentlemen of all ages with all sorts of beards in every variety of costume now and again a stray schoolfellow from grey friars who stared as well he might at the company in which he found himself sometimes a few ladies were brought to these entertainments the immense politeness of the good host compensated some of them for the strangeness of his company they had never seen such oddlooking hairy men as those young artists nor such wonderful women as colonel newcome assembled together he was good to all old maids and poor widows retired captains with large families of daughters found in him their best friend he sent carriages to fetch them and bring them back from the suburbs where they dwelt gandish mrs gandish and the four miss gandishes in scarlet robes were constant attendants at the colonels soirees  i delight sir in the ospitality of my distinguished military friend mr gandish would say the harmy has always been my passioni served in the soho volunteers three years myself till the conclusion of the war sir till the conclusion of the war  it was a great sight to see mr frederick bayham engaged in the waltz or the quadrille with some of the elderly houris at the colonels parties f b like a goodnatured f b as he was always chose the plainest women as partners and entertained them with profound compliments and sumptuous conversation the colonel likewise danced quadrilles with the utmost gravity waltzing had been invented long since his time but he practised quadrilles when they first came in about 1817 in calcutta to see him leading up a little old maid and bowing to her when the dance was ended and performing cavalier seul with stately simplicity was a sight indeed to remember if clive newcome had not such a fine sense of humour he would have blushed for his fathers simplicityas it was the elders guileless goodness and childlike trustfulness endeared him immensely to his son look at the old boy pendennis he would say look at him leading up that old miss tidswell to the piano doesnt he do it like an old duke i lay a wager she thinks she is going to be my motherinlaw all the women are in love with him young and old should he upbraid there she goes ill own that hell prevail and sing as sweetly as a nightingale oh you old warbler look at fathers old head bobbing up and down wouldnt he do for sir roger de coverley how do you do uncle charlesi say mcollop how gets on the duke of whatdyecallem starving in the castlegandish says its very good the lad retires to a group of artists mr honeyman comes up with a faint smile playing on his features like moonlight on the facade of lady whittleseas chapel  these parties are the most singular i have ever seen whispers honeyman in entering one of these assemblies one is struck with the immensity of london and with the sense of ones own insignificance without i trust departing from my clerical character nay from my very avocation as incumbent of a london chapeli have seen a good deal of the world and here is an assemblage no doubt of most respectable persons on scarce one of whom i ever set eyes till this evening where does my good brother find such characters  that says mr honeymans interlocutor is the celebrated though neglected artist professor gandish whom nothing but jealousy has kept out of the royal academy surely you have heard of the great gandish  indeed i am ashamed to confess my ignorance but a clergyman busy with his duties knows little perhaps too little of the fine arts  gandish sir is one of the greatest geniuses on whom our ungrateful country ever trampled he exhibited his first celebrated picture of alfred in the neatherds hut he says he is the first who ever touched that subject in 180 but lord nelsons death and victory of trafalgar occupied the public attention at that time and gandishs work went unnoticed in the year 1816 he painted his great work of boadicea you see her before you that lady in yellow with a light front and a turban boadicea became mrs gandish in that year so late as 27 he brought before the world his non angli sed angeli two of the angels are yonder in seagreen dressesthe misses gandish the youth in berlin gloves was the little male angelus of that piece  how came you to know all this you strange man says mr honeyman  simply because gandish has told me twenty times he tells the story to everybody every time he sees them he told it today at dinner boadicea and the angels came afterwards  satire satire mr pendennis says the divine holding up a reproving finger of lavender kid beware of a wicked witbut when a man has that tendency i know how difficult it is to restrain my dear colonel good evening you have a great reception tonight that gentlemans bass voice is very fine mr pendennis and i were admiring it the wolf is a song admirably adapted to show its capabilities  mr gandishs autobiography had occupied the whole time of the retirement of the ladies from colonel newcomes dinnertable mr hobson newcome had been asleep during the performance sir curry baughton and one or two of the colonels professional and military guests silent and puzzled honest mr binnie with his shrewd goodhumoured face sipping his claret as usual and delivering a sly joke now and again to the gentlemen at his end of the table mrs newcome had sat by him in sulky dignity was it that lady baughtons diamonds offended herher ladyship and her daughters being attired in great splendour for a court ball which they were to attend that evening was she hurt because she was not invited to that royal entertainment as the festivities were to take place at an early hour the ladies bidden were obliged to quit the colonels house before the evening part commenced from which lady anne declared she was quite vexed to be obliged to run away  lady anne newcome had been as gracious on this occasion as her sisterinlaw had been out of humour everything pleased her in the house she had no idea that there were such fine houses in that quarter of the town she thought the dinner so very nicethat mr binnie such a goodhumouredlooking gentleman that stout gentleman with his collars turned down like lord byron so exceedingly clever and full of information a celebrated artist was he courtly mr smee had his own opinion upon that point but did not utter it all those artists are so eccentric and amusing and clever before dinner she insisted upon seeing clives den with its pictures and casts and pipes you horrid young wicked creature have you begun to smoke already she asks as she admires his room she admired everything nothing could exceed her satisfaction  the sistersinlaw kissed on meeting with that cordiality so delightful to witness in sisters who dwell together in unity it was my dear maria what an age since i have seen you my dear anne our occupations are so engrossing our circles are so different in a languid response from the other sir brian is not coming i suppose now colonel she turns in a frisky manner towards him and taps her fan did i not tell you sir brian would not come  he is kept at the house of commons my dear those dreadful committees he was quite vexed at not being able to come  i know i know dear anne there are always excuses to gentlemen in parliament i have received many such mr shaloo and mr msheny the leaders of our party often and often disappoint me i knew brian would not come my husband came down from marble head on purpose this morning nothing would have induced us to give up our brothers party  i believe you i did come down from marble head this morning and i was four hours in the hayfield before i came away and in the city till five and ive been to look at a horse afterwards at tattersalls and im as hungry as a hunter and as tired as a hodman says mr newcome with his hands in his pockets how do you do mr pendennis maria you remember mr pendennisdont you  perfectly replies the languid maria mrs gandish colonel topham major mcracken are announced and then in diamonds feathers and splendour lady baughton and miss baughton who are going to the queens ball and sir curry baughton not quite in his deputylieutenants uniform as yet looking very shy in a pair of blue trousers with a glittering stripe of silver down the seams clive looks with wonder and delight at these ravishing ladies rustling in fresh brocades with feathers diamonds and every magnificence aunt anne has not her court dress on as yet and aunt maria blushes as she beholds the new comers having thought fit to attire herself in a high dress with a quakerlike simplicity and a pair of gloves more than ordinarily dingy the pretty little foot she has it is true and sticks it out from habit but what is mrs newcomes foot compared with that sweet little chaussure which miss baughton exhibits and withdraws the shiny white satin slipper the pink stocking which ever and anon peeps from the rustling folds of her robe and timidly retires into its covertthat foot light as it is crushes mrs newcome  no wonder she winces and is angry there are some mischievous persons who rather like to witness that discomfiture all mr smees flatteries that day failed to soothe her she was in the state in which his canvasses sometimes are when he cannot paint on them  what happened to her alone in the drawingroom when the ladies invited to the dinner had departed and those convoked to the soiree began to arrivewhat happened to her or to them i do not like to think the gandishes arrived first boadicea and the angels we judged from the fact that young mr gandish came blushing in to the dessert name after name was announced of persons of whom mrs newcome knew nothing the young and the old the pretty and homely they were all in their best dresses and no doubt stared at mrs newcome so obstinately plain in her attire when we came upstairs from dinner we found her seated entirely by herself tapping her fan at the fireplace timid groups of persons were round about waiting for the irruption of the gentlemen until the pleasure should begin mr newcome who came upstairs yawning was heard to say to his wife oh dam lets cut and they went downstairs and waited until their carriage had arrived when they quitted fitzroy square  mr barnes newcome presently arrived looking particularly smart and lively with a large flower in his buttonhole and leaning on the arm of a friend how do you do pendennis he says with a peculiarly dandified air did you dine here you look as if you dined here and barnes certainly as if he had dined elsewhere i was only asked to the cold soiree who did you have for dinner you had my mamma and the baughtons and my uncle and aunt i know for they are down below in the library waiting for the carriage he is asleep and she is as sulky as a bear  why did mrs newcome say i should find nobody i knew up here asks barness companion on the contrary there are lots of fellows i know theres fred bayham dancing like a harlequin theres old gandish who used to be my drawingmaster and my brighton friends your uncle and cousin barnes what relations are they to me must be some relations fine fellow your cousin  hm growls barnes very fine boynot spirited at allnot fond of flatterynot surrounded by toadiesnot fond of drinkdelightful boy see yonder the young fellow is in conversation with his most intimate friend a little crooked fellow with long hair do you know who he is he is the son of old todmoretons butler upon my life its true  and suppose it is what the deuce do i care cries lord kew who can be more respectable than a butler a man must be somebodys son when i am a middleaged man i hope humbly i shall look like a butler myself suppose you were to put ten of gunters men into the house of lords do you mean to say that they would not look as well as any average ten peers in the house look at lord westcot he is exactly like a butler thats why the country has such confidence in him i never dine with him but i fancy he ought to be at the sideboard here comes that insufferable little old smee how do you do mr smee  mr smee smiles his sweetest smile with his rings diamond shirtstuds and red velvet waistcoat there are few more elaborate middleaged bucks than alfred smee how do you do my dear lord cries the bland one who would ever have thought of seeing your lordship here  why the deuce not mr smee asks lord kew abruptly is it wrong to come here i have been in the house only five minutes and three people have said the same thing to memrs newcome who is sitting downstairs in a rage waiting for her carriage the condescending barnes and yourself why do you come here since how are you mr gandish how do the fine arts go  your lordships kindness in asking for them will cheer them if anything will says mr gandish your noble family has always patronised them i am proud to be reckonised by your lordship in this house where the distinguished father of one of my pupils entertains us this evening a most promising young man is young mr clivetalents for a hamateur really most remarkable  excellent upon my wordexcellent cries mr smee im not an animal painter myself and perhaps dont think much of that branch of the profession but it seems to me the young fellow draws horses with the most wonderful spirit i hope lady walham is very well and that she was satisfied with her sons portrait stockholm i think your brother is appointed to i wish i might be allowed to paint the elder as well as the younger brother my lord  i am an historical painter but whenever lord kew is painted i hope his lordship will think of the old servant of his lordships family charles gandish cries the professor  i am like susannah between the two elders says lord kew let my innocence alone smee mr gandish dont persecute my modesty with your addresses i wont be painted i am not a fit subject for a historical painter mr gandish  halcibiades sat to praxiteles and pericles to phridjas remarks gandish  the cases are not quite similar says lord kew languidly you are no doubt fully equal to praxiteles but i dont see my resemblance to the other party i should not look well as a hero and smee could not paint me handsome enough  i would try my dear lord cries mr smee  i know you would my dear fellow lord kew answered looking at the painter with a lazy scorn in his eyes where is colonel newcome mr gandish mr gandish replied that our gallant host was dancing a quadrille in the next room and the young gentleman walked on towards that apartment to pay his respects to the giver of the evenings entertainment  newcomes behaviour to the young peer was ceremonious but not in the least servile he saluted the others superior rank not his person as he turned the guard out for a general officer he never could be brought to be otherwise than cold and grave in his behaviour to john james nor was it without difficulty when young ridley and his son became pupils at gandishs he could be induced to invite the former to his parties an artist is any mans equal he said i have no prejudice of that sort and think that sir joshua reynolds and doctor johnson were fit company for any person of whatever rank but a young man whose father may have had to wait behind me at dinner should not be brought into my company clive compromises the dispute with a laugh first says he i will wait till i am asked and then i promise i will not go to dine with lord todmoreton     chapter xx contains more particulars of the colonel and his brethren   clives amusements studies or occupations such as they were filled his day pretty completely and caused the young gentlemans time to pass rapidly and pleasantly his father it must be owned had no such resources and the good colonels idleness hung heavily upon him he submitted very kindly to this infliction however as he would have done to any other for clives sake and though he may have wished himself back with his regiment again and engaged in the pursuits in which his life had been spent he chose to consider these desires as very selfish and blameable on his part and sacrificed them resolutely for his sons welfare the young fellow i dare say gave his parent no more credit for his long selfdenial than many other children award to theirs we take such lifeofferings as our due commonly the old french satirist avers that in a love affair there is usually one person who loves and the other qui se laisse aimer it is only in later days perhaps when the treasures of love are spent and the kind hand cold which ministered them that we remember how tender it was how soft to soothe how eager to shield how ready to support and caress the ears may no longer hear which would have received our words of thanks so delightedly let us hope those fruits of love though tardy are yet not all too late and though we bring our tribute of reverence and gratitude it may be to a gravestone there is an acceptance even there for the stricken hearts oblation of fond remorse contrite memories and pious tears i am thinking of the love of clive newcomes father for him and perhaps young reader that of yours and mine for ourselves how the old man lay awake and devised kindnesses and gave his all for the love of his son and the young man took and spent and slept and made merry did we not say at our tales commencement that all stories were old careless prodigals and anxious elders have been from the beginningand so may love and repentance and forgiveness endure even till the end  the stifling fogs the slippery mud the dun dreary november mornings when the regents park where the colonel took his early walk was wrapped in yellow mist must have been a melancholy exchange for the splendour of eastern sunrise and the invigorating gallop at dawn to which for so many years of his life thomas newcome had accustomed himself his obstinate habit of early waking accompanied him to england and occasioned the despair of his london domestics who if master wasnt so awful early would have found no fault with him for a gentleman as gives less trouble to his servants as scarcely ever rings the bell for his self as will brush his own clothes as will even boil his own shavingwater in the little hetna which he keeps up in his dressingroom as pays so regular and never looks twice at the accounts such a man deserved to be loved by his household and i dare say comparisons were made between him and his son who do ring the bells and scold if his boots aint nice and horder about like a young lord but clive though imperious was very liberal and goodhumoured and not the worse served because he insisted upon exerting his youthful authority as for friend binnie he had a hundred pursuits of his own which made his time pass very comfortably he had all the lectures at the british institution he had the geographical society the asiatic society and the political economy club and though he talked year after year of going to visit his relations in scotland the months and seasons passed away and his feet still beat the london pavement  in spite of the cold reception his brothers gave him duty was duty and colonel newcome still proposed or hoped to be well with the female members of the newcome family and having as we have said plenty of time on his hands and living at no very great distance from either of his brothers town houses when their wives were in london the elder newcome was for paying them pretty constant visits but after the good gentleman had called twice or thrice upon his sisterinlaw in bryanstone squarebringing as was his wont a present for this little niece or a book for thatmrs newcome with her usual virtue gave him to understand that the occupation of an english matron who besides her multifarious family duties had her own intellectual culture to mind would not allow her to pass the mornings in idle gossips and of course took great credit to herself for having so rebuked him i am not above instruction of any age says she thanking heaven or complimenting it rather for having created a being so virtuous and humbleminded when professor schroff comes i sit with my children and take lessons in germanand i say my verbs with maria and tommy in the same class yes with curtsies and fine speeches she actually bowed her brother out of doors and the honest gentleman meekly left her though with bewilderment as he thought of the different hospitality to which he had been accustomed in the east where no friends house was ever closed to him where no neighbour was so busy but he had time to make thomas newcome welcome  when hobson newcomes boys came home for the holidays their kind uncle was for treating them to the sights of the town but here virtue again interposed and laid its interdict upon pleasure thank you very much my dear colonel says virtue there never was surely such a kind affectionate unselfish creature as you are and so indulgent for children but my boys and yours are brought up on a very different plan excuse me for saying that i do not think it is advisable that they should even see too much of each other clives company is not good for them  great heavens maria cries the colonel starting up do you mean that my boys society is not good enough for any boy alive  maria turned very red she had said not more than she meant but more than she meant to say my dear colonel how hot we are how angry you indian gentlemen become with us poor women your boy is much older than mine he lives with artists with all sorts of eccentric people our children are bred on quite a different plan hobson will succeed his father in the bank and dear samuel i trust will go into the church i told you before the views i had regarding the boys but it was most kind of you to think of themmost generous and kind  that nabob of ours is a queer fish hobson newcome remarked to his nephew barnes he is as proud as lucifer he is always taking huff about one thing or the other he went off in a fume the other night because your aunt objected to his taking the boys to the play she dont like their going to the play my mother didnt either your aunt is a woman who is uncommon wideawake i can tell you  i always knew sir that my aunt was perfectly aware of the time of the day says barnes with a bow  and then the colonel flies out about his boy and says that my wife insulted him i used to like that boy before his father came he was a good lad enougha jolly brave little fellow  i confess i did not know mr clive at that interesting period of his existence remarks barnes  but since he has taken this madcap freak of turning painter the uncle continues there is no understanding the chap did you ever see such a set of fellows as the colonel had got together at his party the other night dirty chaps in velvet coats and beards they looked like a set of mountebanks and this young clive is going to turn painter  very advantageous thing for the family hell do our pictures for nothing i always said he was a darling boy simpered barnes  darling jackass growled out the senior confound it why doesnt my brother set him up in some respectable business i aint proud i have not married an earls daughter no offence to you barnes  not at all sir i cant help it if my grandfather is a gentleman says barnes with a fascinating smile  the uncle laughs i mean i dont care what a fellow is if he is a good fellow but a painter hang ita painters no trade at alli dont fancy seeing one of our family sticking up pictures for sale i dont like it barnes  hush here comes his distinguished friend mr pendennis whispers barnes and the uncle growling out damn all literary fellowsall artiststhe whole lot of them turns away barnes waves three languid fingers of recognition towards pendennis and when the uncle and nephew have moved out of the club newspaper room little tom eaves comes up and tells the present reporter every word of their conversation  very soon mrs newcome announced that their indian brother found the society of bryanstone square very little to his taste as indeed how should he being a man of a good harmless disposition certainly but of small intellectual culture it could not be helped she had done her utmost to make him welcome and grieved that their pursuits were not more congenial she heard that he was much more intimate in park lane possibly the superior rank of lady annes family might present charms to colonel newcome who fell asleep at her assemblies his boy she was afraid was leading the most irregular life he was growing a pair of mustachios and going about with all sorts of wild associates she found no fault who was she to find fault with any one but she had been compelled to hint that her children must not be too intimate with him and so between one brother who meant no unkindness and another who was all affection and goodwill this undoubting woman created difference distrust dislike which might one day possibly lead to open rupture the wicked are wicked no doubt and they go astray and they fall and they come by their deserts but who can tell the mischief which the very virtuous do  to her sisterinlaw lady anne the colonels society was more welcome the affectionate gentleman never tired of doing kindnesses to his brothers many children and as mr clives pursuits now separated him a good deal from his father the colonel not perhaps without a sigh that fate should so separate him from the society which he loved best in the world consoled himself as best he might with his nephews and nieces especially with ethel for whom his belle passion conceived at first sight never diminished if uncle newcome had a hundred children ethel said who was rather jealous of disposition he would spoil them all he found a fine occupation in breaking a pretty little horse for her of which he made her a present and there was no horse in the park that was so handsome and surely no girl who looked more beautiful than ethel newcome with her broad hat and red ribbon with her thick black locks waving round her bright face galloping along the ride on bhurtpore occasionally clive was at their ridingparties when the colonel would fall back and fondly survey the young people cantering side by side over the grass but by a tacit convention it was arranged that the cousins should be but seldom together the colonel might be his nieces companion and no one could receive him with a more joyous welcome but when mr clive made his appearance with his father at the park lane door a certain gene was visible in miss ethel who would never mount except with colonel newcomes assistance and who especially after mr clives famous mustachios made their appearance rallied him and remonstrated with him regarding those ornaments and treated him with much distance and dignity she asked him if he was going into the army she could not understand how any but military men could wear mustachios and then she looked fondly and archly at her uncle and said she liked none that were not grey  clive set her down as a very haughty spoiled aristocratic young creature if he had been in love with her no doubt he would have sacrificed even those beloved newborn whiskers for the charmer had he not already bought on credit the necessary implements in a fine dressingcase from young moss but he was not in love with her otherwise he would have found a thousand opportunities of riding with her walking with her meeting her in spite of all prohibitions tacit or expressed all governesses guardians mammas punctilios and kind hints from friends for a while mr clive thought himself in love with his cousin than whom no more beautiful young girl could be seen in any park ball or drawingroom and he drew a hundred pictures of her and discoursed about her beauties to j j who fell in love with her on hearsay but at this time mademoiselle saltarelli was dancing at drury lane theatre and it certainly may be said that clives first love was bestowed upon that beauty whose picture of course he drew in most of her favourite characters and for whom his passion lasted until the end of the season when her night was announced tickets to be had at the theatre or of mademoiselle saltarelli buckingham street strand then it was that with a throbbing heart and a fivepound note to engage places for the houris benefit clive beheld madame rogomme mademoiselle saltarellis mother who entertained him in the french language in a dark parlour smelling of onions and oh issuing from the adjoining diningroom where was a dingy vision of a feast and pewter pots upon a darkling tablecloth could that lean scraggy old beetlebrowed yellow face who cried ou es tu donc maman with such a shrill nasal voicecould that elderly vixen be that blooming and divine saltarelli clive drew her picture as she was and a likeness of madame rogomme her mamma a mosaic youth profusely jewelled and scented at once with tobacco and eaudecologne occupied clives stall on mademoiselle saltarellis night it was young mr moss of gandishs to whom newcome ceded his place and who laughed as he always did at clives jokes when the latter told the story of his interview with the dancer paid five pound to see that woman i could have took you behind the scenes or beide the seeds mr moss said and showed her to you for nothing did he take clive behind the scenes over this part of the young gentlemans life without implying the least harm to himfor have not others been behind the scenes and can there be any more dreary object than those whitened and raddled old women who shudder at the slipsover this stage of clive newcomes life we may surely drop the curtain  it is pleasanter to contemplate that kind old face of clives father that sweet young blushing lady by his side as the two ride homewards at sunset the grooms behind in quiet conversation about horses as men never tire of talking about horses ethel wants to know about battles about lovers lamps which she has read of in lalla rookh have you ever seen them uncle floating down the ganges of a night about indian widows did you actually see one burning and hear her scream as you rode up she wonders whether he will tell her anything about clives mother how she must have loved uncle newcome ethel cant bear somehow to think that her name was mrs casey perhaps he was very fond of her though he scarcely ever mentions her name she was nothing like that good old funny miss honeyman at brighton who could the person bea person that her uncle knew ever so long agoa french lady whom her uncle says ethel often resembles that is why he speaks french so well he can recite whole pages out of racine perhaps it was the french lady who taught him and he was not very happy at the hermitage though grandpapa was a very kind good man and he upset papa in a little carriage and was wild and got into disgrace and was sent to india he could not have been very bad ethel thinks looking at him with her honest eyes last week he went to the drawingroom and papa presented him his uniform of grey and silver was quite old yet he looked much grander than sir brian in his new deputylieutenants dress next year when i am presented you must come too sir says ethel i insist upon it you must come too  i will order a new uniform ethel says her uncle  the girl laughs when little egbert took hold of your sword uncle and asked you how many people you had killed do you know i had the same question in my mind and i thought when you went to the drawingroom perhaps the king will knight him but instead he knighted mammas apothecary sir danby jilks that horrid little man and i wont have you knighted any more  i hope egbert wont ask sir danby jilks how many people he has killed says the colonel laughing but thinking the joke too severe upon sir danby and the profession he forthwith apologises by narrating many anecdotes he knows to the credit of surgeons how when the fever broke out on board the ship going to india their surgeon devoted himself to the safety of the crew and died himself leaving directions for the treatment of the patients when he was gone what heroism the doctors showed during the cholera in india and what courage he had seen some of them exhibit in action attending the wounded men under the hottest fire and exposing themselves as readily as the bravest troops ethel declares that her uncle always will talk of other peoples courage and never say a word about his own and the only reason she says which made me like that odious sir thomas de boots who laughs so and looks so red and pays such horrid compliments to all ladies was that he praised you uncle at newcome last year when barnes and he came to us at christmas why did you not come mamma and i went to see your old nurse and we found her such a nice old lady so the pair talk kindly on riding homewards through the pleasant summer twilight mamma had gone out to dinner and there were cards for three parties afterwards oh how i wish it was next year says miss ethel  many a splendid assembly and many a brilliant next year will the ardent and hopeful young creature enjoy but in the midst of her splendour and triumphs buzzing flatterers conquered rivals prostrate admirers no doubt she will think sometimes of that quiet season before the world began for her and that dear old friend on whose arm she leaned while she was yet a young girl  the colonel comes to park street early in the forenoon when the mistress of the house surrounded by her little ones is administering dinner to them he behaves with splendid courtesy to miss quigley the governess and makes a point of taking wine with her and of making a most profound bow during that ceremony miss quigley cannot help thinking colonel newcomes bow very fine she has an idea that his late majesty must have bowed in that way she flutteringly imparts this opinion to lady annes maid who tells her mistress who tells miss ethel who watches the colonel the next time he takes wine with miss quigley and they laugh and then ethel tells him so that the gentleman and the governess have to blush ever after when they drink wine together when she is walking with her little charges in the park or in that beforementioned paradise nigh to apsley house faint signals of welcome appear on her wan cheeks she knows the dear colonel amongst a thousand horsemen if ethel makes for her uncle purses guardchains antimacassars and the like beautiful and useful articles i believe it is in reality miss quigley who does fourfifths of the work as she sits alone in the schoolroom high high up in that lone house when the little ones are long since asleep before her dismal little teatray and her little desk containing her mothers letters and her mementos of home  there are of course numberless fine parties in park lane where the colonel knows he would be very welcome but if there be grand assemblies he does not care to come i like to go to the club best he says to lady anne we talk there as you do here about persons and about jack marrying and tom dying and so forth but we have known jack and tom all our lives and so are interested in talking about them just as you are in speaking of your own friends and habitual society they are people whose names i have sometimes read in the newspaper but whom i never thought of meeting until i came to your house what has an old fellow like me to say to your young dandies or old dowagers  mamma is very odd and sometimes very captious my dear colonel said lady anne with a blush she suffers so frightfully from tic that we are all bound to pardon her  truth to tell old lady kew had been particularly rude to colonel newcome and clive ethels birthday befell in the spring on which occasion she was wont to have a juvenile assembly chiefly of girls of her own age and condition who came accompanied by a few governesses and they played and sang their little duets and choruses together and enjoyed a gentle refection of spongecakes jellies tea and the likethe colonel who was invited to this little party sent a fine present to his favourite ethel and clive and his friend j j made a funny series of drawings representing the life of a young lady as they imagined it and drawing her progress from her cradle upwards now engaged with her doll then with her dancingmaster now marching in her backboard now crying over her german lessons and dressed for her first ball finally and bestowing her hand upon a dandy of preternatural ugliness who was kneeling at her feet as the happy man this picture was the delight of the laughing happy girls except perhaps the little cousins from bryanstone square who were invited to ethels party but were so overpowered by the prodigious new dresses in which their mamma had attired them that they could admire nothing but their rustling pink frocks their enormous sashes their lovely new silk stockings  lady kew coming to london attended on the party and presented her granddaughter with a sixpenny pincushion the colonel had sent ethel a beautiful little gold watch and chain her aunt had complimented her with that refreshing work alisons history of europe richly boundlady kews pincushion made rather a poor figure among the gifts whence probably arose her ladyships illhumour  ethels grandmother became exceedingly testy when the colonel arriving ethel ran up to him and thanked him for the beautiful watch in return for which she gave him a kiss which i dare say amply repaid colonel newcome and shortly after him mr clive arrived looking uncommonly handsome with that smart little beard and mustachio with which nature had recently gifted him as he entered all the girls who had been admiring his pictures began to clap their hands mr clive newcome blushed and looked none the worse for that indication of modesty  lady kew had met colonel newcome a halfdozen times at her daughters house but on this occasion she had quite forgotten him for when the colonel made her a bow her ladyship regarded him steadily and beckoning her daughter to her asked who the gentleman was who has just kissed ethel trembling as she always did before her mother lady anne explained lady kew said oh and left colonel newcome blushing and rather embarrasse de sa personnebefore her  with the clapping of hands that greeted clives arrival the countess was by no means more goodhumoured not aware of her wrath the young fellow who had also previously been presented to her came forward presently to make her his compliments pray who are you she said looking at him very earnestly in the face he told her his name  hm said lady kew i have heard of you and i have heard very little good of you  will your ladyship please to give me your informant cried out colonel newcome  barnes newcome who had condescended to attend his sisters little fete and had been languidly watching the frolics of the young people looked very much alarmed     chapter xxi is sentimental but short   without wishing to disparage the youth of other nations i think a wellbred english lad has this advantage over them that his bearing is commonly more modest than theirs he does not assume the tailcoat and the manners of manhood too early he holds his tongue and listens to his elders his mind blushes as well as his cheeks he does not know how to make bows and pay compliments like the young frenchman nor to contradict his seniors as i am informed american striplings do boys who learn nothing else at our public schools learn at least good manners or what we consider to be such and with regard to the person at present under consideration it is certain that all his acquaintances excepting perhaps his dear cousin barnes newcome agreed in considering him as a very frank manly modest and agreeable young fellowmy friend warrington found a grim pleasure in his company and his bright face droll humour and kindly laughter were always welcome in our chambers honest fred bayham was charmed to be in his society and used pathetically to aver that he himself might have been such a youth had he been blest with a kind father to watch and good friends to guide his early career in fact fred was by far the most didactic of clives bachelor acquaintances pursued the young man with endless advice and sermons and held himself up as a warning to clive and a touching example of the evil consequences of early idleness and dissipation gentlemen of much higher rank in the world took a fancy to the lad captain jack belsize introduced him to his own mess as also to the guard dinner at st jamess and my lord kew invited him to kewbury his lordships house in oxfordshire where clive enjoyed hunting shooting and plenty of good company mrs newcome groaned in spirit when she heard of these proceedings and feared feared very much that that unfortunate young man was going to ruin and barnes newcome amiably disseminated reports amongst his family that the lad was plunged in all sorts of debaucheries that he was tipsy every night that he was engaged in his sober moments with dice the turf or worse amusements and that his head was so turned by living with kew and belsize that the little rascals pride and arrogance were perfectly insufferable ethel would indignantly deny these charges then perhaps credit a few of them and she looked at clive with melancholy eyes when he came to visit his aunt and i hope prayed that heaven might mend his wicked ways the truth is the young fellow enjoyed life as one of his age and spirit might be expected to do but he did very little harm and meant less and was quite unconscious of the reputation which his kind friends were making for him  there had been a longstanding promise that clive and his father were to go to newcome at christmas and i dare say ethel proposed to reform the young prodigal if prodigal he was for she busied herself delightedly in preparing the apartments which they were to inhabit during their stayspeculated upon it in a hundred pleasant ways putting off her visit to this pleasant neighbour or that pretty scene in the vicinage until her uncle should come and they should be enabled to enjoy the excursion together and before the arrival of her relatives ethel with one of her young brothers went to see mrs mason and introduced herself as colonel newcomes niece and came back charmed with the old lady and eager once more in defence of clive when that young gentlemans character happened to be called in question by her brother barnes for had she not seen the kindest letter which clive had written to old mrs mason and the beautiful drawing of his father on horseback and in regimentals waving his sword in front of the gallant the bengal cavalry which the lad had sent down to the good old woman he could not be very bad ethel thought who was so kind and thoughtful for the poor his fathers son could not be altogether a reprobate when mrs mason seeing how good and beautiful ethel was and thinking in her heart nothing could be too good or beautiful for clive nodded her kind old head at miss ethel and said she should like to find a husband for her miss ethel blushed and looked handsomer than ever and at home when she was describing the interview never mentioned this part of her talk with mrs mason  but the enfant terrible young alfred did announcing to all the company at dessert that ethel was in love with clivethat clive was coming to marry herthat mrs mason the old woman at newcome had told him so  i dare say she has told the tale all over newcome shrieked out mr barnes i dare say it will be in the independent next week by jove its a pretty connexionand nice acquaintances this uncle of ours brings us a fine battle ensued upon the receipt and discussion of this intelligence barnes was more than usually bitter and sarcastic ethel haughtily recriminated losing her temper and then her firmness until fairly bursting into tears she taxed barnes with meanness and malignity in for ever uttering stories to his cousins disadvantage and pursuing with constant slander and cruelty one of the very best of men she rose and left the table in great tribulationshe went to her room and wrote a letter to her uncle blistered with tears in which she besought him not to come to newcomeperhaps she went and looked at the apartments which she had adorned and prepared for his reception it was for him and for his company that she was eager she had met no one so generous and gentle so honest and unselfish until she had seen him  lady anne knew the ways of women very well and when ethel that night still in great indignation and scorn against barnes announced that she had written a letter to her uncle begging the colonel not to come at christmas ethels mother soothed the wounded girl and treated her with peculiar gentleness and affection and she wisely gave mr barnes to understand that if he wished to bring about that very attachment the idea of which made him so angry he could use no better means than those which he chose to employ at present of constantly abusing and insulting poor clive and awakening ethels sympathies by mere opposition and ethels sad little letter was extracted from the postbag and her mother brought it to her sealed in her own room where the young lady burned it being easily brought by lady annes quiet remonstrances to perceive that it was best no allusion should take place to the silly dispute which had occurred that evening and that clive and his father should come for the christmas holidays if they were so minded but when they came there was no ethel at newcome she was gone on a visit to her sick aunt lady julia colonel newcome passed the holidays sadly without his young favourite and clive consoled himself by knocking down pheasants with sir brians keepers and increased his cousins attachment for him by breaking the knees of barness favourite mare out hunting it was a dreary entertainment father and son were glad enough to get away from it and to return to their own humbler quarters in london  thomas newcome had now been for three years in the possession of that felicity which his soul longed after and had any friend of his asked him if he was happy he would have answered in the affirmative no doubt and protested that he was in the enjoyment of everything a reasonable man could desire and yet in spite of his happiness his honest face grew more melancholy his loose clothes hung only the looser on his lean limbs he ate his meals without appetite his nights were restless and he would sit for hours silent in the midst of his family so that mr binnie first began jocularly to surmise that tom was crossed in love then seriously to think that his health was suffering and that a doctor should be called to see him and at last to agree that idleness was not good for the colonel and that he missed the military occupation to which he had been for so many years accustomed  the colonel insisted that he was perfectly happy and contented what could he want more than he hadthe society of his son for the present and a prospect of quiet for his declining days binnie vowed that his friends days had no business to decline as yet that a sober man of fifty ought to be at his best and that newcome had grown older in three years in europe than in a quarter of a century in the eastall which statements were true though the colonel persisted in denying them  he was very restless he was always finding business in distant quarters of england he must go visit tom barker who was settled in devonshire or harry johnson who had retired and was living in wales he surprised mrs honeyman by the frequency of his visits to brighton and always came away much improved in health by the sea air and by constant riding with the harriers there he appeared at bath and at cheltenham where as we know there are many old indians mr binnie was not indisposed to accompany him on some of these jauntsprovided the civilian said you dont take young hopeful who is much better without us and let us two old fogies enjoy ourselves together  clive was not sorry to be left alone the father knew that only too well the young man had occupations ideas associates in whom the elder could take no interest sitting below in his blank cheerless bedroom newcome could hear the lad and his friends talking singing and making merry overhead something would be said in clives wellknown tones and a roar of laughter would proceed from the youthful company they had all sorts of tricks bywords waggeries of which the father could not understand the jest nor the secret he longed to share in it but the party would be hushed if he went in to join itand he would come away sad at heart to think that his presence should be a signal for silence among them and that his son could not be merry in his company  we must not quarrel with clive and clives friends because they could not joke and be free in the presence of the worthy gentleman if they hushed when he came in thomas newcomes sad face would seem to look roundappealing to one after another of them and asking why dont you go on laughing a company of old comrades shall be merry and laughing together and the entrance of a single youngster will stop the conversationand if men of middle age feel this restraint with our juniors the young ones surely have a right to be silent before their elders the boys are always mum under the eyes of the usher there is scarce any parent however friendly or tender with his children but must feel sometimes that they have thoughts which are not his or hers and wishes and secrets quite beyond the parental control and as people are vain long after they are fathers ay or grandfathers and not seldom fancy that mere personal desire of domination is overweening anxiety and love for their family no doubt that common outcry against thankless children might often be shown to prove not that the son is disobedient but the father too exacting when a mother as fond mothers often will vows that she knows every thought in her daughters heart i think she pretends to know a great deal too much nor can there be a wholesomer task for the elders as our young subjects grow up naturally demanding liberty and citizens rights than for us gracefully to abdicate our sovereign pretensions and claims of absolute control theres many a family chief who governs wisely and gently who is loth to give the power up when he should ah be sure it is not youth alone that has need to learn humility by their very virtues and the purity of their lives many good parents create flatterers for themselves and so live in the midst of a filial court of parasitesand seldom without a pang of unwillingness and often not at all will they consent to forgo their autocracy and exchange the tribute they have been wont to exact of love and obedience for the willing offering of love and freedom  our good colonel was not of the tyrannous but of the loving order of fathers and having fixed his whole heart upon this darling youth his son was punished as i suppose such worldly and selfish love ought to be punished so mr honeyman says at least in his pulpit by a hundred little mortifications disappointments and secret wounds which stung not the less severely though never mentioned by their victim  sometimes he would have a company of such gentlemen as messrs warrington honeyman and pendennis when haply a literary conversation would ensue after dinner and the merits of our present poets and writers would be discussed with the claret honeyman was well enough read in profane literature especially of the lighter sort and i dare say could have passed a satisfactory examination in balzac dumas and paul de kock himself of all whose works our good host was entirely ignorantas indeed he was of graver books and of earlier books and of books in generalexcept those few which we have said formed his travelling library he heard opinions that amazed and bewildered him he heard that byron was no great poet though a very clever man he heard that there had been a wicked persecution against mr popes memory and fame and that it was time to reinstate him that his favourite dr johnson talked admirably but did not write english that young keats was a genius to be estimated in future days with young raphael and that a young gentleman of cambridge who had lately published two volumes of verses might take rank with the greatest poets of all doctor johnson not write english lord byron not one of the greatest poets of the world sir walter a poet of the second order mr pope attacked for inferiority and want of imagination mr keats and this young mr tennyson of cambridge the chief of modern poetic literature what were these new dicta which mr warrington delivered with a puff of tobaccosmoke to which mr honeyman blandly assented and clive listened with pleasure such opinions were not of the colonels time he tried in vain to construe oenone and to make sense of lamia ulysses he could understand but what were these prodigious laudations bestowed on it and that reverence for mr wordsworth what did it mean had he not written peter bell and been turned into deserved ridicule by all the reviews was that dreary excursion to be compared to goldsmiths traveller or doctor johnsons imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal if the young men told the truth where had been the truth in his own young days and in what ignorance had our forefathers been brought upmr addison was only an elegant essayist and shallow trifler all these opinions were openly uttered over the colonels claret as he and mr binnie sate wondering at the speakers who were knocking the gods of their youth about their ears to binnie the shock was not so great the hardheaded scotchman had read hume in his college days and sneered at some of the gods even at that early time but with newcome the admiration for the literature of the last century was an article of belief and the incredulity of the young men seemed rank blasphemy you will be sneering at shakspeare next he said and was silenced though not better pleased when his youthful guests told him that doctor goldsmith sneered at him too that dr johnson did not understand him and that congreve in his own day and afterwards was considered to be in some points shakspeares superior what do you think a mans criticism is worth sir cries mr warrington who says those lines of mr congreve about a church      how reverend is the face of yon tall pile      whose ancient pillars rear their marble heads      to bear aloft its vast and ponderous roof      by its own weight made steadfast and immovable      looking tranquillity it strikes an awe      and terror on my aching sightet caetera  what do you think of a critic who says those lines are finer than anything shakspeare ever wrote a dim consciousness of danger for clive a terror that his son had got into the society of heretics and unbelievers came over the coloneland then presently as was the wont with his modest soul a gentle sense of humility he was in the wrong perhaps and these younger men were right who was he to set up his judgment against men of letters educated at college it was better that clive should follow them than him who had had but a brief schooling and that neglected and who had not the original genius of his sons brilliant companions we particularise these talks and the little incidental mortifications which one of the best of men endured not because the conversations are worth the remembering or recording but because they presently very materially influenced his own and his sons future history  in the midst of the artists and their talk the poor colonel was equally in the dark they assaulted this academician and that laughed at mr haydon or sneered at mr eastlake or the contrary deified mr turner on one side of the table and on the other scorned him as a madmannor could newcome comprehend a word of their jargon some sense there must be in their conversation clive joined eagerly in it and took one side or another but what was all this rapture about a snuffy brown picture called titian this delight in three flabby nymphs by rubens and so forth as for the vaunted antique and the elgin marblesit might be that that battered torso was a miracle and that brokennosed bust a perfect beauty he tried and tried to see that they were he went away privily and worked at the national gallery with a catalogue and passed hours in the museum before the ancient statues desperately praying to comprehend them and puzzled before them as he remembered he was puzzled before the greek rudiments as a child when he cried over o kai hae alaethaes kai to alaethaes whereas when clive came to look at these same things his eyes would lighten up with pleasure and his cheeks flush with enthusiasm he seemed to drink in colour as he would a feast of wine before the statues he would wave his finger following the line of grace and burst into ejaculations of delight and admiration why cant i love the things which he loves thought newcome why am i blind to the beauties which he admires so muchand am i unable to comprehend what he evidently understands at his young age  so as he thought what vain egotistical hopes he used to form about the boy when he was away in indiahow in his plans for the happy future clive was to be always at his side how they were to read work play think be merry togethera sickening and humiliating sense of the reality came over him and he sadly contrasted it with the former fond anticipations together they were yet he was alone still his thoughts were not the boys and his affections rewarded but with a part of the young mans heart very likely other lovers have suffered equally many a man and woman has been incensed and worshipped and has shown no more feeling than is to be expected from idols there is yonder statue in st peters of which the toe is worn away with kisses and which sits and will sit eternally prim and cold as the young man grew it seemed to the father as if each day separated them more and more he himself became more melancholy and silent his friend the civilian marked the ennui and commented on it in his laughing way sometimes he announced to the club that tom newcome was in love then he thought it was not toms heart but his liver that was affected and recommended blue pill o thou fond fool who art thou to know any mans heart save thine alone wherefore were wings made and do feathers grow but that birds should fly the instinct that bids you love your nest leads the young ones to seek a tree and a mate of their own as if thomas newcome by poring over poems or pictures ever so much could read them with clives eyesas if by sitting mum over his wine but watching till the lad came home with his latchkey when the colonel crept back to his own room in his stockings by prodigal bounties by stealthy affection by any schemes or prayers he could hope to remain first in his sons heart  one day going into clives study where the lad was so deeply engaged that he did not hear the fathers steps advancing thomas newcome found his son pencil in hand poring over a paper which blushing he thrust hastily into his breastpocket as soon as he saw his visitor the father was deeply smitten and mortified ii am sorry you have any secrets from me clive he gasped out at length  the boys face lighted up with humour here it is father if you would like to seeand he pulled out a paper which contained neither more nor less than a copy of very flowery verses about a certain young lady who had succeeded after i know not how many predecessors to the place of primadonna assoluta in clives heart and be pleased madam not to be too eager with your censure and fancy that mr clive or his chronicler would insinuate anything wrong i dare say you felt a flame or two before you were married yourself and that the captain or the curate and the interesting young foreigner with whom you danced caused your heart to beat before you bestowed that treasure on mr candour clive was doing no more than your own son will do when he is eighteen or nineteen years old himselfif he is a lad of any spirit and a worthy son of so charming a lady as yourself     chapter xxii describes a visit to paris with accidents and incidents in london   mr clive as we have said had now begun to make acquaintances of his own and the chimneyglass in his study was decorated with such a number of cards of invitation as made his exfellowstudent of gandishs young moss when admitted into that sanctum stare with respectful astonishment lady bary rowe at obe the young hebrew read out lady baughton at obe dadsig by eyes what a tiptop swell youre a gettid to be newcome i guess this is a different sort of business to the hops at old levisons where you first learned the polka and where we had to pay a shilling a glass for negus  we had to pay you never paid anything moss cries clive laughing and indeed the negus imbibed by mr moss did not cost that prudent young fellow a penny  well well i suppose at these swell parties you ave as bush champade as ever you like continues moss lady kicklebury at obesmall early party why i declare you know the whole peerage i say if any of these swells want a little tiptop lace a real bargain or diamonds you know you might put in a word for us and do us a good turn  give me some of your cards says clive i can distribute them about at the balls i go to but you must treat my friends better than you serve me those cigars which you sent me were abominable moss the groom in the stable wont smoke them  what a regular swell that newcome has become says mr moss to an old companion another of clives fellowstudents i saw him riding in the park with the earl of kew and captain belsize and a whole lot of emi know em alland hed hardly nod to me ill have a horse next sunday and then ill see whether hell cut me or not confound his airs for all hes such a count i know hes got an aunt who lets lodgings at brighton and an uncle wholl be preaching in the bench if he dont keep a precious good lookout  newcome is not a bit of a count answers mosss companion indignantly he dont care a straw whether a fellows poor or rich and he comes up to my room just as willingly as he would go to a dukes he is always trying to do a friend a good turn he draws the figure capitally he looks proud but he isnt and is the bestnatured fellow i ever saw  he aint been in our place this eighteen months says mr moss i know that  because when he came you were always screwing him with some bargain or other cried the intrepid hicks mr mosss companion for the moment he said he couldnt afford to know you you never let him out of your house without a pin or a box of eaudecologne or a bundle of cigars and when you cut the arts for the shop how were you and newcome to go on together i should like to know  i know a relative of his who comes to our ouse every three months to renew a little bill says mr moss with a grin and i know this if i go to the earl of kew in the albany or the honourable captain belsize knightsbridge barracks they let me in soon enough im told his father aint got much money  how the deuce should i know or what do i care cries the young artist stamping the heel of his blucher on the pavement when i was sick in that confounded clipstone street i know the colonel came to see me and newcome too day after day and night after night and when i was getting well they sent me wine and jelly and all sorts of jolly things i should like to know how often you came to see me moss and what you did for a fellow  well i kep away because i thought you wouldnt like to be reminded of that two pound three you owe me hicks thats why i kep away says mr moss who i dare say was goodnatured too and when young moss appeared at the billiardroom that night it was evident that hicks had told the story for the wardour street youth was saluted with a roar of queries how about that two pound three that hicks owes you  the artless conversation of the two youths will enable us to understand how our heros life was speeding connected in one way or another with persons in all ranks it never entered his head to be ashamed of the profession which he had chosen people in the great world did not in the least trouble themselves regarding him or care to know whether mr clive newcome followed painting or any other pursuit and though clive saw many of his schoolfellows in the world these entering into the army others talking with delight of college and its pleasures or studies yet having made up his mind that art was his calling he refused to quit her for any other mistress and plied his easel very stoutly he passed through the course of study prescribed by mr gandish and drew every cast and statue in that gentlemans studio grindley his tutor getting a curacy clive did not replace him but he took a course of modern languages which he learned with considerable aptitude and rapidity and now being strong enough to paint without a master it was found that there was no good light in the house in fitzroy square and mr clive must needs have an atelier hard by where he could pursue his own devices independently  if his kind father felt any pang even at this temporary parting he was greatly soothed and pleased by a little mark of attention on the young mans part of which his present biographer happened to be a witness for having walked over with colonel newcome to see the new studio with its tall centre window and its curtains and carved wardrobes china jars pieces of armour and other artistical properties the lad with a very sweet smile of kindness and affection lighting up his honest face took one of two bramahs housekeys with which he was provided and gave it to his father thats your key sir he said to the colonel and you must be my first sitter please father for though im a historical painter i shall condescend to do a few portraits you know the colonel took his sons hand and grasped it as clive fondly put the other hand on his fathers shoulder then colonel newcome walked away into the next room for a minute or two and came back wiping his moustache with his handkerchief and still holding the key in the other hand he spoke about some trivial subject when he returned but his voice quite trembled and i thought his face seemed to glow with love and pleasure clive has never painted anything better than that head which he executed in a couple of sittings and wisely left without subjecting it to the chances of further labour  it is certain the young man worked much better after he had been inducted into this apartment of his own and the meals at home were gayer and the rides with his father more frequent and agreeable the colonel used his key once or twice and found clive and his friend ridley engaged in depicting a lifeguardsmanor a muscular negroor a malay from a neighbouring crossing who would appear as othello conversing with a clipstone street nymph who was ready to represent desdemona diana queen ellinor sucking poison from the arm of the plantagenet of the blues or any other model of virgin or maiden excellence  of course our young man commenced as a historical painter deeming that the highest branch of art and declining except for preparatory studies to operate on any but the largest canvasses he painted a prodigious battlepiece of assaye with general wellesley at the head of the 19th dragoons charging the mahratta artillery and sabring them at their guns a piece of ordnance was dragged into the backyard and the colonels stud put into requisition to supply studies for this enormous picture fred bayham a stunning likeness appeared as the principal figure in the foreground terrifically wounded but still of undaunted courage slashing about amidst a group of writhing malays and bestriding the body of a dead cabhorse which clive painted until the landlady and rest of the lodgers cried out and for sanitary reasons the knackers removed the slaughtered charger so large was this picture that it could only be got out of the great window by means of artifice and coaxing and its transport caused a shout of triumph among the little boys in charlotte street will it be believed that the royal academicians rejected the battle of assaye the masterpiece was so big that fitzroy square could not hold it and the colonel had thoughts of presenting it to the oriental club but clive who had taken a trip to paris with his father as a delassement after the fatigues incident on this great work when he saw it after a months interval declared the thing was rubbish and massacred britons malays dragoons artillery and all   hotel de la terrasse rue de rivoli  april 27may 1 183  my dear pendennisyou said i might write you a line from paris and if you find in my correspondence any valuable hints for the pall mall gazette you are welcome to use them gratis now i am here i wonder i have never been here before and that i have seen the dieppe packet a thousand times at brighton pier without thinking of going on board her we had a rough little passage to boulogne we went into action as we cleared dover pierwhen the first gun was fired and a stout old lady was carried off by a steward to the cabin half a dozen more dropped immediately and the crew bustled about bringing basins for the wounded the colonel smiled as he saw them fall im an old sailor says he to a gentleman on board i was coming home sir and we had plenty of rough weather on the voyage i never thought of being unwell my boy here who made the voyage twelve years ago last may may have lost his sealegs but for me sir here a great wave dashed over the three of us and would you believe it in five minutes after the dear old governor was as ill as all the rest of the passengers when we arrived we went through a line of ropes to the customhouse with a crowd of snobs jeering at us on each side and then were carried off by a bawling commissioner to an hotel where the colonel who speaks french beautifully you know told the waiter to get us a petit dejeuner soigne on which the fellow grinning said a nice fried sole sirnice muttonchop sir in regular temple bar english and brought us harvey sauce with the chops and the last bells life to amuse us after our luncheon i wondered if all the frenchmen read bells life and if all the inns smell so of brandyandwater  we walked out to see the town which i dare say you know and therefore shant describe we saw some good studies of fishwomen with bare legs and remarked that the soldiers were very dumpy and small we were glad when the time came to set off by the diligence and having the coupe to ourselves made a very comfortable journey to paris it was jolly to hear the postillions crying to their horses and the bells of the team and to feel ourselves really in france we took in provender at abbeville and amiens and were comfortably landed here after about sixandtwenty hours of coaching didnt i get up the next morning and have a good walk in the tuileries the chestnuts were out and the statues all shining and all the windows of the palace in a blaze it looks big enough for the king of the giants to live in how grand it is i like the barbarous splendour of the architecture and the ornaments profuse and enormous with which it is overladen think of louis xvi with a thousand gentlemen at his back and a mob of yelling ruffians in front of him giving up his crown without a fight for it leaving his friends to be butchered and himself sneaking into prison no end of little children were skipping and playing in the sunshiny walks with dresses as bright and cheeks as red as the flowers and roses in the parterres i couldnt help thinking of barbaroux and his bloody pikemen swarming in the gardens and fancied the swiss in the windows yonder where they were to be slaughtered when the king had turned his back what a great man that carlyle is i have read the battle in his history so often that i knew it before i had seen it our windows look out on the obelisk where the guillotine stood the colonel doesnt admire carlyle he says mrs grahams letters from paris are excellent and we bought scotts visit to paris and paris revisited and read them in the diligence they are famous good reading but the palais royal is very much altered since scotts time no end of handsome shops i went there directlythe same night we arrived when the colonel went to bed but there is none of the fun going on which scott describes the laquais de place says charles x put an end to it all  next morning the governor had letters to deliver after breakfast and left me at the louvre door i shall come and live here i think i feel as if i never want to go away i had not been ten minutes in the place before i fell in love with the most beautiful creature the world has ever seen she was standing silent and majestic in the centre of one of the rooms of the statuegallery and the very first glimpse of her struck one breathless with the sense of her beauty i could not see the colour of her eyes and hair exactly but the latter is light and the eyes i should think are grey her complexion is of a beautiful warm marble tinge she is not a clever woman evidently i do not think she laughs or talks muchshe seems too lazy to do more than smile she is only beautiful this divine creature has lost an arm which has been cut off at the shoulder but she looks none the less lovely for the accident she maybe some twoandthirty years old and she was born about two thousand years ago her name is the venus of milo o victrix o lucky paris i dont mean this present lutetia but priams son how could he give the apple to any else but this enslaverthis joy of gods and men at whose benign presence the flowers spring up and the smiling ocean sparkles and the soft skies beam with serene light i wish we might sacrifice i would bring a spotless kid snowycoated and a pair of doves and a jar of honeyyea honey from morels in piccadilly thymeflavoured narbonian and we would acknowledge the sovereign loveliness and adjure the divine aphrodite did you ever see my pretty young cousin miss newcome sir brians daughter she has a great look of the huntress diana it is sometimes too proud and too cold for me the blare of those horns is too shrill and the rapid pursuit through bush and bramble too daring o thou generous venus o thou beautiful bountiful calm at thy soft feet let me kneelon cushions of tyrian purple dont show this to warrington please i never thought when i began that pegasus was going to run away with me  i wish i had read greek a little more at school its too late at my age i shall be nineteen soon and have got my own business but when we return i think i shall try and read it with cribs what have i been doing spending six months over a picture of sepoys and dragoons cutting each others throats art ought not to be a fever it ought to be a calm not a screaming bullfight or a battle of gladiators but a temple for placid contemplation rapt worship stately rhythmic ceremony and music solemn and tender i shall take down my snyders and rubens when i get home and turn quietist to think i have spent weeks in depicting bony lifeguardsmen delivering cut one or saint george and painting black beggars off a crossing  what a grand thing it is to think of half a mile of pictures at the louvre not but that there are a score under the old pepperboxes in trafalgar square as fine as the best here i dont care for any raphael here as much as our own st catharine there is nothing more grand could the pyramids of egypt or the colossus of rhodes be greater than our sebastian and for our bacchus and ariadne you cannot beat the best you know but if we have fine jewels here there are whole sets of them there are kings and all their splendid courts round about them j j and i must come and live here oh such portraits of titian oh such swells by vandyke im sure he must have been as fine a gentleman as any he painted its a shame they havent got a sir joshua or two at a feast of painters he has a right to a place and at the high table too do you remember tom rogers of gandishs he used to come to my roomsmy other rooms in the square tom is here with a fine carrotty beard and a velvet jacket cut open at the sleeves to show that tom has a shirt i dare say it was clean last sunday he has not learned french yet but pretends to have forgotten english and promises to introduce me to a set of the french artists his camarades there seems to be a scarcity of soap among these young fellows and i think i shall cut off my mustachios only warrington will have nothing to laugh at when i come home  the colonel and i went to dine at the cafe de paris and afterwards to the opera ask for huitres de marenne when you dine here we dined with a tremendous french swell the vicomte de florac officier dordonnance to one of the princes and son of some old friends of my fathers they are of very high birth but very poor he will be a duke when his cousin the duc divry dies his father is quite old the vicomte was born in england he pointed out to us no end of famous people at the operaa few of the fauxbourg st germain and ever so many of the present peoplem thiers and count mole and georges sand and victor hugo and jules janini forget half their names and yesterday we went to see his mother madame de florac i suppose she was an old flame of the colonels for their meeting was uncommonly ceremonious and tender it was like an elderly sir charles grandison saluting a middleaged miss byron and only fancy the colonel has been here once before since his return to england it must have been last year when he was away for ten days whilst i was painting that rubbishing picture of the black prince waiting on king john madame de f is a very grand lady and must have been a great beauty in her time there are two pictures by gerard in her salonof her and m de florac m de florac old swell powder thick eyebrows hooked nose no end of stars ribbons and embroidery madame also in the dress of the empirepensive beautiful black velvet and a look something like my cousins she wore a little oldfashioned brooch yesterday and said voila la reconnoissezvous last year when you were here it was in the country and she smiled at him and the dear old boy gave a sort of groan and dropped his head in his hand i know what it is ive gone through it myself i kept for six months an absurd ribbon of that infernal little flirt fanny freeman dont you remember how angry i was when you abused her  your father and i knew each other when we were children my friend the countess said to me in the sweetest french accent he was looking into the garden of the house where they live in the rue saint dominique you must come and see me often always you remind me of him and she added with a very sweet kind smile do you like best to think that he was betterlooking than you or that you excel him i said i should like to be like him but who is there are cleverer fellows i dare say but where is there such a good one i wonder whether he was very fond of madame de florac the old count does not show he is quite old and wears a pigtail we saw it bobbing over his garden chair he lets the upper part of his house majorgeneral the honourable zeno f pokey of cincinnati us lives in it we saw mrs pokeys carriage in the court and her footmen smoking cigars there a tottering old man with feeble legs as old as old count de florac seemed to be the only domestic who waited on the family below  madame de florac and my father talked about my profession the countess said it was a belle carriere the colonel said it was better than the army ah oui monsieur says she very sadly and then he said that presently i should very likely come to study at paris when he knew there would be a kind friend to watch over son garcon  but you will be here to watch over him yourself mon ami says the french lady  father shook his head i shall very probably have to go back to india he said my furlough is expired i am now taking my extra leave if i can get my promotion i need not return without that i cannot afford to live in europe but my absence in all probability will be but very short he said and clive is old enough now to go on without me  is this the reason why father has been so gloomy for some months past i thought it might have been some of my follies which made him uncomfortable and you know i have been trying my best to amendi have not half such a tailors bill this year as last i owe scarcely anything i have paid off moss every halfpenny for his confounded rings and gimcracks i asked father about this melancholy news as we walked away from madame de florac  he is not near so rich as we thought since he has been at home he says he has spent greatly more than his income and is quite angry at his own extravagance at first he thought he might have retired from the army altogether but after three years at home he finds he cannot live upon his income when he gets his promotion as full colonel he will be entitled to a thousand a year that and what he has invested in india and a little in this country will be plenty for both of us he never seems to think of my making money by my profession why suppose i sell the battle of assaye for 500 pounds that will be enough to carry me on ever so long without dipping into the purse of the dear old father  the viscount de florac called to dine with us the colonel said he did not care about going out and so the viscount and i went together trois freres provencauxhe ordered the dinner and of course i paid then we went to a little theatre and he took me behind the scenessuch a queer place we went to the loge of mademoiselle fine who acted the part of le petit tambour in which she sings a famous song with a drum he asked her and several literary fellows to supper at the cafe anglais and i came home ever so late and lost twenty napoleons at a game called bouillotte it was all the change out of a twentypound note which dear old binnie gave me before we set out with a quotation out of horace you know about neque tu choreas sperne puer o me how guilty i felt as i walked home at ever so much oclock to the hotel de la terrasse and sneaked into our apartment but the colonel was sound asleep his dear old boots stood sentries at his bedroom door and i slunk into mine as silently as i could  pswednesdaytheres just one scrap of paper left i have got j js letter he has been to the private view of the academy so that his own picture is in and the battle of assaye is refused smee told him it was too big i dare say its very bad im glad im away and the fellows are not condoling with me  please go and see mr binnie he has come to grief he rode the colonels horse came down on the pavement and wrenched his leg and im afraid the greys please look at his legs we cant understand johns report of them he i mean mr b was going to scotland to see his relations when the accident happened you know he has always been going to scotland to see his relations he makes light of the business and says the colonel is not to think of coming to him and i dont want to go back just yet to see all the fellows from gandishs and the life academy and have them grinning at my misfortune  the governor would send his regards i dare say but he is out and i am always yours affectionately clive newcome  pshe tipped me himself this morning isnt he a kind dear old fellow   arthur pendennis esq to clive newcome esq  pall mall gazette journal of politics literature and fashion 225 catherine street strand  dear clivei regret very much for fred bayhams sake who has lately taken the responsible office of fine arts critic for the p g that your extensive picture of the battle of assaye has not found a place in the royal academy exhibition f b is at least fifteen shillings out of pocket by its rejection as he had prepared a flaming eulogium of your work which of course is so much waste paper in consequence of this calamity never mind courage my son the duke of wellington you know was best back at seringapatam before he succeeded at assaye i hope you will fight other battles and that fortune in future years will be more favourable to you the town does not talk very much of your discomfiture you see the parliamentary debates are very interesting just now and somehow the battle of assaye did not seem to excite the public mind  i have been to fitzroy square both to the stables and the house the houyhnhnms legs are very well the horse slipped on his side and not on his knees and has received no sort of injury not so mr binnie his ankle is much wrenched and inflamed he must keep his sofa for many days perhaps weeks but you know he is a very cheerful philosopher and endures the evils of life with much equanimity his sister has come to him i dont know whether that may be considered as a consolation of his evil or an aggravation of it you know he uses the sarcastic method in his talk and it was difficult to understand from him whether he was pleased or bored by the embraces of his relative she was an infant when he last beheld her on his departure to india she is now to speak with respect a very brisk plump pretty little widow having seemingly recovered from her grief at the death of her husband captain mackenzie in the west indies mr binnie was just on the point of visiting his relatives who reside at musselburgh near edinburgh when he met with the fatal accident which prevented his visit to his native shores his account of his misfortune and his lonely condition was so pathetic that mrs mackenzie and her daughter put themselves into the edinburgh steamer and rushed to console his sofa they occupy your bedroom and sittingroom which latter mrs mackenzie says no longer smells of tobacco smoke as it did when she took possession of your den if you have left any papers about any bills any billetsdoux i make no doubt the ladies have read every single one of them according to the amiable habits of their sex the daughter is a bright little blueeyed fairhaired lass with a very sweet voice in which she sings unaided by instrumental music and seated on a chair in the middle of the room the artless ballads of her native country i had the pleasure of hearing the bonnets of bonny dundee and jack of hazeldean from her ruby lips two evenings since not indeed for the first time in my life but never from such a pretty little singer though both ladies speak our language with something of the tone usually employed by the inhabitants of the northern part of britain their accent is exceedingly pleasant and indeed by no means so strong as mr binnies own for captain mackenzie was an englishman for whose sake his lady modified her native musselburgh pronunciation she tells many interesting anecdotes of him of the west indies and of the distinguished regiment of infantry to which the captain belonged miss rosa is a great favourite with her uncle and i have had the good fortune to make their stay in the metropolis more pleasant by sending them orders from the pall mall gazette for the theatres panoramas and the principal sights in town for pictures they do not seem to care much they thought the national gallery a dreary exhibition and in the royal academy could be got to admire nothing but the picture of mcollop of mcollop by our friend of the like name but they think madame tussauds interesting exhibition of waxwork the most delightful in london and there i had the happiness of introducing them to our friend mr frederick bayham who subsequently on coming to this office with his valuable contributions on the fine arts made particular inquiries as to their pecuniary means and expressed himself instantly ready to bestow his hand upon the mother or daughter provided old mr binnie would make a satisfactory settlement i got the ladies a box at the opera whither they were attended by captain goby of their regiment godfather to miss and where i had the honour of paying them a visit i saw your fair young cousin miss newcome in the lobby with her grandmamma lady kew mr bayham with great eloquence pointed out to the scotch ladies the various distinguished characters in the house the opera delighted them but they were astounded at the ballet from which mother and daughter retreated in the midst of a fire of pleasantries of captain goby i can fancy that officer at mess and how brilliant his anecdotes must be when the company of ladies does not restrain his genial flow of humour  here comes mr baker with the proofs in case you dont see the p g at galignanis i send you an extract from bayhams article on the royal academy where you will have the benefit of his opinion on the works of some of your friends  617 moses bringing home the gross of green spectacles smith raperhaps poor goldsmiths exquisite little work has never been so great a favourite as in the present age we have here in a work by one of our most eminent artists an homage to the genius of him who touched nothing which he did not adorn and the charming subject is handled in the most delicious manner by mr smith the chiaroscuro is admirable the impasto is perfect perhaps a very captious critic might object to the foreshortening of mosess left leg but where there is so much to praise justly the pall nall gazette does not care to condemn  420 our and the publics favourite brown ra treats us to a subject from the best of all stories the tale which laughed spains chivalry away the ever new don quixote the incident which brown has selected is the dons attack on the flock of sheep the sheep are in his best manner painted with all his wellknown facility and brio mr browns friendly rival hopkins has selected gil blas for an illustration this year and the robbers cavern is one of the most masterly of

subjects of his pencil the scene near corpodibacco we know the spot well and have spent many a happy month in its romantic mountains is most characteristic cardinal cospetto we must say is a most truculent prelate and not certainly an ornament to his church  49 210 311 smee raportraits which a reynolds might be proud ofa vandyke or claude might not disown sir brian newcome in the costume of a

mcollopis a noble work of a young artist who in depicting the gallant chief of a hardy scottish clan has also represented a romantic highland landscape in the midst of which his foot upon his native heath stands a man of splendid symmetrical figure and great facial advantages we shall keep our eye on mr mcollop  1367 oberon and titania ridleythis sweet and fanciful little picture draws crowds round about it and is one of the most charming and delightful works of the present exhibition we echo the universal opinion in declaring that it shows not only the greatest promise but the most delicate and beautiful performance the earl of kew we understand bought the picture at the private view and we congratulate the young painter heartily upon his successful debut he is we understand a pupil of mr gandish where is that admirable painter we miss his bold canvasses and grand historic outline  i shall alter a few inaccuracies in the composition of our friend f b who has as he says drawn it uncommonly mild in the above criticism in fact two days since he brought in an article of quite a different tendency of which he retains only the two last paragraphs but he has with great magnanimity recalled his previous observations and indeed he knows as much about pictures as some critics i could name  goodbye my dear clive i send my kindest regards to your father and think you had best see as little as possible of your bouillotteplaying french friend and his friends this advice i know you will follow as young men always follow the advice of their seniors and wellwishers i dine in fitzroy square today with the pretty widow and her daughter and am yours always dear clive a p     chapter xxiii in which we hear a soprano and a contralto   the most hospitable and polite of colonels would not hear of mrs mackenzie and her daughter quitting his house when he returned to it after six weeks pleasant sojourn in paris nor indeed did his fair guest show the least anxiety or intention to go away mrs mackenzie had a fine merry humour of her own she was an old soldiers wife she said and knew when her quarters were good and i suppose since her honeymoon when the captain took her to harrogate and cheltenham stopping at the first hotels and travelling in a chaiseandpair the whole way she had never been so well off as in that roomy mansion near tottenham court road of her mothers house at musselburgh she gave a ludicrous but dismal account eh james she said i think if you had come to mamma as you threatened you would not have staid very long its a wearisome place dr mcraw boards with her and its sermon and psalmsinging from morning till night my little josey takes kindly to the life there and i left her behind poor little darling it was not fair to bring three of us to take possession of your house dear james but my poor little rosey was just withering away there its good for the dear child to see the world a little and a kind uncle who is not afraid of us now he sees us is he kind uncle james was not at all afraid of little rosey whose pretty face and modest manners and sweet songs and blue eyes cheered and soothed the old bachelor nor was roseys mother less agreeable and pleasant she had married the captain it was a lovematch against the will of her parents who had destined her to be the third wife of old dr mmull when very young many sorrows she had had including poverty the captains imprisonment for debt and his demise but she was of a gay and lightsome spirit she was but threeandthirty years old and looked fiveandtwenty she was active brisk jovial and alert and so goodlooking that it was a wonder she had not taken a successor to captain mackenzie james binnie cautioned his friend the colonel against the attractions of the buxom siren and laughingly would ask clive how he would like mrs mackenzie for a mamaw  colonel newcome felt himself very much at ease regarding his future prospects he was very glad that his friend james was reconciled to his family and hinted to clive that the late captain mackenzies extravagance had been the cause of the rupture between him and his brotherinlaw who had helped that prodigal captain repeatedly during his life and in spite of family quarrels had never ceased to act generously to his widowed sister and her family but i think mr clive said he that as miss rosa is very pretty and you have a spare room at your studio you had best take up your quarters in charlotte street as long as the ladies are living with us clive was nothing loth to be independent but he showed himself to be a very good homeloving youth he walked home to breakfast every morning dined often and spent the evenings with the family indeed the house was a great deal more cheerful for the presence of the two pleasant ladies nothing could be prettier than to see the two ladies tripping downstairs together mammas pretty arm round roseys pretty waist mammas talk was perpetually of rosey that child was always gay always good always happy that darling girl woke with a smile on her face it was sweet to see her uncle james in his dry way said he dared to say it was very pretty go away you droll dear old kind uncle james roseys mamma would cry out you old bachelors are wicked old things uncle james used to kiss rosey very kindly and pleasantly she was as modest as gentle as eager to please colonel newcome as any little girl could be it was pretty to see her tripping across the room with his coffeecup or peeling walnuts for him after dinner with her white plump little fingers  mrs irons the housekeeper naturally detested mrs mackenzie and was jealous of her though the latter did everything to soothe and coax the governess of the two gentlemens establishment she praised her dinners delighted in her puddings must beg mrs irons to allow her to see one of those delicious puddings made and to write the receipt for her that mrs mackenzie might use it when she was away it was mrs irons belief that mrs mackenzie never intended to go away she had no ideer of ladies as were ladies coming into her kitchen the maids vowed that they heard miss rosa crying and mamma scolding in her bedroom for all she was so softspoken how was that jug broke and that chair smashed in the bedroom that day there was such a awful row up there  mrs mackenzie played admirably in the oldfashioned way dances reels and scotch and irish tunes the former of which filled james binnies soul with delectation the good mother naturally desired that her darling should have a few good lessons of the piano while she was in london rosey was eternally strumming upon an instrument which had been taken upstairs for her special practice and the colonel who was always seeking to do harmless jobs of kindness for his friends bethought him of little miss cann the governess at ridleys whom he recommended as an instructress anybody whom you recommend im sure dear colonel we shall like said mrs mackenzie who looked as black as thunder and had probably intended to have monsieur quatremains or signor twankeydillo and the little governess came to her pupil mrs mackenzie treated her very gruffly and haughtily at first but as soon as she heard miss cann play the widow was pacifiednay charmed monsieur quatremains charged a guinea for threequarters of an hour while miss cann thankfully took five shillings for an hour and a half and the difference of twenty lessons for which dear uncle james paid went into mrs mackenzies pocket and thence probably on to her pretty shoulders and head in the shape of a fine silk dress and a beautiful french bonnet in which captain goby said upon his life she didnt look twenty  the little governess trotting home after her lesson would often look in to clives studio in charlotte street where her two boys as she called clive and j j were at work each at his easel clive used to laugh and tell us who joked him about the widow and her daughter what miss cann said about them mrs mack was not all honey it appeared if rosey played incorrectly mamma flew at her with prodigious vehemence of language and sometimes with a slap on poor roseys back she must make rosey wear tight boots and stamp on her little feet if they refused to enter into the slipper i blush for the indiscretion of miss cann but she actually told j j that mamma insisted upon lacing her so tight as nearly to choke the poor little lass rosey did not fight rosey always yielded and the scolding over and the tears dried would come simpering downstairs with mammas arm round her waist and her pretty artless happy smile for the gentlemen below besides the scottish songs without music she sang ballads at the piano very sweetly mamma used to cry at these ditties that childs voice brings tears into my eyes mr newcome she would say she has never known a moments sorrow yet heaven grant heaven grant she may be happy but what shall i be when i lose her  why my dear when ye lose rosey yell console yourself with josey says droll mr binnie from the sofa who perhaps saw the manoeuvre of the widow  the widow laughs heartily and really she places a handkerchief over her mouth she glances at her brother with a pair of eyes full of knowing mischief ah dear james she says you dont know what it is to have a mothers feelings  i can partly understand them says james rosey sing me that pretty little french song mrs mackenzies attention to clive was really quite affecting if any of his friends came to the house she took them aside and praised clive to them the colonel she adored she had never met with such a man or seen such a manner the manners of the bishop of tobago were beautiful and he certainly had one of the softest and finest hands in the world but not finer than colonel newcomes look at his foot and she put out her own which was uncommonly pretty and suddenly withdrew it with an arch glance meant to represent a blushmy shoe would fit it when we were at coventry island sir peregrine blandy who succeeded poor dear sir rawdon crawleyi saw his dear boy was gazetted to a lieutenantcolonelcy in the guards last weeksir peregrine who was one of the prince of waless most intimate friends was always said to have the finest manner and presence of any man of his day and very grand and noble he was but i dont think he was equal to colonel newcomei dont really think so do you think so mr honeyman what a charming discourse that was last sunday i know there were two pair of eyes not dry in the church i could not see the other people just for crying myself oh but i wish we could have you at musselburgh i was bred a presbyterian of course but in much travelling through the world with my dear husband i came to love his church at home we sit under dr mcraw of course but he is so awfully long four hours every sunday at least morning and afternoon it nearly kills poor rosey did you hear her voice at your church the dear girl is delighted with the chants rosey were you not delighted with the chants  if she is delighted with the chants honeyman is delighted with the chantress and her mamma he dashes the fair hair from his brow he sits down to the piano and plays one or two of them warbling a faint vocal accompaniment and looking as if he would be lifted off the screw musicstool and flutter up to the ceiling  oh its just seraphic says the widow its just the breath of incense and the pealing of the organ at the cathedral at montreal rosey doesnt remember montreal she was a wee wee child she was born on the voyage out and christened at sea you remember goby  gad i promised and vowed to teach her her catechism gad but i havent says captain goby we were between montreal and quebec for three years with the hundredth and the hundred twentieth highlanders and the thirtythird dragoon guards a part of the time fipley commanded them and a very jolly time we had much better than the west indies where a fellows liver goes to the deuce with hot pickles and sangaree mackenzie was a devlish wild fellow whispers captain goby to his neighbour the present biographer indeed and mrs mack was as pretty a little woman as ever you set eyes on captain goby winks and looks peculiarly sly as he makes this statement our regiment wasnt on your side of india colonel  and in the interchange of such delightful remarks and with music and song the evening passes away since the house had been adorned by the fair presence of mrs mackenzie and her daughter honeyman said always gallant in behaviour and flowery in expression it seemed as if spring had visited it its hospitality was invested with a new grace its ever welcome little reunions were doubly charming but why did these ladies come if they were to go away again howhow would mr binnie console himself not to mention others if they left him in solitude  we have no wish to leave my brother james in solitude cries mrs mackenzie frankly laughing we like london a great deal better than musselburgh  oh that we do ejaculates the blushing rosey  and we will stay as long as ever my brother will keep us continues the widow  uncle james is so kind and dear says rosey i hope he wont send me and mamma away  he were a brutea savage if he did cries binnie with glances of rapture towards the two pretty faces everybody liked them binnie received their caresses very goodhumouredly the colonel liked every woman under the sun clive laughed and joked and waltzed alternately with rosey and her mamma the latter was the briskest partner of the two the unsuspicious widow poor dear innocent would leave her girl at the paintingroom and go shopping herself but little j j also worked there being occupied with his second picture and he was almost the only one of clives friends whom the widow did not like she pronounced the quiet little painter a pert little obtrusive underbred creature  in a word mrs mackenzie was as the phrase is setting her cap so openly at clive that none of us could avoid seeing her play and clive laughed at her simple manoeuvres as merrily as the rest she was a merry little woman we gave her and her pretty daughter a luncheon in lamb court temple in sibwrights chambersluncheon from dicks coffee houseices and dessert from partingtons in the strand miss rosey mr sibwright our neighbour in lamb court and the reverend charles honeyman sang very delightfully after lunch there was quite a crowd of porters laundresses and boys to listen in the court mr paley was disgusted with the noise we madein fact the party was perfectly successful we all liked the widow and if she did set her pretty ribbons at clive why should not she we all liked the pretty fresh modest rosey why even the grave old benchers in the temple church when the ladies visited it on sunday winked their reverend eyes with pleasure as they looked at those two uncommonly smart pretty welldressed fashionable women ladies go to the temple church you will see more young men and receive more respectful attention there than in any place except perhaps at oxford or cambridge go to the temple churchnot of course for the admiration which you will excite and which you cannot help but because the sermon is excellent the choral services beautifully performed and the church so interesting as a monument of the thirteenth century and as it contains the tombs of those dear knights templars  mrs mackenzie could be grave or gay according to her company nor could any woman be of more edifying behaviour when an occasional scottish friend bringing a letter from darling josey or a recommendatory letter from joseys grandmother paid a visit in fitzroy square little miss cann used to laugh and wink knowingly saying you will never get back your bedroom mr clive you may be sure that miss josey will come in a few months and perhaps old mrs binnie only no doubt she and her daughter do not agree but the widow has taken possession of uncle james and she will carry off somebody else if i am not mistaken should you like a stepmother mr clive or should you prefer a wife  whether the fair lady tried her wiles upon colonel newcome the present writer has no certain means of ascertaining but i think another image occupied his heart and this circe tempted him no more than a score of other enchantresses who had tried their spells upon him if she tried she failed she was a very shrewd woman quite frank in her talk when such frankness suited her she said to me colonel newcome has had some great passion once upon a time i am sure of that and has no more heart to give away the woman who had his must have been a very lucky woman though i daresay she did not value what she had or did not live to enjoy itoror something or other you see tragedies in some peoples faces i recollect when we were in coventry islandthere was a chaplain therea very good mana mr bell and married to a pretty little woman who died the first day i saw him i said i know that man has had a great grief in life i am sure that he left his heart in england you gentlemen who write books mr pendennis and stop at the third volume know very well that the real story often begins afterwards my third volume ended when i was sixteen and was married to my poor husband do you think all our adventures ended then and that we lived happy ever after i live for my darling girls now all i want is to see them comfortable in life nothing can be more generous than my dear brother james has been i am only his halfsister you know and was an infant in arms when he went away he had differences with captain mackenzie who was headstrong and imprudent and i own my poor dear husband was in the wrong james could not live with my poor mother neither could by possibility suit the other i have often i own longed to come and keep house for him his home the society he sees of men of talents like mr warrington andand i wont mention names or pay compliments to a man who knows human nature so well as the author of walter lorraine this house is pleasanter a thousand times than musselburghpleasanter for me and my dearest rosey whose delicate nature shrunk and withered up in poor mammas society she was never happy except in my room the dear child shes all gentleness and affection she doesnt seem to show it but she has the most wonderful appreciation of wit of genius and talent of all kinds she always hides her feelings except from her fond old mother i went up into our room yesterday and found her in tears i cant bear to see her eyes red or to think of her suffering i asked her what ailed her and kissed her she is a tender plant mr pendennis heaven knows with what care i have nurtured her she looked up smiling on my shoulder she looked so pretty oh mamma the darling child said i couldnt help it i have been crying over walter lorraine enter rosey rosey darling i have been telling mr pendennis what a naughty naughty child you were yesterday and how you read a book which i told you you shouldnt read for it is a very wicked book and though it contains some sad sad truths it is a great deal too misanthropic is that the right word im a poor soldiers wife and no scholar you know and a great deal too bitter and though the reviews praise it and the clever peoplewe are poor simple country peoplewe wont praise it sing dearest that little song profuse kisses to rosey that pretty thing that mr pendennis likes  i am sure that i will sing anything that mr pendennis likes says rosey with her candid bright eyesand she goes to the piano and warbles batti batti with her sweet fresh artless voice  more caresses follow mamma is in a rapture how pretty they lookthe mother and daughtertwo lilies twining together the necessity of an entertainment at the templelunch from dicks as before mentioned dessert from partingtons sibwrights spoons his boy to aid ours nay sib himself and his rooms which are so much more elegant than ours and where there is a piano and guitar all these thoughts pass in rapid and brilliant combination in the pleasant mr pendenniss mind how delighted the ladies are with the proposal mrs mackenzie claps her pretty hands and kisses rosey again if osculation is a mark of love surely mrs mack is the best of mothers i may say without false modesty that our little entertainment was most successful the champagne was iced to a nicety the ladies did not perceive that our laundress mrs flanagan was intoxicated very early in the afternoon percy sibwright sang admirably and with the greatest spirit ditties in many languages i am sure miss rosey thought him as indeed he is one of the most fascinating young fellows about town to her mothers excellent accompaniment rosey sang her favourite songs by the way her stock was very smallfive i think was the number then the table was moved into a corner where the quivering moulds of jelly seemed to keep time to the music and whilst percy played two couple of waltzers actually whirled round the little room no wonder that the court below was thronged with admirers that paley the reading man was in a rage and mrs flanagan in a state of excitement ah pleasant days happy gold dingy chambers illuminated by youthful sunshine merry songs and kind facesit is pleasant to recall you some of those bright eyes shine no more some of those smiling lips do not speak some are not less kind but sadder than in those days of which the memories revisit us for a moment and sink back into the grey past the dear old colonel beat time with great delight to the songs the widow lit his cigar with her own fair fingers that was the only smoke permitted during the entertainmentgeorge warrington himself not being allowed to use his cuttypipethough the gay little widow said that she had been used to smoking in the west indies and i dare say spoke the truth our entertainment lasted actually until after dark and a particularly neat cab being called from st clements by mr binnies boy you may be sure we all conducted the ladies to their vehicle and many a fellow returning from his lonely club that evening into chambers must have envied us the pleasure of having received two such beauties  the clerical bachelor was not to be outdone by the gentlemen of the bar and the entertainment at the temple was followed by one at honeymans lodgings which i must own greatly exceeded ours in splendour for honeyman had his luncheon from gunters and if he had been miss roseys mother giving a breakfast to the dear girl on her marriage the affair could not have been more elegant and handsome we had but two bouquets at our entertainment at honeymans there were four upon the breakfasttable besides a great pineapple which must have cost the rogue three or four guineas and which percy sibwright delicately cut up rosey thought the pineapple delicious the dear thing does not remember the pineapples in the west indies cries mrs mackenzie and she gave us many exciting narratives of entertainments at which she had been present at various colonial governors tables after luncheon our host hoped we should have a little music dancing of course could not be allowed that said honeyman with his softbleating sigh were scarcely clerical you know besides you are in a hermitage and with a glance round the table must put up with cenobites fare the fare was as i have said excellent the wine was bad as george and i and sib agreed and in so far we flattered ourselves that our feast altogether excelled the parsons the champagne especially was such stuff that warrington remarked on it to his neighbour a dark gentleman with a tuft to his chin and splendid rings and chains  the dark gentlemans wife and daughter were the other two ladies invited by our host the elder was splendidly dressed poor mrs mackenzies simple gimcracks though she displayed them to the most advantage and could make an ormolu bracelet go as far as another womans emerald clasps were as nothing compared to the other ladys gorgeous jewellery her fingers glittered with rings innumerable the head of her smellingbottle was as big as her husbands gold snuff box and of the same splendid material our ladies it must be confessed came in a modest cab from fitzroy square these arrived in a splendid little open carriage with white ponies and harness all over brass which the lady of the rings drove with a whip that was a parasol mrs mackenzie standing at honeymans window with her arm round roseys waist viewed this arrival perhaps with envy my dear mr honeyman whose are those beautiful horses cries rosey with enthusiasm  the divine says with a faint blushit isahit is mrs sherrick and miss sherrick who have done me the favour to come to luncheon  winemerchant oh thinks mrs mackenzie who has seen sherricks brass plate on the cellar door of lady whittleseas chapel and hence perhaps she was a trifle more magniloquent than usual and entertained us with stories of colonial governors and their ladies mentioning no persons but those who had handles to their names as the phrase is  although sherrick had actually supplied the champagne which warrington abused to him in confidence the winemerchant was not wounded on the contrary he roared with laughter at the remark and some of us smiled who understood the humour of the joke as for george warrington he scarce knew more about the town than the ladies opposite to him who yet more innocent than george thought the champagne very good mrs sherrick was silent during the meal looking constantly up at her husband as if alarmed and always in the habit of appealing to that gentleman who gave her as i thought knowing glances and savage winks which made me augur that he bullied her at home miss sherrick was exceedingly handsome she kept the fringed curtains of her eyes constantly down but when she lifted them up towards clive who was very attentive to her the rogue never sees a handsome woman but to this day he continues the same practicewhen she looked up and smiled she was indeed a beautiful young creature to beholdwith her pale forehead her thick arched eyebrows her rounded cheeks and her full lips slightly shadedhow shall i mention the wordslightly pencilled after the manner of the lips of the french governess mademoiselle lenoir  percy sibwright engaged miss mackenzie with his usual grace and affability mrs mackenzie did her very utmost to be gracious but it was evident the party was not altogether to her liking poor percy about whose means and expectations she had in the most natural way in the world asked information from me was not perhaps a very eligible admirer for darling rosey she knew not that percy can no more help gallantry than the sun can help shining as soon as rosey had done eating up her pineapple artlessly confessing to percy sibwrights inquiries that she preferred it to the rasps and hinnyblobs in her grandmammas garden now dearest rosey cries mrs mack now a little song you promised mr pendennis a little song honeyman whisks open the piano in a moment the widow takes off her cleaned gloves mrs sherricks were new and of the best paris make and little rosey sings no 1 followed by no 2 with very great applause mother and daughter entwine as they quit the piano brava brava says percy sibwright does mr clive newcome say nothing his back is turned to the piano and he is looking with all his might into the eyes of miss sherrick  percy sings a spanish seguidilla or a german lied or a french romance or a neapolitan canzonet which i am bound to say excites very little attention mrs ridley is sending in coffee at this juncture of which mrs sherrick partakes with lots of sugar as she has partaken of numberless things before chicken plovers eggs prawns aspics jellies creams grapes and whatnot mr honeyman advances and with deep respect asks if mrs sherrick and miss sherrick will not be persuaded to sing she rises and bows and again takes off the french gloves and shows the large white hands glittering with rings and summoning emily her daughter they go to the piano  can she sing whispers mrs mackenzie can she sing after eating so much can she sing indeed oh you poor ignorant mrs mackenzie why when you were in the west indies if you ever read the english newspapers you must have read of the fame of miss folthorpe mrs sherrick is no other than the famous artist who after three years of brilliant triumphs at the scala the pergola the san carlo the opera in england forsook her profession rejected a hundred suitors and married sherrick who was mr coxs lawyer who failed as everybody knows as manager of drury lane sherrick like a man of spirit would not allow his wife to sing in public after his marriage but in private society of course she is welcome to perform and now with her daughter who possesses a noble contralto voice she takes her place royally at the piano and the two sing so magnificently that everybody in the room with one single exception is charmed and delighted and that little miss cann herself creeps up the stairs and stands with mrs ridley at the door to listen to the music  miss sherrick looks doubly handsome as she sings clive newcome is in a rapture so is goodnatured miss rosey whose little heart beats with pleasure and who says quite unaffectedly to miss sherrick with delight and gratitude beaming from her blue eyes why did you ask me to sing when you sing so wonderfully so beautifully yourself do not leave the piano pleasedo sing again and she puts out a kind little hand towards the superior artist and blushing leads her back to the instrument im sure me and emily will sing for you as much as you like dear says mrs sherrick nodding to rosey goodnaturedly mrs mackenzie who has been biting her lips and drumming the time on a sidetable forgets at last the pain of being vanquished in admiration of the conquerors it was cruel of you not to tell us mr honeyman she says of theof the treat you had in store for us i had no idea we were going to meet professional people mrs sherricks singing is indeed beautiful  if you come up to our place in the regents park mr newcome mr sherrick says mrs s and emily will give you as many songs as you like how do you like the house in fitzroy square anything wanting doing there im a good landlord to a good tenant dont care what i spend on my houses lose by em sometimes name a day when youll come to us and ill ask some good fellows to meet you your father and mr binnie came once that was when you were a young chap they didnt have a bad evening i believe you just come and try usi can give you as good a glass of wine as most i think and he smiles perhaps thinking of the champagne which mr warrington had slighted ive ad the close carriage for my wife this evening he continues looking out of window at a very handsome brougham which has just drawn up there that little pair of horses steps prettily together dont they fond of horses i know you are see you in the park and going by our house sometimes the colonel sits a horse uncommonly well so do you mr newcome ive often said why dont they get off their horses and say sherrick were come for a bit of lunch and a glass of sherry name a day sir mr p will you be in it  clive newcome named a day and told his father of the circumstance in the evening the colonel looked grave there was something which i did not quite like about mr sherrick said that acute observer of human nature it was easy to see that the man is not quite a gentleman i dont care what a mans trade is clive indeed who are we to give ourselves airs upon that subject but when i am gone my boy and there is nobody near you who knows the world as i do you may fall into designing hands and rogues may lead you into mischief keep a sharp lookout clive mr pendennis here knows that there are designing fellows abroad and the dear old gentleman gives a very knowing nod as he speaks when i am gone keep the lad from harms way pendennis meanwhile mr sherrick has been a very good and obliging landlord and a man who sells wine may certainly give a friend a bottle i am glad you had a pleasant evening boys ladies i hope you have had a pleasant afternoon miss rosey you are come back to make tea for the old gentlemen james begins to get about briskly now he walked to hanover square mrs mackenzie without hurting his ankle in the least  i am almost sorry that he is getting well says mrs mackenzie sincerely he wont want us when he is quite cured  indeed my dear creature cries the colonel taking her pretty hand and kissing it he will want you and he shall want you james no more knows the world than miss rosey here and if i had not been with him would have been perfectly unable to take care of himself when i am gone to india somebody must stay with him andand my boy must have a home to go to says the kind soldier his voice dropping i had been in hopes that his own relatives would have received him more but never mind about that he cried more cheerfully why i may not be absent a year i perhaps need not go at alli am second for promotion a couple of our old generals may drop any day and when i get my regiment i come back to stay to live at home meantime whilst i am gone my dear lady you will take care of james and you will be kind to my boy  that i will said the widow radiant with pleasure and she took one of clives hands and pressed it for an instant and from clives fathers kind face there beamed out that benediction which always made his countenance appear to me among the most beautiful of human faces     chapter xxiv in which the newcome brothers once more meet together in unity   his narrative as the judicious reader no doubt is aware is written maturely and at ease long after the voyage is over whereof it recounts the adventures and perils the winds adverse and favourable the storms shoals shipwrecks islands and so forth which clive newcome met in his early journey in life in such a history events follow each other without necessarily having a connection with one another one ship crosses another ship and after a visit from one captain to his comrade they sail away each on his course the clive newcome meets a vessel which makes signals that she is short of bread and water and after supplying her our captain leaves her to see her no more one or two of the vessels with which we commenced the voyage together part company in a gale and founder miserably others after being wofully battered in the tempest make port or are cast upon surprising islands where all sorts of unlookedfor prosperity awaits the lucky crew also no doubt the writer of the book into whose hands clive newcomes logs have been put and who is charged with the duty of making two octavo volumes out of his friends story dresses up the narrative in his own way utters his own remarks in place of newcomes makes fanciful descriptions of individuals and incidents with which he never could have been personally acquainted and commits blunders which the critics will discover a great number of the descriptions in cooks voyages for instance were notoriously invented by dr hawkesworth who did the book so in the present volumes where dialogues are written down which the reporter could by no possibility have heard and where motives are detected which the persons actuated by them certainly never confided to the writer the public must once for all be warned that the authors individual fancy very likely supplies much of the narrative and that he forms it as best he may out of stray papers conversations reported to him and his knowledge right or wrong of the characters of the persons engaged and as is the case with the most orthodox histories the writers own guesses or conjectures are printed in exactly the same type as the most ascertained patent facts i fancy for my part that the speeches attributed to clive the colonel and the rest are as authentic as the orations in sallust or livy and only implore the truthloving public to believe that incidents here told and which passed very probably without witnesses were either confided to me subsequently as compiler of this biography or are of such a nature that they must have happened from what we know happened after for example when you read such words as qve romanvs on a battered roman stone your profound antiquarian knowledge enables you to assert that senatvs popvlvs was also inscribed there at some time or other you take a mutilated statue of mars bacchus apollo or virorum and you pop him on a wanting hand an absent foot or a nose which time or barbarians have defaced you tell your tales as you can and state the facts as you think they must have been in this manner mr james historiographer to her majesty titus livius professor alison robinson crusoe and all historians proceeded blunders there must be in the best of these narratives and more asserted than they can possibly know or vouch for  to recur to our own affairs and the subject at present in hand i am obliged here to supply from conjecture a few points of the history which i could not know from actual experience or hearsay clive let us say is romanus and we must add senatus populusque to his inscription after mrs mackenzie and her pretty daughter had been for a few months in london which they did not think of quitting although mr binnies wounded little leg was now as well and as brisk as ever it had been a redintegration of love began to take place between the colonel and his relatives in park lane how should we know that there had ever been a quarrel or at any rate a coolness thomas newcome was not a man to talk at length of any such matter though a word or two occasionally dropped in conversation by the simple gentleman might lead persons who chose to interest themselves about his family affairs to form their own opinions concerning them after that visit of the colonel and his son to newcome ethel was constantly away with her grandmother the colonel went to see his pretty little favourite at brighton and once twice thrice lady kews door was denied to him the knocker of that door could not be more fierce than the old ladys countenance when newcome met her in her chariot driving on the cliff once forming the loveliest of a charming amazonian squadron led by mr whiskin the ridingmaster when the colonel encountered his pretty ethel she greeted him affectionately it is true there was still the sweet look of candour and love in her eyes but when he rode up to her she looked so constrained when he talked about clive so reserved when he left her so sad that he could not but feel pain and commiseration back he went to london having in a week only caught this single glance of his darling  this event occurred while clive was painting his picture of the battle of assaye before mentioned during the struggles incident on which composition he was not thinking much about miss ethel or his papa or any other subject but his great work whilst assaye was still in progress thomas newcome must have had an explanation with his sisterinlaw lady anne to whom he frankly owned the hopes which he had entertained for clive and who must as frankly have told the colonel that ethels family had very different views for that young lady to those which the simple colonel had formed a generous early attachment the colonel thought is the safeguard of a young man to love a noble girl to wait a while and struggle and haply do some little achievement in order to win her the best task to which his boy could set himself if two young people so loving each other were to marry on rather narrow means what then a happy home was better than the finest house in mayfair a generous young fellow such as please god his son wasloyal upright and a gentlemanmight pretend surely to his kinswomans hand without derogation and the affection he bore ethel himself was so great and the sweet regard with which she returned it that the simple father thought his kindly project was favoured by heaven and prayed for its fulfilment and pleased himself to think when his campaigns were over and his sword hung on the wall what a beloved daughter he might have to soothe and cheer his old age with such a wife for his son and child for himself he thought the happiness of his last years might repay him for friendless boyhood lonely manhood and cheerless exile and he imparted his simple scheme to ethels mother who no doubt was touched as he told his story for she always professed regard and respect for him and in the differences which afterwards occurred in the family and the quarrels which divided the brothers still remained faithful to the good colonel  but barnes newcome esquire was the bead of the house and the governor of his father and all sir brians affairs and barnes newcome esquire hated his cousin clive and spoke of him as a beggarly painter an impudent snob an infernal young puppy and so forth and barnes with his usual freedom of language imparted his opinions to his uncle hobson at the bank and uncle hobson carried them home to mrs newcome in bryanstone square and mrs newcome took an early opportunity of telling the colonel her opinion on the subject and of bewailing that love for aristocracy which she saw actuated some folks and the colonel was brought to see that barnes was his boys enemy and words very likely passed between them for thomas newcome took a new banker at this time and as clive informed me was in very great dudgeon because hobson brothers wrote to him to say that he had overdrawn his account i am sure there is some screw loose the sagacious youth remarked to me and the colonel and the people in park lane are at variance because he goes there very little now and he promised to go to court when ethel was presented and he didnt go  some months after the arrival of mr binnies niece and sister in fitzroy square the fraternal quarrel between the newcomes must have come to an endfor that time at leastand was followed by a rather ostentatious reconciliation and pretty little rosey mackenzie was the innocent and unconscious cause of this amiable change in the minds of the three brethren as i gathered from a little conversation with mrs newcome who did me the honour to invite me to her table as she had not vouchsafed this hospitality to me for a couple of years previously and perfectly stifled me with affability when we metas her invitation came quite at the end of the season when almost everybody was out of town and a dinner to a man is no complimenti was at first for declining this invitation and spoke of it with great scorn when mr newcome orally delivered it to me at bayss club  what said i turning round to an old man of the world who happened to be in the room at the time what do these people mean by asking a fellow to dinner in august and taking me up after dropping me for two years  my good fellow says my friendit was my kind old uncle major pendennis indeedi have lived long enough about town never to ask myself questions of that sort in the world people drop you and take you up every day you know lady cheddar by sight i have known her husband for forty years i have stayed with them in the country for weeks at a time she knows me as well as she knows king charles at charing cross and a doosid deal better and yet for a whole season she will drop mepass me by as if there was no such person in the world well sir what do i do i never see her i give you my word i am never conscious of her existence and if i meet her at dinner im no more aware of her than the fellows in the play are of banquo whats the end of it she comes roundonly last toosday she came roundand said lord cheddar wanted me to go down to wiltshire i asked after the family you know henry churningham is engaged to miss renneta doosid good match for the cheddars we shook hands and are as good friends as ever i dont suppose shell cry when i die you know said the worthy old gentleman with a grin nor shall i go into very deep mourning if anything happens to her you were quite right to say to newcome that you did not know whether you were free or not and would look at your engagements when you got home and give him an answer a fellow of that rank has no right to give himself airs but they will sir some of those bankers are as high and mighty as the oldest families they marry noblemens daughters by jove and think nothing is too good for em but i should go if i were you arthur i dined there a couple of months ago and the bankeress said something about you that you and her nephew were much together that you were sad wild dogs i thinksomething of that sort gad maam says i boys will be boys and they grow to be men says she nodding her head queer little woman devilish pompous dinner confoundedly long stoopid scientific  the old gentleman was on this day inclined to be talkative and confidential and i set down some more remarks which he made concerning my friends your indian colonel says he seems a worthy man the major quite forgot having been in india himself unless he was in company with some very great personage he dont seem to know much of the world and we are not very intimate fitzroy square is a devlish long way off for a fellow to go for a dinner and entre nous the dinner is rather queer and the company still more so its right for you who are a literary man to see all sorts of people but im different you know so newcome and i are not very thick together they say he wanted to marry your friend to lady annes daughter an exceedingly fine girl one of the prettiest girls come out this season i hear the young men say so and that shows how monstrous ignorant of the world colonel newcome is his son could no more get that girl than he could marry one of the royal princesses mark my words they intend miss newcome for lord kew those banker fellows are wild after grand marriages kew will sow his wild oats and theyll marry her to him or if not to him to some man of high rank his father walham was a weak young man but his grandmother old lady kew is a monstrous clever old woman too severe with her children one of whom ran away and married a poor devil without a shilling nothing could show a more deplorable ignorance of the world than poor newcome supposing his son could make such a match as that with his cousin is it true that he is going to make his son an artist i dont know what the dooce the world is coming to an artist by gad in my time a fellow would as soon have thought of making his son a hairdresser or a pastrycook by gad and the worthy major gives his nephew two fingers and trots off to the next club in st jamess street of which he is a member  the virtuous hostess of bryanstone square was quite civil and goodhumoured when mr pendennis appeared at her house and my surprise was not inconsiderable when i found the whole party from saint pancras there assembledmr binnie the colonel and his son mrs mackenzie looking uncommonly handsome and perfectly welldressed and miss rosey in pink crape with pearly shoulders and blushing cheeks and beautiful fair ringletsas fresh and comely a sight as it was possible to witness scarcely had we made our bows and shaken our hands and imparted our observations about the fineness of the weather when behold as we look from the drawingroom windows into the cheerful square of bryanstone a great family coach arrives driven by a family coachman in a family wig and we recognise lady anne newcomes carriage and see her ladyship her mother her daughter and her husband sir brian descend from the vehicle it is quite a family party whispers the happy mrs newcome to the happy writer conversing with her in the niche of the window knowing your intimacy with our brother colonel newcome we thought it would please him to meet you here will you be so kind as to take miss newcome to dinner  everybody was bent upon being happy and gracious it was my dear brother how do you do from sir brian my dear colonel how glad we are to see you how well you look from lady anne miss newcome ran up to him with both hands out and put her beautiful face so close to his that i thought upon my conscience she was going to kiss him and lady kew advancing in the frankest manner with a smile i must own rather awful playing round her many wrinkles round her ladyships hooked nose and displaying her ladyships teeth a new and exceedingly handsome set held out her hand to colonel newcome and said briskly colonel it is an age since we met she turns to clive with equal graciousness and goodhumour and says mr clive let me shake hands with you i have heard all sorts of good of you that you have been painting the most beautiful things that you are going to be quite famous nothing can exceed the grace and kindness of lady anne newcome towards mrs mackenzie the pretty widow blushes with pleasure at this greeting and now lady anne must be introduced to mrs mackenzies charming daughter and whispers in the delighted mothers ear she is lovely rosey comes up looking rosy indeed and executes a pretty curtsey with a great deal of blushing grace  ethel has been so happy to see her dear uncle that as yet she has had no eyes for any one else until clive advancing those bright eyes become brighter still with surprise and pleasure as she beholds him for being absent with his family in italy now and not likely to see this biography for many many months i may say that he is a much handsomer fellow than our designer has represented and if that wayward artist should take this very scene for the purpose of illustration he is requested to bear in mind that the hero of this story will wish to have justice done to his person there exists in mr newcomes possession a charming little pencildrawing of clive at this age and which colonel newcome took with him when he wentwhither he is about to go in a very few pagesand brought back with him to this country a florid apparel becomes some men as simple raiment suits others and clive in his youth was of the ornamental class of mankinda customer to tailors a wearer of handsome rings shirtstuds mustachios long hair and the like nor could he help in his costume or his nature being picturesque and generous and splendid he was always greatly delighted with that scotch manatarms in quentin durward who twists off an inch or two of his gold chain to treat a friend and pay for a bottle he would give a comrade a ring or a fine jewelled pin if he had no money silver dressingcases and brocade morninggowns were in him a sort of propriety at this season of his youth it was a pleasure to persons of colder temperament to sun themselves in the warmth of his bright looks and generous humour his laughter cheered one like wine i do not know that he was very witty but he was pleasant he was prone to blush the history of a generous trait moistened his eyes instantly he was instinctively fond of children and of the other sex from one year old to eighty coming from the derby oncea merry partyand stopped on the road from epsom in a lock of carriages during which the people in the carriage ahead saluted us with many vituperative epithets and seized the heads of our leadersclive in a twinkling jumped off the box and the next minute we saw him engaged with a halfdozen of the enemy his hat gone his fair hair flying off his face his blue eyes flashing with fire his lips and nostrils quivering wrath his right and left hand hitting out que cetoit un plaisir voir his father sat back in the carriage looking with delight and wonderindeed it was a great sight policeman x separated the warriors clive ascended the box again with a dreadful wound in the coat which was gashed from the waist to the shoulder i hardly ever saw the elder newcome in such a state of triumph the postboys quite stared at the gratuity he gave them and wished they might drive his lordship to the oaks  all the time we have been making this sketch ethel is standing looking at clive and the blushing youth casts down his eyes before hers her face assumes a look of arch humour she passes a slim hand over the prettiest lips and a chin with the most lovely of dimples thereby indicating her admiration of mr clives mustachios and imperial they are of a warm yellowish chestnut colour and have not yet known the razor he wears a low cravat a shirtfront of the finest lawn with ruby buttons his hair of a lighter colour waves almost to his manly shoulders broad upon my word my dear colonel says lady kew after looking at him and nodding her head shrewdly i think we were right  no doubt right in everything your ladyship does but in what particularly asks the colonel  right to keep him out of the way ethel has been disposed of these ten years did not anne tell you how foolish of her but all mothers like to have young men dying for their daughters your son is really the handsomest boy in london who is that conceitedlooking young man in the window mr penwhat has your son really been very wicked i was told he was a sad scapegrace  i never knew him do and i dont believe he ever thought anything that was untrue or unkind or ungenerous says the colonel if any one has belied my boy to you and i think i know who his enemy has been  the young lady is very pretty remarks lady kew stopping the colonels further outbreak how very young her mother looks ethel my dear colonel newcome must present us to mrs mackenzie and miss mackenzie and ethel giving a nod to clive with whom she has talked for a minute or two again puts her hand in her uncles and walks towards mrs mackenzie and her daughter  and now let the artist if he has succeeded in drawing clive to his liking cut a fresh pencil and give us a likeness of ethel she is seventeen years old rather taller than the majority of women of a countenance somewhat grave and haughty but on occasion brightening with humour or beaming with kindliness and affection too quick to detect affectation or insincerity in others too impatient of dulness or pomposity she is more sarcastic now than she became when after years of suffering had softened her nature truth looks out of her bright eyes and rises up armed and flashes scorn or denial perhaps too readily when she encounters flattery or meanness or imposture after her first appearance in the world if the truth must be told this young lady was popular neither with many men nor with most women the innocent dancing youth who pressed round her attracted by her beauty were rather afraid after a while of engaging her this one felt dimly that she despised him another that his simpering commonplaces delights of how many wellbred maidens only occasioned miss newcomes laughter young lord croesus whom all maidens and matrons were eager to secure was astounded to find that he was utterly indifferent to her and that she would refuse him twice or thrice in an evening and dance as many times with poor tom spring who was his fathers ninth son and only at home till he could get a ship and go to sea again the young women were frightened at her sarcasm she seemed to know what fadaises they whispered to their partners as they paused in the waltzes and fanny who was luring lord croesus towards her with her blue eyes dropped them guiltily to the floor when ethels turned towards her and cecilia sang more out of time than usual and clara who was holding freddy and charley and tommy round her enchanted by her bright conversation and witty mischief became dumb and disturbed when ethel passed her with her cold face and old lady hookham who was playing off her little minnie now at young jack gorget of the guards now at the eager and simple bob bateson of the coldstreams would slink off when ethel made her appearance on the ground whose presence seemed to frighten away the fish and the angler no wonder that the other mayfair nymphs were afraid of this severe diana whose looks were so cold and whose arrows were so keen  but those who had no cause to heed dianas shot or coldness might admire her beauty nor could the famous parisian marble which clive said she resembled be more perfect in form than this young lady her hair and eyebrows were jet black these latter may have been too thick according to some physiognomists giving rather a stern expression to the eyes and hence causing those guilty ones to tremble who came under her lash but her complexion was as dazzlingly fair and her cheeks as red as miss roseys own who had a right to those beauties being a blonde by nature in miss ethels black hair there was a slight natural ripple as when a fresh breeze blows over the melan hudora ripple such as roman ladies nineteen hundred years ago and our own beauties a short time since endeavoured to imitate by art paper and i believe crumplingirons her eyes were grey her mouth rather large her teeth as regular and bright as lady kews own her voice low and sweet and her smile when it lighted up her face and eyes as beautiful as spring sunshine also they could lighten and flash often and sometimes though rarely rain as for her figurebut as this tall slender form is concealed in a simple white muslin robe of the sort which i believe is called demitoilette in which her fair arms are enveloped and which is confined at her slim waist by an azure ribbon and descends to her feetlet us make a respectful bow to that fair image of youth health and modesty and fancy it as pretty as we will miss ethel made a very stately curtsey to mrs mackenzie surveying that widow calmly so that the elder lady looked up and fluttered but towards rosey she held out her hand and smiled with the utmost kindness and the smile was returned by the other and the blushes with which miss mackenzie was always ready at this time became her very much as for mrs mackenziethe very largest curve that shall not be a caricature and actually disfigure the widows countenancea smile so wide and steady so exceedingly rident indeed as almost to be ridiculous may be drawn upon her buxom face if the artist chooses to attempt it as it appeared during the whole of this summer evening before dinner came when people ordinarily look very grave when she was introduced to the company when she was made known to our friends julia and mariathe darling child lovely little dears how like their papa and mammawhen sir brian newcome gave her his arm downstairs to the diningroom when anybody spoke to her when john offered her meat or the gentleman in the white waistcoat wine when she accepted or when she refused these refreshments when mr newcome told her a dreadfully stupid story when the colonel called cheerily from his end of the table my dear mrs mackenzie you dont take any wine today may i not have the honour of drinking a glass of champagne with you when the new boy from the country upset some sauce upon her shoulder when mrs newcome made the sign for departure and i have no doubt in the drawingroom when the ladies retired thither mrs mack is perfectly awful clive told me afterwards since that dinner in bryanstone square lady kew and lady anne are never out of her mouth she has had white muslin dresses made just like ethels for herself and her daughter she has bought a peerage and knows the pedigree of the whole kew family she wont go out in a cab now without the boy on the box and in the plate for the cards which she has established in the drawingroom you know lady kews pasteboard always will come up to the top though i poke it down whenever i go into the room as for poor lady trotter the governess of st kitts you know and the bishop of tobago they are quite bowled out mrs mack has not mentioned them for a week  during the dinner it seemed to me that the lovely young lady by whom i sate cast many glances towards mrs mackenzie which did not betoken particular pleasure miss ethel asked me several questions regarding clive and also respecting miss mackenzie perhaps her questions were rather downright and imperious and she patronised me in a manner that would not have given all gentlemen pleasure i was clives friend his schoolfellow had i seen him a great deal know him very wellvery well indeed was it true that he had been very thoughtless very wild who told her so that was not her question with a blush it was not true and i ought to know he was not spoiled he was very goodnatured generous told the truth he loved his profession very much and had great talent indeed she was very glad why do they sneer at his profession it seemed to her quite as good as her fathers and brothers were artists not very dissipated not more so nor often so much as other young men was mr binnie rich and was he going to leave all his money to his niece how long have you known them is miss mackenzie as goodnatured as she looks not very clever i suppose mrs mackenzie looks veryno thank you no more grandmamma she is very deaf and cannot hear scolded me for reading the book you wrote and took the book away i afterwards got it and read it all i dont think there was any harm in it why do you give such bad characters of women dont you know any good ones yes two as good as any in the world they are unselfish they are pious they are always doing good they live in the country why dont you put them into a book why dont you put my uncle into a book he is so good that nobody could make him good enough before i came out i heard a young ladylady claverings daughter miss amory sing a song of yours i have never spoken to an author before i saw mr lyon at lady popinjoys and heard him speak he said it was very hot and he looked so i am sure who is the greatest author now alive you will tell me when you come upstairs after dinnerand the young lady sails away following the matrons who rise and ascend to the drawingroom miss newcome has been watching the behaviour of the author by whom she sate curious to know what such a persons habits are whether he speaks and acts like other people and in what respect authors are different from persons in society  when we had sufficiently enjoyed claret and politics belowstairs the gentlemen went to the drawingroom to partake of coffee and the ladies delightful conversation we had heard previously the tinkling of the piano above and the wellknown sound of a couple of miss roseys five songs the two young ladies were engaged over an album at a sidetable when the males of the party arrived the book contained a number of clives drawings made in the time of his very early youth for the amusement of his little cousins miss ethel seemed to be very much pleased with these performances which miss mackenzie likewise examined with great goodnature and satisfaction so she did the views of rome naples marble hill in the county of sussex etc in the same collection so she did the berlin cockatoo and spaniel which mrs newcome was working in idle moments so she did the books of beauty flowers of loveliness and so forth she thought the prints very sweet and pretty she thought the poetry very pretty and sweet which did she like best mr niminys lines to a bunch of violets or miss piminys stanzas to a wreath of roses miss mackenzie was quite puzzled to say which of these masterpieces she preferred she found them alike so pretty she appealed as in most cases to mamma how my darling love can i pretend to know mamma says i have been a soldiers wife battling about the world i have not had your advantages i had no drawingmasters nor musicmasters as you have you dearest child must instruct me in these things this poses rosey who prefers to have her opinions dealt out to her like her frocks bonnets handkerchiefs her shoes and gloves and the order thereof the lumps of sugar for her tea the proper quantity of raspberry jam for breakfast who trusts for all supplies corporeal and spiritual to her mother for her own part rosey is pleased with everything in nature does she love music oh yes bellini and donizetti oh yes dancing they had no dancing at grandmammas but she adores dancing and mr clive dances very well indeed a smile from miss ethel at this admission does she like the country oh she is so happy in the country london london is delightful and so is the seaside she does not really know which she likes best london or the country for mamma is not near her to decide being engaged listening to sir brian who is laying down the law to her and smiling smiling with all her might in fact mr newcome says to mr pendennis in his droll humorous way that woman grins like a cheshire cat who was the naturalist who first discovered that peculiarity of the cats in cheshire  in regard to miss mackenzies opinions then it is not easy to discover that they are decided or profound or original but it seems pretty clear that she has a good temper and a happy contented disposition and the smile which her pretty countenance wears shows off to great advantage the two dimples on her pink cheeks her teeth are even and white her hair of a beautiful colour and no snow can be whiter than her fair round neck and polished shoulders she talks very kindly and goodnaturedly with julia and maria mrs hobsons precious ones until she is bewildered by the statements which those young ladies make regarding astronomy botany and chemistry all of which they are studying my dears i dont know a single word about any of these abstruse subjects i wish i did she says and ethel newcome laughs she too is ignorant upon all these subjects i am glad there is some one else says rosey with naivete who is as ignorant as i am and the younger children with a solemn air say they will ask mamma leave to teach her so everybody somehow great or small seems to protect her and the humble simple gentle little thing wins a certain degree of goodwill from the world which is touched by her humility and her pretty sweet looks the servants in fitzroy square waited upon her much more kindly than upon her smiling bustling mother uncle james is especially fond of his little rosey her presence in his study never discomposes him whereas his sister fatigues him with the exceeding activity of her gratitude and her energy in pleasing as i was going away i thought i heard sir brian newcome say it but what it was of course i cannot conjectureit will do very well the mother seems a superior woman     chapter xxv is passed in a publichouse   i had no more conversation with miss newcome that night who had forgotten her curiosity about the habits of authors when she had ended her talk with miss mackenzie she devoted the rest of the evening to her uncle colonel newcome and concluded by saying and now you will come and ride with me tomorrow uncle wont you which the colonel faithfully promised to do and she shook hands with clive very kindly and with rosey very frankly but as i thought with rather a patronising air and she made a very stately bow to mrs mackenzie and so departed with her father and mother lady kew had gone away earlier mrs mackenzie informed us afterwards that the countess had gone to sleep after her dinner if it was at mrs macks story about the governors ball at tobago and the quarrel for precedence between the lord bishops lady mrs rotchet and the chief justices wife lady barwise i should not be at all surprised  a handsome fly carried off the ladies to fitzroy square and the two worthy indian gentlemen in their company clive and i walking with the usual havannah to light us home and clive remarked that he supposed there had been some difference between his father and the bankers for they had not met for ever so many months before and the colonel always had looked very gloomy when his brothers were mentioned and i cant help thinking says the astute youth that they fancied i was in love with ethel i know the colonel would have liked me to make up to her and that may have occasioned the row now i suppose they think i am engaged to rosey what the deuce are they in such a hurry to marry me for  clives companion remarked that marriage was a laudable institution and an honest attachment an excellent conservator of youthful morals on which clive replied why dont you marry yourself  this it was justly suggested was no argument but a merely personal allusion foreign to the question which was that marriage was laudable etc  mr clive laughed rosey is as good a little creature as can be he said she is never out of temper though i fancy mrs mackenzie tries her i dont think she is very wise but she is uncommonly pretty and her beauty grows on you as for ethel anything so high and mighty i have never seen since i saw the french giantess going to court and about to parties every night where a parcel of young fools flatter her has perfectly spoiled her by jove how handsome she is how she turns with her long neck and looks at you from under those black eyebrows if i painted her hair i think i should paint it almost blue and then glaze over with lake it is blue and how finely her head is joined on to her shouldersand he waves in the air an imaginary line with his cigar she would do for judith wouldnt she or how grand she would look as herodiass daughter sweeping down a stairin a great dress of clothofgold like paul veroneseholding a charger before her with white arms you knowwith the muscles accented like that glorious diana at parisa savage smile on her face and a ghastly solemn gory head on the dish i see the picture sir i see the picture and he fell to curling his mustachios just like his brave old father  i could not help laughing at the resemblance and mentioning it to my friend he broke as was his wont into a fond eulogium of his sire wished he could be like himworked himself up into another state of excitement in which he averred that if his father wanted him to marry he would marry that instant and why not rosey she is a dear little thing or why not that splendid miss sherrick what aheada regular titian i was looking at the difference of their colour at uncle honeymans that day of the dejeuner the shadows in roseys face sir are all pearlytinted you ought to paint her in milk sir cries the enthusiast have you ever remarked the grey round her eyes and the sort of purple bloom of her cheek rubens could have done the colour but i dont somehow like to think of a young lady and that sensuous old peter paul in company i look at her like a little wildflower in a fieldlike a little child at play sir pretty little tender nursling if i see her passing in the street i feel as if i would like some fellow to be rude to her that i might have the pleasure of knocking him down she is like a little songbird sira tremulous fluttering little linnet that you would take into your hand pavidam quaerentem matrem and smooth its little plumes and let it perch on your finger and sing the sherrick creates quite a different sentimentthe sherrick is splendid stately sleepy  stupid hints clives companion  stupid why not some women ought to be stupid what you call dulness i call repose give me a calm woman a slow womana lazy majestic woman show me a gracious virgin bearing a lily not a leering giggler frisking a rattle a lively woman would be the death of me look at mrs mack perpetually nodding winking grinning throwing out signals which you are to be at the trouble to answer i thought her delightful for three days i declare i was in love with herthat is as much as i can be afterbut never mind that i feel i shall never be really in love again why shouldnt the sherrick be stupid i say about great beauty there should always reign a silence as you look at the great stars the great ocean any great scene of nature you hush sir you laugh at a pantomime but you are still in a temple when i saw the great venus of the louvre i thoughtwert thou alive o goddess thou shouldst never open those lovely lips but to speak lowly slowly thou shouldst never descend from that pedestal but to walk stately to some near couch and assume another attitude of beautiful calm to be beautiful is enough if a woman can do that well who shall demand more from her you dont want a rose to sing and i think wit is out of place where theres great beauty as i wouldnt have a queen to cut jokes on her throne i say pendennishere broke off the enthusiastic youthhave you got another cigar shall we go into finchs and have a game at billiards just oneits quite early yet or shall we go in the haunt its wednesday night you know when all the boys go we tap at a door in an old old street in soho an old maid with a kind comical face opens the door and nods friendly and says how do sir aint seen you this ever so long how do mr noocom whos here most everybodys here we pass by a little snug bar in which a trim elderly lady is seated by a great fire on which boils an enormous kettle while two gentlemen are attacking a cold saddle of mutton and west india pickles hard by mrs nokes the landladys elbowwith mutual bowswe recognise hickson the sculptor and morgan the intrepid irish chieftain chief of the reporters of the morning press newspaper we pass through a passage into a back room and are received with a roar of welcome from a crowd of men almost invisible in the smoke  i am right glad to see thee boy cries a cheery voice that will never troll a chorus more we spake anon of thy misfortune gentle youth and that thy warriors of assaye have charged the academy in vain mayhap thou frightenedst the courtly school with barbarous visages of grisly warpendennis thou dost wear a thirsty look resplendent swell untwine thy choker white and i will either stand a glass of grog or thou shalt pay the like for me my lad and tell us of the fashionable world thus spake the brave old tom sarjentalso one of the press one of the old boys a good old scholar with a good old library of books who had taken his seat any time these forty years by the chimneyfire in this old haunt where painters sculptors men of letters actors used to congregate passing pleasant hours in rough kindly communion and many a day seeing the sunrise lighting the rosy street ere they parted and betsy put the useless lamp out and closed the hospitable gates of the haunt  the time is not very long since though today is so changed as we think of it the kind familiar faces rise up and we hear the pleasant voices and singing there are they met the honest hearty companions in the days when the haunt was a haunt stagecoaches were not yet quite over casinos were not invented clubs were rather rare luxuries there were sanded floors triangular sawdustboxes pipes and tavern parlours young smith and brown from the temple did not go from chambers to dine at the polyanthus or the megatherium off potage a la bisque turbot au gratin cotelettes a la whatdoyoucallem and a pint of st emilion but ordered their beefsteak and pint of port from the plump headwaiter at the cock did not disdain the pit of the theatre and for a supper a homely refection at the tavern how delightful are the suppers in charles lamb to read of even nowthe cardsthe punchthe candles to be snuffedthe social oystersthe modest cheer whoever snuffs a candle now what man has a domestic supper whose dinnerhour is eight oclock those little meetings in the memory of many of us yet are gone quite away into the past fiveandtwenty years ago is a hundred years offso much has our social life changed in those five lustres james boswell himself were he to revisit london would scarce venture to enter a tavern he would find scarce a respectable companion to enter its doors with him it is an institution as extinct as a hackneycoach many a grown man who peruses this historic page has never seen such a vehicle and only heard of rumpunch as a drink which his ancestors used to tipple  cheery old tom sarjent is surrounded at the haunt by a dozen of kind boon companions they toil all day at their avocations of art or letters or law and here meet for a harmless nights recreation and converse they talk of literature or politics or pictures or plays socially banter one another over their cheap cups sing brave old songs sometimes when they are especially jolly kindly ballads in praise of love and wine famous maritime ditties in honour of old england i fancy i hear jack brents noble voice rolling out the sad generous refrain of the deserter then for that reason and for a season we will be merry before we go or michael percys clear tenor carolling the irish chorus of whats that to any one whether or no or mark wilder shouting his bottlesong of garryowen na gloria these songs were regarded with affection by the brave old frequenters of the haunt a gentlemans property in a song was considered sacred it was respectfully asked for it was heard with the more pleasure for being old honest tom sarjent how the times have changed since we saw thee i believe the present chief of the reporters of the newspaper which responsible office tom filled goes to parliament in his brougham and dines with the ministers of the crown  around tom are seated grave royal academicians rising gay associates writers of other journals besides the pall mall gazette a barrister maybe whose name will be famous some day a hewer of marble perhaps a surgeon whose patients have not come yet and one or two men about town who like this queer assembly better than haunts much more splendid captain shandon has been here and his jokes are preserved in the tradition of the place owlet the philosopher came once and tried as his wont is to lecture but his metaphysics were beaten down by a storm of banter slatter who gave himself such airs because he wrote in the review tried to air himself at the haunt but was choked by the smoke and silenced by the unanimous poohpoohing of the assembly dick walker who rebelled secretly at sarjents authority once thought to give himself consequence by bringing a young lord from the blue posts but he was so unmercifully chaffed by tom that even the young lord laughed at him his lordship has been heard to say he had been taken to a monsus queeah place queeah set of folks in a tap somewhere though he went away quite delighted with toms affability but he never came again he could not find the place probably you might pass the haunt in the daytime and not know it in the least i believe said charley ormond ara he was theni believe in the day theres no such place at all and when betsy turns the gas off at the doorlamp as we go away the whole thing vanishes the door the house the bar the haunt betsy the beerboy mrs nokes and all it has vanished it is to be found no more neither by night nor by dayunless the ghosts of good fellows still haunt it  as the genial talk and glass go round and after clive and his friend have modestly answered the various queries put to them by good old tom sarjent the acknowledged praeses of the assembly and sachem of this venerable wigwam the door opens and another wellknown figure is recognised with shouts as it emerges through the smoke bayham all hail says tom frederick i am right glad to see thee  bayham says he is disturbed in spirit and calls for a pint of beer to console him  hast thou flown far thou restless bird of night asks father tom who loves speaking in blank verses  i have come from cursitor street says bayham in a low groan i have just been to see a poor devil in quod there is that you pendennis you know the mancharles honeyman  what cries clive starting up  o my prophetic soul my uncle growls bayham i did not see the young one but tis true  the reader is aware that more than the three years have elapsed of which time the preceding pages contain the harmless chronicle and while thomas newcomes leave has been running out and clives mustachios growing the fate of other persons connected with our story has also had its development and their fortune has experienced its natural progress its increase or decay our tale such as it has hitherto been arranged has passed leisurely in scenes wherein the present tense is perforce adopted the writer acting as chorus to the drama and occasionally explaining by hints or more open statements what has occurred during the intervals of the acts and how it happens that the performers are in such or such a posture in the modern theatre as the playgoing critic knows the explanatory personage is usually of quite a thirdrate order he is the two walkinggentlemen friends of sir harry courtly who welcome the young baronet to london and discourse about the niggardliness of harrys old uncle the nabob and the depth of courtlys passion for lady annabel the premiere amoureuse he is the confidant in white linen to the heroine in white satin he is tom you rascal the valet or tiger more or less impudent and acutethat wellknown menial in topboots and a livery frock with red cuffs and collar whom sir harry always retains in his service addresses with scurrilous familiarity and pays so irregularly or he is lucetta lady annabels waitingmaid who carries the billetsdoux and peeps into them knows all about the family affairs pops the lover under the sofa and sings a comic song between the scenes our business now is to enter into charles honeymans privacy to peer into the secrets of that reverend gentleman and to tell what has happened to him during the past months in which he has made fitful though graceful appearances on our scene  while his nephews whiskers have been budding and his brotherinlaw has been spending his money and leave mr honeymans hopes have been withering his sermons growing stale his once blooming popularity drooping and running to seed many causes have contributed to bring him to his present melancholy strait when you go to lady whittleseas chapel now it is by no means crowded gaps are in the pews there is not the least difficulty in getting a snug place near the pulpit whence the preacher can look over his pockethandkerchief and see lord dozeley no more his lordship has long gone to sleep elsewhere and a host of the fashionable faithful have migrated too the incumbent can no more cast his fine eyes upon the french bonnets of the female aristocracy and see some of the loveliest faces in mayfair regarding his with expressions of admiration actual dowdy tradesmen of the neighbourhood are seated with their families in the aisles ridley and his wife and son have one of the very best seats to be sure ridley looks like a nobleman with his large waistcoat bald head and gilt book j j has a fine head but mrs ridley cook and housekeeper is written on her round face the music is by no means of its former good quality that rebellious and illconditioned basso bellew has seceded and seduced the four best singing boys who now perform glees at the cave of harmony honeyman has a right to speak of persecution and to compare himself to a hermit in so far that he preaches in a desert once like another hermit st hierome he used to be visited by lions none such come to him now such lions as frequent the clergy are gone off to lick the feet of other ecclesiastics they are weary of poor honeymans old sermons  rivals have sprung up in the course of these three yearshave sprung up round about honeyman and carried his flock into their folds we know how such simple animals will leap one after another and that it is the sheepish way perhaps a new pastor has come to the church of st jacobs hard bybold resolute bright clear a scholar and no pedant his manly voice is thrilling in their ears he speaks of life and conduct of practice as well as faith and crowds of the most polite and most intelligent and best informed and best dressed and most selfish people in the world come and hear him twice at least there are so many wellinformed and welldressed etc etc people in the world that the succession of them keeps st jacobs full for a year or more then it may be a bawling quack who has neither knowledge nor scholarship nor charity but who frightens the public with denunciations and rouses them with the energy of his wrath succeeds in bringing them together for a while till they tire of his din and curses meanwhile the good quiet old churches round about ring their accustomed bell open their sabbath gates receive their tranquil congregations and sober priest who has been busy all the week at schools and sickbeds with watchful teaching gentle counsel and silent alms  though we saw honeyman but seldom for his company was not altogether amusing and his affectation when one became acquainted with it very tiresome to witness fred bayham from his garret at mrs ridleys kept constant watch over the curate and told us of his proceedings from time to time when we heard the melancholy news first announced of course the intelligence damped the gaiety of clive and his companion and f b conducted all the affairs of life with great gravity telling tom sarjent that he had news of importance for our private ear tom with still more gravity than f bs said go my children you had best discuss this topic in a separate room apart from the din and fun of a convivial assembly and ringing the bell he bade betsy bring him another glass of rumandwater and one for mr desborough to be charged to him  we adjourned to another parlour then where gas was lighted up and f b over a pint of beer narrated poor honeymans mishap saving your presence clive said bayham and with every regard for the youthful bloom of your young hearts affections your uncle charles honeyman sir is a bad lot i have known him these twenty years when i was at his fathers as a private tutor old miss honeyman is one of those cards which we call trumpsso was old honeyman a trump but charles and his sister  i stamped on f bs foot under the table he seemed to have forgotten that he was about to speak of clives mother  hem of your poor mother ihemi may say vidi tantum i scarcely knew her she married very young as i was when she left borhambury but charles exhibited his character at a very early ageand it was not a charming oneno by no means a model of virtue he always had a genius for running into debt he borrowed from every one of the pupilsi dont know how he spent it except in hardbake and alycompaineand even from old noseys groompardon me we used to call your grandfather by that playful epithet boys will be boys you knoweven from the doctors groom he took money and i recollect thrashing charles honeyman for that disgraceful action  at college without any particular show he was always in debt and difficulties take warning by him dear youth by him and by me if you like see meme f bayham descended from the ancient kings that long the tuscan sceptre swayed dodge down a street to get out of sight of a bootshop and my colossal frame tremble if a chap puts his hand on my shoulder as you did pendennis the other day in the strand when i thought a straw might have knocked me down i have had my errors clive i know em ill take another pint of beer if you please betsy has mrs nokes any cold meat in the bar and an accustomed pickle ha give her my compliments and say f b is hungry i resume my tale faults f b has and knows it humbug he may have been sometimes but im not such a complete humbug as honeyman  clive did not know how to look at this character of his relative but clives companion burst into a fit of laughter at which f b nodded gravely and resumed his narrative i dont know how much money he has had from your governor but this i can say the half of it would make f b a happy man i dont know out of how much the reverend party has nobbled his poor old sister at brighton he has mortgaged his chapel to sherrick i suppose you know who is master of it and could turn him out any day i dont think sherrick is a bad fellow i think hes a good fellow i have known him do many a good turn to a chap in misfortune he wants to get into society what more natural that was why you were asked to meet him the other day and why he asked you to dinner i hope you had a good one i wish hed ask me  then moss has got his bills and mosss brotherinlaw in cursitor street has taken possession of his revered person hes very welcome one jew has the chapel another hebrew has the clergyman its singular aint it sherrick might turn lady whittlesea into a synagogue and have the chief rabbi into the pulpit where my uncle the bishop has given out the text  the shares of that concern aint at a premium i have had immense fun with sherrick about it i like the hebrew sir he maddens with rage when f b goes and asks him whether any more pews are let overhead honeyman begged and borrowed in order to buy out the last man i remember when the speculation was famous when all the boxes i mean the pews were taken for the season and you couldnt get a place come ever so early then honeyman was spoilt and gave his sermons over and over again people got sick of seeing the old humbug cry the old crocodile then we tried the musical dodge f b came forward sir there that was a coup i did it sir bellew wouldnt have sung for any man but meand for twoandtwenty months i kept him as sober as father mathew then honeyman didnt pay him there was a row in the sacred building and bellew retired then sherrick must meddle in it and having heard a chap out hampstead way who sherrick thought would do honeyman was forced to engage him regardless of expense you recollect the fellow sir the reverend simeon rawkins the lowest of the low church sira redhaired dumpy man who gasped at his hs and spoke with a lancashire twanghed no more do for mayfair than grimaldi for macbeth he and honeyman used to fight like cat and dog in the vestry and he drove away a third part of the congregation he was an honest man and an able man too though not a sound churchman f b said this with a very edifying gravity i told sherrick this the very day i heard him and if he had spoken to me on the subject i might have saved him a pretty pennya precious deal more than the paltry sum which he and i had a quarrel about at that timea matter of business sira pecuniary difference about a small three months thing which caused a temporary estrangement between us as for honeyman he used to cry about it your uncle is great in the lachrymatory line clive newcome he used to go with tears in his eyes to sherrick and implore him not to have rawkins but he would and i must say for poor charles that the failure of lady whittleseas has not been altogether charless fault and that sherrick has kicked down that property  well then sir poor charles thought to make it all right by marrying mrs brumbyand she was very fond of him and the thing was all but done in spite of her sons who were in a rage as you may fancy but charley sir has such a propensity for humbug that he will tell lies when there is no earthly good in lying he represented his chapel at twelve hundred a year his private means as soandso and when he came to book up with briggs the lawyer mrs brumbys brother it was found that he lied and prevaricated so that the widow in actual disgust would have nothing more to do with him she was a good woman of business and managed the hatshop for nine years whilst poor brumby was at dr tokelys a firstrate shop it was too i introduced charles to it my uncle the bishop had his shovels there and they used for a considerable period to cover this humble roof with tiles said f b tapping his capacious forehead i am sure he might have had brumby he added in his melancholy tones but for those unlucky lies she didnt want money she had plenty she longed to get into society and was bent on marrying a gentleman  but what i cant pardon in honeyman is the way in which he has done poor old ridley and his wife i took him there you know thinking they would send their bills in once a month that he was doing a good business in fact that i had put em into a good thing and the fellow has told me a score of times that he and the ridleys were all right but he has not only not paid his lodgings but he has had money of them he has given dinners he has made ridley pay for wine he has kept paying lodgers out of the house and he tells me all this with a burst of tears when he sent for me to lazaruss tonight and i went to him sir because he was in distresswent into the lions den sir says f b looking round nobly i dont know how much he owes them because of course you know the sum he mentions aint the right one he never does tell the truthdoes charles but think of the pluck of those good ridleys never saying a single word to f b about the debt we are poor but we have saved some money and can lie out of it and we think mr honeyman will pay us says mrs ridley to me this very evening and she thrilled my heartstrings sir and i took her in my arms and kissed the old woman says bayham and i rather astonished little miss cann and young j j who came in with a picture under his arm but she said she had kissed master frederick long before j j was bornand so she had that good and faithful servantand my emotion in embracing her was manly sir manly  here old betsy came in to say that the supper was awaitin for mr bayham and it was agetting very late and we left f b to his meal and bidding adieu to mrs nokes clive and i went each to our habitation     chapter xxvi in which colonel newcomes horses are sold   at an hour early the next morning i was not surprised to see colonel newcome at my chambers to whom clive had communicated bayhams important news of the night before the colonels object as any one who knew him need scarcely be told was to rescue his brotherinlaw and being ignorant of lawyers sheriffsofficers and their proceedings he bethought him that he would apply to lamb court for information and in so far showed some prudence for at least i knew more of the world and its ways than my simple client and was enabled to make better terms for the unfortunate prisoner or rather for colonel newcome who was the real sufferer than honeymans creditors might otherwise have been disposed to give  i thought it would be more prudent that our good samaritan should not see the victim of rogues whom he was about to succour and left him to entertain himself with mr warrington in lamb court while i sped to the lockup house where the mayfair pet was confined a sickly smile played over his countenance as he beheld me when i was ushered to his private room the reverent gentleman was not shaved he had partaken of breakfast i saw a glass which had once contained brandy on the dirty tray whereon his meal was placed a greasy novel from a chancery lane library lay on the table but he was at present occupied in writing one or more of those great long letters those laborious ornate eloquent statements those documents so profusely underlined in which the machinations of villains are laid bare with italic fervour the coldness to use no harsher phrase of friends on whom reliance might have been placed the outrageous conduct of solomons the astonishing failure of smith to pay a sum of money on which he had counted as on the bank of england finally the infallible certainty of repaying with what heartfelt thanks need not be said the loan of so many pounds next saturday week at farthest all this which some readers in the course of their experience have read no doubt in many handwritings was duly set forth by poor honeyman there was a wafer in a wineglass on the table and the bearer no doubt below to carry the missive they always sent these letters by a messenger who is introduced in the postscript he is always sitting in the hall when you get the letter and is a young man waiting for an answer please  no one can suppose that honeyman laid a complete statement of his affairs before the negotiator who was charged to look into them no debtor does confess all his debts but breaks them gradually to his man of business factor or benefactor leading him on from surprise to surprise and when he is in possession of the tailors little account introducing him to the bootmaker honeymans schedule i felt perfectly certain was not correct the detainees against him were trifling moss of wardour street one hundred and twentyi believe i have paid him thousands in this very transaction ejaculates honeyman a heartless west end tradesman hearing of my misfortuneall these people a linked together my dear pendennis and rush like vultures upon their preywaddilove the tailor has another writ out for ninetyeight pounds a man whom i have made by my recommendations tobbins the bootmaker his neighbour in jermyn street fortyone pounds more and that is alli give you my word all in a few months when my pewrents will be coming in i should have settled with those cormorants otherwise my total and irretrievable ruin and the disgrace and humiliation of a prison attends me i know it i can bear it i have been wretchedly weak pendennis i can say mea culpa mea maxima culpa and i canbearmypenalty in his finest moments he was never more pathetic he turned his head away and concealed it in a handkerchief not so white as those which veiled his emotions at lady whittleseas  how by degrees this slippery penitent was induced to make other confessions how we got an idea of mrs ridleys account from him of his dealings with mr sherrick need not be mentioned here the conclusion to which colonel newcomes ambassador came was that to help such a man would be quite useless and that the fleet prison would be a most wholesome retreat for this most reckless divine ere the day was out messrs waddilove and tobbins had conferred with their neighbour in st jamess mr brace and there came a detainer from that haberdasher for gloves cravats and pockethandkerchiefs that might have done credit to the most dandified young guardsman mr warrington was on mr pendenniss side and urged that the law should take its course why help a man said he who will not help himself let the law sponge out the fellows debts set him going again with twenty pounds when he quits the prison and get him a chaplaincy in the isle of man  i saw by the colonels grave kind face that these hard opinions did not suit him at all events sir promise us we said that you will pay nothing yourselfthat you wont see honeymans creditors and let people who know the world better deal with him know the world young man cries newcome i should think if i dont know the world at my age i never shall and if he had lived to be as old as jahaleel a boy could still have cheated him  i do not scruple to tell you he said after a pause during which a plenty of smoke was delivered from the council of three that i havea fundwhich i had set aside for mere purposes of pleasure i give you my word and a part of which i shall think it my duty to devote to poor honeymans distresses the fund is not large the money was intended in facthowever there it is if pendennis will go round to these tradesmen and make some composition with them as their prices have been no doubt enormously exaggerated i see no harm besides the tradesfolk there is good mrs ridley and mr sherrickwe must see them and if we can set this luckless charles again on his legs we have read of other prodigals who were kindly treated and we may have debts of our own to forgive boys  into mr sherricks account we had no need to enter that gentleman had acted with perfect fairness by honeyman he laughingly said to us you dont imagine i would lend that chap a shilling without security i will give him fifty or a hundred heres one of his notes with whatdoyoucallemsthat rum fellow bayhams name as drawer a nice pair aint they pooh i shall never touch em i lent some money on the shop overhead says sherrick pointing to the ceiling we were in his countinghouse in the cellar of lady whittleseas chapel because i thought it was a good speculation and so it was at first the people liked honeyman all the nobs came to hear him now the speculation aint so good hes used up a chap cant be expected to last for ever when i first engaged mademoiselle bravura at my theatre you couldnt get a place for three weeks together the next year she didnt draw twenty pounds a week so it was with pottle and the regular drama humbug at first it was all very well good business good houses our immortal bard and that sort of game they engaged the tigers and the french riding people over the way and there was pottle bellowing away in my place to the orchestra and the orders its all a speculation ive speculated in about pretty much everything thats going in theatres in jointstock jobs in buildingground in bills in gas and insurance companies and in this chapel poor old honeyman i wont hurt him about that other chap i put in to do the first businessthat redhaired chap rawkinsi think i was wrong i think he injured the property but i dont know everything you know i wasnt bred to know about parsonsquite the reverse i thought when i heard rawkins at hampstead he was just the thing i used to go about sir just as i did to the provinces when i had the theatrecamberwell islington kennington clapton all about and hear the young chaps have a glass of sherry and heres better luck to honeyman as for that colonel hes a trump sir i never see such a man i have to deal with such a precious lot of rogues in the city and out of it among the swells and all you know that to see such a fellow refreshes me and id do anything for him youve made a good thing of that pall mall gazette i tried papers too but mine didnt do i dont know why i tried a tory one moderate liberal and outandout uncompromising radical i say what dye think of a religious paper the catechism or some such name would honeyman do as editor im afraid its all up with the poor cove at the chapel and i parted with mr sherrick not a little edified by his talk and greatly relieved as to honeymans fate the tradesmen of honeymans body were appeased and as for mr moss when he found that the curate had no effects and must go before the insolvent court unless moss chose to take the composition which we were empowered to offer him he too was brought to hear reason and parted with the stamped paper on which was poor honeymans signature our negotiation had like to have come to an end by clives untimely indignation who offered at one stage of the proceedings to pitch young moss out of window but nothing came of this most ungentlemanlike behaviour on noocobs part further than remonstrance and delay in the proceedings and honeyman preached a lovely sermon at lady whittleseas the very next sunday he had made himself much liked in the sponginghouse and mr lazarus said if he hadnt a got out time enough id a let him out for sunday and sent one of my men with him to show him the way ome you know for when a gentleman behaves as a gentleman to me i behave as a gentleman to him  mrs ridleys account and it was a long one was paid without a single question or the deduction of a farthing but the colonel rather sickened of honeymans expressions of rapturous gratitude and received his professions of mingled contrition and delight very coolly my boy says the father to clive you see to what straits debt brings a man to tamper with truth to have to cheat the poor think of flying before a washerwoman or humbling yourself to a tailor or eating a poor mans childrens bread clive blushed i thought and looked rather confused  oh father says he iim afraid i owe some money toonot much but about forty pound fiveandtwenty for cigars and fifteen i borrowed of pendennis andand ive been devilish annoyed about it all this time  you stupid boy says the father i knew about the cigars bill and paid it last week anything i have is yours you know as long as there is a guinea there is half for you see that every shilling we owe is paid beforebefore a week is over and go down and ask binnie if i can see him in his study i want to have some conversation with him when clive was gone away he said to me in a very sweet voice in gods name keep my boy out of debt when i am gone arthur i shall return to india very soon  very soon sir you have another years leave said i  yes but no allowances you know and this affair of honeymans has pretty nearly emptied the little purse i had set aside for european expenses they have been very much heavier than i expected as it is i overdrew my account at my brothers and have been obliged to draw money from my agents in calcutta a year sooner or later unless two of our senior officers had died when i should have got my promotion and full colonels pay with it and proposed to remain in this countrya year sooner or later what does it matter clive will go away and work at his art and see the great schools of painting while i am absent i thought at one time how pleasant it would be to accompany him but lhomme propose pendennis i fancy now a lad is not the better for being always tied to his parents apronstring you young fellows are too clever for me i havent learned your ideas or read your books i feel myself very often an old damper in your company i will go back sir where i have some friends where i am somebody still i know an honest face or two white and brown that will lighten up in the old regiment when they see tom newcome again god bless you arthur you young fellows in this country have such cold ways that we old ones hardly know how to like you at first james binnie and i when we first came home used to talk you over and think you laughed at us but you didnt i know god almighty bless you and send you a good wife and make a good man of you i have bought a watch which i would like you to wear in remembrance of me and my boy to whom you were so kind when you were boys together in the old grey friars i took his hand and uttered some incoherent words of affection and respect did not thomas newcome merit both from all who knew him  his resolution being taken our good colonel began to make silent but effectual preparations for his coming departure he was pleased during these last days of his stay to give me even more of his confidence than i had previously enjoyed and was kind enough to say that he regarded me almost as a son of his own and hoped i would act as elder brother and guardian to clive ah who is to guard the guardian the younger brother had many nobler qualities than belonged to the elder the world had not hardened clive nor even succeeded in spoiling him i perceive i am diverging from his history into that of another person and will return to the subject proper of the book  colonel newcome expressed himself as being particularly touched and pleased with his friend binnies conduct now that the colonels departure was determined james is one of the most generous of men pendennis and i am proud to be put under an obligation to him and to tell it too i hired this house as you are aware of our speculative friend mr sherrick and am answerable for the payment of the rent till the expiry of the lease james has taken the matter off my hands entirely the place is greatly too large for him but he says that he likes it and intends to stay and that his sister and niece shall be his housekeepers clive here perhaps the speakers voice drops a littleclive will be the son of the house still honest james says and god bless him james is richer than i thought by near a lakh of rupeesand here is a hint for you master arthur mr binnie has declared to me in confidence that if his niece miss rosey shall marry a person of whom he approves he will leave her a considerable part of his fortune  the colonels confidant here said that his own arrangements were made in another quarter to which statement the colonel replied knowingly i thought so a little bird has whispered to me the name of a certain miss a i knew her grandfather an accommodating old gentleman and i borrowed some money from him when i was a subaltern at calcutta i tell you in strict confidence my dear young friend that i hope and trust a certain young gentleman of your acquaintance may be induced to think how good and pretty and sweettempered a girl miss mackenzie is and that she may be brought to like him if you young men would marry in good time good and virtuous womenas i am sureahemmiss amory ishalf the temptations of your youth would be avoided you would neither be dissolute has many of you seem to me or cold and selfish which are worse vices still and my prayer is that my clive may cast anchor early out of the reach of temptation and mate with some such kind girl as binnies niece when i first came home i formed other plans for him which could not be brought to a successful issue and knowing his ardent disposition and having kept an eye on the young rogues conduct i tremble lest some mischance with a woman should befall him and long to have him out of danger  so the kind scheme of the two elders was that their young ones should marry and be happy ever after like the prince and princess of the fairy tale and dear mrs mackenzie have i said that at the commencement of her visit to her brother she made almost open love to the colonel dear mrs mack was content to forgo her own chances so that her darling rosey might be happy we used to laugh and say that as soon as clives father was gone josey would be sent for to join rosey but little josey being under her grandmothers sole influence took most gratifying and serious turn wrote letters in which she questioned the morality of operas towers of london and waxworks and before a year was out married elder bogie of mr mcraws church  presently was to be read in the morning post an advertisement of the sale of three horses the description and pedigree following the property of an officer returning to india apply to the groom at the stables 150 fitzroy square  the court of directors invited lieutenantcolonel newcome to an entertainment given to majorgeneral sir ralph spurrier kcb appointed commanderinchief at madras clive was asked to this dinner too and the governors health was drunk sir clive said after dinner and the dear old fellow made such a good speech in returning thanks  he clive and i made a pilgrimage to grey friars and had the green to ourselves it being the bartlemytide vacation and the boys all away one of the good old poor brothers whom we both recollected accompanied us round the place and we sate for a while in captain scarsdales little room he had been a peninsular officer who had sold out and was fain in his old age to retire into this calm retreat and we talked as old schoolmates and lovers talk about subjects interesting to schoolmates and lovers only  one by one the colonel took leave of his friends young and old ran down to newcome and gave mrs mason a parting benediction slept a night at tom smiths and passed a day with jack brown went to all the boys and girls schools where his little proteges were so as to be able to take the very last and most authentic account of the young folks to their parents in india spent a week at marble hill and shot partridges there but for which entertainment clive said the place would have been intolerable and thence proceeded to brighton to pass a little time with good miss honeyman as for sir brians family when parliament broke up of course they did not stay in town barnes of course had part of a moor in scotland whither his uncle and cousin did not follow him the rest went abroad sir brian wanted the waters of aixlachapelle the brothers parted very good friends lady anne and all the young people heartily wished him farewell i believe sir brian even accompanied the colonel downstairs from the drawingroom in park lane and actually came out and saw his brother into his cab just as he would accompany old lady bagges when she came to look at her account at the bank from the parlour to her carriage but as for ethel she was not going to be put off with this sort of parting and the next morning a cab dashed up to fitzroy square and a veiled lady came out thence and was closeted with colonel newcome for five minutes and when he led her back to the carriage there were tears in his eyes  mrs mackenzie joked about the transaction having watched it from the diningroom windows and asked the colonel who his sweetheart was newcome replied very sternly that he hoped no one would ever speak lightly of that young lady whom he loved as his own daughter and i thought rosey looked vexed at the praises thus bestowed this was the day before we all went down to brighton miss honeymans lodgings were taken for mr binnie and his ladies clive and her dearest colonel had apartments next door charles honeyman came dawn and preached one of his very best sermons fred bayham was there and looked particularly grand and noble on the pier and the cliff i am inclined to think he had had some explanation with thomas newcome which had placed f b in a state of at least temporary prosperity whom did he not benefit whom he knew and what eye that saw him did not bless him f b was greatly affected at charless sermon of which our party of course could see the allusions tears actually rolled down his brown cheeks for fred was a man very easily moved and as it were a softened sinner little rosey and her mother sobbed audibly greatly to the surprise of stout old miss honeyman who had no idea of such watery exhibitions and to the discomfiture of poor newcome who was annoyed to have his praises even hinted in that sacred edifice good mr james binnie came for once to church and however variously their feelings might be exhibited or repressed i think there was not one of the little circle there assembled who did not bring to the place a humble prayer and a gentle heart it was the last sabbathbell our dear friend was to hear for many a day on his native shore the great sea washed the beach as we came out blue with the reflection of the skies and its innumerable waves crested with sunshine i see the good man and his boy yet clinging to him as they pace together by the shore  the colonel was very much pleased by a visit from mr ridley and the communication which he made my lord todmorden has a mansion and park in sussex whence mr ridley came to pay his duty to colonel newcome he said he never could forget the kindness with which the colonel have a treated him his lordship have taken a young man which mr ridley had brought him up under his own eye and can answer for him mr r says with impunity and which he is to be his lordships own man for the future and his lordship have appointed me his steward and having as he always hev been been most liberal in point of sellary and me and mrs ridley was thinking sir most respectfully with regard to our son mr john james ridleyas good and honest a young man which i am proud to say it that if mr clive goes abroad we should be most proud and happy if john james went with him and the money which you have paid us so handsome colonel he shall have it which it was the excellent ideer of miss cann and my lord have ordered a pictur of john james in the most libral manner and have asked my son to dinner sir at his lordships own table which i have faithfully served him fiveandthirty years ridleys voice fairly broke down at this part of his speech which evidently was a studied composition and he uttered no more of it for the colonel cordially shook him by the hand and clive jumped up clapping his and saying that it was the greatest wish of his heart that j j and he should be companions in france and italy but i did not like to ask my dear old father he said who has had so many calls on his purse and besides i knew that j j was too independent to come as my follower  the colonels berth has been duly secured ere now this time he makes the overland journey and his passage is to alexandria taken in one of the noble ships of the peninsular and oriental company his kit is as simple as a subalterns i believe but for clives friendly compulsion he would have carried back no other than the old uniform which has served him for so many years clive and his father travelled to southampton together by themselves f b and i took the southampton coach we had asked leave to see the last of him and say a god bless you to our dear old friend so the day came when the vessel was to sail we saw his cabin and witnessed all the bustle and stir on board the good ship on a day of departure our thoughts however were fixed but on one personthe case no doubt with hundreds more on such a day there was many a group of friends closing wistfully together on the sunny deck and saying the last words of blessing and farewell the bustle of the ship passes dimly round about them the hurrying noise of crew and officers running on their duty the tramp and song of the men at the capstanbars the bells ringing as the hour for departure comes nearer and nearer as mother and son father and daughter husband and wife hold hands yet for a little while we saw clive and his father talking together by the wheel then they went below and a passenger her husband asked me to give my arm to an almost fainting lady and to lead her off the ship bayham followed us carrying their two children in his arms as the husband turned away and walked aft the last bell was ringing and they were crying now for the shore the whole ship had begun to throb ere this and its great wheels to beat the water and the chimneys had flung out their black signals for sailing we were as yet close on the dock and we saw clive coming up from below looking very pale the plank was drawn after him as he stepped on land  then with three great cheers from the dock and from the crew in the bows and from the passengers on the quarterdeck the noble ship strikes the first stroke of her destined race and swims away towards the ocean there he is there he is shouts fred bayham waving his hat god bless him god bless him i scarce perceived at the ships side beckoning an adieu our dear old friend when the lady whose husband had bidden me to lead her away from the ship fainted in my arms poor soul her too has fate stricken ah pangs of hearts torn asunder passionate regrets cruel cruel partings shall you not end one day ere many years when the tears shall be wiped from all eyes and there shall be neither sorrow nor pain     chapter xxvii youth and sunshine   although thomas newcome was gone back to india in search of more money finding that he could not live upon his income at home he was nevertheless rather a wealthy man and at the moment of his departure from europe had two lakhs of rupees invested in various indian securities a thousand a year he thought more added to the interest accruing from my two lakhs will enable us to live very comfortably at home i can give clive ten thousand pounds when he marries and five hundred a year out of my allowances if he gets a wife with some money they may have every enjoyment of life and as for his pictures he can paint just as few or as many of those as he pleases newcome did not seem seriously to believe that his son would live by painting pictures but considered clive as a young prince who chose to amuse himself with painting the muse of painting is a lady whose social station is not altogether recognised with us as yet the polite world permits a gentleman to amuse himself with her but to take her for better or for worse forsake all other chances and cleave unto her to assume her name many a respectable person would be as much shocked at the notion as if his son had married an operadancer  newcome left a hundred a year in england of which the principal sum was to be transferred to his boy as soon as he came of age he endowed clive further with a considerable annual sum which his london bankers would pay and if these are not enough says he kindly you must draw upon my agents messrs frank and merryweather at calcutta who will receive your signature just as if it was mine before going away he introduced clive to f and ms corresponding london house jolly and baines fog courtleading out of leadenhallmr jolly a myth as regarded the firm now married to lady

whim of colonel newcomes who can give his son twelve or fifteen hundred a year and makes an artist of him euphemia and flora adore artists they feel quite interested about this young man he was scribbling caricatures all the time i was talking with his father in my parlour says mr baines and produces a sketch of an orangewoman near the bank who had struck clives eyes and been transferred to the blottingpaper in fog court he neednt do anything said goodnatured mr baines i guess all the pictures hell paint wont sell for much  is he fond of music papa asks miss what a pity he had not come

fitzroy square queer place aint it put his name down in your book and ask him to dinner next season  before clive went away he had an apparatus of easels sketchingstools umbrellas and paintingboxes the most elaborate and beautiful that messrs soap and isaac could supply it made j js eyes glisten to see those lovely gimcracks of art those smooth millboards those slabtinted sketchingblocks and glistening rows of colourtubes lying in their boxes which seemed to cry come squeeze me if paintingboxes made painters if sketchingstools would but enable one to sketch surely i would hasten this very instant to messrs soap and isaac but alas these pretty toys no more make artists than cowls make monks  as a proof that clive did intend to practise his profession and to live by it too at this time he took four sporting sketches to a printseller in the haymarket and disposed of them at the rate of seven shillings and sixpence per sketch his exultation at receiving a sovereign and half a sovereign from mr jones was boundless i can do half a dozen of these things easily in a morning he says two guineas a day is twelve guineassay ten guineas a week for i wont work on sundays and may take a holiday in the week besides ten guineas a week is five hundred a year that is pretty nearly as much money as i shall want and i need not draw the dear old governors allowance at all he wrote an ardent letter full of happiness and affection to the kind father which he shall find a month after he has arrived in india and read to his friends in calcutta and barrackpore clive invited many of his artist friends to a grand feast in honour of the thirty shillings the kings arms kensington was the hotel selected tavern beloved of artists for many score years gandish was there and the gandishites and some chosen spirits from the life academy clipstone street and j j was vicepresident with fred bayham by his side to make the speeches and carve the mutton and i promise you many a merry song was sung and many a health drunk in flowing bumpers and as jolly a party was assembled as any london contained that day the beaumonde had quitted it the park was empty as we crossed it and the leaves of kensington gardens had begun to fall dying after the fatigues of a london season we sang all the way home through knightsbridge and by the park railings and the covent garden carters halting at the halfway house were astonished at our choruses there is no halfway house now no merry chorus at midnight  then clive and j j took the steamboat to antwerp and those who love pictures may imagine how the two young men rejoiced in one of the most picturesque cities of the world where they went back straightway into the sixteenth century where the inn at which they stayed delightful old grand laboureur thine ancient walls are levelled thy comfortable hospitalities exist no more seemed such a hostelry as that where quentin durward first saw his sweetheart where knights of velasquez or burgomasters of rubens seemed to look from the windows of the tallgabled houses and the quaint porches where the bourse still stood the bourse of three hundred years ago and you had but to supply figures with beards and ruffs and rapiers and trunkhose to make the picture complete where to be awakened by the carillon of the bells was to waken to the most delightful sense of life and happiness where nuns actual nuns walked the streets and every figure in the place de meir and every devotee at church kneeling and draped in black or entering the confessional actually the confessional was a delightful subject for the new sketchbook had clive drawn as much everywhere as at antwerp messrs soap and isaac might have made a little income by supplying him with materials  after antwerp clives correspondent gets a letter dated from the hotel de suede at brussels which contains an elaborate eulogy of the cookery and comfort of that hotel where the wines according to the writers opinion are unmatched almost in europe and this is followed by a description of waterloo and a sketch of hougoumont in which j j is represented running away in the character of a french grenadier clive pursuing him in the lifeguards habit and mounted on a thundering charger  next follows a letter from bonn verses about drachenfels of a not very superior style of versification an account of crichton an old grey friars man who has become a student at the university of a commerz a drunken bout and a students duel at bonn and whom should i find here says mr clive but aunt anne ethel miss quigley and the little ones the whole detachment under the command of kuhn uncle brian is staying at aix he is recovered from his attack and upon my conscience i think my pretty cousin looks prettier every day  when they are not in london clive goes on to write or i sometimes think when barnes or old lady kew are not looking over them they are quite different you know how cold they have latterly seemed to us and how their conduct annoyed my dear old father nothing can be kinder than their behaviour since we have met it was on the little hill at godesberg j j and i were mounting to the ruin followed by the beggars who waylay you and have taken the place of the other robbers who used to live there when there came a procession of donkeys down the steep and i heard a little voice cry hullo its clive hooray clive and an ass came pattering down the declivity with a little pair of white trousers at an immensely wide angle over the donkeys back and behold there was little alfred grinning with all his might  he turned his beast and was for galloping up the hill again i suppose to inform his relations but the donkey refused with many kicks one of which sent alfred plunging amongst the stones and we were rubbing him down just as the rest of the party came upon us miss quigley looked very grim on an old white pony my aunt was on a black horse that might have turned grey he is so old then come two donkeysful of children with kuhn as supercargo then ethel on donkeyback too with a bunch of wildflowers in her hand a great straw hat with a crimson ribbon a white muslin jacket you know bound at the waist with a ribbon of the first and a dark skirt with a shawl round her feet which kuhn had arranged as she stopped the donkey fell to cropping greens in the hedge the trees there chequered her white dress and face with shadow her eyes hair and forehead were in shadow toobut the light was all upon her right cheek upon her shoulder down to her arm which was of a warmer white and on the bunch of flowers which she held blue yellow and red poppies and so forth  j j says i think the birds began to sing louder when she came we have both agreed that she is the handsomest woman in england its not her form merely which is certainly as yet too thin and a little angularit is her colour i do not care for woman or picture without colour o ye carnations o ye lilia mista rosis o such black hair and solemn eyebrows it seems to me the roses and carnations have bloomed again since we saw them last in london when they were drooping from the exposure to night air candlelight and heated ballrooms  here i was in the midst of a regiment of donkeys bearing a crowd of relations j j standing modestly in the backgroundbeggars completing the group and kuhn ruling over them with voice and gesture oaths and whip throw in the rhine in the distance flashing by the seven mountainsbut mind and make ethel the principal figure if you make her like she certainly will beand other lights will be only minor fires you may paint her form but you cant paint her colour that is what beats us in nature a line must come right you can force that into its place but you cant compel the circumambient air there is no yellow i know of will make sunshine and no blue that is a bit like sky and so with pictures i think you only get signs of colour and formulas to stand for it that brickdust which we agree to receive as representing a blush look at itcan you say it is in the least like the blush which flickers and varies as it sweeps over the down of the cheekas you see sunshine playing over a meadow look into it and see what a variety of delicate blooms there are a multitude of flowerets twining into one tint we may break our colourpots and strive after the line alone that is palpable and we can grasp itthe other is impossible and beyond us which sentiment i here set down not on account of its worth and i think it is contradictedas well as assertedin more than one of the letters i subsequently had from mr clive but it may serve to show the ardent and impulsive disposition of this youth by whom all beauties of art and nature animate or inanimate the former especially were welcomed with a gusto and delight whereof colder temperaments are incapable the view of a fine landscape a fine picture a handsome woman would make this harmless young sensualist tipsy with pleasure he seemed to derive an actual hilarity and intoxication as his eye drank in these sights and though it was his maxim that all dinners were good and he could eat bread and cheese and drink small beer with perfect goodhumour i believe that he found a certain pleasure in a bottle of claret which most mens systems were incapable of feeling  this springtime of youth is the season of letterwriting a lad in high health and spirits the blood running briskly in his young veins and the world and life and nature bright and welcome to him looks out perforce for some companion to whom he may impart his sense of the pleasure which he enjoys and which were not complete unless a friend were by to share it i was the person most convenient for the young fellows purpose he was pleased to confer upon me the title of friend en titre and confidant in particular to endow the confidant in question with a number of virtues and excellences which existed very likely only in the lads imagination to lament that the confidant had no sister whom he clive might marry out of hand and to make me a thousand simple protests of affection and admiration which are noted here as signs of the young mans character by no means as proofs of the goodness of mine the books given to the present biographer by his affectionate friend clive newcome still bear on the titlepages the marks of that boyish hand and youthful fervour he had a copy of walter lorraine bound and gilt with such splendour as made the author blush for his performance which has since been seen at the bookstalls at a price suited to the very humblest purses he fired up and fought a newspaper critic whom clive met at the haunt one night who had dared to write an article in which that work was slighted and if in the course of nature his friendship has outlived that rapturous period the kindness of the two old friends i hope is not the less because it is no longer romantic and the days of white vellum and gilt edges have passed away from the abundance of the letters which the affectionate young fellow now wrote the ensuing portion of his youthful history is compiled it may serve to recall passages of their early days to such of his seniors as occasionally turn over the leaves of a novel and in the story of his faults indiscretions passions and actions young readers may be reminded of their own  now that the old countess and perhaps barnes were away the barrier between clive and this family seemed to be withdrawn the young folks who loved him were free to see him as often as he would come they were going to baden would he come too baden was on the road to switzerland he might journey to strasbourg basle and so on clive was glad enough to go with his cousins and travel in the orbit of such a lovely girl as ethel newcome j j performed the second part always when clive was present and so they all travelled to coblentz mayence and frankfort together making the journey which everybody knows and sketching the mountains and castles we all of us have sketched ethels beauty made all the passengers on all the steamers look round and admire clive was proud of being in the suite of such a lovely person the family travelled with a pair of those carriages which used to thunder along the continental roads a dozen years since and from interior box and rumble discharge a dozen english people at hotel gates  the journey is all sunshine and pleasure and novelty the circular notes with which mr baines of fog court has supplied clive newcome esquire enabled that young gentleman to travel with great ease and comfort he has not yet ventured upon engaging a valetdechambre it being agreed between him and j j that two travelling artists have no right to such an aristocratic appendage but he has bought a snug little britzska at frankfort the youth has very polite tastes is already a connoisseur in wine and has no scruple in ordering the best at the hotels and the britzska travels in company with lady annes caravan either in its wake so as to be out of reach of the dust or more frequently ahead of that enormous vehicle and its tender in which come the children and the governess of lady anne newcome guarded by a huge and melancholy london footman who beholds rhine and neckar valley and mountain village and ruin with a like dismal composure little alfred and little egbert are by no means sorry to escape from miss quigley and the tender and for a stage ride or two in clives britzska the little girls cry sometimes to be admitted to that privilege i dare say ethel would like very well to quit her place in the caravan where she sits circumvented by mammas dogs and books bags dressingboxes and gimcrack cases without which apparatus some english ladies of condition cannot travel but miss ethel is grown up she is out and has been presented at court and is a person of too great dignity now to sit anywhere but in the place of state in the chariot corner i like to think for my part of the gallant young fellow taking his pleasure and enjoying his holiday and few sights are more pleasant than to watch a happy manly english youth freehanded and generoushearted content and goodhumour shining in his honest face pleased and pleasing eager active and thankful for services and exercising bravely his noble youthful privilege to be happy and to enjoy sing cheery spirit whilst the spring lasts bloom whilst the sun shines kindly flowers of youth you shall be none the worse tomorrow for having been happy today if the day brings no action to shame it as for j j he too had his share of enjoyment the charming scenes around him did not escape his bright eye he absorbed pleasure in his silent way he was up with the sunrise always and at work with his eyes and his heart if not with his hands a beautiful object too is such a one to contemplate a pure virgin soul a creature gentle pious and full of love endowed with sweet gifts humble and timid but for truths and justices sake inflexible thankful to god and man fond patient and faithful clive was still his hero as ever his patron his splendid young prince and chieftain who was so brave who was so handsome generous witty as clive to hear clive sing as the lad would whilst they were seated at their work or driving along on this happy journey through fair landscapes in the sunshine gave j j the keenest pleasure his wit was a little slow but he would laugh with his eyes at clives sallies or ponder over them and explode with laughter presently giving a new source of amusement to these merry travellers and little alfred would laugh at j js laughing and so with a hundred harmless jokes to enliven and the everchanging evercharming smiles of nature to cheer and accompany it the happy days journey would come to an end  so they travelled by the accustomed route to the prettiest town of all places where pleasure has set up her tents and where the gay the melancholy the idle or occupied grave or haughty come for amusement or business or relaxation where london beauties having danced and flirted all the season may dance and flirt a little more where welldressed rogues from all quarters of the world assemble where i have seen severe london lawyers forgetting their wigs and the temple trying their luck against fortune and m benazet where wistful schemers conspire and prick cards down and deeply meditate the infallible coup and try it and lose it and borrow a hundred francs to go home where even virtuous british ladies venture their little stakes and draw up their winnings with trembling rakes by the side of ladies who are not virtuous at all no not even by name where young prodigals break the bank sometimes and carry plunder out of a place which hercules himself could scarcely compel where you meet wonderful countesses and princesses whose husbands are almost always absent on their vast estatesin italy spain piedmontwho knows where their lordships possessions arewhile trains of suitors surround those wandering penelopes their noble wives russian boyars spanish grandees of the order of the fleece counts of france and princes polish and italian innumerable who perfume the gilded halls with their tobaccosmoke and swear in all languages against the black and the red the famous english monosyllable by which things persons luck even eyes are devoted to the infernal gods we may be sure is not wanting in that babel where does one not hear it d the luck says lord kew as the croupier sweeps off his lordships rouleaux d the luck says brown the bagman who has been backing his lordship with fivefranc pieces ah body of bacchus says count felice whom we all remember a courier ah sacre coup cries m le vicomte de florac as his last louis parts company from himeach cursing in his native tongue oh sweet chorus  that lord kew should be at baden is no wonder if you heard of him at the finish or at buckingham palace ball or in a watchhouse or at the third cataract or at a newmarket meeting you would not be surprised he goes everywhere does everything with all his might knows everybody last week he won who knows how many thousand louis from the bank it appears brown has chosen one of the unlucky days to back his lordship he will eat his supper as gaily after a great victory as after a signal defeat and we know that to win with magnanimity requires much more constancy than to lose his sleep will not be disturbed by one event or the other he will play skittles all the morning with perfect contentment romp with children in the forenoon he is the friend of half the children in the place or he will cheerfully leave the green table and all the risk and excitement there to take a hand at sixpenny whist with general fogey or to give the six miss fogeys a turn each in the ballroom from hrh the prince royal of  who is the greatest guest at baden down to brown the bagman who does not consider himself the smallest lord kew is hail fellow with everybody and has a kind word from and for all     chapter xxviii in which clive begins to see the world   in the company assembled at baden clive found one or two old acquaintances among them his friend of paris m de florac not in quite so brilliant a condition as when newcome had last met him on the boulevard florac owned that fortune had been very unkind to him at baden and indeed she had not only emptied his purse but his portmanteaus jewelbox and linenclosetthe contents of all of which had ranged themselves on the red and black against monsieur benazets crownpieces whatever side they took was however the unlucky one this campaign has been my moscow mon cher florac owned to clive i am conquered by benazet i have lost in almost every combat i have lost my treasure my baggage my ammunition of war everything but my honour which au reste mons benazet will not accept as a stake if he would there are plenty here believe me who would set it on the trenteetquarante sometimes i have had a mind to go home my mother who is an angel all forgiveness would receive her prodigal and kill the fatted veal for me but what will you he annoys methe domestic veal besides my brother the abbe though the best of christians is a jew upon certain matters a benazet who will not troquer absolution except against repentance and i have not for a sou of repentance in my pocket i have been sorry yesbut it was because odd came up in place of even or the reverse the accursed apres has chased me like a remorse and when black has come up i have wished myself converted to red otherwise i have no repentancei am joueurnature has made me so as she made my brother devot the archbishop of strasbourg is of our parents i saw his grandeur when i went lately to strasbourg on my last pilgrimage to the mont de piete i owned to him that i would pawn his cross and ring to go play the good prelate laughed and said his chaplain should keep an eye on them will you dine with me the landlord of my hotel was the intendant of our cousin the duc divry and will give me credit to the day of judgment i do not abuse his noble confidence my dear there are covers of silver put upon my table every day with which i could retrieve my fortune did i listen to the suggestions of satanas but i say to him vade retro come and dine with medulucs kitchen is very good  these easy confessions were uttered by a gentleman who was nearly forty years of age and who had indeed played the part of a young man in paris and the great european world so long that he knew or chose to perform no other he did not want for abilities had the best temper in the world was well bred and gentlemanlike always and was gay even after moscow his courage was known and his character for bravery and another kind of gallantry probably exaggerated by his bad reputation had his mother not been alive perhaps he would have believed in the virtue of no woman but this one he worshipped and spoke with tenderness and enthusiasm of her constant love and patience and goodness see her miniature he said i never separate myself from itoh never it saved my life in an affair aboutabout a woman who was not worth the powder which poor jules and i burned for her his ball struck me here upon the waistcoat bruising my rib and sending me to my bed which i never should have left alive but for this picture oh she is an angel my mother i am sure that heaven has nothing to deny that saint and that her tears wash out my sins  olive smiled i think madame de florac must weep a good deal he said  enormement my friend my faith i do not deny it i give her cause night and evening i am possessed by demons this little affenthaler wine of this country has a little smack which is most agreeable the passions tear me my young friend play is fatal but play is not so fatal as woman pass me the ecrevisses they are most succulent take warning by me and avoid both i saw you roder round the green tables and marked your eyes as they glistened over the heaps of gold and looked at some of our beauties of baden beware of such sirens young man and take me for your mentor avoiding what i have donethat understands itself you have not played as yet do not do so above all avoid a martingale if you do play ought not to be an affair of calculation but of inspiration i have calculated infallibly and what has been the effect gousset empty tiroirs empty necessaire parted for strasbourg where is my fur pelisse frederic  parbleu vous le savez bien monsieur le vicomte says frederic the domestic who was waiting on clive and his friend  a pelisse lined with true sable and worth three thousand francs that i won of a little russian at billiards that pelisse at strasbourg where the infamous worms of the mount of piety are actually gnawing her two hundred francs and this reconnaissance which frederic receive are all that now represent the pelisse how many chemises have i frederic  eh parbleu monsieur le vicomte sait bien que nous avons toujours vingtquatre chemises says frederic grumbling  monsieur le vicomte springs up shrieking from the dinnertable twentyfour shirts says he and i have been a week without a louis in my pocket belitre nigaud he flings open one drawer after another but there are no signs of thatsuperfluity of linen of which the domestic spoke whose countenance now changes from a grim frown to a grim smile  ah my faithful frederic i pardon thee mr newcome will understand my harmless supercherie frederic was in my company of the guard and remains with me since he is caleb balderstone and i am ravenswood yes i am edgard let us have coffee and a cigar balderstone  plaitil monsieur le vicomte says the french caleb  thou comprehendest not english thou readest not valtare scott thou cries the master i was recounting to monsieur newcome thy history and my misfortunes go seek coffee for us nigaud and as the two gentlemen partake of that exhilarating liquor the elder confides gaily to his guest the reason why he prefers taking coffee at the hotel to the coffee at the great cafe of the redoute with a duris urgens in rebus egestass pronounced in the true french manner  clive was greatly amused by the gaiety of the viscount after his misfortunes and his moscow and thought that one of mr bainess circular notes might not be ill laid out in succouring this hero it may have been to this end that floracs confessions tended though to do him justice the incorrigible young fellow would confide his adventures to any one who would listen and the exact state of his wardrobe and the story of his pawned pelisse dressingcase rings and watches were known to all baden  you tell me to marry and range myself said clive to whom the viscount was expatiating upon the charms of the superbe young anglaise with whom he had seen clive walking on the promenade why do you not marry and range yourself too  eh my dear i am married already you do not know it i am married since the revolution of july yes we were poor in those days as poor we remain my cousins the duc divrys sons and his grandson were still alive seeing no other resource and pursued by the arabs i espoused the vicomtesse de florac i gave her my name you comprehend in exchange for her own odious one she was miss higg do you know the family higg of manchesterre in the comte of lancastre she was then a person of a ripe age the vicomtesse is nowah it is fifteen years since and she dies not our union was not happy my friendmadame paul de florac is of the reformed religionnot of the anglican church you understandbut a dissident i know not of what sort we inhabited the hotel de florac for a while after our union which was all of convenience you understand she filled her salon with ministers to make you die she assaulted my poor father in his gardenchair whence he could not escape her she told my sainted mother that she was an idolatressshe who only idolatrises her children she called us other poor catholics who follow the rites of our fathers des romishes and rome babylon and the holy fathera scarleteh a scarlet abomination she outraged my mother that angel essayed to convert the antechamber and the office put little books in the abbes bedroom eh my friend what a good king was charles ix and his mother what a wise sovereign i lament that madame de florac should have escaped the st barthelemi when no doubt she was spared on account of her tender age we have been separated for many years her income was greatly exaggerated beyond the payment of my debts i owe her nothing i wish i could say as much of all the rest of the world shall we take a turn of promenade mauvais sujet i see you are longing to be at the green table  clive was not longing to be at the green table but his companion was never easy at it or away from it next to winning losing m de florac said was the best sportnext to losing looking on so he and clive went down to the redoute where lord kew was playing with a crowd of awestruck amateurs and breathless punters admiring his valour and fortune and clive saying that he knew nothing about the game took out five napoleons from his purse and besought florac to invest them in the most profitable manner at roulette the other made some faint attempts at a scruple but the money was speedily laid on the table where it increased and multiplied amazingly too so that in a quarter of an hour florac brought quite a handful of gold pieces to his principal then clive i dare say blushing as he made the proposal offered half the handful of napoleons to m de florac to be repaid when he thought fit and fortune must have been very favourable to the husband of miss higg that night for in the course of an hour he insisted on paying back clives loan and two days afterwards appeared with his shirtstuds of course with his shirts also released from captivity his watch rings and chains on the parade and was observed to wear his celebrated fur pelisse as he drove back in a britzska from strasbourg as for myself wrote clive i put back into my purse the five napoleons with which i had begun and laid down the whole mass of winnings on the table where it was doubled and then quadrupled and then swept up by the croupiers greatly to my ease of mind and then lord kew asked me to supper and we had a merry night  this was mr clives first and last appearance as a gambler j j looked very grave when he heard of these transactions clives french friend did not please his english companion at all nor the friends of clives french friend the russians the spaniards the italians of sounding titles and glittering decorations and the ladies who belonged to their society he saw by chance ethel escorted by her cousin lord kew passing through a crowd of this company one day there was not one woman there who was not the heroine of some discreditable story it was the comtesse calypso who had been jilted by the duc ulysse it was the marquise ariane to whom the prince thesee had behaved so shamefully and who had taken to bacchus as a consolation it was madame medee who had absolutely killed her old father by her conduct regarding jason she had done everything for jason she had got him the toison dor from the queen mother and now had to meet him every day with his little blonde bride on his arm j j compared ethel moving in the midst of these folks to the lady amidst the rout of comus there they were the fauns and satyrs there they were the merry pagans drinking and dancing dicing and sporting laughing out jests that never should be spoken whispering rendezvous to be written in midnight calendars jeering at honest people who passed under their palace windowsjolly rebels and repealers of the law ah if mrs brown whose children are gone to bed at the hotel knew but the history of that calm dignifiedlooking gentleman who sits under her and over whose patient back she frantically advances and withdraws her twofranc piece whilst his own columns of louis dor are offering battle to fortunehow she would shrink away from the shoulder which she pushes that man so calm and well bred with a string of orders on his breast so well dressed with such white hands has stabbed trusting hearts severed family ties written lying vows signed false oaths torn up pitilessly tender appeals for redress and tossed away into the fire supplications blistered with tears packed cards and cogged dice or used pistol or sword as calmly and dexterously as he now ranges his battalions of gold pieces  ridley shrank away from such lawless people with the delicacy belonging to his timid and retiring nature but it must be owned that mr clive was by no means so squeamish he did not know in the first place the mystery of their iniquities and his sunny kindly spirit undimmed by any of the cares which clouded it subsequently was disposed to shine upon all people alike the world was welcome to him the day a pleasure all nature a gay feast scarce any dispositions discordant with his own for pretension only made him laugh and hypocrisy he will never be able to understand if he lives to be a hundred years old the night brought him a long sleep and the morning a glad waking to those privileges of youth what enjoyments of age are comparable what achievements of ambition what rewards of money and fame clives happy friendly nature shone out of his face and almost all who beheld it felt kindly towards him as those guileless virgins of romance and ballad who walk smiling through dark forests charming off dragons and confronting lions the young man as yet went through the world harmless no giant waylaid him as yet no robbing ogre fed on him and greatest danger of all for one of his ardent nature no winning enchantress or artful siren coaxed him to her cave or lured him into her watershaunts into which we know so many young simpletons are drawn where their silly bones are picked and their tender flesh devoured  the time was short which clive spent at baden for it has been said the winter was approaching and the destination of our young artists was rome but he may have passed some score of days here to which he and another person in that pretty wateringplace possibly looked back afterwards as not the unhappiest period of their lives among colonel newcomes papers to which the family biographer has had subsequent access there are a couple of letters from clive dated baden at this time and full of happiness gaiety and affection letter no 1 says ethel is the prettiest girl here at the assemblies all the princes counts dukes parthians medes and elamites are dying to dance with her she sends her dearest love to her uncle by the side of the words prettiest girl was written in a frank female hand the monosyllable stuff and as a note to the expression dearest love with a star to mark the text and the note are squeezed in the same feminine characters at the bottom of clives page the words that i do e n  in letter no 2 the first two pages are closely written in clives handwriting describing his pursuits and studies and giving amusing details of the life at baden and the company whom he met therenarrating his rencontre with their paris friend m de florac and the arrival of the duchesse divry floracs cousin whose titles the vicomte will probably inherit not a word about floracs gambling propensities are mentioned in the letter but clive honestly confesses that he has staked five napoleons doubled them quadrupled them won ever so much lost it all back again and come away from the table with his original five pounds in his pocketproposing never to play any more ethel he concluded is looking over my shoulder she thinks me such a delightful creature that she is never easy without me she bids me to say that i am the best of sons and cousins and am in a word a darling du the rest of this important word is not given but goose is added in the female hand in the faded ink on the yellow paper that may have crossed and recrossed oceans that has lain locked in chests for years and buried under piles of family archives while your friends have been dying and your head has grown whitewho has not disinterred mementos like thesefrom which the past smiles at you so sadly shimmering out of hades an instant but to sink back again into the cold shades perhaps with a faint faint sound as of a remembered tonea ghostly echo of a once familiar laughter i was looking of late at a wall in the naples museum whereon a boy of herculaneum eighteen hundred years ago had scratched with a nail the figure of a soldier i could fancy the child turning round and smiling on me after having done his etching which of us that is thirty years old has not had his pompeii deep under ashes lies the life of youththe careless sport the pleasure and passion the darling joy you open an old letterbox and look at your own childish scrawls or your mothers letters to you when you were at school and excavate your heart oh me for the day when the whole city shall be bare and the chambers unroofedand every cranny visible to the light above from the forum to the lupanar  ethel takes up the pen my dear uncle she says while clive is sketching out of window let me write you a line or two on his paper though i know you like to hear no one speak but him i wish i could draw him for you as he stands yonder looking the picture of good health good spirits and good humour everybody likes him he is quite unaffected always gay always pleased he draws more and more beautifully every day and his affection for young mr ridley who is really a most excellent and astonishing young man and actually a better artist than clive himself is most romantic and does your son the greatest credit you will order clive not to sell his pictures wont you i know it is not wrong but your son might look higher than to be an artist it is a rise for mr ridley but a fall for him an artist an organist a pianist all these are very good people but you know not de notre monde and clive ought to belong to it  we met him at bonn on our way to a great family gathering here where i must tell you we are assembled for what i call the congress of baden the chief of the house of kew is here and what time he does not devote to skittles to smoking cigars to the jeu in the evenings to madame divry to madame de cruchecassee and the foreign people of whom there are a host here of the worst kind as usual he graciously bestows on me lord and lady dorking are here with their meek little daughter clara pulleyn and barnes is coming uncle hobson has returned to lombard street to relieve guard i think you will hear before very long of lady clara newcome grandmamma who was to have presided at the congress of baden and still you know reigns over the house of kew has been stopped at kissingen with an attack of rheumatism i pity poor aunt julia who can never leave her here are all our news i declare i have filled the whole page men write closer than we do i wear the dear brooch you gave me often and often i think of you always dear kind uncle as your affectionate ethel  besides roulette and trenteetquarante a number of amusing games are played at baden which are not performed so to speak sur table these little diversions and jeux de societe can go on anywhere in an alley in the park in a picnic to this old schloss or that pretty huntinglodge at a teatable in a lodginghouse or hotel in a ball at the redoute in the playrooms behind the backs of the gamblers whose eyes are only cast upon rakes and rouleaux and red and black or on the broad walk in front of the conversation rooms where thousands of people are drinking and chattering lounging and smoking whilst the austrian brass band in the little music pavilion plays the most delightful mazurkas and waltzes here the widow plays her black suit and sets her bright eyes against the rich bachelor elderly or young as may be here the artful practitioner who has dealt in a thousand such games engages the young simpleton with more money than wit and knowing his weakness and her skill we may safely take the odds and back rouge et couleur to win here mamma not having money perhaps but metal more attractive stakes her virgin daughter against count fettackers forests and meadows or lord lackland plays his coronet of which the jewels have long since been in pawn against miss bags threepercents and so two or three funny little games were going on at baden amongst our immediate acquaintance besides that vulgar sport round the green table at which the mob with whom we have little to do was elbowing each other a hint of these domestic prolusions has been given to the reader in the foregoing extract from miss ethel newcomes letter likewise some passions have been in play of which a modest young english maiden could not be aware do not however let us be too prematurely proud of our virtue that tariff of british virtue is wonderfully organised heaven help the society which made its laws gnats are shut out of its ports or not admitted without scrutiny and repugnance whilst herds of camels are let in the law professes to exclude some goods or bads shall we call themwell some articles of baggage which are yet smuggled openly under the eyes of winking officers and worn every day without shame shame what is shame virtue is very often shameful according to the english social constitution and shame honourable truth if yours happens to differ from your neighbours provokes your friends coldness your mothers tears the worlds persecution love is not to be dealt in save under restrictions which kill its sweet healthy free commerce sin in man is so light that scarce the fine of a penny is imposed while for woman it is so heavy that no repentance can wash it out ah yes all stories are old you proud matrons in your mayfair markets have you never seen a virgin sold or sold one have you never heard of a poor wayfarer fallen among robbers and not a pharisee to help him of a poor woman fallen more sadly yet abject in repentance and tears and a crowd to stone her i pace this broad baden walk as the sunset is gilding the hills round about as the orchestra blows its merry tunes as the happy children laugh and sport in the alleys as the lamps of the gamblingpalace are lighted up as the throngs of pleasurehunters stroll and smoke and flirt and hum and wonder sometimes is it the sinners who are the most sinful is it poor prodigal yonder amongst the bad company calling black and red and tossing the champagne or brother straitlace that grudges his repentance is it downcast hagar that slinks away with poor little ishmael in her hand or bitter old virtuous sarah who scowls at her from my demure lord abrahams arm  one day of the previous may when of course everybody went to visit the watercolour exhibitions ethel newcome was taken to see the pictures by her grandmother that rigorous old lady kew who still proposed to reign over all her family the girl had high spirit and very likely hot words had passed between the elder and the younger lady such as i am given to understand will be uttered in the most polite families they came to a piece by mr hunt representing one of those figures which he knows how to paint with such consummate truth and pathosa friendless young girl cowering in a doorway evidently without home or shelter the exquisite fidelity of the details and the plaintive beauty of the expression of the child attracted old lady kews admiration who was an excellent judge of works of art and she stood for some time looking at the drawing with ethel by her side nothing in truth could be more simple or pathetic ethel laughed and her grandmother looking up from her stick on which she hobbled about saw a very sarcastic expression in the girls eyes  you have no taste for pictures only for painters i suppose said lady kew  i was not looking at the picture said ethel still with a smile but at the little green ticket in the corner  sold said lady kew of course it is sold all mr hunts pictures are sold there is not one of them here on which you wont see the green ticket he is a most admirable artist i dont know whether his comedy or tragedy are the most excellent  i think grandmamma ethel said we young ladies in the world when we are exhibiting ought to have little green tickets pinned on our backs with sold written on them it would prevent trouble and any future haggling you know then at the end of the season the owner would come to carry us home  grandmamma only said ethel you are a fool and hobbled on to mr cattermoles picture hard by what splendid colour what a romantic gloom what a flowing pencil and dexterous hand lady kew could delight in pictures applaud good poetry and squeeze out a tear over a good novel too that afternoon young dawkins the rising watercolour artist who used to come daily to the gallery and stand delighted before his own piece was aghast to perceive that there was no green ticket in the corner of his frame and he pointed out the deficiency to the keeper of the pictures his landscape however was sold and paid for so no great mischief occurred on that same evening when the newcome family assembled at dinner in park lane ethel appeared with a bright green ticket pinned in the front of her white muslin frock and when asked what this queer fancy meant she made lady kew a curtsey looking her full in the face and turning round to her father said i am a tableauvivant papa i am number 46 in the exhibition of the gallery of painters in watercolours  my love what do you mean says mamma and lady kew jumping up on her crooked stick with immense agility tore the card out of ethels bosom and very likely would have boxed her ears but that her parents were present and lord kew announced  ethel talked about pictures the whole evening and would talk of nothing else grandmamma went away furious she told barnes and when everybody was gone there was a pretty row in the building said madam ethel with an arch look when she narrated the story barnes was ready to kill me and eat me but i never was afraid of barnes and the biographer gathers from this little anecdote narrated to him never mind by whom at a long subsequent period that there had been great disputes in sir brian newcomes establishment fierce drawingroom battles whereof certain pictures of a certain painter might have furnished the cause and in which miss newcome had the whole of the family forces against her that such battles take place in other domestic establishments who shall say or shall not say who when he goes out to dinner and is received by a bland host with a gay shake of the hand and a pretty hostess with a gracious smile of welcome dares to think that mr johnson upstairs half an hour before was swearing out of his dressingroom at mrs johnson for having ordered a turbot instead of a salmon or that mrs johnson now talking to lady jones so nicely about their mutual darling children was crying her eyes out as her maid was fastening her gown as the carriages were actually driving up the servants know these things but not we in the diningroom hark with what a respectful tone johnson begs the clergyman present to say grace  whatever these family quarrels may have been let bygones be bygones and let us be perfectly sure that to whatever purpose miss ethel newcome for good or for evil might make her mind up she had quite spirit enough to hold her own she chose to be countess of kew because she chose to be countess of kew had she set her heart on marrying mr kuhn she would have had her way and made the family adopt it and called him dear fritz as by his godfathers and godmothers in his baptism mr kuhn was called clive was but a fancy if he had even been so much as that not a passion and she fancied a pretty fourpronged coronet still more  so that the diatribe wherein we lately indulged about the selling of virgins by no means applies to lady anne newcome who signed the address to mrs stowe the other day along with thousands more virtuous british matrons but should the reader haply say is thy fable o poet narrated concerning tancred pulleyn earl of dorking and sigismunda his wife the reluctant moralist is obliged to own that the cap does fit those noble personages of whose lofty society you will however see but little  for though i would like to go into an indian brahmins house and see the punkahs and the purdahs and tattys and the pretty brown maidens with great eyes and great noserings and painted foreheads and slim waists cased in cashmir shawls kincob scarfs curly slippers gilt trousers precious anklets and bangles and have the mystery of eastern existence revealed to me as who would not who has read the arabian nights in his youth yet i would not choose the moment when the brahmin of the house was dead his women howling his priests doctoring his child of a widow now frightening her with sermons now drugging her with bang so as to push her on his funeral pile at last and into the arms of that carcase stupefied but obedient and decorous and though i like to walk even in fancy in an earls house splendid well ordered where there are feasts and fine pictures and fair ladies and endless books and good company yet there are times when the visit is not pleasant and when the parents in that fine house are getting ready their daughter for sale and frightening away her tears with threats and stupefying her grief with narcotics praying her and imploring her and dramming her and coaxing her and blessing her and cursing her perhaps till they have brought her into such a state as shall fit the poor young thing for that deadly couch upon which they are about to thrust her when my lord and lady are so engaged i prefer not to call at their mansion number 1000 in grosvenor square but to partake of a dinner of herbs rather than of that stalled ox which their cook is roasting whole there are some people who are not so squeamish the family comes of course the most reverend the lord archbrahmin of benares will attend the ceremony there will be flowers and lights and white favours and quite a string of carriages up to the pagoda and such a breakfast afterwards and music in the street and little parish boys hurrahing and no end of speeches within and tears shed no doubt and his grace the archbrahmin will make a highly appropriate speech just with a faint scent of incense about it as such a speech ought to have and the young person will slip away unperceived and take off her veils wreaths orangeflowers bangles and finery and will put on a plain dress more suited for the occasion and the housedoor will openand there comes the suttee in company of the body yonder the pile is waiting on four wheels with four horses the crowd hurrahs and the deed is done  this ceremony amongst us is so stale and common that to be sure there is no need to describe its rites and as women sell themselves for what you call an establishment every day to the applause of themselves their parents and the world why on earth should a man ape at originality and pretend to pity them never mind about the lies at the altar the blasphemy against the godlike name of love the sordid surrender the smiling dishonour what the deuce does a mariage de convenance mean but all this and are not such sober hymeneal torches more satisfactory often than the most brilliant love matches that ever flamed and burnt out of course let us not weep when everybody else is laughing let us pity the agonised duchess when her daughter lady atalanta runs away with the doctorof course thats respectable let us pity lady iphigenias father when that venerable chief is obliged to offer up his darling child but it is over her part of the business that a decorous painter would throw the veil now her ladyships sacrifice is performed and the less said about it the better  such was the case regarding an affair which appeared in due subsequence in the newspapers not long afterwards under the fascinating title of marriage in high life and which was in truth the occasion of the little family congress of baden which we are now chronicling we all knoweverybody at least who has the slightest acquaintance with the army listthat at the commencement of their life my lord kew my lord viscount rooster the earl of dorkings eldest son and the honourable charles belsize familiarly called jack belsize were subaltern officers in one of his majestys regiments of cuirassier guards they heard the chimes at midnight like other young men they enjoyed their fun and frolics as gentlemen of spirit will do sowing their wild oats plentifully and scattering them with boyish profusion lady kews luck had blessed him with more sacks of oats than fell to the lot of his noble young companions lord dorkings house is known to have been long impoverished an excellent informant major pendennis has entertained me with many edifying accounts of the exploits of lord roosters grandfather with the wild prince and poins of his feats in the huntingfield over the bottle over the dicebox he played two nights and two days at a sitting with charles fox when they both lost sums awful to reckon he played often with lord steyne and came away as all men did dreadful sufferers from those midnight encounters his descendants incurred the penalties of the progenitors imprudence and chanticlere though one of the finest castles in england is splendid but for a month in the year the estate is mortgaged up to the very castle windows dorking cannot cut a stick or kill a buck in his own park the good old major used to tell with tragic accents he lives by his cabbages grapes and pineapples and the fees which people give for seeing the place and gardens which are still the show of the county and among the most splendid in the island when dorking is at chanticlere ballard who married his sister lends him the plate and sends three men with it four cooks inside and four maids and six footmen on the roof with a butler driving come down from london in a trap and wait the month and as the last carriage of the company drives away the servants coach is packed and they all bowl back to town again its pitiable sir pitiable  in lord kews youth the names of himself and his two noble friends appeared on innumerable slips of stamped paper conveying pecuniary assurances of a promissory nature all of which promises my lord kew singly and most honourably discharged neither of his two companionsinarms had the means of meeting these engagements ballard roosters uncle was said to make his lordship some allowance as for jack belsize how he lived how he laughed how he dressed himself so well and looked so fat and handsome how he got a shilling to pay for a cab or a cigar what ravens fed him was a wonder to all the young men claimed kinsmanship with one another which those who are learned in the peerage may unravel  when lord dorkings eldest daughter married the honourable and venerable dennis gallowglass archdeacon of bullintubber and at present viscount gallowglass and killbrogue and lord bishop of ballyshannon great festivities took place at chanticlere whither the relatives of the high contracting parties were invited among them came poor jack belsize and hence the tears which are dropping at baden at this present period of our history clara pulleyn was then a pretty little maiden of sixteen and jack a handsome guardsman of six or seven and twenty as she had been especially warned against jack as a wicked young rogue whose antecedents were wofully against him as she was never allowed to sit near him at dinner or to walk with him or to play at billiards with him or to waltz with him as she was scolded if he spoke a word to her or if he picked up her glove or touched her hand in a round game or caught him when they were playing at blindmansbuff as they neither of them had a penny in the world and were both very goodlooking of course clara was always catching jack at blindmansbuff constantly lighting upon him in the shrubberies or corridors etc etc etc she fell in love she was not the first with jacks broad chest and thin waist she thought his whiskers as indeed they were the handsomest pair in all his majestys brigade of cuirassiers  we know not what tears were shed in the vast and silent halls of chanticlere when the company were gone and the four cooks and four maids six footmen and temporary butler had driven back in their private trap to the metropolis which is not forty miles distant from that splendid castle how can we tell the guests departed the lodgegates shut all is mysterydarkness with one pair of wax candles blinking dismally in a solitary chamber all the rest dreary vistas of brown hollands rolled turkey carpets gaunt ancestors on the walls scowling out of the twilight blank the imagination is at liberty to depict his lordship with one candle over his dreadful endless tapes and papers her ladyship with the other and an old old novel wherein perhaps mrs radcliffe describes a castle as dreary as her own and poor little clara sighing and crying in the midst of these funereal splendours as lonely and heartsick as oriana in her moated grangepoor little clara  lord kews drag took the young men to london his lordship driving and the servants sitting inside jack sat behind with the two grooms and tooted on a cornetapiston in the most melancholy manner he partook of no refreshment on the road his silence at his clubs was remarked smoking billiards military duties and this and that roused him a little and presently jack was alive again but then came the season lady clara pulleyns first season in london and jack was more alive than ever there was no ball he did not go to no opera that is to say no opera of certain operas which he did not frequent it was easy to see by his face two minutes after entering a room whether the person he sought was there or absent not difficult for those who were in the secret to watch in another pair of eyes the bright kindling signals which answered jacks fiery glances ah how beautiful he looked on his charger on the birthday all in a blaze of scarlet and bullion and steel o jack tear her out of yon carriage from the side of yonder livid feathered painted bony dowager place her behind you on the black charger cut down the policeman and away with you the carriage rolls in through st jamess park jack sits alone with his sword dropped to the ground or only atra cura on the crupper behind him and snip the tailor in the crowd thinks it is for fear of him jacks head droops lady clara pulleyn is presented by her mother the countess of dorking and jack is arrested that night as he is going out of whites to meet her at the opera  jacks little exploits are known in the insolvent court where he made his appearances as charles belsize commonly called the honourable charles belsize whose dealings were smartly chronicled by the indignant moralists of the press of those days the scourge flogged him heartily the whip of which the accomplished editor was himself in whitecross street prison was especially virtuous regarding him and the penny voice of freedom gave him an awful dressing i am not here to scourge sinners i am true to my party it is the other side this humble pen attacks let us keep to the virtuous and respectable for as for poor sinners they get the whippingpost every day one person was faithful to poor jack through all his blunders and follies and extravagance and misfortunes and that was the pretty young girl of chanticlere round whose young affections his luxuriant whiskers had curled and the world may cry out at lord kew for sending his brougham to the queens bench prison and giving a great feast at grignons to jack on the day of his liberation but i for one will not quarrel with his lordship he and many other sinners had a jolly night they said kew made a fine speech in hearing and acknowledging which jack belsize wept copiously barnes newcome was in a rage at jacks manumission and sincerely hoped mr commissioner would give him a couple of years longer and cursed and swore with a great liberality on hearing of his liberty  that this poor prodigal should marry clara pulleyn and by way of a dowry lay his schedule at her feet was out of the question his noble father lord highgate was furious against him his eldest brother would not see him he had given up all hopes of winning his darling prize long ago and one day there came to him a great packet bearing the seal of chanticlere containing a wretched little letter signed c p and a dozen sheets of jacks own clumsy writing delivered who knows how in what crushrooms quadrilles bouquets balls and in which were scrawled jacks love and passion and ardour how many a time had he looked into the dictionary at whites to see whether eternal was spelt with an e and adore with one a or two there they were the incoherent utterances of his brave longing heart and those two wretched wretched lines signed c begging that cs little letters might too be returned or destroyed to do him justice he burnt them loyally every one along with his own waste paper he kept not one single little token which she had given him or let him take the rose the glove the little handkerchief which she had dropped to him how he cried over them the ringlet of golden hairhe burnt them all all in his own fire in the prison save a little little bit of the hair which might be any ones which was the colour of his sisters kew saw the deed done perhaps he hurried away when jack came to the very last part of the sacrifice and flung the hair into the fire where he would have liked to fling his heart and his life too  so clara was free and the year when jack came out of prison and went abroad she passed the season in london dancing about night after night and everybody said she was well out of that silly affair with jack belsize it was then that barnes newcome esq a partner of the wealthy banking firm of hobson brothers and newcome son and heir of sir brian newcome of newcome bart and m p descended in right line from bryan de newcomyn slain at hastings and barbersurgeon to edward the confessor etc etc cast the eyes of regard on the lady clara pulleyn who was a little pale and languid certainly but had blue eyes a delicate skin and a pretty person and knowing her previous history as well as you who have just perused it deigned to entertain matrimonial intentions towards her ladyship  not one of the members of these most respectable families excepting poor little clara perhaps poor little fish as if she had any call but to do her duty or to ask a quelle sauce elle serait mangee protested against this little affair of traffic lady dorking had a brood of little chickens to succeed clara there was little hennie who was sixteen and biddy who was fourteen and adelaide and who knows how many more how could she refuse a young man not very agreeable it is true nor particularly amiable nor of good birth at least on his fathers side but otherwise eligible and heir to so many thousands a year the newcomes on their side think it a desirable match barnes it must be confessed is growing rather selfish and has some bachelor ways which a wife will reform lady kew is strongly for the match with her own family interest lord steyne and lord kew her nephews and barness own fatherinlaw lord dorking in the peers why shall not the newcomes sit there too and resume the old seat which all the world knows they had in the time of richard iii barnes and his father had got up quite a belief about a newcome killed at bosworth along with king richard and hated henry vii as an enemy of their noble race so all the parties were pretty well agreed lady anne wrote rather a pretty little poem about welcoming the white fawn to the newcome bowers and clara was made to rhyme with fairer and timid does and antlered deer to dot the glades of chanticlere quite in a picturesque way lady kew pronounced that the poem was very pretty indeed  the year after jack belsize made his foreign tour he returned to london for the season lady clara did not happen to be there her health was a little delicate and her kind parents took her abroad so all things went on very smoothly and comfortably indeed  yes but when things were so quiet and comfortable when the ladies of the two families had met at the congress of baden and liked each other so much when barnes and his papa the baronet recovered from his illness were actually on their journey from aixlachapelle and lady kew in motion from kissingen to the congress of baden why on earth should jack belsize haggard wild having been winning great sums it was said at hombourg forsake his luck there and run over frantically to baden he wore a great thick beard a great slouched hathe looked like nothing more or less than a painter or an italian brigand unsuspecting clive remembering the jolly dinner which jack had procured for him at the guards mess in st jamess whither jack himself came from the horse guardssimple clive seeing jack enter the town hailed him cordially and invited him to dinner and jack accepted and clive told him all the news he had of the place how kew was there and lady anne newcome and ethel and barnes was coming i am not very fond of him either says clive smiling when belsize mentioned his name so barnes was coming to marry that pretty little lady clara pulleyn the knowing youth i dare say he was rather pleased with his knowledge of the fashionable world and the idea that jack belsize would think he too was somebody  jack drank an immense quantity of champagne and the dinner over as they could hear the band playing from clives open windows in the snug clean little hotel de france jack proposed they should go on the promenade m de florac was of the party he had been exceedingly jocular when lord kews name was mentioned and said ce petit kiou m le duc divry mon oncle lhonore dune amitie toute particuliere these three gentlemen walked out the promenade was crowded the was band playing home sweet home very sweetly and the very first persons they met on the walk were the lords of kew and dorking on the arm of which latter venerable peer his daughter lady clara was hanging  jack belsize in a velvet coat with a sombrero slouched over his face with a beard reaching to his waist was no doubt not recognised at first by the noble lord of dorking for he was greeting the other two gentlemen with his usual politeness and affability when of a sudden lady clara looking up gave a little shriek and fell down lifeless on the gravel walk then the old earl recognised mr belsize and clive heard him say you villain how dare you come here  belsize had flung himself down to lift up clara calling her frantically by her name when old dorking sprang to seize him  hands off my lord said the other shaking the old man from his back confound you jack hold your tongue roars out kew clive runs for a chair and a dozen were forthcoming florac skips back with a glass of water belsize runs towards the awakening girl and the father for an instant losing all patience and selfcommand trembling in every limb lifts his stick and says again leave her you ruffian lady clara has fainted again sir says captain belsize i am staying at the hotel de france if you touch me old man this in a very low voice by heaven i shall kill you i wish you good morning and taking a last long look at the lifeless girl he lifts his hat and walks away lord dorking mechanically takes his hat off and stands stupidly gazing after him he beckoned clive to follow him and a crowd of the frequenters of the place are by this time closed round the fainting young lady  here was a pretty incident in the congress of baden     chapter xxix in which barnes comes awooing   ethel had all along known that her holiday was to be a short one and that her papa and barnes arrived there was to be no more laughing and fun and sketching and walking with clive so she took the sunshine while it lasted determined to bear with a stout heart the bad weather  sir brian newcome and his eldest born arrived at baden on the very night of jack belsizes performance upon the promenade of course it was necessary to inform the young bridegroom of the facts his acquaintances of the public who by this time know his temper and are acquainted with his language can imagine the explosions of the one and the vehemence of the other it was a perfect feu dartifice of oaths which he sent up mr newcome only fired off these volleys of curses when he was in a passion but then he was in a passion very frequently  as for lady claras little accident he was disposed to treat that very lightly poor dear clara of course of course he said shes been accustomed to fainting fits no wonder she was agitated on the sight of that villain after his infernal treatment of her if i had been there a volley of oaths comes here along the whole line i should have strangled the scoundrel i should have murdered him  mercy barnes cries lady anne  it was a mercy barnes was not there says ethel gravely a fight between him and captain belsize would have been awful indeed  i am afraid of no man ethel says barnes fiercely with another oath  hit one of your own size barnes says miss ethel who had a number of schoolphrases from her little brothers and used them on occasions skilfully hit captain belsize he has no friends  as jack belsize from his height and strength was fitted to be not only an officer but actually a private in his former gallant regiment and brother barnes was but a puny young gentleman the idea of a personal conflict between them was rather ridiculous some notion of this sort may have passed through sir brians mind for the baronet said with his usual solemnity it is the cause ethel it is the cause my dear which gives strength in such a cause as barness with a beautiful young creature to protect from a villain any man would be strong any man would be strong since his last attack barnes used to say my poor old governor is exceedingly shaky very groggy about the head which was the fact barnes was already master at newcome and the bank and awaiting with perfect composure the event which was to place the bloodred hand of the newcome baronetcy on his own brougham  casting his eyes about the room a heap of drawings the work of a wellknown hand which he hated met his eye there were a halfdozen sketches of baden ethel on horseback again the children and the dogs just in the old way d him is he here screams out barnes is that young pothouse villain here and hasnt kew knocked his head off is clive newcome here sir he cries out to his father the colonels son i have no doubt they met by  by what barnes says ethel  clive is here is he says the baronet making caricatures hey you did not mention him in your letters lady anne  sir brian was evidently very much touched by his last attack  ethel blushed it was a curious fact but there had been no mention of clive in the ladies letters to sir brian  my dear we met him by the merest chance at bonn travelling with a friend of his and he speaks a little german and was very useful to us and took one of the boys in his britzska the whole way  boys always crowd in a carriage says sir brian kick your shins always in the way i remember when we used to come in the carriage from clapham when we were boys i used to kick my brother toms shins poor tom he was a devilish wild fellow in those days you dont recollect tom my lady anne  further anecdotes from sir brian are interrupted by lord kews arrival how dydo kew cries barnes hows clara and lord kew walking up with great respect to shake hands with sir brian says i am glad to see you looking so well sir and scarcely takes any notice of barnes that mr barnes newcome was an individual not universally beloved is a point of history of which there can be no doubt  you have not told me how clara is my good fellow continues barnes i have heard all about her meeting with that villain jack belsize  dont call names my good fellow says lord kew it strikes me you dont know belsize well enough to call him by nicknames or by other names lady clara pulleyn i believe is very unwell indeed  confound the fellow how dared he to come here cries barnes backing from this little rebuff  dare is another ugly word i would advise you not to use it to the fellow himself  what do you mean says barnes looking very serious in an instant  easy my good friend not so very loud it appears ethel that poor jacki know him pretty well you see barnes and may call him by what names i likehad been dining today with cousin clive he and m de florac and that they went with jack to the promenade not in the least aware of mr jack belsizes private affairs or of the shindy that was going to happen  by jove he shall answer for it cries out barnes in a loud voice  i dare say he will if you ask him says the other drily but not before ladies hed be afraid of frightening them poor jack was always as gentle as a lamb before women i had some talk with the frenchman just now continued lord kew gaily as if wishing to pass over this side of the subject mi lord kiou says he we have made your friend jac to hear reason he is a little fou your friend jack he drank champagne at dinner like an ogre how is the charmante miss clara florac you see calls her miss clara barnes the world calls her lady clara you call her clara you happy dog you  i dont see why that infernal young cub of a clive is always meddling in our affairs cries out barnes whose rage was perpetually being whipped into new outcries why has he been about this house why is he here  it is very well for you that he was barnes lord kew said the young fellow showed great temper and spirit there has been a famous row but dont be alarmed it is all over it is all over everybody may go to bed and sleep comfortably barnes need not get up in the morning to punch jack belsizes head im sorry for your disappointment you fenchurch street fireeater come away it will be but proper you know for a bridegroom elect to go and ask news of la charmante miss clara  as we went out of the house lord kew told clive i said to barnes that every word i had uttered upstairs with regard to the reconciliation was a lie that jack belsize was determined to have his blood and was walking under the limetrees by which we had to pass with a thundering big stick you should have seen the state the fellow was in sir the sweet youth started back and turned as yellow as a cream cheese then he made a pretext to go into his room and said it was for his pockethandkerchief but i know it was for a pistol for he dropped his hand from my arm into his pocket every time i said heres jack as we walked down the avenue to lord dorkings apartment  a great deal of animated business had been transacted during the two hours subsequent to poor lady claras mishap clive and belsize had returned to the formers quarters while gentle j j was utilising the last rays of the sun to tint a sketch which he had made during the morning he fled to his own apartment on the arrival of the fiercelooking stranger whose glaring eyes pallid looks shaggy beard clutched hands and incessant gasps and mutterings as he strode up and down might well scare a peaceable person very terrible must jack have looked as he trampled those boards in the growing twilight anon stopping to drink another tumbler of champagne then groaning expressions of inarticulate wrath and again sinking down on clives bed with a dropping head and breaking voice crying poor little thing poor little devil  if the old man sends me a message you will stand by me wont you newcome he was a fierce old fellow in his time and i have seen him shoot straight enough at chanticlere i suppose you know what the affair is about  i never heard of it before but i think i understand says clive gravely  i cant ask kew he is one of the family he is going to marry miss newcome it is no use asking him  all clives blood tingled at the idea that any man was going to marry miss newcome he knew it beforea fortnight since and it was nothing to him to hear it he was glad that the growing darkness prevented his face from being seen i am of the family too said clive and barnes newcome and i had the same grandfather  oh yes old boyold banker the weaver what was he i forgot says poor jack kicking on clives bed in that family the newcomes dont count i beg your pardon groans poor jack  they lapse into silence during which jacks cigar glimmers from the twilight corner where clives bed is whilst clive wafts his fragrance out of the window where he sits and whence he has a view of lady anne newcomes windows to the right over the bridge across the little rushing river at the hotel de hollande hard by the lights twinkle in the booths under the pretty lime avenues the hum of distant voices is heard the gamblingpalace is all in a blaze it is an assembly night and from the doors of the conversation rooms as they open and close escape gusts of harmony behind on the little hill the darkling woods lie calm the edges of the firtrees cut sharp against the sky which is clear with a crescent moon and the lambent lights of the starry hosts of heaven clive does not see pinerobed hills and shining stars nor think of pleasure in its palace yonder nor of pain writhing on his own bed within a few feet of him where poor belsize was groaning his eyes are fixed upon a window whence comes the red light of a lamp across which shadows float now and again so every light in every booth yonder has a scheme of its own every star above shines by itself and each individual heart of ours goes on brightening with its own hopes burning with its own desires and quivering with its own pain  the reverie is interrupted by the waiter who announces m le vicomte de florac and a third cigar is added to the other two smoky lights belsize is glad to see florac whom he has known in a thousand haunts he will do my business for me he has been out half a dozen times thinks jack it would relieve the poor fellows boiling blood that some one would let a little out he lays his affair before florac he expects a message from lord dorking  comment donc cries florac il y avait donc quelque chose cette pauvre petite miss vous voulez tuer le pere apres avoir delaisse la fille cherchez dautres temoins monsieur le vicomte de florac ne se fait pas complice de telles lachetes  by heaven says jack sitting up on the bed with his eyes glaring i have a great mind florac to wring your infernal little neck and to fling you out of the window is all the world going to turn against me i am half mad as it is if any man dares to think anything wrong regarding that little angel or to fancy that she is not as pure and as good and as gentle and as innocent by heaven as any angel thereif any man thinks id be the villain to hurt her i should just like to see him says jack by the lord sir just bring him to me just tell the waiter to send him upstairs hurt her i hurt her oh im a fool a fool a dd fool whos that  its kew says a voice out of the darkness from behind cigar no 4 and clive now having a party assembled scrapes a match and lights his candles  i heard your last words jack lord kew says bluntly and you never spoke more truth in your life why did you come here what right had you to stab that poor little heart over again and frighten lady clara with your confounded hairy face you promised me you would never see her you gave your word of honour you wouldnt when i gave you the money to go abroad hang the money i dont mind that it was on your promise that you would prowl about her no more the dorkings left london before you came there they gave you your innings they have behaved kindly and fairly enough to that poor girl how was she to marry such a bankrupt beggar as you are what you have done is a shame charley belsize i tell you it is unmanly and cowardly  pst says florac numero deux voila le mot lache  dont bite your thumb at me kew went on i know you could thrash me if thats what you mean by shaking your fists so could most men i tell you againyou have done a bad deed you have broken your word of honour and you knocked down clara pulleyn today as cruelly as if you had done it with your hand  with this rush upon him and fiery assault of kew belsize was quite bewildered the huge man flung up his great arms and let them drop at his side as a gladiator that surrenders and asks for pity he sank down once more on the iron bed  i dont know says he rolling and rolling round in one of his great hands one of the brass knobs of the bed by which he was seated i dont know frank says he what the world is coming to or me either here is twice in one night i have been called a coward by you and by that little whatdyoucallm i beg your pardon florac i dont know whether it is very brave in you to hit a chap when he is down hit again i have no friends i have acted like a blackguard i own that i did break my promise you had that safe enough frank my boy but i did not think it would hurt her to see me says he with a dreadful sob in his voice byi would have given ten years of my life to look at her i was going mad without her i tried every place everything went to ems to wiesbaden to hombourg and played like hell it used to excite me once and now i dont care for it i won no end of moneyno end for a poor beggar like me that is but i couldnt keep away i couldnt and if she had been at the north pole by heavens i would have followed her  and so just to look at her just to give your confounded stupid eyes two minutes pleasure you must bring about all this pain you great baby cries kew who was very softhearted and in truth quite torn himself by the sight of poor jacks agony  get me to see her for five minutes kew cries the other griping his comrades hand in his but for five minutes  for shame cries lord kew shaking away his hand be a man jack and have no more of this puling its not a baby that must have its toy and cries because it cant get it spare the poor girl this pain for her own sake and balk yourself of the pleasure of bullying and making her unhappy  belsize started up with looks that were by no means pleasant theres enough of this chaff i have been called names and blackguarded quite sufficiently for one sitting i shall act as i please i choose to take my own way and if any gentleman stops me he has full warning and he fell to tugging his mustachios which were of a dark tawny hue and looked as warlike as he had ever done on any fieldday  i take the warning said lord kew and if i know the way you are going as i think i do i will do my best to stop you madman as you are you can hardly propose to follow her to her own doorway and pose yourself before your mistress as the murderer of her father like rodrigue in the french play if rooster were here it would be his business to defend his sister in his absence i will take the duty on myself and i say to you charles belsize in the presence of these gentlemen that any man who iusults this young lady who persecutes her with his presence knowing it can but pain her who persists in following her when he has given his word of honour to avoid her that such a man is  what my lord kew cries belsize whose chest began to heave  you know what answers the other you know what a man is who insults a poor woman and breaks his word of honour consider the word said and act upon it as you think fit  i owe you four thousand pounds kew says belsize and i have got four thousand on the bills besides four hundred when i came out of that place  you insult me the more cries kew flashing out by alluding to the money if you will leave this place tomorrow well and good if not you will please to give me a meeting mr newcome will you be so kind as to act as my friend we are connexions you know and this gentleman chooses to insult a lady who is about to become one of our family  cest bien milord ma foi cest dagir en vrai gentilhomme says florac delighted touchezla mon petit kiou tu as du coeur godam you are a brave a brave fellow and the viscount reached out his hand cordially to lord kew  his purpose was evidently pacific from kew he turned to the great guardsman and taking him by the coat began to apostrophise him and you mon gros says he is there no way of calming this hot blood without a saignee have you a penny to the world can you hope to carry off your chimene o rodrigue and live by robbing afterwards on the great way suppose you kill ze fazer you kill kiou you kill roostere your chimene will have a pretty moon of honey  what the devil do you mean about your chimene and your rodrigue do you mean viscount says belsize jack belsize once more and he dashed his hand across his eyes kew has riled me and he drove me half wild i aint much of a frenchman but i know enough of what you said to say its true by jove and that frank kews a trump thats what you mean give us your hand frank god bless you old boy dont be too hard upon me you know im dd miserable that i am hullo whats this jacks pathetic speech was interrupted at this instant for the vicomte de florac in his enthusiasm rushed into his arms and jumped up towards his face and proceeded to kiss jack a roar of immense laughter as he shook the little viscount off cleared the air and ended this quarrel  everybody joined in this chorus the frenchman with the rest who said he loved to laugh meme when he did not know why and now came the moment of the evening when clive according to lord kews saying behaved so well and prevented barnes from incurring a great danger in truth what mr clive did or said amounted exactly to nothing what moments can we not all remember in our lives when it would have been so much wittier and wiser to say and do nothing  florac a very sober drinker like most of his nation was blessed with a very fine appetite which as he said renewed itself thrice a day at least he now proposed supper and poor jack was for supper too and especially more drink champagne and seltzerwater bring champagne and seltzerwater there is nothing like it clive could not object to this entertainment which was ordered forthwith and the four young men sat down to share it  whilst florac was partaking of his favourite ecrevisses giving not only his palate but his hands his beard his mustachios and cheeks a full enjoyment of the sauce which he found so delicious he chose to revert now and again to the occurrences which had just passed and which had better perhaps have been forgotten and gaily rallied belsize upon his warlike humour if ze petit pretendu was here what would you have done wiz him jac you would croquer im like zis ecrevisse hein you would mache his bones hein  jack who had forgotten to put the seltzerwater into his champagne writhed at the idea of having barnes newcome before him and swore could he but see barnes he would take the little villains life  and but for clive jack might actually have beheld his enemy young clive after the meal went to the window with his eternal cigar and of course began to look at that other window here as he looked a carriage had at the moment driven up he saw two servants descend then two gentlemen and then he heard a wellknown voice swearing at the couriers to his credit be it said he checked the exclamation which was on his lips and when he came back to the table did not announce to kew or his righthand neighbour belsize that his uncle and barnes had arrived belsize by this time had had quite too much wine when the viscount went away poor jacks head was nodding he had been awake all the night before sleepless for how many nights previous he scarce took any notice of the frenchmans departure  lord kew remained he was for taking jack to walk and for reasoning with him further and for entering more at large than perhaps he chose to do before the two others upon this family dispute clive took a moment to whisper to lord kew my uncle and barnes are arrived dont let belsize go out for goodness sake let us get him to bed  and lest the poor fellow should take a fancy to visit his mistress by moonlight when he was safe in his room lord kew softly turned the key in mr jacks door     chapter xxx a retreat   as clive lay awake revolving the strange incidents of the day and speculating upon the tragedy in which he had been suddenly called to take a certain part a sure presentiment told him that his own happy holiday was come to an end and that the clouds and storm which he had always somehow foreboded were about to break and obscure this brief pleasant period of sunshine he rose at a very early hour flung his windows open looked out no doubt towards those other windows in the neighbouring hotel where he may have fancied he saw a curtain stirring drawn by a hand that every hour now he longed more to press he turned back into his chamber with a sort of groan and surveyed some of the relics of the last nights little feast which still remained on the table there were the champagneflasks which poor jack belsize had emptied the tall seltzerwater bottle from which the gases had issued and mingled with the hot air of the previous nights talk glasses with dregs of liquor ashes of cigars or their black stumps strewing the cloth the dead men the burst guns of yesterdays battle early as it was his neighbour j j had been up before him clive could hear him singing as was his wont when the pencil went well and the colours arranged themselves to his satisfaction over his peaceful and happy work  he pulled his own drawingtable to the window set out his board and colourbox filled a great glass from the seltzerwater bottle drank some of the vapid liquor and plunged his brushes in the rest with which he began to paint the work all went wrong there was no song for him over his labour he dashed brush and board aside after a while opened his drawers pulled out his portmanteaus from under the bed and fell to packing mechanically j j heard the noise from the next room and came in smiling with a great paintingbrush in his mouth  have the bills in j j says clive leave your cards on your friends old boy say goodbye to that pretty little strawberrygirl whose picture you have been doing polish it off today and dry the little things tears i read ppc in the stars last night and my familiar spirit came to me in a vision and said clive son of thomas put thy travellingboots on  lest any premature moralist should prepare to cry fie against the good pureminded little j j i hereby state that his strawberrygirl was a little village maiden of seven years old whose sweet little picture a bishop purchased at the next years exhibition  are you going already cries j j removing the bit out of his mouth i thought you had arranged parties for a week to come and that the princesses and the duchesses had positively forbidden the departure of your lordship  we have dallied at capua long enough says clive and the legions have the route for rome so wills hannibal the son of hasdrubal  the son of hasdrubal is quite right his companion answered the sooner we march the better i have always said it i will get all the accounts in hannibal has been living like a voluptuous carthaginian prince one two three champagnebottles there will be a deuce of a bill to pay  ah there will be a deuce of a bill to pay says clive with a groan whereof j j knew the portent for the young men had the confidence of youth one in another clive was accustomed to pour out his full heart to any crony who was near him and indeed had he spoken never a word his growing attachment to his cousin was not hard to see a hundred times and with the glowing language and feelings of youth with the fire of his twenty years with the ardour of a painter he had spoken of her and described her her magnanimous simplicity her courage and lofty scorn her kindness towards her little family her form her glorious colour of rich carnation and dazzling white her queenly grace when quiescent and in motion had constantly formed the subjects of this young gentlemans ardent eulogies as he looked at a great picture or statue as the venus of milo calm and deep unfathomably beautiful as the sea from which she sprung as he looked at the rushing aurora of the rospigliosi or the assumption of titian more bright and glorious than sunshine or that divine madonna and divine infant of dresden whose sweet faces must have shone upon raphael out of heaven his heart sang hymns as it were before these gracious altars and somewhat as he worshipped these masterpieces of his art he admired the beauty of ethel  j j felt these things exquisitely after his manner and enjoyed honest clives mode of celebration and rapturous fioriture of song but ridleys natural note was much gentler and he sang his hymns in plaintive minors ethel was all that was bright and beautiful butbut she was engaged to lord kew the shrewd kind confidant used gently to hint the sad fact to the impetuous hero of this piece the impetuous hero knew this quite well as he was sitting over his paintingboard he would break forth frequently after his manner in which laughter and sentiment were mingled and roar out with all the force of his healthy young lungs      but her heart it is anothers she nevercanbemine  and then hero and confidant would laugh each at his drawingtable miss ethel went between the two gentlemen by the name of alice grey  very likely night the grey mentor had given clive newcome the benefit of his sad counsel poor belsizes agony and the wretchedness of the young lady who shared in the desperate passion may have set our young man athinking and lord kews frankness and courage and honour whereof clive had been a witness during the night touched his heart with a generous admiration and manned him for a trial which he felt was indeed severe he thought of the dear old father ploughing the seas on the way to his duty and was determined by heavens help to do his own only three weeks since when strolling careless about bonn he had lighted upon ethel and the laughing group of little cousins he was a boy as they were thinking but of the enjoyment of the day and the sunshine as careless as those children and now the thoughts and passions which had sprung up in a week or two had given him an experience such as years do not always furnish and our friend was to show not only that he could feel love in his heart but that he could give proof of courage and selfdenial and honour  do you remember j j says he as boots and breeches went plunging into the portmanteau and with immense energy he pummels down one upon the other do you remember a dig into the snowy bosom of a dress cambric shirt my dear old fathers only campaign story of his running away a frightful blow into the ribs of a waistcoat running away at asseerghur  asseerwhat says j j wondering  the siege of asseerghur says clive fought in the eventful year 1803 lieutenant newcome who has very neat legs let me tell you which also he has imparted to his descendants had put on a new pair of leather breeches for he likes to go handsomely dressed into action his horse was shot the enemy were upon him and the governor had to choose between death and retreat i have heard his brotherofficers say that my dear old father was the bravest man they ever knew the coolest hand sir what do you think it was lieutenant newcomes duty to do under these circumstances to remain alone as he was his troop having turned about and to be cut down by the mahratta horsemento perish or to run sir  i know which i should have done says ridley  exactly lieutenant newcome adopted that course his brannew leather breeches were exceedingly tight and greatly incommoded the rapidity of his retreating movement but he ran away sir and afterwards begot your obedient servant that is the history of the battle of asseerghur  and now for the moral says j j not a little amused  j j old boy this is my battle of asseerghur i am off dip into the moneybag pay the people be generous j j but not too prodigal the chambermaid is ugly yet let her not want for a crown to console her at our departure the waiters have been brisk and servile reward the slaves for their labours forget not the humble boots so shall he bless us when we depart for artists are gentlemen though ethel does not think so denogod bless her god bless her groans out clive cramming his two fists into his eyes if ridley admired him before he thought none the worse of him now and if any generous young fellow in life reads the fable which may possibly concern him let him take a seniors counsel and remember that there are perils in our battle god help us from which the bravest had best run away  early as the morning yet was clive had a visitor and the door opened to let in lord kews honest face ridley retreated before it into his own den the appearance of earls scared the modest painter though he was proud and pleased that his clive should have their company lord kew indeed lived in more splendid apartments on the first floor of the hotel clive and his friend occupying a couple of spacious chambers on the second story you are an early bird says kew i got up myself in a panic before daylight almost jack was making a deuce of a row in his room and fit to blow the door out i have been coaxing him for this hour i wish we had thought of giving him a dose of laudanum last night if it finished him poor old boy it would do him no harm and then laughing he gave clive an account of his interview with barnes on the previous night you seem to be packing up to go too says lord kew with a momentary glance of humour darting from his keen eyes the weather is breaking up here and if you are going to cross the st gothard as the newcomes told me the sooner the better its bitter cold over the mountains in october  very cold says clive biting his nails  post or vett asks my lord  i bought a carriage at frankfort says clive in an offhand manner  hulloh cries the other who was perfectly kind and entirely frank and pleasant and showed no difference in his conversation with men of any degree except perhaps that to his inferiors in station he was a little more polite than to his equals but who would as soon have thought of a young artist leaving baden in a carriage of his own as of his riding away on a dragon  i only gave twenty pounds for the carriage its a little light thing we are two a couple of horses carry us and our traps you know and we can stop where we like i dont depend upon my profession clive added with a blush i made three guineas once and that is the only money i ever gained in my life  of course my dear fellow have not i been to your fathers house at that pretty ball and seen no end of fine people there we are young swells i know that very well we only paint for pleasure  we are artists and we intend to paint for money my lord says clive will your lordship give me an order  my lordship serves me right the other said i think newcome as you are going i think you might do some folks here a good turn though the service is rather a disagreeable one jack belsize is not fit to be left alone i cant go away from here just now for reasons of state do be a good fellow and take him with you put the alps between him and this confounded business and if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted if you will furnish me with the occasion jack does not know yet that our amiable barnes is here i know how fond you are of him i have heard the storyglass of claret and all we all love barnes how that poor lady clara can have accepted him the lord knows we are fearfully and wonderfully made especially women  good heavens clive broke out can it be possible that a young creature can have been brought to like such a selfish insolent coxcomb as that such a cocktail as barnes newcome you know very well lord kew what his life is there was a poor girl whom he brought out of a newcome factory when he was a boy himself and might have had a heart one would have thought whom he illtreated whom he deserted and flung out of doors without a penny upon some pretence of her infidelity towards him who came and actually sat down on the steps of park lane with a child on each side of her and not their cries and their hunger but the fear of his own shame and a dread of a policecourt forced him to give her a maintenance i never see the fellow but i loathe him and long to kick him out of window and this man is to marry a noble young lady because forsooth he is a partner in a bank and heir to seven or eight thousand a year oh it is a shame it is a shame it makes me sick when i think of the lot which the poor thing is to endure  it is not a nice story said lord kew rolling a cigarette barnes is not a nice man i give you that in you have not heard it talked about in the family have you  good heavens you dont suppose that i would speak to ethel to miss newcome about such a foul subject as that cries clive i never mentioned it to my own father he would have turned barnes out of his doors if he had known it  it was the talk about town i know kew said dryly everything is told in those confounded clubs i told you i give up barnes i like him no more than you do he may have treated the woman ill i suspect he has not an angelical temper but in this matter he has not been so bad so very bad as it would seem the first step is wrong of coursethose factory townsthat sort of thing you knowwell well the commencement of the business is a sad one but he is not the only sinner in london he has declared on his honour to me when the matter was talked about and he was coming on for election at bayss and was as nearly as any man i ever knew in my lifehe declared on his word that he only parted from poor mrs delacy mrs delacy the devil used to call herself because he found that she had served himas such women will serve men he offered to send his children to school in yorkshirerather a cheap schoolbut she would not part with them she made a scandal in order to get good terms and she succeeded he was anxious to break the connexion he owned it had hung like a millstone round his neck and caused him a great deal of remorseannoyance you may call it he was immensely cut up about it i remember when that fellow was hanged for murdering a woman barnes said he did not wonder at his having done it young men make those connexions in their early lives and rue them all their days after he was heartily sorry that we may take for granted he wished to lead a proper life my grandmother managed this business with the dorkings lady kew still pulls stroke oar in our boat you know and the old woman will not give up her place they know everything the elders do he is a clever fellow he is witty in his way when he likes he can make himself quite agreeable to some people there has been no sort of force you dont suppose young ladies are confined in dungeons and subject to tortures do you but there is a brood of pulleyns at chanticlere and old dorking has nothing to give them his daughter accepted barnes of her own free will he knowing perfectly well of that previous affair with jack the poor devil bursts into the place yesterday and the girl drops down in a faint she will see belsize this very day if he likes i took a note from lady dorking to him at five oclock this morning if he fancies that there is any constraint put upon lady claras actions she will tell him with her own lips that she has acted of her own free will she will marry the husband she has chosen and do her duty by him you are quite a young un who boil and froth up with indignation at the idea that a girl hardly off with an old love should take on with a new  i am not indignant with her says clive for breaking with belsize but for marrying barnes  you hate him and you know he is your enemy and indeed young fellow he does not compliment you in talking about you a pretty young scapegrace he has made you out to be and very likely thinks you to be it depends on the colours in which a fellow is painted our friends and our enemies draw usand i often think both pictures are like continued the easy worldphilosopher you hate barnes and cannot see any good in him he sees none in you there have been tremendous shindies in park lane a propos of your worship and of a subject which i dont care to mention said lord kew with some dignity and what is the upshot of all this malevolence i like you i like your father i think he is a noble old boy there are those who represented him as a sordid schemer give mr barnes the benefit of common charity at any rate and let others like him if you do not  and as for this romance of love the young nobleman went on kindling as he spoke and forgetting the slang and colloquialisms with which we garnish all our conversationthis fine picture of jenny and jessamy falling in love at first sight billing and cooing in an arbour and retiring to a cottage afterwards to go on cooing and billingpsha what folly is this it is good for romances and for misses to sigh about but any man who walks through the world with his eyes open knows how senseless is all this rubbish i dont say that a young man and woman are not to meet and to fall in love that instant and to marry that day year and love each other till they are a hundred that is the supreme lotbut that is the lot which the gods only grant to baucis and philemon and a very very few besides as for the rest they must compromise make themselves as comfortable as they can and take the good and the bad together and as for jenny and jessamy by jove look round among your friends count up the love matches and see what has been the end of most of them love in a cottage who is to pay the landlord for the cottage who is to pay for jennys tea and cream and jessamys muttonchops if he has cold mutton he will quarrel with her if there is nothing in the cupboard a pretty meal they make no you cry out against people in our world making money marriages why kings and queens marry on the same understanding my butcher has saved a stockingful of money and marries his daughter to a young salesman mr and mrs salesman prosper in life and get an aldermans daughter for their son my attorney looks out amongst his clients for an eligible husband for miss deeds sends his son to the bar into parliament where he cuts a figure and becomes attorneygeneral makes a fortune has a house in belgrave square and marries miss deeds of the second generation to a peer do not accuse us of being more sordid than our neighbours we do but as the world does and a girl in our society accepts the best party which offers itself just as miss chummey when entreated by two young gentlemen of the order of costermongers inclines to the one who rides from market on a moke rather than to the gentleman who sells his greens from a handbasket  this tirade which his lordship delivered with considerable spirit was intended no doubt to carry a moral for clives private hearing and which to do him justice the youth was not slow to comprehend the point was young man if certain persons of rank choose to receive you very kindly who have but a comely face good manners and three or four hundred pounds a year do not presume upon their goodnature or indulge in certain ambitious hopes which your vanity may induce you to form sail down the stream with the brasspots master earthenpot but beware of coming too near you are a nice young man but there are prizes which are some too good for you and are meant for your betters and you might as well ask the prime minister for the next vacant garter as expect to wear on your breast such a star as ethel newcome  before clive made his accustomed visit to his friends at the hotel opposite the last great potentiary had arrived who was to take part in the family congress of baden in place of ethels flushing cheeks and bright eyes clive found on entering lady anne newcomes sittingroom the parchmentcovered features and the wellknown hooked beak of the old countess of kew to support the glances from beneath the bushy black eyebrows on each side of that promontory was no pleasant matter the whole family cowered under lady kews eyes and nose and she ruled by force of them it was only ethel whom these awful features did not utterly subdue and dismay  besides lady kew clive had the pleasure of finding his lordship her grandson lady anne and children of various sizes and mr barnes not one of whom was the person whom clive desired to behold  the queer glance in kews eye directed towards clive who was himself not by any means deficient in perception informed him that there had just been a conversation in which his own name had figured having been abusing clive extravagantly as he did whenever he mentioned his cousins name barnes must needs hang his head when the young fellow came in his hand was yet on the chamberdoor and barnes was calling his miscreant and scoundrel within so no wonder barnes had a hangdog look but as for lady kew that veteran diplomatist allowed no signs of discomfiture or any other emotion to display themselves on her ancient countenance her bushy eyebrows were groves of mystery her unfathomable eyes were wells of gloom  she gratified clive by a momentary loan of two knuckly old fingers which he was at liberty to hold or to drop and then he went on to enjoy the felicity of shaking hands with mr barnes who observing and enjoying his confusion over lady kews reception determined to try clive in the same way and he gave clive at the same time a supercilious how de dah which the other would have liked to drive down his throat a constant desire to throttle mr barnesto beat him on the noseto send him flying out of window was a sentiment with which this singular young man inspired many persons whom he accosted a biographer ought to be impartial yet i own in a modified degree to have partaken of this sentiment he looked very much younger than his actual time of life and was not of commanding stature but patronised his equals nay let us say his betters so insufferably that a common wish for his suppression existed amongst many persons in society  clive told me of this little circumstance and i am sorry to say of his own subsequent ill behaviour we were standing apart from the ladies so clive narrated when barnes and i had our little passageofarms he had tried the finger business upon me before and i had before told him either to shake hands or to leave it alone you know the way in which the impudent little beggar stands astride and sticks his little feet out i brought my heel well down on his confounded little varnished toe and gave it a scrunch which made mr barnes shriek out one of his loudest oaths  d clumsy  screamed out barnes  clive said in a low voice i thought you only swore at women barnes  it is you that say things before women clive cries his cousin looking very furious  mr clive lost all patience in what company barnes would you like me to say that i think you are a snob will you have it on the parade come out and i will speak to you  barnes cant go out on the parade cries lord kew bursting out laughing theres another gentleman there wanting him and two of the three young men enjoyed this joke exceedingly i doubt whether barnes newcome newcome esq of newcome was one of the persons amused  what wickedness are you three boys laughing at cries lady anne perfectly innocent and goodnatured no good i will be bound come here clive our young friend it must be premised had no sooner received the thrust of lady kews two fingers on entering than it had been intimated to him that his interview with that gracious lady was at an end for she had instantly called her daughter to her with whom her ladyship fell awhispering and then it was that clive retreated from lady kews hand to fall into barness  clive trod on barness toe cries out cheery lord kew and has hurt barness favourite corn so that he cannot go out and is actually obliged to keep the room thats what we were laughing at  hem growled lady kew she knew to what her grandson alluded lord kew had represented jack belsize and his thundering big stick in the most terrific colours to the family council the joke was too good a one not to serve twice  lady anne in her whispered conversation with the old countess had possibly deprecated her mothers anger towards poor clive for when he came up to the two ladies the younger took his hand with great kindness and said my dear clive we are very sorry you are going you were of the greatest use to us on the journey i am sure you have been uncommonly goodnatured and obliging and we shall all miss you very much her gentleness smote the generous young fellow and an emotion of gratitude towards her for being so compassionate to him in his misery caused his cheeks to blush and his eyes perhaps to moisten thank you dear aunt says he you have been very good and kind to me it is i that shall feel lonely butbut it is quite time that i should go to my work  quite time said the severe possessor of the eagle beak baden is a bad place for young men they make acquaintances here of which very little good can come they frequent the gamblingtables and live with the most disreputable french viscounts we have heard of your goingson sir it is a great pity that colonel newcome did not take you with him to india  my dear mamma cries lady anne i am sure clive has been a very good boy indeed the old ladys morality put a stop to clives pathetic mood and he replied with a great deal of spirit dear lady anne you have been always very good and kindness is nothing surprising from you but lady kews advice which i should not have ventured to ask is an unexpected favour my father knows the extent of the gambling transactions to which your ladyship was pleased to allude and introduced me to the gentleman whose acquaintance you dont seem to think eligible  my good young man i think it is time you were off lady kew said this time with great goodhumour she liked clives spirit and as long as he interfered with none of her plans was quite disposed to be friendly with him go to rome go to florence go wherever you like and study very hard and make very good pictures and come back again and we shall all be very glad to see you you have very great talentsthese sketches are really capital  is not he very clever mamma said kind lady anne eagerly clive felt the pathetic mood coming on again and an immense desire to hug lady anne in his arms and to kiss her how grateful are wehow touched a frank and generous heart is for a kind word extended to us in our pain the pressure of a tender hand nerves a man for an operation and cheers him for the dreadful interview with the surgeon  that cool old operator who had taken mr clives case in hand now produced her shining knife and executed the first cut with perfect neatness and precision we are come here as i suppose you know mr newcome upon family matters and i frankly tell you that i think for your own sake you would be much better away i wrote my daughter a great scolding when i heard that you were in this place  but it was by the merest chance mamma indeed it was cries lady anne  of course by the merest chance and by the merest chance i heard of it too a little bird came and told me at kissingen you have no more sense anne than a goose i have told you so a hundred times lady anne requested you to stay and i my good young friend request you to go away  i needed no request said clive my going lady kew is my own act i was going without requiring any guide to show me to the door  no doubt you were and my arrival is the signal for mr newcomes bon jour i am bogey and i frighten everybody away by the scene which you witnessed yesterday my good young friend and all that painful esclandre on the promenade you must see how absurd and dangerous and wickedyes wicked it is for parents to allow intimacies to spring up between young people which can only lead to disgrace and unhappiness lady dorking was another goodnatured goose i had not arrived yesterday ten minutes when my maid came running in to tell me of what had occurred on the promenade and tired as i was i went that instant to jane dorking and passed the evening with her and that poor little creature to whom captain belsize behaved so cruelly she does not care a fig for himnot one fig her childish inclination is passed away these two years whilst mr jack was performing his feats in prison and if the wretch flatters himself that it was on his account she was agitated yesterday he is perfectly mistaken and you may tell him lady kew said so she is subject to fainting fits dr finck has been attending her ever since she has been here she fainted only last tuesday at the sight of a rat walking about their lodgings they have dreadful lodgings the dorkings and no wonder she was frightened at the sight of that great coarse tipsy wretch she is engaged as you know to your connexion my grandson barnesin all respects a most eligible union the rank of life of the parties suits them to one another she is a good young woman and barnes has experienced from persons of another sort such horrors that he will know the blessing of domestic virtue it was high time he should i say all this in perfect frankness to you  go back again and play in the garden little brats this to the innocents who came frisking in from the lawn in front of the windows you have been and barnes sent you in here go up to miss quigley no stop go and tell ethel to come down bring her down with you do you understand  the unconscious infants toddle upstairs to their sister and lady kew blandly says ethels engagement to my grandson lord kew has long been settled in our family though these things are best not talked about until they are quite determined you know my dear mr newcome when we saw you and your father in london we heard that you toothat you too were engaged to a young lady in your own rank of life a misswhat was her namemiss macpherson miss mackenzie your aunt mrs hobson newcome who i must say is a most blundering silly person had set about this story it appears there is no truth in it do not look surprised that i know about your affairs i am an old witch and know numbers of things  and indeed how lady kew came to know this fact whether her maid corresponded with lady annes maid what her ladyships means of information were avowed or occult this biographer has never been able to ascertain very likely ethel who in these last three weeks had been made aware of that interesting circumstance had announced it to lady kew in the course of a crossexamination and there may have been a battle between the granddaughter and the grandmother of which the family chronicler of the newcomes has had no precise knowledge that there were many such i knowskirmishes sieges and general engagements when we hear the guns and see the wounded we know there has been a fight who knows had there been a battleroyal and was miss newcome having her wounds dressed upstairs  you will like to say goodbye to your cousin i know lady kew continued with imperturbable placidity ethel my dear here is mr clive newcome who has come to bid us all goodbye the little girls came trotting down at this moment each holding a skirt of their elder sister she looked rather pale but her expression was haughtyalmost fierce  clive rose up as she entered from the sofa by the old countesss side which place she had pointed him to take during the amputation he rose up and put his hair back off his face and said very calmly yes im come to say goodbye my holidays are over and ridley and i are off for rome goodbye and god bless you ethel  she gave him her hand and said goodbye clive but her hand did not return his pressure and dropped to her side when he let it go  hearing the words goodbye little alice burst into a howl and little maude who was an impetuous little thing stamped her little red shoes and said it sant be goodbye tlive sant go alice roaring clung hold of clives trousers he took them up gaily each on an arm as he had done a hundred times and tossed the children on to his shoulders where they used to like to pull his yellow mustachios he kissed the little hands and faces and a moment after was gone  quastu says m de florac meeting him going over the bridge to his own hotel quastu mon petit claive estce quon vient de tarracher une dent  cest ca says clive and walked into the hotel de france hulloh j j ridley he sang out order the trap out and lets be off i thought we were not to march till tomorrow says j j divining perhaps that some catastrophe had occurred indeed mr clive was going a day sooner than he had intended he woke at fribourg the next morning it was the grand old cathedral he looked at not baden of the pineclad hills of the pretty walks and the limetree avenues not baden the prettiest booth of all vanity fair the crowds and the music the gamblingtables and the cadaverous croupiers and chinking gold were far out of sight and hearing there was one window in the hotel de hollande that he thought of how a fair arm used to open it in the early morning how the muslin curtain in the morning air swayed to and fro he would have given how much to see it once more walking about at fribourg in the night away from his companions he had thought of ordering horses galloping back to baden and once again under that window calling ethel ethel but he came back to his room and the quiet j j and to poor jack belsize who had had his tooth taken out too  we had almost forgotten jack who took a back seat in clives carriage as befits a secondary personage in this history and clive in truth had almost forgotten him too but jack having his own cares and business and having rammed his own carpetbag brought it down without a word and clive found him environed in smoke when he came down to take his place in the little britzska i wonder whether the window at the hotel de hollande saw him go there are some curtains behind which no historian however prying is allowed to peep  tiens le petit part says florac of the cigar who was always sauntering yes we go says clive there is a fourth place viscount will you come too  i would love it well replies florac but i am here in faction my cousin and seigneur m le duc divry is coming all the way from bagneres de bigorre he says he counts on meaffaires mon cher affaires detat  how pleased the duchess will be easy with that bag shouts clive how pleased the princess will be in truth he hardly knew what he was saying  vous croyez vous croyez says m de florac as you have a fourth place i know who had best take it  and who is that asked the young traveller  lord kew and barnes esq of newcome came out of the hotel de hollande at this moment barnes slunk back seeing jack belsizes hairy face kew ran over the bridge goodbye clive goodbye jack goodbye kew it was a great handshake away goes the postillion blowing his horn and young hannibal has left capua behind him     chapter xxxi madame la duchesse   in one of clive newcomes letters from baden the young man described to me with considerable humour and numerous illustrations as his wont was a great lady to whom he was presented at that wateringplace by his friend lord kew lord kew had travelled in the east with monsieur le duc and madame la duchesse divrythe prince being an old friend of his lordships family he is the q of madame divrys book of travels footprints of the gazelles by a daughter of the crusaders in which she prays so fervently for lord kews conversion he is the q who rescued the princess from the arabs and performed many a feat which lives in her glowing pages he persists in saying that he never rescued madame la princesse from any arabs at all except from one beggar who was bawling out for bucksheesh and whom kew drove away with a stick they made pilgrimages to all the holy places and a piteous sight it was said lord kew to see the old prince in the jerusalem processions at easter pacing with bare feet and a candle here lord kew separated from the princes party his name does not occur in the last part of the footprints which in truth are filled full of strange rhapsodies adventures which nobody was but the princess and mystic disquisitions she hesitates at nothing like other poets of her nation not profoundly learned she invents where she has not acquired mingles together religion and the opera and performs parisian pasdeballet before the gates of monasteries and the cells of anchorites she describes as if she had herself witnessed the catastrophe the passage of the red sea and as if there were no doubt of the transaction an unhappy loveaffair between pharaohs eldest son and mosess daughter at cairo apropos of josephs granaries she enters into a furious tirade against putiphar whom she paints as an old savage suspicious and a tyrant they generally have a copy of the footprints of the gazelles at the circulating library at baden as madame divry constantly visits that wateringplace m le duc was not pleased with the book which was published entirely without his concurrence and which he described as one of the ten thousand follies of madame la duchesse  this nobleman was fiveandforty years older than his duchess france is the country where that sweet christian institution of mariages de convenance which so many folks of the family about which this story treats are engaged in arranging is most in vogue there the newspapers daily announce that m de foy has a bureau de confiance where families may arrange marriages for their sons and daughters in perfect comfort and security it is but a question of money on one side and the other mademoiselle has so many francs of dot monsieur has such and such rentes or lands in possession or reversion an etude davoue a shop with a certain clientele bringing him such and such an income which may be doubled by the judicious addition of so much capital and the pretty little matrimonial arrangement is concluded the agent touching his percentage or broken off and nobody unhappy and the world none the wiser the consequences of the system i do not pretend personally to know but if the light literature of a country is a reflex of its manners and french novels are a picture of french life a pretty society must that be into the midst of which the london reader may walk in twelve hours from this time of perusal and from which only twenty miles of sea separate us  when the old duke divry of the ancient ancient nobility of france an emigrant with artois a warrior with conde an exile during the reign of the corsican usurper a grand prince a great nobleman afterwards though shorn of nineteentwentieths of his wealth by the revolutionwhen the duke divry lost his two sons and his sons son likewise died as if fate had determined to end the direct line of that noble house which had furnished queens to europe and renowned chiefs to the crusadersbeing of an intrepid spirit the duke was ill disposed to yield to his redoubtable energy in spite of the cruel blows which the latter had inflicted upon him and when he was more than sixty years of age three months before the july revolution broke out a young lady of a sufficient nobility a virgin of sixteen was brought out of the convent of the sacre coeur at paris and married with immense splendour and ceremony to this princely widower the most august names signed the book of the civil marriage madame la dauphine and madame la duchesse de berri complimented the young bride with royal favours her portrait by dubufe was in the exhibition next year a charming young duchess indeed with black eyes and black ringlets pearls on her neck and diamonds in her hair as beautiful as a princess of a fairy tale m divry whose early life may have been rather oragious was yet a gentleman perfectly well conserved resolute against fate his enemy one would fancy fate was of an aristocratic turn and took especial delight in combats with princely houses the atridae the borbonidae the ivrysthe browns and joneses being of no account the prince seemed to be determined not only to secure a progeny but to defy age at sixty he was still young or seemed to be so his hair was as black as the princesss own his teeth as white if you saw him on the boulevard de gand sunning among the youthful exquisites there or riding au bois with a grace worthy of old franconi himself you would take him for one of the young men of whom indeed up to his marriage he retained a number of the graceful follies and amusements though his manners had a dignity acquired in old days of versailles and the trianon which the moderns cannot hope to imitate he was as assiduous behind the scenes of the opera as any journalist or any young dandy of twenty years he ranged himself as the french phrase is shortly before his marriage just like any other young bachelor took leave of phryne and aspasie in the coulisses and proposed to devote himself henceforth to his charming young wife  the affreux catastrophe of july arrived the ancient bourbons were once more on the road to exile save one wily old remnant of the race who rode grinning over the barricades and distributing poignees de main to the stout fists that had pummelled his family out of france m le duc divry who lost his place at court his appointments which helped his income very much and his peerage would no more acknowledge the usurper of neuilly than him of elba the expeer retired to his terres he barricaded his house in paris against all supporters of the citizen king his nearest kinsman m de florac among the rest who for his part cheerfully took his oath of fidelity and his seat in louis philippes house of peers having indeed been accustomed to swear to all dynasties for some years past  in due time madame la duchesse divry gave birth to a child a daughter whom her noble father received with but small pleasure what the duke desired was an heir to his name a prince of moncontour to fill the place of the sons and grandsons gone before him to join their ancestors in the tomb no more children however blessed the old dukes union madame divry went the round of all the wateringplaces pilgrimages were tried vows and gifts to all saints supposed to be favourable to the divry family or to families in generalbut the saints turned a deaf ear they were inexorable since the true religion and the elder bourbons were banished from france  living by themselves in their ancient castles or their dreary mansion of the faubourg st germain i suppose the duke and duchess grew tried of one another as persons who enter into a mariage de convenance sometimes nay as those who light a flaming lovematch and run away with one another will be found to do a lady of oneandtwenty and a gentleman of sixtysix alone in a great castle have not unfrequently a third guest at their table who comes without a card and whom they cannot shut out though they keep their doors closed ever so his name is ennui and many a long hour and weary night must such folks pass in the unbidden society of this old man of the sea this daily guest at the board this watchful attendant at the fireside this assiduous companion who will walk out with you this sleepless restless bedfellow  at first m divry that wellconserved nobleman who never would allow that he was not young exhibited no sign of doubt regarding his own youth except an extreme jealousy and avoidance of all other young fellows very likely madame la duchesse may have thought men in general dyed their hair wore stays and had the rheumatism coming out of the convent of the sacre coeur how was the innocent young lady to know better you see in these mariages de convenance though a coronet may be convenient to a beautiful young creature and a beautiful young creature may be convenient to an old gentleman there are articles which the marriagemonger cannot make to convene at all tempers over which m de foy and his like have no control and tastes which cannot be put into the marriage settlements so this couple were unhappy and the duke and duchess quarrelled with one another like the most vulgar pair who ever fought across a table  in this unhappy state of home affairs madame took to literature monsieur to politics she discovered that she was a great unappreciated soul and when a woman finds that treasure in her bosom of course she sets her own price on the article did you ever see the first poems of madame la duchesse divry les cris de lame she used to read them to her very intimate friends in white with her hair a good deal down her back they had some success dubufe having painted her as a duchess scheffer depicted her as a muse that was in the third year of her marriage when she rebelled against the duke her husband insisted on opening her saloons to art and literature and a fervent devotee still proposed to unite genius and religion poets had interviews with her musicians came and twanged guitars to her  her husband entering her room would fall over the sabre and spurs of count almaviva from the boulevard or don basilio with his great sombrero and shoebuckles the old gentleman was breathless and bewildered in following her through all her vagaries he was of old france she of new what did he know of the ecole romantique and these jeunes gens with their marie tudors and tours de nesle and sanguineous histories of queens who sewed their lovers into sacks emperors who had interviews with robber captains in charlemagnes tomb buridans and hernanis and stuff monsieur le vicomte de chateaubriand was a man of genius as a writer certainly immortal and m de lamartine was a young man extremely bien pensant but ma foi give him crebillon fils or a bonne farce of m vade to make laugh for the great sentiments for the beautiful style give him m de lormian although bonapartist or the abbe de lille and for the new school bah these little dumass and hugos and mussets what is all that m de lormian shall be immortal monsieur he would say when all these freluquets are forgotten after his marriage he frequented the coulisses of the opera no more but he was a pretty constant attendant at the theatre francais where you might hear him snoring over the chefsdoeuvres of french tragedy  for some little time after 1830 the duchesse was as great a carlist as her husband could wish and they conspired together very comfortably at first of an adventurous turn eager for excitement of all kinds nothing would have better pleased the duchesse than to follow madame in her adventurous courses in la vendee disguised as a boy above all she was persuaded to stay at home however and aid the good cause at paris while monsieur le duc went off to brittany to offer his old sword to the mother of his king but madame was discovered up the chimney at rennes and all sorts of things were discovered afterwards the world said that our silly little duchess of paris was partly the cause of the discovery spies were put upon her and to some people she would tell anything m le duc on paying his annual visit to august exiles at goritz was very badly received madame la dauphine gave him a sermon he had an awful quarrel with madame la duchesse on returning to paris he provoked monsieur le comte tiercelin le beau tiercelin an officer of ordonnance of the duke of orleans into a duel a propos of a cup of coffee in a salon he actually wounded the beau tiercelinhe sixtyfive years of age his nephew m de florac was loud in praise of his kinsmans bravery  that pretty figure and complexion which still appear so captivating in m dubufes portrait of madame la duchesse divry have long existedit must be owned only in paint je la prefere a lhuile the vicomte de florac said of his cousin she should get her blushes from monsieur dubufethose of her present furnishers are not near so natural sometimes the duchess appeared with these postiches roses sometimes of a mortal paleness sometimes she looked plump on other occasions wofully thin when she goes into the world said the same chronicler ma cousine surrounds herself with juponscest pour defendre sa vertu when she is in a devotional mood she gives up rouge roast meat

song her cave is jonchee with the bones of her victims be you not one  far from causing clive to avoid madame la duchesse these cautions very likely would have made him only the more eager to make her acquaintance but that a much nobler attraction drew him elsewhere at first being introduced to madame divrys salon he was pleased and flattered and behaved himself there merrily and agreeably enough he had not studied horace vernet for nothing he drew a fine picture of kew rescuing her from the arabs with a plenty of sabres pistols burnouses and dromedaries he made a pretty sketch of her little girl antoinette and a wonderful likeness of miss ogrady the little girls governess the mothers dame de compagniemiss ogrady with the richest milesian brogue who had been engaged to give antoinette the pure english accent but the french ladys great eyes and painted smiles would not bear comparison with ethels natural brightness and beauty clive who had been appointed painter in ordinary to the queen of scots neglected his business and went over to the english faction so did one or two more of the princesss followers leaving her majesty by no means well pleased at their desertion  there had been many quarrels between m divry and his nextofkin political differences private differencesa long story the duke who had been wild himself could not pardon the vicomte de florac for being wild efforts at reconciliation had been made which ended unsuccessfully the vicomte de florac had been allowed for a brief space to be intimate with the chief of his family and then had been dismissed for being too intimate right or wrong the duke was jealous of all young men who approached the duchesse he is suspicious madame de florac indignantly said because he remembers and he thinks other men are like himself the vicomte discreetly said my cousin has paid me the compliment to be jealous of me and acquiesced in his banishment with a shrug  during the emigration the old lord kew had been very kind to exiles m divry amongst the number and that nobleman was anxious to return to all lord kews family when they came to france the hospitality which he had received himself in england he still remembered or professed to remember lady kews beauty how many women are there awful of aspect at present of whom the same pleasing legend is not narrated it must be true for do not they themselves confess it i know of few things more remarkable or suggestive of philosophic contemplation than those physical changes  when the old duke and the old countess met together and talked confidentially their conversation bloomed into a jargon wonderful to hear old scandals woke up old naughtinesses rose out of their graves and danced and smirked and gibbered again like those wicked nuns whom bertram and robert le diable evoke from their sepulchres whilst the bassoon performs a diabolical incantation the brighton pavilion was tenanted ranelagh and the pantheon swarmed with dancers and masks perdita was found again and walked a minuet with the prince of wales mrs clarke and the duke of york danced togethera pretty dance the old duke wore a jabot and ailesdepigeon the old countess a hoop and a cushion on her head if haply the young folks came in the elders modified their recollections and lady kew brought honest old king george and good old ugly queen charlotte to the rescue her ladyship was sister of the marquis of steyne and in some respects resembled that lamented nobleman their family had relations in france lady kew had always a piedaterre at paris a bitter little scandalshop where les bien pensants assembled and retailed the most awful stories against the reigning dynasty it was she who handed over le petit kiou when quite a boy to monsieur and madame divry to be lanced into parisian society he was treated as a son of the family by the duke one of whose many christian names his lordship francis george xavier earl of kew and viscount walham bears if lady kew hated any one and she could hate very considerably she hated her daughterinlaw walhams widow and the methodists who surrounded her kew remain among a pack of psalmsinging old women and parsons with his mother fi donc frank was lady kews boy she would form him marry him leave him her money if he married to her liking and show him life and so she showed it to him  have you taken your children to the national gallery in london and shown them the marriage a la mode was the artist exceeding the privilege of his calling in painting the catastrophe in which those guilty people all suffer if this fable were not true if many and many of your young men of pleasure had not acted it and rued the moral i would tear the page you know that in our nursery tales there is commonly a good fairy to counsel and a bad one to mislead the young prince you perhaps feel that in your own life there is a good principle imploring you to come into its kind bosom and a bad passion which tempts you into its arms be of easy minds goodnatured people let us disdain surprises and coupsdetheatre for once and tell those good souls who are interested about him that there is a good spirit coming to the rescue of our young lord kew  surrounded by her court and royal attendants la reine marie used graciously to attend the playtable where luck occasionally declared itself for and against her majesty her appearance used to create not a little excitement in the saloon of roulette the game which she patronised it being more fertile of emotions than the slower trenteetquarante she dreamed of numbers had favourite incantations by which to conjure them noted the figures made by peels of peaches and so forth the numbers of houses on hackneycoacheswas superstitious comme toutes les rimes poetiques she commonly brought a beautiful agate bonbonniere full of gold pieces when she played it was wonderful to see her grimaces to watch her behaviour her appeals to heaven her delight and despair madame la baronne de la cruchecassee played on one side of her madame la comtesse de schlanigenbad on the other when she had lost all her money her majesty would condescend to borrownot from those ladiesknowing the royal peculiarity they never had any money they always lost they swiftly pocketed their winnings and never left a mass on the table or quitted it as courtiers will when they saw luck was going against their sovereign the officers of her household were count punter a hanoverian the cavaliere spada captain blackball of a mysterious english regiment which might be any one of the hundred and twenty in the army list and other noblemen and gentlemen greeks russians and spaniards mr and mrs jones of england who had made the princesss acquaintance at bagneres where her lord still remained in the gout and perseveringly followed her all the way to baden were dazzled by the splendour of the company in which they found themselves miss jones wrote such letters to her dearest friend miss thompson cambridge square london as caused that young person to crever with envy bob jones who had grown a pair of mustachios since he left home began to think slightingly of poor little fanny thompson now he had got into the best continental society might not he quarter a countesss coat on his brougham along with the jones arms or more slapup still have the two shields painted on the panels with the coronet over do you know the princess calls herself the queen of scots and she calls me julian avenel says jones delighted to clive who wrote me about the transmogrification of our schoolfellow an attorneys son whom i recollected a snivelling little boy at grey friars i say newcome the princess is going to establish an order cried bob in ecstasy every one of her aidesdecamp had a bunch of orders at his button excepting of course poor jones  like all persons who beheld her when miss newcome and her party made their appearance at baden monsieur de florac was enraptured with her beauty i speak of it constantly before the duchesse i know it pleases her so the vicomte said you should have seen her looks when your friend m jones praised miss newcome she ground her teeth with fury tiens ce petit sournois de kiou he always spoke of her as a mere sac dargent that he was about to marryan ingot of the citeune fille de lord maire have all english bankers such pearls of daughters if the vicomtesse de florac had but quitted the earth dont elle fait lornementi would present myself to the charmante meess and ride a steeplechase with kiou that he should win it the viscount never doubted  when lady anne newcome first appeared in the ballroom at baden madame la duchesse divry begged the earl of kew notre filleul she called him to present her to his aunt miladi and her charming daughter my filleul had not prepared me for so much grace she said turning a look towards lord kew which caused his lordship some embarrassment her kindness and graciousness were extreme her caresses and compliments never ceased all the evening she told the mother and the daughter too that she had never seen any one so lovely as ethel whenever she saw lady annes children in the walks she ran to them so that captain blackball and count punter adc were amazed at her tenderness she etouffed them with kisses what lilies and roses what lovely little creatures what companions for her own antoinette this is your governess miss quigli mademoiselle you must let me present you to miss ogredi your compatriot and i hope your children will be always together the irish protestant governess scowled at the irish catholicthere was a boyne water between them  little antoinette a lonely little girl was glad to find any companions mamma kisses me on the promenade she told them in her artless way she never kisses me at home one day when lord kew with florac and clive were playing with the children antoinette said pourquoi ne venezvous plus chez nous m de kew and why does mamma say you are a lache she said so yesterday to ces messieurs and why does mamma say thou art only a vaurien mon cousin thou art always very good for me i love thee better than all those messieurs ma tante florac a ete bonne pour moi a paris aussiah quelle a ete bonne  cest que les anges aiment bien les petits cherubins and my mother is an angel seest thou cries florac kissing her  thy mother is not dead said little antoinette then why dost thou cry my cousin and the three spectators were touched by this little scene and speech  lady anne newcome received the caresses and compliments of madame la duchesse with marked coldness on the part of one commonly so very goodnatured ethels instinct told her that there was something wrong in this woman and she shrank from her with haughty reserve the girls conduct was not likely to please the french lady but she never relaxed in her smiles and her compliments her caresses and her professions of admiration she was present when clara pulleyn fell and prodigal of calineries and consolation and shawls and scentbottles to the unhappy young lady she would accompany her home she inquired perpetually after the health of cette pauvre petite miss clara oh how she railed against ces anglaises and their prudery can you fancy her and her circle the teatable set in the twilight that evening the court assembled madame de la cruchecassee and madame de schlangenbad and their whiskered humble servants baron punter and count spada and marquis iago and prince iachimo and worthy captain blackball can you fancy a moonlight conclave and ghouls feasting on the fresh corpse of a reputationthe gibes and sarcasms the laughing and the gnashing of teeth how they tear the dainty limbs and relish the tender morsels  the air of this place is not good for you believe me my little kew it is dangerous have pressing affairs in england let your chateau burn down or your intendant run away and pursue him partez mon petit kiou partez or evil will come of it such was the advice which a friend of lord kew gave the young nobleman     chapter xxxii barness courtship   ethel had made various attempts to become intimate with her future sisterinlaw had walked and ridden and talked with lady clara before barness arrival she had come away not very much impressed with respect for lady claras mental powers indeed we have said that miss ethel was rather more prone to attack women than to admire them and was a little hard upon the fashionable young persons of her acquaintance and sex in after life care and thought subdued her pride and she learned to look at society more goodnaturedly but at this time and for some years after she was impatient of commonplace people and did not choose to conceal her scorn lady clara was very much afraid of her those timid little thoughts which would come out and frisk and gambol with pretty graceful antics and advance confidingly at the sound of jack belsizes jolly voice and nibble crumbs out of his hand shrank away before ethel severe nymph with the bright eyes and hid themselves under the thickets and in the shade who has not overheard a simple couple of girls or of lovers possibly pouring out their little hearts laughing at their own little jokes prattling and prattling away unceasingly until mamma appears with her awful didactic countenance or the governess with her dry moralities and the colloquy straightway ceases the laughter stops the chirp of the harmless little birds is hushed lady clara being of a timid nature stood in as much awe of ethel as of her father and mother whereas her next sister a brisk young creature of seventeen who was of the order of romps or tomboys was by no means afraid of miss newcome and indeed a much greater favourite with her than her placid elder sister  young ladies may have been crossed in love and have had their sufferings their frantic moments of grief and tears their wakeful nights and so forth but it is only in very sentimental novels that people occupy themselves perpetually with that passion and i believe what are called broken hearts are very rare articles indeed tom is jiltedis for a while in a dreadful statebores all his male acquaintance with his groans and his frenzyrallies from the complainteats his dinner very kindlytakes an interest in the next turf event and is found at newmarket as usual bawling out the odds which he will give or take miss has her

and ten times quicker than lucy who is dancing with the majorreplies in an animated manner to the captains delightful remarkstakes a little supperand looks quite kindly at him before she pulls up the carriage windows  clive may not like his cousin barnes newcome and many other men share in that antipathy but all ladies do not it is a fact that barnes when he likes can make himself a very pleasant fellow he is dreadfully satirical that is certain but many persons are amused by those dreadful satirical young men and to hear fun made of our neighbours even of some of our friends does not make us very angry barnes is one of the very best waltzers in all society that is the truth whereas it must be confessed some one else was very heavy and slow his great foot always crushing you and he always begging your pardon barnes whirls a partner round a room ages after she is ready to faint what wicked fun he makes of other people when he stops he is not handsome but in his face there is something oddlooking and distinguished it is certain he has beautiful small feet and hands  he comes every day from the city drops in in his quiet unobtrusive way and drinks tea at five oclock always brings a budget of the funniest stories with him makes mamma laugh clara laugh henrietta who is in the schoolroom still die of laughing papa has the highest opinion of mr newcome as a man of business if he had had such a friend in early life his affairs would not be where they now are poor dear kind papa do they want to go anywhere is not mr newcome always ready did he not procure that delightful room for them to witness the lord mayors show and make clara die of laughing at those odd city people at the mansion house ball he is at every party and never tired though he gets up so early he waltzes with nobody else he is always there to put lady clara in the carriage at the drawingroom he looked quite handsome in his uniform of the newcome hussars bottlegreen and silver lace he speaks politics so exceedingly well with papa and gentlemen after dinner he is a sound conservative full of practical good sense and information with no dangerous newfangled ideas such as young men have when poor dear sir brian newcomes health gives way quite mr newcome will go into parliament and then he will resume the old barony which has been in abeyance in the family since the reign of richard the third they had fallen quite quite low mr newcomes grandfather came to london with a satchel on his back like whittington isnt it romantic  this process has been going on for months it is not in one day that poor lady clara has been made to forget the past and to lay aside her mourning day after day very likely the undeniable faults and many peccadilloes ofof that other person have been exposed to her people around the young lady may desire to spare her feelings but can have no interest in screening poor jack from condign reprobation a wild prodigala disgrace to his ordera son of old highgates leading such a life and making such a scandal lord dorking believes mr belsize to be an abandoned monster and fiend in human shape gathers and relates all the stories that ever have been told to the young mans disadvantage and of these be sure there are enough and speaks of him with transports of indignation at the end of months of unwearied courtship mr barnes newcome is honestly accepted and lady clara is waiting for him at baden not unhappy to receive him when walking on the promenade with her father the ghost of her dead love suddenly rises before her and the young lady faints to the ground  when barnes newcome thinks fit he can be perfectly placable in his demeanour and delicate in his conduct what he said upon this painful subject was delivered with the greatest propriety he did not for one moment consider that lady claras agitation arose from any present feeling in mr belsizes favour but that she was naturally moved by the remembrance of the past and the sudden appearance which recalled it and but that a ladys name should never be made the subject of dispute between men newcome said to lord dorking with great dignity and that captain belsize has opportunely quitted the place i should certainly have chastised him he and another adventurer against whom i have had to warn my own family have quitted baden this afternoon i am glad that both are gone captain belsize especially for my temper my lord is hot and i do not think i should have commanded it  lord kew when the elder lord informed him of this admirable speech of barnes newcomes upon whose character prudence and dignity the earl of dorking pronounced a fervent eulogium shook his head gravely and said yes barnes was a dead shot and a most determined fellow and did not burst out laughing until he and lord dorking had parted then to be sure he took his fill of laughter he told the story to ethel he complimented barnes on his heroic selfdenial the joke of the thundering big stick was nothing to it barnes newcome laughed too he had plenty of humour barnes i think you might have whopped jack when he came out from his interview with the dorkings kew said the poor devil was so bewildered and weak that alfred might have thrashed him at other times you would find it more difficult barnes my man mr b newcome resumed his dignity said a joke was a joke and there was quite enough of this one which assertion we may be sure he conscientiously made  that meeting and parting between the old lovers passed with a great deal of calm and propriety on both sides misss parents of course were present when jack at their summons waited upon them and their daughter and made his hangdog bow my lord dorking said poor jack in the anguish of his heart had poured out the story to clive newcome afterwards mr belsize i have to apologise for words which i used in my heat yesterday and which i recall and regret as i am sure you do that there should have been any occasion for them  mr belsize looking at the carpet said he was very sorry  lady dorking here remarked that as captain belsize was now at baden he might wish to hear from lady clara pulleyns own lips that the engagement into which she had entered was formed by herself certainly with the consent and advice of her family is it not so my dear  lady clara said yes mamma with a low curtsey  we have now to wish you goodbye charles belsize said my lord with some feeling as your relative and your fathers old friend i wish you well i hope your future course in life may not be so unfortunate as the past year i request that we may part friends goodbye charles clara shake hands with captain belsize my lady dorking you will please to give charles your hand you have known him since he was a child andandwe are sorry to be obliged to part in this way in this wise mr jack belsizes tooth was finally extracted and for the moment we wish him and his brotherpatient a good journey  little lynxeyed dr von finck who attends most of the polite company at baden drove ceaselessly about the place that day with the real version of the faintingfit story about which we may be sure the wicked and malicious and the uninitiated had a hundred absurd details lady clara ever engaged to captain belsize fiddlededee everybody knew the captains affairs and that he could no more think of marrying than flying lady clara faint at seeing him she fainted before he came up she was always fainting and had done so thrice in the last week to his knowledge lord dorking had a nervous affection of his right arm and was always shaking his stick he did not say villain he said william captain belsizes name is william it is not so in the peerage is he called jack in the peerage those peerages are always wrong these candid explanations of course had their effect wicked tongues were of course instantaneously silent people were entirely satisfied they always are the next night being assembly night lady clara appeared at the rooms and danced with lord kew and mr barnes newcome all the society was as gracious and goodhumoured as possible and there was no more question of fainting than of burning down the conversationhouse but madame de cruchecassee and madame de schlangenbad and those horrid people whom the men speak to but whom the women salute with silent curtseys persisted in declaring that there was no prude like an english prude and to dr fincks oaths assertions explanations only replied with a shrug of their bold shoulders taisezvous docteur vous nete quune vieille bete  lady kew was at the rooms uncommonly gracious miss ethel took a few turns of the waltz with lord kew but this nymph looked more farouche than upon ordinary days bob jones who admired her hugely asked leave to waltz with her and entertained her with recollections of clive newcome at school he remembered a fight in which clive had been engaged and recounted that action to miss newcome who seemed to be interested he was pleased to deplore clives fancy for turning artist and that miss newcome recommended him to have his likeness taken for she said his appearance was exceedingly picturesque he was going on with further prattle but she suddenly cut mr jones short making him a bow and going to sit down by lady kew and the next day sir said bob with whom the present writer had the happiness of dining at a mess dinner at the upper temple when i met her on the walk sir she cut me as dead as a stone the airs those swells give themselves is enough to make any man turn republican  miss ethel indeed was haughty very haughty and of a difficult temper she spared none of her party except her kind mother to whom ethel always was kind and her father whom since his illnesses she tended with much benevolence and care but she did battle with lady kew repeatedly coming to her aunt julias rescue on whom her mother as usual exercised her powers of torturing she made barnes quail before her by the shafts of contempt which she flashed at him and she did not spare lord kew whose goodnature was no shield against her scorn the old queenmother was fairly afraid of her she even left off beating lady julia when ethel came in of course taking her revenge in the young girls absence but trying in her presence to soothe and please her against lord kew the young girls anger was most unjust and the more cruel because the kindly young nobleman never spoke a hard word of any one mortal soul and carrying no arms should have been assaulted by none but his very goodnature seemed to make his young opponent only the more wrathful she shot because his honest breast was bare it bled at the wounds which she inflicted her relatives looked at her surprised at her cruelty and the young man himself was shocked in his dignity and best feelings by his cousins wanton illhumour  lady kew fancied she understood the cause of this peevishness and remonstrated with miss ethel shall we write a letter to lucerne and order dick tinto back again said her ladyship are you such a fool ethel as to be hankering after that young scapegrace and his yellow beard his drawings are very pretty why i think he might earn a couple of hundred a year as a teacher and nothing would be easier than to break your engagement with kew and whistle the drawingmaster back again  ethel took up the whole heap of clives drawings lighted a taper carried the drawings to the fireplace and set them in a blaze a very pretty piece of work says lady kew and which proves satisfactorily that you dont care for the young clive at all have we arranged a correspondence we are cousins you know we may write pretty cousinly letters to one another a month before the old lady would have attacked her with other arms than sarcasm but she was scared now and dared to use no coarser weapons oh cried ethel in a transport what a life ours is and how you buy and sell and haggle over your children it is not clive i care about poor boy our ways of life are separate i cannot break from my own family and i know very well how yon would receive him in it had he money it would be different you would receive him and welcome him and hold out your hands to him but he is only a poor painter and we forsooth are bankers in the city and he comes among us on sufferance like those concertsingers whom mamma treats with so much politeness and who go down and have supper by themselves why should they not be as good as we are  m de c my dear is of a noble family interposed lady kew when he has given up singing and made his fortune no doubt he can go back into the world again  made his fortune yes ethel continued that is the cry there never were since the world began people so unblushingly sordid we own it and are proud of it we barter rank against money and money against rank day after day why did you marry my father to my mother was it for his wit you know he might have been an angel and you would have scorned him your daughter was bought with papas money as surely as ever newcome was will there be no day when this mammonworship will cease among us  not in my time or yours ethel the elder said not unkindly perhaps she thought of a day long ago before she was old herself  we are sold the young girl went on we are as much sold as turkish women the only difference being that our masters may have but one circassian at a time no there is no freedom for us i wear my green ticket and wait till my master comes but every day as i think of our slavery i revolt against it more that poor wretch that poor girl whom my brother is to marry why did she not revolt and fly i would if i loved a man sufficiently loved him better than the world than wealth than rank than fine houses and titlesand i feel i love these besti would give up all to follow him but what can i be with my name and my parents i belong to the world like all the rest of my family it is you who have bred us up you who are answerable for us why are there no convents to which we can fly you make a fine marriage for me you provide me with a good husband a kind soul not very wise but very kind you make me what you call happy and i would rather be at the plough like the women here  no you wouldnt ethel replies the grandmother drily these are the fine speeches of schoolgirls the showers of rain would spoil your complexionyou would be perfectly tired in an hour and come back to luncheonyou belong to your belongings my dear and are not better than the rest of the worldvery goodlooking as you know perfectly well and not very goodtempered it is lucky that kew is calm your temper at least before marriage such a prize does not fall to a pretty girls lot every day why you sent him away quite seared by your cruelty and if he is not playing at roulette or at billiards i dare say he is thinking what a little termagant you are and that he had beat pause while it is yet time before i was married your poor grandfather never knew i had a temper of afterdays i say nothing but trials are good for all of us and he bore his like an angel  lady kew too on this occasion at least was admirably goodhumoured she also when it was necessary could put a restraint on her temper and having this match very much at heart chose to coax and to soothe her granddaughter rather than to endeavour to scold and frighten her  why do you desire this marriage so much grandmamma the girl asked my cousin is not very much in loveat least i should fancy not she added blushing i am bound to own lord kew is not in the least eager and i think if you were to tell him to wait for five years he would be quite willing why should you be so very anxious  why my dear because i think young ladies who want to go and work in the fields should make hay while the sun shines because i think it is high time that kew should ranger himself because i am sure he will make the best husband and ethel the prettiest countess in england and the old lady seldom exhibiting any signs of affection looked at her granddaughter very fondly from her ethel looked up into the glass which very likely repeated on its shining face the truth her elder had just uttered shall we quarrel with the girl for that dazzling reflection for owning that charming truth and submitting to the conscious triumph give her her part of vanity of youth of desire to rule and be admired meanwhile mr clives drawings have been crackling in the fireplace at her feet and the last spark of that combustion is twinkling out unheeded     chapter xxxiii lady kew at the congress   when lady kew heard that madame divry was at baden and was informed at once of the french ladys graciousness towards the newcome family and of her fury against lord kew the old countess gave a loose to that energetic temper with which nature had gifted her a temper which she tied up sometimes and kept from barking and biting but which when unmuzzled was an animal of whom all her ladyships family had a just apprehension not one of them but in his or her time had been wounded lacerated tumbled over otherwise frightened or injured by this unruly brute the cowards brought it sops and patted it the prudent gave it a clear berth and walked round so as not to meet it but woe be to those of the family who had to bring the meal and prepare the litter and to speak respectfully share the kennel with lady kews black dog surely a fine furious temper if accompanied with a certain magnanimity and bravery which often go together with it is one of the most precious and fortunate gifts with which a gentleman or lady can be endowed a person always ready to fight is certain of the greatest consideration amongst his or her family circle the lazy grow tired of contending with him the timid coax and flatter him and as almost every one is timid or lazy a badtempered man is sure to have his own way it is he who commands and all the others obey if he is a gourmand he has what he likes for dinner and the tastes of all the rest are subservient to him she we playfully transfer the gender as a bad temper is of both sexes has the place which she likes best in the drawingroom nor do her parents nor her brothers and sisters venture to take her favourite chair if she wants to go to a party mamma will dress herself in spite of her headache and papa who hates those dreadful soirees will go upstairs after dinner and put on his poor old white neckcloth though he has been toiling at chambers all day and must be there early in the morninghe will go out with her we say and stay for the cotillon if the family are taking their tour in the summer it is she who ordains whither they shall go and when they shall stop if he comes home late the dinner is kept for him and not one dares to say a word though ever so hungry if he is in a good humour how every one frisks about and is happy how the servants jump up at his bell and run to wait upon him how they sit up patiently and how eagerly they rush out to fetch cabs in the rain whereas for you and me who have the tempers of angels and never were known to be angry or to complain nobody cares whether we are pleased or not our wives go to the milliners and send us the bill and we pay it our john finishes reading the newspaper before he answers our bell and brings it to us our sons loll in the armchair which we should like fill the house with their young men and smoke in the diningroom our tailors fit us badly our butchers give us the youngest mutton our tradesmen dun us much more quickly than other peoples because they know we are goodnatured and our servants go out whenever they like and openly have their friends to supper in the kitchen when lady kew said sic volo sic jubeo i promise you few persons of her ladyships belongings stopped before they did her biddings to ask her reasons  if which very seldom happens there are two such imperious and domineering spirits in a family unpleasantries of course will arise from their contentions or if out of doors the family bajazet meets with some other violent turk dreadful battles ensue all the allies on either side are brought in and the surrounding neighbours perforce engaged in the quarrel this was unluckily the case in the present instance lady kew unaccustomed to have her will questioned at home liked to impose it abroad she judged the persons around her with great freedom of speech her opinions were quoted as peoples sayings will be and if she made bitter speeches depend on it they lost nothing in the carrying she was furious against madame la duchesse divry and exploded in various companies whenever that ladys name was mentioned why was she not with her husband why was the poor old duke left to his gout and this woman trailing through the country with her vagabond court of billiardmarkers at her heels she to call herself mary queen of scots forsoothwell she merited the title in some respects though she had not murdered her husband as yet ah i should like to be queen elizabeth if the duchess is queen of scots said the old lady shaking her old fist and these sentiments being uttered in public upon the promenade to mutual friends of course the duchess had the benefit of lady kews remarks a few minutes after they were uttered and her grace and the distinguished princes counts and noblemen in her court designated as billiardmarkers by the old countess returned the latters compliments with pretty speeches of their own scandals were dug up respecting her ladyship so old that one would have thought them forgotten these forty yearsso old that they happened before most of the newcomes now extant were born and surely therefore are out of the province of this contemporary biography lady kew was indignant with her daughter there were some moments when any conduct of her friends did not meet her ladyships approbation even for the scant civility with which lady anne had received the duchesss advances leave a card upon heryes send a card by one of your footmen but go in to see herbecause she was at the window and saw you drive upare you mad anne that was the very reason you should not have come out of your carriage but you are so weak and goodnatured that if a highwayman stopped you you would say thank you sir as you gave him your purse yes and if mrs macheath called on you afterwards you would return the visit  even had these speeches been made about the duchess and some of them not addressed to her things might have gone on pretty well if we quarrelled with all the people who abuse us behind our backs and began to tear their eyes out as soon as we set ours on them what a life it would be and when should we have any quiet backbiting is all fair in society abuse me and i will abuse you but let us be friends when we meet have not we all entered a dozen rooms and been sure from the countenances of the amiable persons present that they had been discussing our little peculiarities perhaps as we were on the stairs was our visit therefore the less agreeable did we quarrel and say hard words to one anothers faces nowe wait until some of our dear friends take their leave and then comes our turn my back is at my neighbours service as soon as that is turned let him make what faces he thinks proper but when we meet we grin and shake hands like wellbred folk to whom clean linen is not more necessary than a clean sweetlooking countenance and a nicely gotup smile for company  here was lady kews mistake she wanted for some reason to drive madame divry out of baden and thought there were no better means of effecting this object than by using the high hand and practising those frowns upon the duchess which had scared away so many other persons but the queen of scots was resolute too and her band of courtiers fought stoutly round about her some of them could not pay their bills and could not retreat others had courage and did not choose to fly instead of coaxing and soothing madame divry madame de kew thought by a brisk attack to rout and dislodge her she began on almost the very first occasion when the ladies met i was so sorry to hear that monsieur le duc was ill at bagneres madame la duchesse the old lady began on their very first meeting after the usual salutations had taken place  madame la comtesse is very kind to interest herself in monsieur divrys health monsieur le duc at his age is not disposed to travel you dear miladi are more happy in being always able to retain the gout des voyages  i come to my family my dear duchess  how charmed they must be to possess you miladi anne you must be inexpressibly consoled by the presence of a mother so tender permit me to present madame la comtesse de la cruchecassee to madame la comtesse de kew miladi is sister to that amiable marquis of steyne whom you have known ambrosine madame la baronne de schlangenbad miladi kew do you not see the resemblance to milor these ladies have enjoyed the hospitalitiesthe splendours of gaunt house they were of those famous routs of which the charming mistress crawley la semillante becki made part how sad the hotel de gaunt must be under the present circumstances have you heard miladi of the charming mistress becki monsieur le duc describes her as the most spirituelle englishwoman he ever met the queen of scots turns and whispers her lady of honour and shrugs and taps her forehead lady kew knows that madame divry speaks of her nephew the present lord steyne who is not in his right mind the duchess looks round and sees a friend in the distance whom she beckons comtesse you know already monsieur the captain blackball he makes the delight of our society a dreadful man with a large cigar a florid waistcoat and billiards written on his countenance swaggers forward at the duchesss summons the countess of kew has not gained much by her attack she has been presented to cruchecassee and schlangenbad she sees herself on the eve of becoming the acquaintance of captain blackball  permit me duchess to choose my english friends at least for myself says lady kew drumming her foot  but madam assuredly you do not love this good monsieur de blackball eh the english manners are droll pardon me for saying so it is wonderful how proud you are as a nation and how ashamed you are of your compatriots  there are some persons who are ashamed of nothing madame la duchesse cries lady kew losing her temper  is that gracieusete for me how much goodness this good monsieur de blackball is not very well bred but for an englishman he is not too bad i have met with people who are more illbred than englishmen in my travels  and they are said lady anne who had been in vain endeavouring to put an end to this colloquy  englishwomen madam i speak not for you you are kind youyou are too soft dear lady anne for a persecutor  the counsels of the worldly woman who governed and directed that branch of the newcome family of whom it is our business to speak now for a little while bore other results than those which the elderly lady desired and foresaw who can foresee everything and always not the wisest among us when his majesty louis xiv jockeyed his grandson on to the throne of spain founding thereby the present revered dynasty of that country did he expect to peril his own and bring all europe about his royal ears could a late king of france eager for the advantageous establishment of one of his darling sons and anxious to procure a beautiful spanish princess with a crown and kingdom in reversion for the simple and obedient youth ever suppose that the welfare of his whole august race and reign would be upset by that smart speculation we take only the most noble examples to illustrate the conduct of such a noble old personage as her ladyship of kew who brought a prodigious deal of trouble upon some of the innocent members of her family whom no doubt she thought to better in life by her experienced guidance and undoubted worldly wisdom we may be as deep as jesuits know the world ever so well lay the bestordered plans and the profoundest combinations and by a certain not unnatural turn of fate we and our plans and combinations are sent flying before the wind we may be as wise as louis philippe that manycounselled ulysses whom the respectable world admired so and after years of patient scheming and prodigies of skill after coaxing wheedling doubling bullying wisdom behold yet stronger powers interpose and schemes and skill and violence are nought  frank and ethel lady kews grandchildren were both the obedient subjects of this ancient despot this imperious old louis xiv in a black front and a cap and ribbon this scheming old louis philippe in tabinet but their blood was good and their tempers high and for all her bitting and driving and the training of her mange the generous young colts were hard to break ethel at this time was especially stubborn in training rebellious to the whip and wild under harness and the way in which lady kew managed her won the admiration of her family for it was a maxim among these folks that no one could manage ethel but lady kew barnes said no one could manage his sister but his grandmother he couldnt that was certain mamma never tried and indeed was so goodnatured that rather than ride the filly she would put the saddle on her own back and let the filly ride her no there was no one but her ladyship capable of managing that girl barnes owned who held lady kew in much respect and awe if the tightest hand were not kept on her theres no knowing what she mightnt do said her brother ethel newcome by jove is capable of running away with the writingmaster  after poor jack belsizes mishap and departure barness own bride showed no spirit at all save one of placid contentment she came at call and instantly and went through whatever paces her owner demanded of her she laughed whenever need was simpered and smiled when spoken to danced whenever she was asked drove out at barness side in kews phaeton and received him certainly not with warmth but with politeness and welcome it is difficult to describe the scorn with which her sisterinlaw regarded her the sight of the patient timid little thing chafed ethel who was always more haughty and flighty and bold when in claras presence than at any other time her ladyships brother captain lord viscount rooster before mentioned joined the family party at this interesting juncture my lord rooster found himself surprised delighted subjugated by miss newcome her wit and spirit by jove she is a plucky one his lordship exclaimed to dance with her is the best fun in life how she pulls all the other girls to pieces by jove and how splendidly she chaffs everybody but he added with the shrewdness and sense of humour which distinguished the young officer id rather dance with her than marry herby a doosid long scorei dont envy you that part of the business kew my boy lord kew did not set himself up as a person to be envied he thought his cousin beautiful and with his grandmother that she would make a very handsome countess and he thought the money which lady kew would give or leave to the young couple a very welcome addition to his means  on the next night when there was a ball at the room miss ethel chose to appear in a toilette the very grandest and finest which she had ever assumed who was ordinarily exceedingly simple in her attire and dressed below the mark of the rest of the world her clustering ringlets her shining white shoulders her splendid raiment i believe indeed it was her courtdress which the young lady assumed astonished all beholders she errased all other beauties by her appearance so much so that madame divrys court could not but look the men in admiration the women in dislike at this dazzling young creature none of the countesses duchesses princesses russ spanish italian were so fine or so handsome there were some new york ladies at baden as there are everywhere else in europe now not even these were more magnificent than miss ethel general jeremiah j bungs lady owned that miss newcome was fit to appear in any party in fourth avenue she was the only welldressed english girl mrs bung had seen in europe a young german durchlaucht deigned to explain to his aidedecamp how very handsome he thought miss newcome all our acquaintances were of one mind mr jones of england pronounced her stunning the admirable captain blackball examined her points with the skill of an amateur and described them with agreeable frankness lord rooster was charmed as he surveyed her and complimented his late companioninarms on the possession of such a paragon only lord kew was not delightednor did miss ethel mean that he should be she looked as splendid as cinderella in the princes palace but what need for all this splendour this wonderful toilette this dazzling neck and shoulders whereof the brightness and beauty blinded the eyes of lookerson she was dressed as gaudily as an actress of the varietes going to a supper at trois freres it was mademoiselle mabille en habit de coeur madame divry remarked to madame schlangenbad barnes who with his brideelect for a partner made a visavis for his sister and the admiring lord rooster was puzzled likewise by ethels countenance and appearance little lady clara looked like a little schoolgirl dancing before her  one two three of the attendants of her majesty the queen of scots were carried off in the course of the evening by the victorious young beauty whose triumph had the effect which the headstrong girl perhaps herself anticipated of mortifying the duchesse divry of exasperating old lady kew and of annoying the young nobleman to whom miss ethel was engaged the girl seemed to take a pleasure in defying all three a something embittered her alike against her friends and her enemies the old dowager chaffed and vented her wrath upon lady anne and barnes ethel kept the ball alive by herself almost she refused to go home declining hints and commands alike she was engaged for ever so many dances more not dance with count punter it would be rude to leave him after promising him not waltz with captain blackball he was not a proper partner for her why then did kew know him lord kew walked and talked with captain blackball every day was she to be so proud as not to know lord kews friends she greeted the captain with a most fascinating smile as he came up whilst the controversy was pending and ended it by whirling round the room in his arms  madame divry viewed with such pleasure as might be expected the defection of her adherents and the triumph of her youthful rival who seemed to grow more beautiful with each waltz so that the other dancers paused to look at her the men breaking out in enthusiasm the reluctant women being forced to join in the applause angry as she was and knowing how ethels conduct angered her grandson old lady kew could not help admiring the rebellious beauty whose girlish spirit was more than a match for the imperious dowagers tough old resolution as for mr barness displeasure the girl tossed her saucy head shrugged her fair shoulders and passed on with a scornful laugh in a word miss ethel conducted herself as a most reckless and intrepid young flirt using her eyes with the most consummate effect chattering with astounding gaiety prodigal of smiles gracious thanks and killing glances what wicked spirit moved her perhaps had she known the mischief she was doing she would have continued it still  the sight of this wilfulness and levity smote poor lord kews honest heart with cruel pangs of mortification the easy young nobleman had passed many a year of his life in all sorts of wild company the chaumiere knew him and the balls of parisian actresses the coulisses of the opera at home and abroad those pretty heads of ladies whom nobody knows used to nod their shining ringlets at kew from private boxes at theatres or dubious park broughams he had run the career of young men of pleasure and laughed and feasted with jolly prodigals and their company he was tired of it perhaps he remembered an earlier and purer life and was sighing to return to it living as he had done amongst the outcasts his ideal of domestic virtue was high and pure he chose to believe that good women were entirely good duplicity he could not understand illtemper shocked him wilfulness he seemed to fancy belonged only to the profane and wicked not to good girls with good mothers in honest homes their nature was to love their families to obey their parents to tend their poor to honour their husbands to cherish their children ethels laugh woke him up from one of these simple reveries very likely and then she swept round the ballroom rapidly to the brazen notes of the orchestra he never offered to dance with her more than once in the evening went away to play and returned to find her still whirling to the music madame divry remarked his tribulation and gloomy face though she took no pleasure at his discomfiture knowing that ethels behaviour caused it  in plays and novels and i dare say in real life too sometimes when the wanton heroine chooses to exert her powers of fascination and to flirt with sir harry or the captain the hero in a pique goes off and makes love to somebody else both acknowledge their folly after a while shake hands and are reconciled and the curtain drops or the volume ends but there are some people too noble and simple for these amorous scenes and smirking artifices when kew was pleased he laughed when he was grieved he was silent he did not deign to hide his grief or pleasure under disguises his error perhaps was in forgetting that ethel was very young that her conduct was not design so much as girlish mischief and high spirits and that if young men have their frolics sow their wild oats and enjoy their pleasure young women may be permitted sometimes their more harmless vagaries of gaiety and sportive outbreaks of wilful humour  when she consented to go home at length lord kew brought miss newcomes little white cloak for her under the hood of which her glossy curls her blushing cheeks and bright eyes looked provokingly handsome and encased her in this pretty garment without uttering one single word she made him a saucy curtsey in return for this act of politeness which salutation he received with a grave bow and then he proceeded to cover up old lady kew and to conduct her ladyship to her chariot miss ethel chose to be displeased at her cousins displeasure what were balls made for but that people should dance she a flirt she displease lord kew if she chose to dance she would dance she had no idea of his giving himself airs besides it was such fun taking away the gentlemen of mary queen of scots court from her such capital fun so she went to bed singing and performing wonderful roulades as she lighted her candle and retired to her room she had had such a jolly evening such famous fun and i dare say but how shall a novelist penetrate these mysteries when her chamber door was closed she scolded her maid and was as cross as two sticks you see there come moments of sorrow after the most brilliant victories and you conquer and rout the enemy utterly and then regret that you fought     chapter xxxiv the end of the congress of baden   mention has been made of an elderly young person from ireland engaged by madame la duchesse divry as companion and teacher of english for her little daughter when miss ogrady as she did some time afterwards quitted madame divrys family she spoke with great freedom regarding the behaviour of that duchess and recounted horrors which she the latter had committed a number of the most terrific anecdotes issued from the lips of the indignant miss whose volubility lord kew was obliged to check not choosing that his countess with whom he was paying a bridal visit to paris should hear such dreadful legends it was there that miss ogrady finding herself in misfortune and reading of lord kews arrival at the hotel bristol waited upon his lordship and the countess of kew begging them to take tickets in a raffle for an invaluable ivory writingdesk sole relic of her former prosperity which she proposed to give her friends the chance of acquiring in fact miss ogrady lived for some years on the produce of repeated raffles for this beautiful desk many religious ladies of the faubourg st germain taking an interest in her misfortunes and alleviating them by the simple lottery system protestants as well as catholics were permitted to take shares in miss ogradys raffles and lord kew goodnatured then as always purchased so many tickets that the contrite ogrady informed him of a transaction which had nearly affected his happiness and in which she took a not very creditable share had i known your lordships real character miss og was pleased to say no tortures would have induced me to do an act for which i have undergone penance it was that blackhearted woman my lord who maligned your lordship to me that woman whom i called friend once but who is the most false depraved and dangerous of her sex in this way do ladies companions sometimes speak of ladies when quarrels separate them when confidential attendants are dismissed bearing away family secrets in their minds and revenge in their hearts  the day after miss ethels feats at the assembly old lady kew went over to advise her granddaughter and to give her a little timely warning about the impropriety of flirtations above all with such men as are to be found at wateringplaces persons who are never seen elsewhere in society remark the peculiarities of kews temper who never flies into a passion like you and me my dear said the old lady being determined to be particularly gracious and cautious when once angry he remains so and is so obstinate that it is almost impossible to coax him into goodhumour it is much better my love to be like us continued the old lady to fly out in a rage and have it over but que voulezvous such is franks temper and we must manage him so she went on backing her advice by a crowd of examples drawn from the family history showing how kew was like his grandfather her own poor husband still more like his late father lord walham between whom and his mother there had been differences chiefly brought on by my lady walham of course which had ended in the almost total estrangement of mother and son lady kew then administered her advice and told her stories with ethel alone for a listener and in a most edifying manner she besought miss newcome to menager lord kews susceptibilities as she valued her own future comfort in life as well as the happiness of a most amiable man of whom if properly managed ethel might make what she pleased we have said lady kew managed everybody and that most of the members of her family allowed themselves to be managed by her ladyship  ethel who had permitted her grandmother to continue her sententious advice while she herself sat tapping her feet on the floor and performing the most rapid variations of that air which is called the devils tattoo burst out at length to the elder ladys surprise with an outbreak of indignation a flushing face and a voice quivering with anger  this most amiable man she cried out that you design for me i know everything about this most amiable man and thank you and my family for the present you make me for the past year what have you been doing every one of you my father my brother and you yourself have been filling my ears wit cruel reports against a poor boy whom you chose to depict as everything that was dissolute and wicked when there was nothing against him nothing but that he was poor yes you yourself grandmamma have told me many and many a time that clive newcome was not a fit companion for us warned me against his bad courses and painted him as extravagant unprincipled i dont know how bad how bad i know how good he is how upright generous and truthtelling though there was not a day until lately that barnes did not make some wicked story against himbarnes who i believe is bad himself likelike other young men yes i am sure there was something about barnes in that newspaper which my father took away from me and you come and you lift up your hands and shake your head because i dance with one gentleman or another you tell me i am wrong mamma has told me so this morning barnes of course has told me so and you bring me frank as a pattern and tell me to love and honour and obey him look here and she drew out a paper and put it into lady kews hands here is kews history and i believe it is true yes i am sure it is true  the old dowager lifted her eyeglass to her black eyebrow and read a paper written in english and bearing no signature in which many circumstances of lord kews life were narrated for poor ethels benefit it was not a worse life than that of a thousand young men of pleasure but there were kews many misdeeds set down in order such a catalogue as we laugh at when leporello trolls it and sings his masters victories in france italy and spain madame divrys name was not mentioned in this list and lady kew felt sure that the outrage came from her  with real ardour lady kew sought to defend her grandson from some of the attacks here made against him and showed ethel that the person who could use such means of calumniating him would not scruple to resort to falsehood in order to effect her purpose  her purpose cries ethel how do you know it is a woman lady kew lapsed into generalities she thought the handwriting was a womansat least it was not likely that a man should think of addressing an anonymous letter to a young lady and so wreaking his hatred upon lord kew besides frank has had no rivalsexceptexcept one young gentleman who has carried his paintboxes to italy says lady kew you dont think your dear colonels son would leave such a piece of mischief behind him you must act my dear continued her ladyship as if this letter had never been written at all the person who wrote it no doubt will watch you of course we are too proud to allow him to see that we are wounded and pray pray do not think of letting poor frank know a word about this horrid transaction  then the letter is true burst out ethel you know it is true grandmamma and that is why you would have me keep it a secret from my cousin besides she added with a little hesitation your caution comes too late lord kew has seen the letter  you fool screamed the old lady you were not so mad as to show it to him  i am sure the letter is true ethel said rising up very haughtily it is not by calling me bad names that your ladyship will disprove it keep them if you please for my aunt julia she is sick and weak and cant defend herself i do not choose to bear abuse from you or lectures from lord kew he happened to be here a short while since when the letter arrived he had been good enough to come to preach me a sermon on his own account he to find fault with my actions cried miss ethel quivering with wrath and clenching the luckless paper in her hand he to accuse me of levity and to warn me against making improper acquaintances he began his lectures too soon i am not a lawful slave yet and prefer to remain unmolested at least as long as i am free  and you told frank all this miss newcome and you showed him that letter said the old lady  the letter was actually brought to me whilst his lordship was in the midst of his sermon ethel replied i read it as he was making his speech she continued gathering anger and scorn as she recalled the circumstances of the interview he was perfectly polite in his language he did not call me a fool or use a single other bad name he was good enough to advise me and to make such virtuous pretty speeches that if he had been a bishop he could not have spoken better and as i thought the letter was a nice commentary on his lordships sermon i gave it to him i gave it to him cried the young woman and much good may it do him i dont think my lord kew will preach to me again for some time  i dont think he will indeed said lady kew in a hard dry voice you dont know what you may have done will you be pleased to ring the bell and order my carriage i congratulate you on having performed a most charming mornings work  ethel made her grandmother a very stately curtsey i pity lady julias condition when her mother reached home  all who know lord kew may be pretty sure that in that unlucky interview with ethel to which the young lady has alluded he just said no single word to her that was not kind and just and gentle considering the relation between them he thought himself justified in remonstrating with her as to the conduct which she chose to pursue and in warning her against acquaintances of whom his own experience had taught him the dangerous character he knew madame divry and her friends so well that he would not have his wifeelect a member of their circle he could not tell ethel what he knew of those women and their history she chose not to understand his hintsdid not very likely comprehend them she was quite young and the stories of such lives as theirs had never been told before her she was indignant at the surveillance which lord kew exerted over her and the authority which he began to assume at another moment and in a better frame of mind she would have been thankful for his care and very soon and ever after she did justice to his many admirable qualitieshis frankness honesty and sweet temper only her high spirit was in perpetual revolt at this time against the bondage in which her family strove to keep her the very worldly advantages of the position which they offered her served but to chafe her the more had her proposed husband been a young prince with a crown to lay at her feet she had been yet more indignant very likely and more rebellious had kews younger brother been her suitor or kew in his place she had been not unwilling to follow her parents wishes hence the revolt in which she was engagedthe wayward freaks and outbreaks her haughty temper indulged in no doubt she saw the justice of lord kews reproofs that selfconsciousness was not likely to add to her goodhumour no doubt she was sorry for having shown lord kew the letter the moment after she had done that act of which the poor young lady could not calculate the consequences that were now to ensue  lord kew on glancing over the letter at once divined the quarter whence it came the portrait drawn of him was not unlike as our characters described by those who hate us are not unlike he had passed a reckless youth indeed he was sad and ashamed of that past life longed like the poor prodigal to return to better courses and had embraced eagerly the chance afforded him of a union with a woman young virtuous and beautiful against whom and against heaven he hoped to sin no more if we have told or hinted at more of his story than will please the ear of modern conventionalism i beseech the reader to believe that the writers purpose at least is not dishonest nor unkindly the young gentleman hung his head with sorrow over that sad detail of his life and its follies what would he have given to be able to say to ethel this is not true  his reproaches to miss newcome of course were at once stopped by this terrible assault on himself the letter had been put in the baden postbox and so had come to its destination it was in a disguised handwriting lord kew could form no idea even of the sex of the scribe he put the envelope in his pocket when ethels back was turned he examined the paper when he left her he could make little of the superscription or of the wafer which had served to close the note he did not choose to caution ethel as to whether she should burn the letter or divulge it to her friends he took his share of the pain as a boy at school takes his flogging stoutly and in silence  when he saw ethel again which he did in an hours time the generous young gentleman held his hand out to her my dear he said if you had loved me you never would have shown me that letter it was his only reproof after that he never again reproved or advised her  ethel blushed you are very brave and generous frank said bending her head and i am captious and wicked he felt the hot tear blotting on his hand from his cousins downcast eyes  he kissed her little hand lady anne who was in the room with her children when these few words passed between the two in a very low tone thought it was a reconciliation ethel knew it was a renunciation on kews partshe never liked him so much as at that moment the young man was too modest and simple to guess himself what the girls feelings were could he have told them his fate and hers might have been changed  you must not allow our kind letterwriting friend lord kew continued to fancy we are hurt we must walk out this afternoon and we must appear very good friends  yes always kew said ethel holding out her hand again the next minute her cousin was at the table carving roastfowls and distributing the portions to the hungry children  the assembly of the previous evening had been one of those which the fermier des jeux at baden beneficently provides for the frequenters of the place and now was to come off a much more brilliant entertainment in which poor clive who is far into switzerland by this time was to have taken a share the bachelors had agreed to give a ball one of the last entertainments of the season a dozen or more of them had subscribed the funds and we may be sure lord kews name was at the head of the list as it was of any list of any scheme whether of charity or fun the english were invited and the russians were invited the spaniards and italians poles prussians and hebrews all the motley frequenters of the place and the warriors in the duke of badens army unlimited supper was set in the restaurant the dancingroom glittered with extra lights and a profusion of cutpaper flowers decorated the festive scene everybody was present those crowds with whom our story has nothing to do and those two or three groups of persons who enact minor or greater parts in it madame divry came in a dress of stupendous splendour even more brilliant than that in which miss ethel had figured at the last assembly if the duchess intended to ecraser miss newcome by the superior magnificence of her toilet she was disappointed miss newcome wore a plain white frock on the occasion and resumed madame divry said her role of ingenue for that night  during the brief season in which gentlemen enjoyed the favour of mary queen of scots that wandering sovereign led them through all the paces and vagaries of a regular passion as in a fair where time is short and pleasures numerous the master of the theatrical booth shows you a tragedy a farce and a pantomime all in a quarter of an hour having a dozen new audiences to witness his entertainments in the course of the forenoon so this lady with her platonic lovers went through the complete dramatic coursetragedies of jealousy pantomimes of rapture and farces of parting there were billets on one side and the other hints of a fatal destiny and a ruthless lynxeyed tyrant who held a demoniac grasp over the duchess by means of certain secrets which he knew there were regrets that we had not known each other sooner why were we brought out of our convent and sacrificed to monsieur le duc there were frolic interchanges of fancy and poesy pretty bouderies sweet reconciliations yawns finallyand separation adolphe went out and alphonse came in it was the new audience for which the bell rang the band played and the curtain rose and the tragedy comedy and farce were repeated  those greenwich performers who appear in the theatrical pieces abovementioned make a great deal more noise than your stationary tragedians and if they have to denounce a villain to declare a passion or to threaten an enemy they roar stamp shake their fists and brandish their sabres so that every man who sees the play has surely a full pennyworth for his penny thus madame la duchesse divry perhaps a little exaggerated her heroines parts liking to strike her audiences quickly and also to change them often like good performers she flung herself heart and soul into the business of the stage and was what she acted she was phedre and if in the first part of the play she was uncommonly tender to hippolyte in the second she hated him furiously she was medea and if jason was volage woe to creusa perhaps our poor lord kew had taken the first character in a performance with madame divry for his behaviour in which part it was difficult enough to forgive him but when he appeared at baden the affianced husband of one of the most beautiful young creatures in europewhen his relatives scorned madame divryno wonder she was maddened and enraged and would have recourse to revenge steel poison  there was in the duchesss court a young fellow from the south of france whose friends had sent him to faire son droit at paris where he had gone through the usual course of pleasure and studies of the young inhabitants of the latin quarter he had at one time exalted republican opinions and had fired his shot with distinction at st meri he was a poet of some little notea book of his lyrics les rales dun asphyxie having made a sensation at the time of their appearance he drank great quantities of absinthe of a morning smoked incessantly played roulette

clarisse young milliners of the students district had punctured this terrible motto on his manly right arm le leopard emblem of england was his aversion he shook his fist at the caged monster in the garden of plants he desired to have here lies an enemy of england engraved upon his early tomb he was skilled at billiards and dominoes adroit in the use of arms of unquestionable courage and fierceness mr jones of england was afraid of m de castillonnes and cowered before his scowls and sarcasms captain blackball the other english aidedecamp of the duchesse divry a warrior of undoubted courage who had been on the ground more than once gave him a wide berth and wondered what the little beggar meant when he used to say since the days of the prince noir monsieur my family has been at

had fancied a resemblance between her and agnes de calverley the blanche miss of his novel and drama and cast an eye of favour upon the young creature he even composed verses in her honour for i presume that the miss betti and the princess crimhilde of the poems which he subsequently published were no other than miss newcome and the duchess her rival he had been one of the lucky gentlemen who had danced with ethel on the previous evening on the occasion of the ball he came to her with a highflown compliment and a request to be once more allowed to waltz with hera request to which he expected a favourable answer thinking no doubt that his wit his powers of conversation and the amour qui flambait dans son regard had had their effect upon the charming meess perhaps he had a copy of the very verses in his breastpocket with which he intended to complete his work of fascination for her sake alone he had been heard to say that he would enter into a truce with england and forget the hereditary wrongs of his race  but the blanche miss on this evening declined to waltz with him his compliments were not of the least avail he retired with them and his unuttered verses in his crumpled bosom miss newcome only danced in one quadrille with lord kew and left the party quite early to the despair of many of the bachelors who lost the fairest ornament of their ball  lord kew however had been seen walking with her in public and particularly attentive to her during her brief appearance in the ballroom and the old dowager who regularly attended all places of amusement and was at twenty parties and six dinners the week before she died thought fit to be particularly gracious to madame divry upon this evening and far from shunning the duchesses presence or being rude to her as on former occasions was entirely smiling and goodhumoured lady kew too thought there had been a reconciliation between ethel and her cousin lady anne had given her mother some account of the handshaking kews walk with ethel the quadrille which she had danced with him alone induced the elder lady to believe that matters had been made up between the young people  so by way of showing the duchesse that her little shot of the morning had failed in its effect as frank left the room with his cousin lady kew gaily hinted that the young earl was aux petits soins with miss ethel that she was sure her old friend the duc divry would be glad to hear that his godson was about to range himself he would settle down on his estates he would attend to his duties as an english peer and a country gentleman we shall go home says the benevolent countess and kill the veau gras and you shall see our dear prodigal will become a very quiet gentleman  the duchesse said my lady kews plan was most edifying she was charmed to hear that lady kew loved veal there were some who thought that meat rather insipid a waltzer came to claim her hand at this moment and as she twirled round the room upon that gentlemans arm wafting odours as she moved her pink silks pink feathers pink ribands making a mighty rustling the countess of kew had the satisfaction of thinking that she had planted an arrow in that shrivelled little waist which count punters arms embraced and had returned the stab which madame divry had delivered in the morning  mr barnes and his elect bride had also appeared danced and disappeared lady kew soon followed her young ones and the ball went on very gaily in spite of the absence of these respectable personages  being one of the managers of the entertainment lord kew returned to it after conducting lady anne and her daughter to their carriage and now danced with great vigour and with his usual kindness selecting those ladies whom other waltzers rejected because they were too old or too plain or too stout or what not but he did not ask madame divry to dance he could condescend to dissemble so far as to hide the pain which he felt but did not care to engage in that more advanced hypocrisy of friendship which for her part his old grandmother had not shown the least scruple in assuming  amongst other partners my lord selected that intrepid waltzer the graefinn von gumpelheim who in spite of her age size and large family never lost a chance of enjoying her favourite recreation look with what a camel my lord waltzes said m victor to madame divry whose slim waist he had the honour of embracing to the same music what man but an englishman would ever select such a dromedary  avant de se marier said madame divry il faut avouer que my lord se permet denormes distractions  my lord marries himself and when and whom cried the duchesses partner  miss newcome do not you approve of his choice i thought the eyes of stenio the duchess called m victor stenio looked with some favour upon that little person she is handsome even very handsome is it not so often in life stenio are not youth and innocence i give miss ethel the compliment of her innocence now surtout that the little painter is dismissedare we not cast into the arms of jaded roues tender young flowers are we not torn from our convent gardens and flung into a world of which the air poisons our pure life and withers the sainted buds of hope and love and faith faith the mocking world tramples on it nestce pas love the brutal world strangles the heavenborn infant at its birth hope it smiled at me in my little convent chamber played among the flowers which i cherished warbled with the birds that i loved but it quitted me at the door of the world stenio it folded its white wings and veiled its radiant face in return for my young love they gave mesixty years the dregs of a selfish heart egotism cowering over its fire and cold for all its mantle of ermine in place of the sweet flowers of my young years they gave me these stenio and she pointed to her feathers and her artificial roses oh i should like to crush them under my feet and she put out the neatest little slipper the duchesse was great upon her wrongs and paraded her blighted innocence to every one who would feel interested by that piteous spectacle the music here burst out more swiftly and melodiously than before the pretty little feet forgot their desire to trample upon the world she shrugged the lean little shoulderseh said the queen of scots dansons et oublions and stenios arm once more surrounded her fairy waist she called herself a fairy other ladies called her a skeleton and they whirled away in the waltz again and presently she and stenio came bumping up against the stalwart lord kew and the ponderous madame de gumpelheim as a wherry dashes against the oaken ribs of a steamer  the little couple did not fall they were struck on to a neighbouring bench luckily but there was a laugh at the expense of stenio and the queen of scotsand lord kew settling his panting partner on to a seat came up to make excuses for his awkwardness to the lady who had been its victim at the laugh produced by the catastrophe the duchesses eyes gleamed with anger  m de castillonnes she said to her partner have you had any quarrel with that englishman  with ce milor but no said stenio  he did it on purpose there has been no day but his family has insulted me hissed out the duchesse and at this moment lord kew came up to make his apologies he asked a thousand pardons of madame la duchesse for being so maladroit  maladroit et tres maladroit monsieur says stenio curling his moustache cest bien le mot monsieur  also i make my excuses to madame la duchesse which i hope she will receive said lord kew the duchesse shrugged her shoulders and sunk her head  when one does not know how to dance one ought not to dance continued the duchesses knight  monsieur is very good to give me lessons in dancing said lord kew  any lessons which you please milor cries stenio and everywhere where you will them  lord kew looked at the little man with surprise he could not understand so much anger for so trifling an accident which happens a dozen times in every crowded ball he again bowed to the duchesse and walked away  this is your englishmanyour kew whom you vaunt everywhere said stenio to m de florac who was standing by and witnessed the scene is he simply bete or is he poltron as well i believe him to be both  silence victor cried florac seizing his arm and drawing him away you know me and that i am neither one or the other believe my word that my lord kew wants neither courage nor wit  will you be my witness florac continues the other  to take him your excuses yes it is you who have insulted  yes parbleu i have insulted says the gascon  a man who never willingly offended soul alive a man full of heart the most frank the most loyal i have seen him put to the proof and believe me he is all i say  eh so much the better for me cried the southron i shall have the honour of meeting a gallant man and there will be two on the field  they are making a tool of you my poor gascon said m de florac who saw madame divrys eyes watching the couple she presently took the arm of the noble count de punter and went for fresh air into the adjoining apartment where play was going on as usual and lord kew and his friend lord rooster were pacing the room apart from the gamblers  my lord rooster at something which kew said looked puzzled and said pooh stuff damned little frenchman confounded nonsense  i was searching you milor said madame divry in a most winning tone tripping behind him with her noiseless little feet allow me a little word your arm you used to give it me once mon filleul i hope you think nothing of the rudeness of m de castillonnes he is a foolish gascon he must have been too often to the buffet this evening  lord kew said no indeed he thought nothing of de castillonnes rudeness  i am so glad these heroes of the salledarmes have not the commonest manners these gascons are always flamberge au vent what would the charming miss ethel say if she heard of the dispute  indeed there is no reason why she should hear of it said lord kew unless some obliging friend should communicate it to her  communicate it to herthe poor dear who would be so cruel as to give her pain asked the innocent duchesse why do you look at me so frank  because i admire you said her interlocutor with a bow i have never seen madame la duchesse to such advantage as today  you speak in enigmas come back with me to the ballroom come and dance with me once more you used to dance with me let us have one waltz more kew and then and then in a day or two i shall go back to monsieur le duc and tell him that his filleul is going to marry the fairest of all englishwomen and to turn hermit in the country and orator in the chamber of peers you have wit ah siyou have wit and she led back lord kew rather amazed himself at what he was doing into the ballroom so that the goodnatured people who were there and who beheld them dancing could not refrain from clapping their hands at the sight of this couple  the duchess danced as if she was bitten by that neapolitan spider which according to the legend is such a wonderful danceincentor she would have the music quicker and quicker she sank on kews arm and clung on his support she poured out all the light of her languishing eyes into his face their glances rather confused than charmed him but the bystanders were pleased they thought it so goodhearted of the duchesse after the little quarrel to make a public avowal of reconciliation  lord rooster looking on at the entrance of the dancingroom over monsieur de floracs shoulder said its all right shes a clipper to dance the little duchess  the viper said florac how she writhes  i suppose that business with the frenchman is all over says lord rooster confounded piece of nonsense  you believe it finished we shall see said florac who perhaps knew his fair cousin better when the waltz was over kew led his partner to a seat and bowed to her but though she made room for him at her side pointing to it and gathering up her rustling robes so that he might sit down he moved away his face full of gloom he never wished to be near her again there was something more odious to him in her friendship than her hatred he knew hers was the hand that had dealt that stab at him and ethel in the morning he went back and talked with his two friends in the doorway couch yourself my little kiou said florac you are all pale you were best in bed mon garcon  she has made me promise to take her in to supper kew said with a sigh  she will poison you said the other why have they abolished the roue chez nous my word of honour they should retabliche it for this woman  there is one in the next room said kew with a laugh come vicomte let us try our fortune and he walked back into the playroom  that was the last night on which lord kew ever played a gambling game he won constantly the double zero seemed to obey him so that the croupiers wondered at his fortune florac backed it saying with the superstition of a gambler i am sure something goes to arrive to this boy from time to time m de florac went back to the dancingroom leaving his mise under kews charge he always found his heaps increased indeed the worthy vicomte wanted a turn of luck in his favour on one occasion he returned with a grave face saying to lord rooster she has the other one in hand we are going to see trentesix encor et rouge gagne cried the croupier with his nasal tone monsieur de floracs pockets overflowed with double napoleons and he stopped his play luckily for kew putting down his winnings once twice thrice lost them all  when lord kew had left the dancingroom madame divry saw stenio following him with fierce looks and called back that bearded bard you were going to pursue m de kew she said i knew you were sit down here sir and she patted him down on her seat with her fan  do you wish that i should call him back madame said the poet with the deepest tragic accents  i can bring him when i want him victor said the lady  let us hope others will be equally fortunate the gascon said with one hand in his breast the other stroking his moustache  fi monsieur que vous sentez le tabac je vous le defends entendezvous monsieur  pourtant i have seen the day when madame la duchesse did not disdain a cigar said victor if the odour incommodes permit that i retire  and you also would quit me stenio do you think i did not mark your eyes towards miss newcome your anger when she refused you to dance ah we see all a woman does not deceive herself do you see you send me beautiful verses poet you can write as well of a statue or a picture of a rose or a sunset as of the heart of a woman you were angry just now because i danced with m de kew do you think in a womans eyes jealousy is unpardonable  you know how to provoke it madame continued the tragedian  monsieur replied the lady with dignity am i to render you an account of all my actions and ask your permission for a walk  in fact i am but the slave madame groaned the gascon i am not the master  you are a very rebellious slave monsieur continues the lady with a pretty moue and a glance of the large eyes artfully brightened by her rouge supposesuppose i danced with m de kew not for his sakeheaven knows to dance with him is not a pleasurebut for yours suppose i do not want a foolish quarrel to proceed suppose i know that he is ni sot ni poltron as you pretend i overheard you sir talking with one of the basest of men my good cousin m de florac but it is not of him i speak suppose i know the comte de kew to be a man cold and insolent illbred and grossier as the men of his nation arebut one who lacks no courageone who is terrible when roused might i have no occasion to fear not for him but  but for me ah marie ah madame believe you that a man of my blood will yield a foot to any englishman do you know the story of my race do you know that since my childhood i have vowed hatred to that nation tenez madame this m jones who frequents your salon it was but respect for you that has enabled me to keep my patience with this stupid islander this captain blackball whom you distinguish who certainly shoots well who mounts well to horse i have always thought his manners were those of the marker of a billiard but i respect him because he has made war with don carlos against the english but this young m de kew his laugh crisps me the nerves his insolent air makes me bound in beholding him i said to myself i hate you think whether i love him better after having seen him as i did but now madame also but this victor did not say he thought kew had laughed at him at the beginning of the evening when the blanche miss had refused to dance with him  ah victor it is not him but you that i would save said the duchess and the people round about and the duchess herself afterwards said yes certainly she had a good heart she entreated lord kew she implored m victor she did everything in her power to appease the quarrel between him and the frenchman  after the ball came the supper which was laid at separate little tables where parties of half a dozen enjoyed themselves lord kew was of the duchesss party where our gascon friend had not a seat but being one of the managers of the entertainment his lordship went about from table to table seeing that the guests at each lacked nothing he supposed too that the dispute with the gascon had possibly come to an end at any rate disagreeable as the others speech had been he had resolved to put up with it not having the least inclination to drink the frenchmans blood or to part with his own on so absurd a quarrel he asked people in his goodnatured way to drink wine with him and catching m victors eye scowling at him from a distant table he sent a waiter with a champagnebottle to his late opponent and lifted his glass as a friendly challenge the waiter carried the message to m victor who when he heard it turned up his glass and folded his arms in a stately manner m de castillonnes dit quil refuse milor said the waiter rather scared he charged me to bring that message to milor florac ran across to the angry gascon it was not while at madame divrys table that lord kew sent his challenge and received his reply his duties as steward had carried him away from that pretty early  meanwhile the glimmering dawn peered into the windows of the refreshmentroom and behold the sun broke in and scared all the revellers the ladies scurried away like so many ghosts at cockcrow some of them not caring to face that detective luminary cigars had been lighted ere this the men remained smoking them with those sleepless german waiters still bringing fresh supplies of drink lord kew gave the duchesse divry his arm and was leading her out m de castillonnes stood scowling directly in their way upon which with rather an abrupt turn of the shoulder and a pardon monsieur lord kew pushed by and conducted the duchesse to her carriage she did not in the least see what had happened between the two gentlemen in the passage she ogled and nodded and kissed her hands quite affectionately to kew as the fly drove away  florac in the meanwhile had seized his compatriot who had drunk champagne copiously with others if not with kew and was in vain endeavouring to make him hear reason the gascon was furious he vowed that lord kew had struck him by the tomb of my mother he bellowed i swear i will have his blood lord rooster was bawling out d him carry him to bed and shut him up which remarks victor did not understand or two victims would doubtless have been sacrificed on his mammas mausoleum  when kew came back as he was only too sure to do the little gascon rushed forward with a glove in his hand and having an audience of smokers round about him made a furious speech about england leopards cowardice insolent islanders and napoleon at st helena and demanded reason for kews conduct during the night as he spoke he advanced towards lord kew glove in hand and lifted it as if he was actually going to strike  there is no need for further words said lord kew taking his cigar out of his mouth if you dont drop that glove upon my word i will pitch you out of the window hapick the man up somebody youll bear witness gentlemen i couldnt help myself if he wants me in the morning he knows where to find me  i declare that my lord kew has acted with great forbearance and under the most brutal provocationthe most brutal provocation entendezvows m cabasse cried out m de florac rushing forward to the gascon who had now risen monsieurs conduct has been unworthy of a frenchman and a gallant homme  d it he has had it on his nob though said lord viscount rooster laconically  ah roosterre ceci nest pas pour rire florac cried sadly as they both walked away with lord kew i wish that first blood was all that was to be shed in this quarrel  gaw how he did go down cried rooster convulsed with laughter  i am very sorry for it said kew quite seriously i couldnt help it god forgive me and he hung down his head he thought of the past and its levities and punishment coming after him pede claudo it was with all his heart the contrite young man said god forgive me he would take what was to follow as the penalty of what had gone before  pallas te hoc vulnere pallas immolat mon pauvre kiou said his french friend and lord rooster whose classical education had been much neglected turned round and said hullo mate what ships that  viscount rooster had not been two hours in bed when the count de punter formerly of the black jaegers waited upon him upon the part of m de castillonnes and the earl of kew who had referred him to the viscount to arrange matters for a meeting between them as the meeting must take place out of the baden territory and they ought to move before the police prevented them the count proposed that they should at once make for france where as it was an affair of honneur they would assuredly be let to enter without passports  lady anne and lady kew heard that the gentlemen after the ball had all gone out on a huntingparty and were not alarmed for fourandtwenty hours at least on the next day none of them returned and on the day after the family heard that lord kew had met with rather a dangerous accident but all the town knew he had been shot by m de castillonnes on one of the islands on the rhine opposite kehl where he was now lying     chapter xxxv across the alps   our discursive muse must now take her place in the little britzska in which clive newcome and his companions are travelling and cross the alps in that vehicle beholding the snows on st gothard and the beautiful region through which the ticino rushes on its way to the lombard lakes and the corncovered great plains of the milanese and that royal city with the cathedral for its glittering crown only less magnificent than the imperial dome of rome i have some long letters from mr clive written during this youthful tour every step of which from the departure at baden to the gate of milan he describes as beautiful and doubtless the delightful scenes through which the young man went had their effect in soothing any private annoyances with which his journey commenced the aspect of nature in that fortunate route which he took is so noble and cheering that our private affairs and troubles shrink away abashed before that serene splendour o sweet peaceful scene of azure lake and snowcrowned mountain so wonderfully lovely is your aspect that it seems like heaven almost and as if grief and care could not enter it what young clives private cares were i knew not as yet in those days and he kept them out of his letters it was only in the intimacy of future life that some of these pains were revealed to me  some three months after taking leave of miss ethel our young gentleman found himself at rome with his friend ridley still for a companion many of us young or middleaged have felt that delightful shock which the first sight of the great city inspires there is one other place of which the view strikes one with an emotion even greater than that with which we look at rome where augustus was reigning when he saw the day whose birthplace is separated but by a hill or two from the awful gates of jerusalem who that has beheld both can forget that first aspect of either at the end of years the emotion occasioned by the sight still thrills in your memory and it smites you as at the moment when you first viewed it  the business of the present novel however lies neither with priest nor pagan but with mr clive newcome and his affairs and his companions at this period of his life nor if the gracious reader expects to hear of cardinals in scarlet and noble roman princes and princesses will he find such in this history the only noble roman into whose mansion our friend got admission was the prince polonia whose footmen wear the liveries of the english royal family who gives gentlemen and even painters cash upon good letters of credit and once or twice in a season opens his transtiberine palace and treats his customers to a ball our friend clive used jocularly to say he believed there were no romans there were priests in portentous hats there were friars with shaven crowns there were the sham peasantry who dressed themselves out in masquerade costumes with bagpipe and goatskin with crossed leggings and scarlet petticoats who let themselves out to artists at so many pauls per sitting but he never passed a romans door except to buy a cigar or to purchase a handkerchief thither as elsewhere we carry our insular habits with us we have a little england at paris a little england at munich dresden everywhere our friend is an englishman and did at rome as the english do  there was the polite english society the society that flocks to see the colosseum lighted up with blue fire that flocks to the vatican to behold the statues by torchlight that hustles into the churches on public festivals in black veils and deputylieutenants uniforms and stares and talks and uses operaglasses while the pontiffs of the roman church are performing its ancient rites and the crowds of faithful are kneeling round the altars the society which gives its balls and dinners has its scandal and bickerings its aristocrats parvenus toadies imported from belgravia has its club its hunt and its hyde park on the pincio and there is the other little english world the broadhatted longbearded velvetjacketed jovial colony of the artists who have their own feasts haunts and amusements by the side of their aristocratic compatriots with whom but few of them have the honour to mingle  j j and clive engaged pleasant lofty apartments in the via gregoriana generations of painters had occupied these chambers and gone their way the windows of their paintingroom looked into a quaint old garden where there were ancient statues of the imperial time a babbling fountain and noble orangetrees with broad clustering leaves and golden balls of fruit glorious to look upon their walks abroad were endlessly pleasant and delightful in every street there were scores of pictures of the graceful characteristic italian life which our painters seem one and all to reject preferring to depict their quack brigands contadini pifferari and the like because thompson painted them before jones and jones before thompson and so on backwards into time there were the children at play the women huddled round the steps of the open doorways in the kindly roman winter grim portentous old hags such as michael angelo painted draped in majestic raggery mothers and swarming bambins slouching countrymen dark of beard and noble of countenance posed in superb attitudes lazy tattered and majestic there came the red troops the black troops the blue troops of the army of priests the snuffy regiments of capuchins grave and grotesque the trim french abbes my lord the bishop with his footman those wonderful footmen my lord the cardinal in his ramshackle coach and his two nay three footmen behind himflunkeys that look as if they had been dressed by the costumier of a british pantomime coach with prodigious emblazonments of hats and coatsofarms that seems as if it came out of the pantomime too and was about to turn into something else so it is that what is grand to some persons eyes appears grotesque to others and for certain sceptical persons that step which we have heard of between the sublime and the ridiculous is not visible  i wish it were not so writes clive in one of the letters wherein he used to pour his full heart out in those days i see these people at their devotions and envy them their rapture a friend who belongs to the old religion took me last week into a church where the virgin lately appeared in person to a jewish gentleman flashed down upon him from heaven in light and splendour celestial and of course straightway converted him my friend bade me look at the picture and kneeling down beside me i know prayed with all his honest heart that the truth might shine down upon me too but i saw no glimpse of heaven at all i saw but a poor picture an altar with blinking candles a church hung with tawdry strips of red and white calico the good kind w went away humbly saying that such might have happened again if heaven so willed it i could not but feel a kindness and admiration for the good man i know his works are made to square with his faith that he dines on a crust lives as chaste as a hermit and gives his all to the poor  our friend j j very different to myself in so many respects so superior in all is immensely touched by these ceremonies they seem to answer to some spiritual want of his nature and he comes away satisfied as from a feast where i have only found vacancy of course our first pilgrimage was to st peters what a walk under what noble shadows does one pass how great and liberal the houses are with generous casements and courts and great grey portals which giants might get through and keep their turbans on why the houses are twice as tall as lamb court itself and over them hangs a noble dinge a venerable mouldy splendour over the solemn portals are ancient mystic escutcheonsvast shields of princes and cardinals such as ariostos knights might take down and every figure about them is a picture by himself at every turn there is a temple in every court a brawling fountain besides the people of the streets and houses and the army of priests black and brown theres a great silent population of marble there are battered gods tumbled out of olympus and broken in the fall and set up under niches and over fountains there are senators namelessly noselessly noiselessly seated under archways or lurking in courts and gardens and then besides these defunct ones of whom these old figures may be said to be the corpses there is the reigning family a countless carved hierarchy of angels saints confessors of the latter dynasty which has conquered the court of jove i say pen i wish warrington would write the history of the last of the pagans did you never have a sympathy for them as the monks came rushing into their temples kicking down their poor altars smashing the fair calm faces of their gods and sending their vestals aflying they are always preaching here about the persecution of the christians are not the churches full of martyrs with choppers in their meek heads virgins on gridirons riddled st sebastians and the like but have they never persecuted in their turn o me you and i know better who were bred up near to the pens of smithfield where protestants and catholics have taken their turn to be roasted  you pass through an avenue of angels and saints on the bridge across tiber all in action their great wings seem clanking their marble garments clapping st michael descending upon the fiend has been caught and bronzified just as he lighted on the castle of st angelo his enemy doubtless fell crushing through the roof and so downwards he is as natural as blank versethat bronze angelset rhythmic grandiose youll see some day or other hes a great sonnet sir im sure of that milton wrote in bronze i am sure virgil polished off his georgics in marblesweet calm shapes exquisite harmonies of line as for the aeneid that sir i consider to be so many basreliefs mural ornaments which affect me not much  i think i have lost sight of st peters havent i yet it is big enough how it makes your heart beat when you first see it ours did as we came in at night from civita vecchia and saw a great ghostly darkling dome rising solemnly up into the grey night and keeping us company ever so long as we drove as if it had been an orb fallen out of heaven with its light put out as you look at it from the pincio and the sun sets behind it surely that aspect of earth and sky is one of the grandest in the world i dont like to say that the facade of the church is ugly and obtrusive as long as the dome overawes that facade is supportable you advance towards itthrough oh such a noble court with fountains flashing up to meet the sunbeams and right and left of you two sweeping halfcrescents of great columns but you pass by the courtiers and up to the steps of the throne and the dome seems to disappear behind it it is as if the throne was upset and the king had toppled over  there must be moments in rome especially when every man of friendly heart who writes himself english and protestant must feel a pang at thinking that he and his countrymen are insulated from european christendom an ocean separates us from one shore or the other one can see the neighbour cliffs on clear days one must wish sometimes that there were no stormy gulf between us and from canterbury to rome a pilgrim could pass and not drown beyond dover of the beautiful parts of the great mother church i believe among us many people have no idea we think of lazy friars of pining cloistered virgins of ignorant peasants worshipping wood and stones bought and sold indulgences absolutions and the like commonplaces of protestant satire lo yonder inscription which blazes round the dome of the temple so great and glorious it looks like heaven almost and as if the words were written in stars it proclaims to all the world this is that peter and on this rock the church shall be built against which hell shall not prevail under the bronze canopy his throne is lit with lights that have been burning before it for ages round this stupendous chamber are ranged the grandees of his court faith seems to be realised in their marble figures some of them were alive but yesterday others to be as blessed as they walk the world even now doubtless and the commissioners of heaven here holding their court a hundred years hence shall authoritatively announce their beatification the signs of their power shall not be wanting they heal the sick open the eyes of the blind cause the lame to walk today as they did eighteen centuries ago are there not crowds ready to bear witness to their wonders isnt there a tribunal appointed to try their claims advocates to plead for and against prelates and clergy and multitudes of faithful to back and believe them thus you shall kiss the hand of a priest today who has given his to a friar whose bones are already beginning to work miracles who has been the disciple of another whom the church has just proclaimed a sainthand in hand they hold by one another till the line is lost up in heaven come friend let us acknowledge this and go and kiss the toe of st peter alas theres the channel always between us and we no more believe in the miracles of st thomas of canterbury than that the bones of his grace john bird who sits in st thomass chair presently will work wondrous cures in the year 2000 that his statue will speak or his portrait by sir thomas lawrence will wink  so you see at those grand ceremonies which the roman church exhibits at christmas i looked on as a protestant holy father on his throne or in his palanquin cardinals with their tails and their trainbearers mitred bishops and abbots regiments of friars and clergy relics exposed for adoration columns draped altars illuminated incense smoking organs pealing and boxes of piping soprani swiss guards with slashed breeches and fringed halbertsbetween us and all this splendour of oldworld ceremony theres an ocean flowing and yonder old statue of peter might have been jupiter again surrounded by a procession of flamens and augurs and augustus as pontifex maximus to inspect the sacrificesand my feelings at the spectacle had been doubtless pretty much the same  shall i utter any more heresies i am an unbeliever in raphaels transfigurationthe scream of that devilpossessed boy in the lower part of the figure of eight a stolen boy too jars the whole music of the composition on michael angelos great wall the grotesque and terrible are not out of place what an awful achievement fancy the state of mind of the man who worked itas alone day after day he devised and drew those dreadful figures suppose in the days of the olympian dynasty the subdued titan rebels had been set to ornament a palace for jove they would have brought in some such tremendous work or suppose that michael descended to the shades and brought up this picture out of the halls of limbo i like a thousand and a thousand times better to think of raphaels loving spirit as he looked at women and children his beautiful face must have shone like sunshine his kind hand must have caressed the sweet figures as he formed them if i protest against the transfiguration and refuse to worship at that altar before which so many generations have knelt there are hundreds of others which i salute thankfully it is not so much in the set harangues to take another metaphor as in the daily tones and talk that his voice is so delicious sweet poetry and music and tender hymns drop from him he lifts his pencil and something gracious falls from it on the paper how noble his mind must have been it seems but to receive and his eye seems only to rest on what is great and generous and lovely you walk through crowded galleries where are pictures ever so large and pretentious and come upon a grey paper or a little fresco bearing his markand over all the brawl and the throng recognise his sweet

them a notice in the pall mall gazettewont youfor the sake of old times and yours affectionately clive newcome     chapter xxxvi in which m de florac is promoted   however much madame la duchesse divry was disposed to admire and praise her own conduct in the affair which ended so unfortunately for poor lord kew between whom and the gascon her grace vowed that she had done everything in her power to prevent a battle the old duke her lord was it appeared by no means delighted with his wifes behaviour nay visited her with his very sternest displeasure miss ogrady the duchesses companion and her little girls instructress at this time resigned her functions in the ivry family it is possible that in the recriminations consequent upon the governesss dismissal the miss irlandaise in whom the family had put so much confidence divulged stories unfavourable to her patroness and caused the indignation of the duke her husband between florac and the duchesse there was also open war and rupture he had been one of kews seconds in the latters affair with the vicomtes countryman he had even cried out for fresh pistols and proposed to engage castillonnes when his gallant principal fell and though a second duel was luckily averted as murderous and needless m de florac never hesitated afterwards and in all companies to denounce with the utmost virulence the instigator and the champion of the odious original quarrel he vowed that the duchesse had shot le petit kiou as effectually as if she had herself fired the pistol at his breast murderer poisoner brinvilliers a hundred more such epithets he used against his kinswoman regretting that the good old times were pastthat there was no chambre ardente to try her and no rack and wheel to give her her due  the biographer of the newcomes has no need although he possesses the fullest information to touch upon the duchesses doings further than as they relate to that most respectable english family when the duke took his wife into the country florac never hesitated to say that to live with her was dangerous for the old man and to cry out to his friends of the boulevards or the jockey club ma parole dhonneur cette femme le

weight of domestic care too heavy to bearare not blows such as these constantly striking people down in this long parenthesis we are wandering ever so far away from m le duc and madame la duchesse divry and from the vivacious floracs statement regarding his kinsman that that woman will kill him  there is this at least to be said that if the duc divry did die he was a very old gentleman and had been a great viveur for at least threescore years of his life as prince de moncontour in his fathers time before the revolution during the emigration even after the restoration m le duc had vecu with an extraordinary vitality he had gone through good and bad fortune extreme poverty display and splendour affairs of loveaffairs of honourand of one disease or another a man must die at the end after the baden businessand he had dragged off his wife to champagnethe duke became greatly broken he brought his little daughter to a convent at paris putting the child under the special guardianship of madame de florac with whom and with whose family in these latter days the old chief of the house effected a complete reconciliation the duke was now for ever coming to madame de florac he poured all his wrongs and griefs into her ear with garrulous senile eagerness that little duchesse is a monstre a femme deugene sue the vicomte used to say the poor old duke he cryma parole dhonneur he cry and i cry too when he comes to recount to my poor mother whose sainted heart is the asile of all griefs a real hotel dieu my word the most sacred with beds for all the afflicted with sweet words like sisters of charity to minister to themi cry mon bon pendennis when this vieillard tells his stories about his wife and tears his white hairs to the feet of my mother  when the little antoinette was separated by her father from her mother the duchesse divry it might have been expected that that poetess would have dashed off a few more cris de lame shrieking according to her wont and baring and beating that shrivelled maternal bosom of hers from which her child had been just torn the child skipped and laughed to go away to the convent it was only when she left madame de florac that she used to cry and when urged by that good lady to exhibit a little decorous sentiment in writing to her mamma antoinette would ask in her artless way pourquoi mamma used never to speak to me except sometimes before the world before ladies that understands itself when her gentleman came she put me to the door then she gave me tapes o oui she gave me tapes i cry no more she has so much made to cry m le duc that it is quite enough of one in a family so madame la duchesse divry did not weep even in print for the loss of her pretty little antoinette besides she was engaged at that time by other sentimental occupations a young grazier of their neighbouring town of an aspiring mind and remarkable poetic talents engrossed the duchesses platonic affections at this juncture when he had sold his beasts at market he would ride over and read rousseau and schiller with madame la duchesse who formed him his pretty young wife was rendered miserable by all these readings but what could the poor little ignorant countrywoman know of platonism faugh there is more than one woman we see in society smiling about from house to house pleasant and sentimental and formosa superne enough but i fancy a fishs tail is flapping under her fine flounces and a forked fin at the end of it  finer flounces finer bonnets more lovely wreaths more beautiful lace smarter carriages bigger white bows larger footmen were not seen during all the season of 18 than appeared round about st georges hanover square in the beautiful month of june succeeding that september when so many of our friends the newcomes were assembled at baden those flaunting carriages powdered and favoured footmen were in attendance upon members of the newcome family and their connexions who were celebrating what is called a marriage in high life in the temple within shall we set down a catalogue of the dukes marquises earls who were present cousins of the lovely bride are they not already in the morning herald and court journal as well as in the newcome chronicle and independent and the dorking intelligencer and chanticleer weekly gazette there they are all printed at full length sure enough the name of the bride lady clara pulleyn the lovely and accomplished daughter of the earl and countess of dorking of the beautiful bridesmaids the ladies henrietta belinda adelaide pulleyn miss newcome miss alice newcome miss maude newcome miss anna maria hobson newcome and all the other persons engaged in the ceremony it was performed by the right honourable viscount gallowglass bishop of ballyshannon brotherinlaw to the bride assisted by the honourable and reverend hercules ogrady his lordships chaplain and the reverend john bulders rector of st marys newcome then follow the names of all the nobility who were present and of the noble and distinguished personages who signed the book then comes an account of the principal dresses chefsdoeuvre of madame crinoline of the brides coronal of brilliants supplied by messrs morr and stortimerof the veil of priceless chantilly lace the gift of the dowager countess of kew then there is a description of the weddingbreakfast at the house of the brides noble parents and of the cake decorated by messrs gunter with the most delicious taste and the sweetest hymeneal allusions  no mention was made by the fashionable chronicler of a slight disturbance which occurred at st georges and which was indeed out of the province of such a genteel purveyor of news before the marriage service began a woman of vulgar appearance and disorderly aspect accompanied by two scared children who took no part in the disorder occasioned by their mothers proceeding except by their tears and outcries to augment the disquiet made her appearance in one of the pews of the church was noted there by persons in the vestry was requested to retire by a beadle and was finally induced to quit the sacred precincts of the building by the very strongest persuasion of a couple of policemen x and y laughed at one another and nodded their heads knowingly as the poor wretch with her whimpering boys was led away they understood very well who the personage was who had come to disturb the matrimonial ceremony it did not commence until mrs de lacy as this lady chose to be called had quitted this temple of hymen she slunk through the throng of emblazoned carriages and the press of footmen arrayed as splendidly as solomon in his glory john jeered at thomas william turned his powdered head and signalled jeames who answered with a corresponding grin as the woman with sobs and wild imprecations and frantic appeals made her way through the splendid crowd escorted by her aidesdecamp in blue i dare say her little history was discussed at many a dinnertable that day in the basement story of several fashionable houses i know that at clubs in st jamess the facetious little anecdote was narrated a young fellow came to bayss after the marriage breakfast and mentioned the circumstance with funny comments although the morning post in describing this affair in high life naturally omitted all mention of such low people as mrs de lacy and her children  those people who knew the noble families whose union had been celebrated by such a profusion of grandees fine equipages and footmen brass bands brilliant toilets and wedding favours asked how it was that lord kew did not assist at barnes newcomes marriage other persons in society inquired waggishly why jack belsize was not present to give lady clara away  as for jack belsize his clubs had not been ornamented by his presence for a year past it was said he had broken the bank at hombourg last autumn had been heard of during the winter at milan venice and vienna and when a few months after the marriage of barnes newcome and lady clara jacks elder brother died and he himself became the next in succession to the title and estates of highgate many folks said it was a pity little barneys marriage had taken place so soon lord kew was not present because kew was still abroad he had had a gambling duel with a frenchman and a narrow squeak for his life he had turned roman catholic some men said others vowed that he had joined the methodist persuasion at all events kew had given up his wild courses broken with the turf and sold his stud off he was delicate yet and his mother was taking care of him between whom and the old dowager of kew who had made up barneys marriage as everybody knew there was no love lost  then who was the prince de moncontour who with his princess figured at this noble marriage there was a moncontour the duc divrys son but he died at paris before the revolution of 30 one or two of the oldsters at bayss major pendennis general tufto old cacklebythe old fogies in a wordremembered the duke of ivry when he was here during the emigration and when he was called prince de moncontour the title of the eldest son of the family ivry was dead having buried his son before him and having left only a daughter by that young woman whom he married and who led him such a life who was this present moncontour  he was a gentleman to whom the reader has already been presented though when we lately saw him at baden he did not enjoy so magnificent a title early in the year of barnes newcomes marriage there came to england and to our modest apartment in the temple a gentleman bringing a letter of recommendation from our dear young clive who said that the bearer the vicomte de florac was a great friend of his and of the colonels who had known his family from boyhood a friend of our clive and our colonel was sure of a welcome in lamb court we gave him the hand of hospitality the best cigar in the box the easychair with only one broken leg the dinner in chambers and at the club the banquet at greenwich where ma foi the little whites baits elicited his profound satisfaction in a word did our best to honour that bill which our young clive had drawn upon us we considered the young one in the light of a nephew of our own we took a pride in him and were fond of him and as for the colonel did we not love and honour him would we not do our utmost in behalf of any stranger who came recommended to us by thomas newcomes good word so florac was straightway admitted to our companionship we showed him the town and some of the modest pleasures thereof we introduced him to the haunt and astonished him by the company which he met there between brents deserter and mark wilders garryowen florac sang      tiens voici ma pipe voila mon briquet     et quand la tulipe fait le noir trajet     que tu sois la seule dans le regiment     avec la brulegueule de ton cher zamant  to the delight of tom sarjent who though he only partially comprehended the words of the song pronounced the singer to be a rare gentleman full of most excellent differences we took our florac to the derby we presented him in fitzroy square whither we still occasionally went for clives and our dear colonels sake  the vicomte pronounced himself strongly in favour of the blanche misse little rosey mackenzie of whom we have lost sight for some few chapters mrs mac he considered my faith to be a woman superb he used to kiss the tips of his own fingers in token of his admiration for the lovely widow he pronounced her again more pretty than her daughter and paid her a thousand compliments which she received with exceeding goodhumour if the vicomte gave us to understand presently that rosey and her mother were both in love with him but that for all the world he would not meddle with the happiness of his dear little clive nothing unfavourable to the character or constancy of the beforementioned ladies must be inferred from m de floracs speech his firm conviction being that no woman could pass many hours in his society without danger to her subsequent peace of mind  for some little time we had no reason to suspect that our french friend was not particularly well furnished with the current coin of the realm without making any show of wealth he would at first cheerfully engage in our little parties his lodgings in the neighbourhood of leicester square though dingy were such as many noble foreign exiles have inhabited it was not until he refused to join some pleasuretrip which we of lamb court proposed honestly confessing his poverty that we were made aware of the vicomtes little temporary calamity and as we became more intimate with him he acquainted us with great openness with the history of all his fortunes he described energetically that splendid run of luck which had set in at baden with clives loan his winnings at that fortunate period had carried him through the winter with considerable brilliancy but bouillotte and mademoiselle atala of the varietes une ogresse mon cher who devours thirty of our young men every year in her cavern in the rue de breda had declared against him and the poor vicomtes pockets were almost empty when he came to london  he was amiably communicative regarding himself and told us his virtues and his faults if indeed a passion for play and for women could be considered as faults in a gay young fellow of two or three and forty with a like engaging frankness he would weep in describing his angel mother he would fly off again into tirades respecting the wickedness the wit the extravagance the charms of the young lady of the varietes he would then in conversation introduce us to madame de florac nee higg of manchesterre his prattle was incessant and to my friend mr warrington especially he was an object of endless delight and amusement and wonder he would roll and smoke countless paper cigars talking unrestrainedly when we were not busy silent when we were engaged he would only rarely partake of our meals and altogether refused all offers of pecuniary aid he disappeared at dinnertime into the mysterious purlieus of leicester square and dark ordinaries only frequented by frenchmen as we walked with him in the regent street precincts he would exchange marks of recognition with many dusky personages smoking bravos and whiskered refugees of his nation  that gentleman he would say who has done me the honour to salute me is a coiffeur of the most celebrated he forms the deuces of our tabledhote bon jour mon cher monsieur we are friends though not of the same opinion monsieur is a republican of the most distinguished conspirator of profession and at this time engaged in constructing an infernal machine to the address of his majesty louis philippe king of the french who is my friend with the scarlet beard and the white paletot my good warrington you do not move in the world you make yourself a hermit my dear not know monsieurmonsieur is secretary to mademoiselle caracoline the lovely rider at the circus of astley i shall be charmed to introduce you to this amiable society some day at our tabledhote  warrington vowed that the company of floracs friends would be infinitely more amusing than the noblest society ever chronicled in the morning post but we were neither sufficiently familiar with the french language to make conversation in that tongue as pleasant to us as talking in our own and so were content with floracs description of his compatriots which the vicomte delivered in that charming frenchenglish of which he was a master  however threadbare in his garments poor in purse and eccentric in morals our friend was his manners were always perfectly gentlemanlike and he draped himself in his poverty with the grace of a spanish grandee it must be confessed that the grandee loved the estaminet where he could play billiards with the first comer that he had a passion for the gamblinghouse that he was a loose and disorderly nobleman but in whatever company he found himself a certain kindness simplicity and politeness distinguished him always he bowed to the damsel who sold him a penny cigar as graciously as to a duchess he crushed a manants impertinence or familiarity as haughtily as his noble ancestors ever did at the louvre at marli or versailles he declined to obtemperer to his landladys request to pay his rent but he refused with a dignity which struck the woman with awe and king alfred over the celebrated muffin on which gandish and other painters have exercised their genius could not have looked more noble than florac in a robedechambre once gorgeous but shady now as became its owners clouded fortunes toasting his bit of bacon at his lodgings when the fare even of his tabledhote had grown too dear for him  as we know from gandishs work that better times were in store for the wandering monarch and that the officers came acquainting him that his people demanded his presence a grands cris when of course king alfred laid down the toast and resumed the sceptre so in the case of florac two humble gentlemen inhabitants of lamb court and members of the upper temple had the good luck to be the heralds as it were nay indeed the occasion of the rising fortunes of the prince de moncontour florac had informed us of the death of his cousin the duc divry by whose demise the vicomtes father the old count de florac became the representative of the house of ivry and possessor through his relatives bequest of an old chateau still more gloomy and spacious than the counts own house in the faubourg st germaina chateau of which the woods domains and appurtenances had been lopped off by the revolution monsieur le comte florac says has not wished to change his name at his age he has shrugged his old shoulder and said it was not the trouble to make to engrave a new card and for me the philosophical vicomte added of what good shall be a title of prince in the position where i find myself it is wonderful for us who inhabit a country where rank is worshipped with so admirable a reverence to think that there are many gentlemen in france who actually have authentic titles and do not choose to bear them  mr george warrington was hugely amused with this notion of floracs ranks and dignities the idea of the prince purchasing penny cigars of the prince mildly expostulating with his landlady regarding the rent of his punting for halfcrowns at a neighbouring hall in air street whither the poor gentleman desperately ran when he had money in his pocket tickled georges sense of humour it was warrington who gravely saluted the vicomte and compared him to king alfred on that afternoon when we happened to call upon him and found him engaged in cooking his modest dinner  we were bent upon an excursion to greenwich and on having our friends company on that voyage and we induced the vicomte to forgo his bacon and be our guest for once george warrington chose to indulge in a great deal of ironical pleasantry in the course of the afternoons excursion as we went down the river he pointed out to florac the very window in the tower where the captive duke of orleans used to sit when he was an inhabitant of that fortress at greenwich which palace florac informed us was built by queen elizabeth george showed the very spot where raleigh laid his cloak down to enable her majesty to step over a puddle in a word he mystified m de florac such was mr warringtons reprehensible spirit  it happened that mr barnes newcome came to dine at greenwich on the same day when our little party took place he had come down to meet rooster and one or two other noble friends whose names he took care to give us cursing them at the same time for having thrown him over having missed his own company mr barnes condescended to join ours warrington gravely thanking him for the great honour which he conferred upon us by volunteering to take a place at our table barnes drank freely and was good enough to resume his acquaintance with monsieur de florac whom he perfectly well recollected at baden but had thought proper to forget on the one or two occasions when they had met in public since the vicomtes arrival in this country there are few men who can drop and resume an acquaintance with such admirable selfpossession as barnes newcome when over our dessert by which time all tongues were unloosed and each man talked gaily george warrington feelingly thanked barnes in a little mock speech for his great kindness in noticing us presenting him at the same time to florac as the ornament of the city the greatest banker of his age the beloved kinsman of their friend clive who was always writing about him barnes said with one of his accustomed curses he did not know whether mr warrington was chaffing him or not and indeed could never make him out warrington replied that he never could make himself out and if ever mr barnes could george would thank him for information on that subject  florac like most frenchmen very sober in his potations left us for a while over ours which were conducted after the more liberal english manner and retired to smoke his cigar on the terrace barnes then freely uttered his sentiments regarding him which were not more favourable than those which the young gentleman generally emitted respecting gentlemen whose backs were turned he had known a little of florac the year before at baden he had been mixed up with kew in that confounded row in which kew was hit he was an adventurer a pauper a blackleg a regular greek he had heard florac was of old family that was true but what of that he was only one of those d french counts everybody was a count in france confound em the claret was beastlynot fit for a gentleman to drinkhe swigged off a great bumper as he was making the remark for barnes newcome abuses the men and things which he uses and perhaps is better served than more grateful persons  count cries warrington what do you mean by talking about beggarly counts floracs family is one of the noblest and most ancient in europe it is more ancient than your illustrious friend the barbersurgeon it was illustrious before the house ay or the pagoda of kew was in existence and he went on to describe how florac by the demise of his kinsman was now actually prince de moncontour though he did not choose to assume that title very likely the noble gascon drink in which george had been indulging imparted a certain warmth and eloquence to his descriptions of floracs good qualities high birth and considerable patrimony barnes looked quite amazed and scared at these announcements then laughed and declared once more that warrington was chaffing him  as sure as the black prince was lord of acquitaineas sure as the english were masters of bordeauxand why did we ever lose the country cries george filling himself a bumperevery word i have said about florac is true and florac coming in at this juncture havin just finished his cigar george turned round and made him a fine speech in the french language in which he lauded his constancy and goodhumour under evil fortune paid him two or three more cordial compliments and finished by drinking another great bumper to his good health  florac took a little wine replied with effusion to the toast which his excellent his noble friend had just carried we rapped our glasses at the end of the speech the landlord himself seemed deeply touched by it as he stood by with a fresh bottle it is good wineit is honest wineit is capital wine says george and honni soit qui mal y pence what business have you you little beggar to abuse it my ancestor drank the wine and wore the motto round his leg long before a newcome ever showed his pale face in lombard street george warrington never bragged about his pedigree except under certain influences i am inclined to think that on this occasion he really did find the claret very good  you dont mean to say says barnes addressing florac in french on which he piqued himself que vous avez un tel manche a votre nom et que vous ne lusez pas  florac shrugged his shoulders he at first did not understand that familiar figure of english speech or what was meant by having a handle to your name moncontour cannot dine better than florac he said florac has two louis in his pocket and moncontour exactly forty shillings floracs proprietor will ask moncontour tomorrow for five weeks rent and as for floracs friends my dear they will burst out laughing to moncontours nose how droll you english are this acute french observer afterwards said laughing and recalling the incident did you not see how that little barnes as soon as he knew my title of prince changed his manner and became all respect towards me this indeed monsieur de floracs two friends remarked with no little amusement barnes began quite well to remember their pleasant days at baden and talked of their acquaintance there barnes offered the prince the vacant seat in his brougham and was ready to set him down anywhere that he wished in town  bah says florac we came by the steamer and i prefer the peniboat but the hospitable barnes nevertheless called upon florac the next day and now having partially explained how the prince de moncontour was present at mr barnes newcomes wedding let us show how it was that barness firstcousin the earl of kew did not attend that ceremony     chapter xxxvii return to lord kew   we do not propose to describe at length or with precision the circumstances of the duel which ended so unfortunately for young lord kew the meeting was inevitable after the public acts and insult of the morning the maddened frenchman went to it convinced that his antagonist had wilfully outraged him eager to show his bravery upon the body of an englishman and as proud as if he had been going into actual war that commandment the sixth in our decalogue which forbids the doing of murder and the injunction which directly follows on the same table have been repealed by a very great number of frenchmen for many years past and to take the neighbours wife and his life subsequently has not been an uncommon practice with the politest people in the world castillonnes had no idea but that he was going to the field of honour stood with an undaunted scowl before his enemys pistol and discharged his own and brought down his opponent with a grim satisfaction and a comfortable conviction afterwards that he had acted en galant homme it was well for this milor that he fell at the first shot my dear the exemplary young frenchman remarked a second might have been yet more fatal to him ordinarily i am sure of my coup and you conceive that in an affair so grave it was absolutely necessary that one or other should remain on the ground nay should m de kew recover from his wound it was m de castillonnes intention to propose a second encounter between himself and that nobleman it had been lord kews determination never to fire upon his opponent a confession which he made not to his second poor scared lord rooster who bore the young earl to kehl but to some of his nearest relatives who happened fortunately to be not far from him when he received his wound and who came with all the eagerness of love to watch by his bedside  we have said that lord kews mother lady walham and her second son were staying at hombourg when the earls disaster occurred they had proposed to come to baden to see kews new bride and to welcome her but the presence of her motherinlaw deterred lady walham who gave up her hearts wish in bitterness of spirit knowing very well that a meeting between the old countess and herself could only produce the wrath pain and humiliation which their coming together always occasioned it was lord kew who bade rooster send for his mother and not for lady kew and as soon as she received those sad tidings you may be sure the poor lady hastened to the bed where her wounded boy lay  the fever had declared itself and the young man had been delirious more than once his wan face lighted up with joy when he saw his mother he put his little feverish hand out of the bed to heri knew you would come dear he said and you know i never would have fired upon the poor frenchman the fond mother allowed no sign of terror or grief to appear upon her face so as to disturb her firstborn and darling but no doubt she prayed by his side as such loving hearts know how to pray for the forgiveness of his trespass who had forgiven those who sinned against him i knew i should be hit george said kew to his brother when they were alone i always expected some such end as this my life has been very wild and reckless and you george have always been faithful to our mother you will make a better lord kew than i have been george god bless you george flung himself down with sobs by his brothers bedside and swore frank had always been the best fellow the best brother the kindest heart the warmest friend in the world loveprayerrepentance thus met over the young mans bed anxious and humble hearts his own the least anxious and the most humble awaited the dread award of life or death and the world and its ambition and vanities were shut out from the darkened chamber where the awful issue was being tried  our history has had little to do with characters resembling this lady it is of the world and things pertaining to it things beyond it as the writer imagines scarcely belong to the novelists province who is he that he should assume the divines office or turn his desk into a preachers pulpit in that career of pleasure of idleness of crime we might call it but that the chronicler of worldly matters had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day the gentle widowed lady mother of lord kew could but keep aloof deploring the course upon which her dear young prodigal had entered and praying with that saintly love those pure supplications with which good mothers follow their children for her boys repentance and return very likely her mind was narrow very likely the precautions which she had used in the lads early days the tutors and directors she had set about him the religious studies and practices to which she would have subjected him had served only to vex and weary the young pupil and to drive his high spirit into revolt it is hard to convince a woman perfectly pure in her life and intentions ready to die if need were for her own faith having absolute confidence in the instruction of her teachers that she and they with all their sermons may be doing harm when the young catechist yawns over his reverences discourse who knows but it is the doctors vanity which is enraged and not heaven which is offended it may have been in the differences which took place between her son and her the good lady walham never could comprehend the lads side of the argument or how his protestantism against her doctrines should exhibit itself on the turf the gamingtable or the stage of the operahouse and thus but for the misfortune under which poor kew now lay bleeding these two loving hearts might have remained through life asunder but by the boys bedside in the paroxysms of his fever in the wild talk of his delirium in the sweet patience and kindness with which he received his dear nurses attentions the gratefulness with which he thanked the servants who waited on him the fortitude with which he suffered the surgeons dealings with his woundsthe widowed woman had an opportunity to admire with an exquisite thankfulness the generous goodness of her son and in those hours those sacred hours passed in her own chamber of prayers fears hopes recollections and passionate maternal love wrestling with fate for her darlings lifeno doubt the humbled creature came to acknowledge that her own course regarding him had been wrong and even more for herself than for him implored forgiveness  for some time george barnes had to send but doubtful and melancholy bulletins to lady kew and the newcome family at baden who were all greatly moved and affected by the accident which had befallen poor kew lady kew broke out in wrath and indignation we may be sure the duchesse divry offered to condole with her upon kews mishap the day after the news arrived at baden and indeed came to visit her the old lady had just received other disquieting intelligence she was just going out but she bade her servant to inform the duchess that she was never more at home to the duchesse divry the message was not delivered properly or the person for whom it was intended did not choose to understand it for presently as the countess was hobbling across the walk on her way to her daughters residence she met the duchesse divry who saluted her with a demure curtsey and a commonplace expression of condolence the queen of scots was surrounded by the chief part of her court saving of course mm castillonnes and punter absent on service we were speaking of this deplorable affair said madame divry which indeed was the truth although she said it how we pity you madame blackball and loder cruchecassee and schlangenbad assumed sympathetic countenances  trembling on her cane the old countess glared out upon madame divry i pray you madame she said in french never again to address me the word if i had like you assassins in my pay i would have you killed do you hear me and she hobbled on her way the household to which she went was in terrible agitation the kind lady anne frightened beyond measure poor ethel full of dread and feeling guilty almost as if she had been the cause as indeed she was the occasion of kews misfortune and the family had further cause of alarm from the shock which the news had given to sir brian it has been said that he had had illnesses of late which caused his friends much anxiety he had passed two months at aixlachapelle his physicians dreading a paralytic attack and madame divrys party still sauntering on the walk the men smoking their cigars the women breathing their scandal now beheld dr finck issuing from lady annes apartments and wearing such a face of anxiety that the duchesse asked with some emotion had there been a fresh bulletin from kehl  no there had been no fresh bulletin from kehl but two hours since sir brian newcome had had a paralytic seizure  is he very bad  no says dr finck he is not very bad  how inconsolable m barnes will be said the duchesse shrugging her haggard shoulders whereas the fact was that mr barnes retained perfect presence of mind under both of the misfortunes which had befallen his family two days afterwards the duchesses husband arrived himself when we may presume that exemplary woman was too much engaged with her own affairs to be able to be interested about the doings of other people with the dukes arrival the court of mary queen of scots was broken up her majesty was conducted to lochleven where her tyrant soon dismissed her very last ladyinwaiting the confidential irish secretary whose performance had produced such a fine effect amongst the newcomes  had poor sir brian newcomes seizure occurred at an earlier period of the autumn his illness no doubt would have kept him for some months confined at baden but as he was pretty nearly the last of dr von fincks bath patients and that eminent physician longed to be off to the residenz he was pronounced in a fit condition for easy travelling in rather a brief period after his attack and it was determined to transport him to mannheim and thence by water to london and newcome  during all this period of their fathers misfortune no sister of charity could have been more tender active cheerful and watchful than miss ethel she had to wear a kind face and exhibit no anxiety when occasionally the feeble invalid made inquiries regarding poor kew at baden to catch the phrases as they came from him to acquiesce or not to deny when sir brian talked of the marriagesboth marriagestaking place at christmas sir brian was especially eager for his daughters and repeatedly with his broken words and smiles and caresses which were now quite senile declared that his ethel would make the prettiest countess in england there came a letter or two from clive no doubt to the young nurse in her sickroom manly and generous full of tenderness and affection as those letters surely were they could give but little pleasure to the young ladyindeed only add to her doubts and pain  she had told none of her friends as yet of those last words of kews which she interpreted as a farewell on the young noblemans part had she told them they were likely would not have understood kews meaning as she did and persisted in thinking that the two were reconciled at any rate whilst he and her father were still lying stricken by the blows which had prostrated them both all questions of love and marriage had been put aside did she love him she felt such a kind pity for his misfortune such an admiration for his generous gallantry such a remorse for her own wayward conduct and cruel behaviour towards this most honest and kindly and affectionate gentleman that the sum of regard which she could bestow upon him might surely be said to amount to love for such a union as that contemplated between them perhaps for any marriage no greater degree of attachment was necessary as the common cement warm friendship and thorough esteem and confidence i do not say that our young lady calculated in this matteroffact way are safe properties invested in the prudent marriage stock multiplying and bearing an increasing value with every year many a young couple of spendthrifts get through their capital of passion in the first twelve months and have no love left for the daily demands of after life o me for the day when the bank account is closed and the cupboard is empty and the firm of damon and phyllis insolvent  miss newcome we say without doubt did not make her calculations in this debtor and creditor fashion it was only the gentlemen of that family who went to lombard street but suppose she thought that regard and esteem and affection being sufficient she could joyfully and with almost all her heart bring such a portion to lord kew that her harshness towards him as contrasted with his own generosity and above all with his present pain infinitely touched her and suppose she fancied that there was another person in the world to whom did fates permit she could offer not esteem affection pity only but something ten thousand times more precious we are not in the young ladys secrets but if she has some as she sits by her fathers chair and bed who day or night will have no other attendant and as she busies herself to interpret his wants silently moves on his errands administers his potions and watches his sleep thinks of clive absent and unhappy of kew wounded and in danger she must have subject enough of thought and pain little wonder that her cheeks are pale and her eyes look red she has her cares to endure now in the world and her burden to bear in it and somehow she feels she is alone since that day when poor clives carriage drove away  in a mood of more than ordinary depression and weakness lady kew must have found her granddaughter upon one of the few occasions after the double mishap when ethel and her elder were together sir brians illness as it may be imagined affected a lady very slightly who was of an age when these calamities occasion but small disquiet and who having survived her own father her husband her son and witnessed their lordships respective demises with perfect composure could not reasonably be called upon to feel any particular dismay at the probable departure from this life of a lombard street banker who happened to be her daughters husband in fact not barnes newcome himself could await that event more philosophically so finding ethel in this melancholy mood lady kew thought a drive in the fresh air would be of service to her and sir brian happening to be asleep carried the young girl away in her barouche  they talked about lord kew of whom the accounts were encouraging and who is mending in spite of his silly mother and her medicines and as soon as he is able to move we must go and fetch him my dear lady kew graciously said before that foolish woman has made a methodist of him he is always led by the woman who is nearest him and i know one who will make of him just the best little husband in england before they had come to this delicate point the lady and her grandchild had talked kews character over the girl you may be sure having spoken feelingly and eloquently about his kindness and courage and many admirable qualities she kindled when she heard the report of his behaviour at the commencement of the fracas with m de castillonnes his great forbearance and goodnature and his resolution and magnanimity when the moment of collision came  but when lady kew arrived at that period of her discourse in which she stated that kew would make the best little husband in england poor ethels eyes filled with tears we must remember that her high spirit was worn down by watching and much varied anxiety and then she confessed that there had been no reconciliation as all the family fancied between frank and herselfon the contrary a parting which she understood to be final and she owned that her conduct towards her cousin had been most captious and cruel and that she could not expect they should ever again come together lady kew who hated sickbeds and surgeons except for herself who hated her daughterinlaw above all was greatly annoyed at the news which ethel gave her made light of if however and was quite confident that a very few words from her would place matters on their old footing and determined on forthwith setting out for kehl she would have carried ethel with her but that the poor baronet with cries and moans insisted on retaining his nurse and ethels grandmother was left to undertake this mission by herself the girl remaining behind acquiescent not unwilling owning openly a great regard and esteem for kew and the wrong which she had done him feeling secretly a sentiment which she had best smother she had received a letter from that other person and answered it with her mothers cognisance but about this little affair neither lady anne nor her daughter happened to say a word to the manager of the whole family     chapter xxxviii in which lady kew leaves his lordship quite convalescent   immediately after lord kews wound and as it was necessary to apprise the newcome family of the accident which had occurred the goodnatured young kew had himself written a brief note to acquaint his relatives with his mishap and had even taken the precaution to antedate a couple of billets to be despatched on future days kindly forgeries which told the newcome family and the countess of kew that lord kew was progressing very favourably and that his hurt was trifling the fever had set in and the young patient was lying in great danger as most of the laggards at baden knew when his friends there were set at ease by this fallacious bulletin on the third day after the accident lady walham arrived with her younger son to find lord kew in the fever which ensued after the wound as the terrible anxiety during the illness had been lady walhams so was hers the delight of the recovery the commanderinchief of the family the old lady at baden showed her sympathy by sending couriers and repeatedly issuing orders to have news of kew sickbeds scared her away invariably when illness befell a member of her family she hastily retreated from before the sufferer showing her agitation of mind however by excessive illhumour to all the others within her reach  a fortnight passed a ball had been found and extracted the fever was over the wound was progressing favourably the patient advancing towards convalescence and the mother with her child once more under her wing happier than she had been for seven years past during which her young prodigal had been running the thoughtless career of which he himself was weary and which had occasioned the fond lady such anguish those doubts which perplex many a thinking man and when formed and uttered give many a fond and faithful woman pain so exquisite had most fortunately never crossed kews mind his early impressions were such as his mother had left them and he came back to her as she would have him as a little child owning his faults with a hearty humble repentance and with a thousand simple confessions lamenting the errors of his past days we have seen him tired and ashamed of the pleasures which he was pursuing of the companions who surrounded him of the brawls and dissipations which amused him no more in those hours of danger and doubt when he had lain with death perhaps before him making up his account of the vain life which probably he would be called upon to surrender no wonder this simple kindly modest and courageous soul thought seriously of the past and of the future and prayed and resolved if a future were awarded to him it should make amends for the days gone by and surely as the mother and son read together the beloved assurance of the divine forgiveness and of that joy which angels feel in heaven for a sinner repentant we may fancy in the happy mothers breast a feeling somewhat akin to that angelic felicity a gratitude and joy of all others the loftiest the purest the keenest lady walham might shrink with terror at the frenchmans name but her son could forgive him with all his heart and kiss his mothers hand and thank him as the best friend of his life  during all the days of his illness kew had never once mentioned ethels name and once or twice as his recovery progressed when with doubt and tremor his mother alluded to it he turned from the subject as one that was disagreeable and painful had she thought seriously on certain things lady walham asked kew thought not but those who are bred up as you would have them mother are often none the better the humble young fellow said i believe she is a very good girl she is very clever she is exceedingly handsome she is very good to her parents and her brothers and sisters but he did not finish the sentence perhaps he thought as he told ethel afterwards that she would have agreed with lady walham even worse than with her imperious old grandmother  lady walham then fell to deplore sir brians condition accounts of whose seizure of course had been despatched to the kehl party and to lament that a worldly man as he was should have such an affliction so near the grave and so little prepared for it here honest kew however held out every man for himself mother says he sir brian was bred up very strictly perhaps too strictly as a young man dont you know that that good colonel his elder brother who seems to me about the most honest and good old gentleman i ever met in my life was driven into rebellion and all sorts of wild courses by old mrs newcomes tyranny over him as for sir brian he goes to church every sunday has prayers in the family every day im sure has led a hundred times better life than i have poor old sir brian i often have thought mother that though our side was wrong you could not be altogether right because i remember how my tutor and mr bonner and dr laud when they used to come down to us at kewbury used to make themselves so unhappy about other people so the widow withdrew her unhappiness about sir brian she was quite glad to hope for the best regarding that invalid  with some fears yet regarding her sonfor many of the books with which the good lady travelled could not be got to interest him at some he would laugh outrightwith fear mixed with the maternal joy that he was returned to her and had quitted his old ways with keen feminine triumph perhaps that she had won him back and happiness at his daily mending health all lady walhams hours were passed in thankful and delighted occupation george barnes kept the newcomes acquainted with the state of his brothers health the skilful surgeon from strasbourg reported daily better and better of him and the little family were living in great peace and contentment with one subject of dread however hanging over the mother of the two young men the arrival of lady kew as she was foreboding the fierce old motherinlaw who had worsted lady walham in many a previous battle  it was what they call the summer of st martin and the weather was luckily very fine kew could presently be wheeled into the garden of the hotel whence he could see the broad turbid current of the swollen rhine the french bank fringed with alders the vast yellow fields behind them the great avenue of poplars stretching away to the alsatian city and its purple minster yonder good lady walham was for improving the shining hour by reading amusing extracts from her favourite volumes gentle anecdotes of chinese and hottentot converts and incidents from missionary travel george barnes a wily young diplomatist insinuated galignani and hinted that kew might like a novel and a profane work called oliver twist having appeared about this time which george read out to his family with admirable emphasis it is a fact that lady walham became so interested in the parish boys progress that she took his history into her bedroom where it was discovered under blatherwicks voice from mesopotamia by her ladyships maid and that kew laughed so immensely at mr bumble the beadle as to endanger the reopening of his wound  while one day they were so harmlessly and pleasantly occupied a great whacking of whips blowing of horns and whirring of wheels was heard in the street without the wheels stopped at their hotel gate lady walham started up ran through the garden door closing it behind her and divined justly who had arrived the landlord was bowing the courier pushing about waiters in attendance one of them coming up to palefaced lady walham said her excellency the frau graefinn von kew is even now absteiging  will you be good enough to walk into our salon lady kew said the daughterinlaw stepping forward and opening the door of that apartment the countess leaning on her staff entered that darkened chamber she ran up towards an easychair where she supposed lord kew was my dear frank cries the old lady my dear boy what a pretty fright you have given us all they dont keep you in this horrid noisy room facing thathowhat is this cries the countess closing her sentence abruptly  it is not frank it is only a bolster lady kew and i dont keep him in a noisy room towards the street said lady walham  ho how do you do this is the way to him i suppose and she went to another doorit was a cupboard full of the relics of franks illness from which lady walhams motherinlaw shrunk back aghast will you please to see that i have a comfortable room maria and one for my maid next me i will thank you to see yourself the empress of kew said pointing with her stick before which many a time the younger lady had trembled  this time lady walham only rang the bell i dont speak german and have never been on any floor of the house but this your servant had better see to your room lady kew that next is mine and i keep the door which you are trying locked on other side  and i suppose frank is locked up there cried the old lady with a basin of gruel and a book of wattss hymns a servant entered at this moment answering lady walhams summons peacock the countess of kew says that she proposes to stay here this evening please to ask the landlord to show her ladyship rooms said lady walham and by this time she had thought of a reply to lady kews last kind speech  if my son were locked up in my room madam his mother is surely the best nurse for him why did you not come to him three weeks sooner when there was nobody with him  lady kew said nothing but glared and showed her teeththose pearls set in gold  and my company may not amuse lord kew  heee grinned the elder savagely  but at least it is better than some to which you introduced my son continued lady kews daughterinlaw gathering force and wrath as she spoke your ladyship may think lightly of me but you can hardly think so ill of me as of the duchesse divry i should suppose to whom you sent my boy to form him you said about whom when i remonstratedfor though i live out of the world i hear of it sometimesyou were pleased to tell me that i was a prude and a fool it is you i thank for separating my child from meyes youfor so many years of my life and for bringing me to him when he was bleeding and almost a corpse but that god preserved him to the widows prayersand you you were by and never came near him  ii did not come to see youororfor this kind of scene lady walham muttered the other lady kew was accustomed to triumph by attacking in masses like napoleon those who faced her routed her  no you did not come for me i know very well the daughter went on you loved me no better than you loved your son whose life as long as you meddled with it you made wretched you came here for my boy havent you done him evil enough and now god has mercifully preserved him you want to lead him back again into ruin and crime it shall not be so wicked woman bad mother cruel heartless parentgeorge here her younger son entered the room and she ran towards him with fluttering robes and seized his hands here is your grandmother here is the countess of kew come from baden at last and she wantsshe wants to take frank from us my dear and togivehimback to thefrenchwoman again no no oh my god never never and she flung herself into george barness arms fainting with an hysteric burst of tears  you had best get a straitwaistcoat for your mother george barnes lady kew said scorn and hatred in her face if she had been iagos daughter with a strong likeness to her sire lord steynes sister could not have looked more diabolical have you had advice for her has nursing poor kew turned her head i came to see him why have i been left alone for half an hour with this madwoman you ought not to trust her to give frank medicine it is positively  excuse me said george with a bow i dont think the complaint has as yet exhibited itself in my mothers branch of the family she always hated me thought george but if she had by chance left me a legacy there it goes you would like maam to see the rooms upstairs here is the landlord to conduct your ladyship frank will be quite ready to receive you when you come down i am sure i need not beg of your kindness that nothing may be said to agitate him it is barely three weeks since m de castillonness ball was extracted and the doctors wish he should be kept as quiet as possible  be sure that the landlord the courier and the persons engaged in showing the countess of kew the apartments above spent an agreeable time with her excellency the frau graefinn von kew she must have had better luck in her encounter with these than in her previous passages with her grandson and his mother for when she issued from her apartment in a new dress and fresh cap lady kews face wore an expression of perfect serenity her attendant may have shook her fist behind her and her mans eyes and face looked blitz and donnerwetter but their mistresss features wore that pleased look which they assumed when she had been satisfactorily punishing somebody lord kew had by this time got back from the garden to his own room where he awaited grandmamma if the mother and her two sons had in the interval of lady kews toilette tried to resume the history of bumble the beadle i fear they could not have found it very comical  bless me my dear child how well you look many a girl would give the world to have such a complexion there is nothing like a mother for a nurse ah no maria you deserve to be the mother superior of a house of sisters of charity you do the landlord has given me a delightful apartment thank you he is an extortionate wretch but i have no doubt i shall be very comfortable the dodsburys stopped here i see by the travellers bookquite right instead of sleeping at that odious buggy strasbourg we have had a sad sad time my dears at baden between anxiety about poor sir brian and about you you naughty boy i am sure i wonder how i have got through it all doctor finck would not let me come away today would i would come  i am sure it was uncommonly kind maam says poor kew with a rueful face  that horrible woman against whom i always warned but youbut young men will not take the advice of old grandmammashas gone away these ten days monsieur le duc fetched her and if he locked her up at moncontour and kept her on breadandwater for the rest of her life i am sure he would serve her right when a woman once forgets religious principles kew she is sure to go wrong the conversationroom is shut up the dorkings go on tuesday clara is really a dear little artless creature one that you will like mariaand as for ethel i really think she is an angel to see her nursing her poor father is the most beautiful sight night after night she has sate up with him i know where she would like to be the dear child and if frank falls ill again maria he wont need a mother or useless old grandmother to nurse him i have got some pretty messages to deliver from her but they are for your private ears my lord not even mammas and brothers may hear them  do not go mother pray stay george cried the sick man and again lord steynes sister looked uncommonly like that lamented marquis my cousin is a noble young creature he went on she has admirable good qualities which i appreciate with all my heart and her beauty you know how i admire it i have thought of her a great deal as i was lying on the bed yonder the family look was not so visible in lady kews face andandi wrote to her this very morning she will have the letter by this time probably  bien frank lady kew smiled in her supernatural way almost as much as her portrait by harlowe as you may see it at kewbury to this very day she is represented seated before an easel painting a miniature of her son lord walham  i wrote to her on the subject of the last conversation we had together frank resumed in rather a timid voice the day before my accident perhaps she did not tell you maam of what passed between us we had had a quarrel one of many some cowardly hand which we both of us can guess at had written to her an account of my past life and she showed me the letter then i told her that if she loved me she never would have showed it me without any other words of reproof i bade her farewell it was not much the showing that letter but it was enough in twenty differences we have had together she had been unjust and captious cruel towards me and too eager as i thought for other peoples admiration had she loved me it seemed to me ethel would have shown less vanity and better temper what was i to expect in life afterwards from a girl who before her marriage used me so neither she nor i could be happy she could be gentle enough and kind and anxious to please any man whom she loves god bless her as for me i suppose im not worthy of so much talent and beauty so we both understood that that was a friendly farewell and as i have been lying on my bed yonder thinking perhaps i never might leave it or if i did that i should like to lead a different sort of life to that which ended in sending me there my resolve of last month was only confirmed god forbid that she and i should lead the lives of some folks we know that ethel should marry without love perhaps to fall into it afterwards and that i after this awful warning i have had should be tempted to back into that dreary life i was leading it was wicked maam i knew it was many and many a day i used to say so to myself and longed to get rid of it i am a poor weak devil i know i am only too easily led into temptation and i should only make matters worse if i married a woman who cares for the world more than for me and would not make me happy at home  ethel care for the world gasped out lady kew a most artless simple affectionate creature my dear frank she  he interrupted her as a blush came rushing over his pale face ah said he if i had been the painter and young clive had been lord kew which of us do you think she would have chosen and she was right he is a brave handsome honest young fellow and is a thousand times cleverer and better than i am  not better dear thank god cried his mother coming round to the other side of his sofa and seizing her sons hand  no i dont think he is better frank said the diplomatist walking away to the window and as for grandmamma at the end of this little speech and scene her ladyships likeness to her brother the late revered lord steyne was more frightful than ever  after a minutes pause she rose up on her crooked stick and said i really feel i am unworthy to keep company with so much exquisite virtue it will be enhanced my lord by the thought of the pecuniary sacrifice which you are making for i suppose you know that i have been hoardingyes and saving and pinchingdenying myself the necessities of life in order that my grandson might one day have enough to support his rank go and live and starve in your dreary old house and marry a parsons daughter and sing psalms with your precious mother and i have no doubt you and sheshe who has thwarted me all through life and whom i hatedyes i hated from the moment she took my son from me and brought misery into my family will be all the happier when she thinks that she has made a poor fond lonely old woman more lonely and miserable if you please george barnes be good enough to tell my people that i shall go back to baden and waving her children away from her the old woman tottered out of the room on her crutch  so the wicked fairy drove away disappointed in the chariot with the very dragons which had brought her away in the morning and just had time to get their feed of black bread i wonder whether they were the horses clive and j j and jack belsize had used when they passed on their road to switzerland black care sits behind all sorts of horses and gives a trinkgelt to postillions all over the map a thrill of triumph may be permitted to lady walham after her victory over her motherinlaw what christian woman does not like to conquer another and if that other were a motherinlaw would the victory be less sweet husbands and wives both will be pleased that lady walham has had the better of this bout and you young boys and virgins when your turn comes to be married you will understand the hidden meaning of this passage george barnes got oliver twist out and began to read therein miss nancy and fanny again were summoned before this little company to frighten and delight them i dare say even fagin and miss nancy failed with the widow so absorbed was she with the thoughts of the victory which she had just won for the evening service in which her sons rejoiced her fond heart by joining she lighted on a psalm which was as a te deum after the battlethe battle of kehl by rhine where kews soul as his mother thought was the object of contention between the enemies i have said this book is all about the world and a respectable family dwelling in it it is not a sermon except where it cannot help itself and the speaker pursuing the destiny of his narrative finds such a homily before him o friend in your life and mine dont we light upon such sermons dailydont we see at home as well as amongst our neighbours that battle betwixt evil and good here on one side is self and ambition and advancement and right and love on the other which shall we let to triumph for ourselveswhich for our children  the young men were sitting smoking the vesper cigar frank would do it and his mother actually lighted his cigar for him now enjoining him straightway after to go to bed kew smoked and looked at a starshining above in the heaven which is that star he asked and the accomplished young diplomatist answered it was jupiter  what a lot of things you know george cries the senior delighted you ought to have been the elder you ought by jupiter but you have lost your chance this time  yes thank god says george  and i am going to be all rightand to turn over a new leaf old boyand paste down the old ones eh i wrote to martins this morning to have all my horses sold and ill never begso help meso help me jupiter i made a vowa promise to myself you see that i wouldnt if i recovered and i wrote to cousin ethel this morningas i thought over the matter yonder i felt quite certain i was right and that we could never never pull together now the countess is gone i wonder whether i was rightto give up sixty thousand pounds and the prettiest girl in london  shall i take horses and go after her my mothers gone to bed she wont know asked george sixty thousand is a lot of money to lose  kew laughed if you were to go and tell our grandmother that i could not live the night through and that you would be lord kew in the morning and your son viscount walham i think the countess would make up a match between you and the sixty thousand pounds and the prettiest girl in england she would byby jupiter i intend only to swear by the heathen gods now georgyno i am not sorry i wrote to ethel what a fine girl she isi dont mean her beauty merely but such a noblebred one and to think that there she is in the market to be knocked down toi say i was going to call that threeyearold ethelindawe must christen her over again for tattersalls georgy  a knock is heard through an adjoining door and a maternal voice cries it is time to go to bed so the brothers part and let us hope sleep soundly  the countess of kew meanwhile has returned to baden where though it is midnight when she arrives and the old lady has had two long bootless journeys you will be grieved to hear that she does not sleep a single wink in the morning she hobbles over to the newcome quarters and ethel comes down to her pale and calm how is her father he has had a good night he is a little better speaks more clearly has a little more the use of his limbs  i wish i had had a good night groans out the countess  i thought you were going to lord kew at kehl remarked her granddaughter  i did go and returned with wretches who would not bring me more than five miles an hour i dismissed that brutal grinning courier and i have given warning to that fiend of a maid  and frank is pretty well grandmamma  well he looks as pink as a girl in her first season i found him and his brother george and their mamma i think maria was hearing them their catechism cries the old lady  n and m together very pretty says ethel gravely george has always been a good boy and it is quite time for my lord kew to begin  the elder lady looked at her descendant but miss ethels glance was impenetrable i suppose you can fancy my dear why i came back said lady kew  because you quarrelled with lady walham grandmamma i think i have heard that there used to be differences between you miss newcome was armed for defence and attack in which cases we have said lady kew did not care to assault her my grandson told me that he had written to you the countess said  yes and had you waited but half an hour yesterday you might have spared me the humiliation of that journey  youthe humiliationethel  yes me ethel flashed out do you suppose it is none to have me bandied about from bidder to bidder and offered for sale to a gentleman who will not buy me why have you and all my family been so eager to get rid of me why should you suppose or desire that lord kew should like me hasnt he the opera and such friends as madame la duchesse divry to whom your ladyship introduced him in early life he told me so and she was good enough to inform me of the rest what attractions have i in comparison with such women and to this man from whom i am parted by good fortune to this man who writes to remind me that we are separatedyour ladyship must absolutely go and entreat him to give me another trial it

obediencethat is if children do owe any obedience to their parents nowadays i dont know i am an old womanthe world perhaps has changed since my time and it is you who ought to command i dare say and

didnt you and frank i had set my heart on i loved you out of all my grandchildrenwas it very unnatural that i should wish to see you together for that boy i have been saving money these years past he flies back to the arms of his mother who has been pleased to hate me as only such virtuous people can who took away my own son from me and now his sontowards whom the only fault i ever committed was to spoil him and be too fond of him dont leave me too my child let me have something that i can like at my years and i like your pride ethel and your beauty my dear and i am not angry with your hard

pretty hand once what did annewhat did your mother say to franks letter  i did not show it to her ethel answered  let me see it my dear whispered lady kew in a coaxing way  there it is said ethel pointing to the fireplace where there lay some torn fragments and ashes of paper it was the same fireplace at which clives sketches had been burned     chapter xxxix amongst the painters   when clive newcome comes to be old no doubt he will remember his roman days as amongst the happiest which fate ever awarded him the simplicity of the students life there the greatness and friendly splendour of the scenes surrounding him the delightful nature of the occupation in which he is engaged the pleasant company of comrades inspired by a like pleasure over a similar calling the labour the meditation the holiday and the kindly feast afterwards should make the artstudents the happiest of youth did they but know their good fortune their work is for the most part delightfully easy it does not exercise the brain too much but gently occupies it and with a subject most agreeable to the scholar the mere poetic flame or jet of invention needs to be lighted up but very seldom namely when the young painter is devising his subject or settling the composition thereof the posing of figures and drapery the dexterous copying of the line the artful processes of crosshatching of stumping of laying on lights and what not the arrangement of colour and the pleasing operations of glazing and the like are labours for the most part merely manual these with the smoking of a proper number of pipes carry the student through his days work if you pass his door you will very probably hear him singing at his easel i should like to know what young lawyer mathematician or divinity scholar can sing over his volumes and at the same time advance with his labour in every city where art is practised there are old gentlemen who never touched a pencil in their lives but find the occupation and company of artists so agreeable that they are never out of the studios follow one generation of painters after another sit by with perfect contentment while jack is drawing his pifferaro or tom designing his cartoon and years afterwards when jack is established in newman street and tom a royal academician shall still be found in their rooms occupied now by fresh painters and pictures telling the youngsters their successors what glorious fellows jack and tom were a poet must retire to privy places and meditate his rhymes in secret a painter can practise his trade in the company of friends your splendid chef decole a rubens or a horace vernet may sit with a secretary reading to him a troop of admiring scholars watching the masters hand or a company of court ladies and gentlemen to whom he addresses a few kind words now and again looking on admiringly whilst the humblest painter be he ever so poor may have a friend watching at his easel or a gentle wife sitting by with her work in her lap and with fond smiles or talk or silence cheering his labour  amongst all ranks and degrees of painters assembled at rome mr clive found companions and friends the cleverest man was not the best artist very often the ablest artist not the best critic nor the best companion many a man could give no account of the faculty within him but achieved success because he could not help it and did in an hour and without effort that which another could not effect with half a lifes labour there were young sculptors who had never read a line of homer who took on themselves nevertheless to interpret and continue the heroic greek art there were young painters with the strongest natural taste for low humour comic singing and cydercellar jollifications who would imitate nothing under michael angelo and whose canvases teemed with tremendous allegories of fates furies genii of death and battle there were longhaired lads who fancied the sublime lay in the peruginesque manner and depicted saintly personages with crisp draperies crude colours and haloes of goldleaf our friend marked all these practitioners of art with their various oddities and tastes and was welcomed in the ateliers of all of them from the grave dons and seniors the senators of the french and english academy down to the jovial students who railed at the elders over their cheap cups at the lepre what a gallant starving generous kindly life many of them led what fun in their grotesque airs what friendship and gentleness in their poverty how splendidly carlo talked of the marquis his cousin and the duke his intimate friend how great federigo was on the subject of his wrongs from the academy at home a pack of tradesmen who could not understand high art and who had never seen a good picture with what haughtiness augusto swaggered about at sir johns soirees though he was known to have borrowed fernandos coat and luigis dressboots if one or the other was ill how nobly and generously his companions flocked to comfort him took turns to nurse the sick man through nights of fever contributed out of their slender means to help him through his difficulty max who loves fine dresses and the carnival so gave up a costume and a carriage so as to help paul when he sold his picture through the agency of pietro with whom he had quarrelled and who recommended him to a patron gave a third of the money back to max and took another third portion to lazaro with his poor wife and children who had not got a single order all that winterand so the story went on i have heard clive tell of two noble young americans who came to europe to study their art of whom the one fell sick whilst the other supported his penniless comrade and out of sixpence a day absolutely kept but a penny for himself giving the rest to his sick companion i should like to have known that good samaritan sir our colonel said twirling his mustachios when we saw him again and his son told him that story  j j in his steady silent way worked on every day and for many hours every day when clive entered their studio of a morning he found j j there and there he left him when the life academy was over at night and clive went out to his soirees j j lighted his lamp and continued his happy labour he did not care for the brawling supperparties of his comrades liked better to stay at home than to go into the world and was seldom abroad of a night except during the illness of luigi before mentioned when j j spent constant evenings at the others bedside j j was fortunate as well as skilful people in the world took a liking to the modest young man and he had more than one order for pictures the artists club at the lepre set him down as close with his money but a year after he left rome lazaro and his wife who still remained there told a different tale clive newcome when he heard of their distress gave them somethingas much as he could spare but j j gave more and clive was as eager in acknowledging and admiring his friends generosity as he was in speaking of his genius his was a fortunate organisation indeed study was his chief amusement selfdenial came easily to him pleasure or what is generally called so had little charm for him his ordinary companions were pure and sweet thoughts his outdoor enjoyment the contemplation of natural beauty for recreation the hundred pleasant dexterities and manipulations of his craft were ceaselessly interesting to him he would draw every knot in an oak panel or every leaf in an orangetree smiling and taking a gay delight over the simple feats of skill whenever you found him he seemed watchful and serene his modest virginlamp always lighted and trim no gusts of passion extinguished it no hopeless wandering in the darkness afterwards led him astray wayfarers through the world we meet now and again with such purity and salute it and hush whilst it passes on  we have it under clive newcomes own signature that he intended to pass a couple of years in italy devoting himself exclusively to the study of his profession other besides professional reasons were working secretly in the young mans mind causing him to think that absence from england was the best cure for a malady under which he secretly laboured but change of air may cure some sick people more speedily than the sufferers ever hoped and also it is on record that young men with the very best intentions respecting study do not fulfil them and are led away from their scheme by accident or pleasure or necessity or some good cause young clive worked sedulously two or three months at his vocation at rome secretly devouring no doubt the pangs of sentimental disappointment under which he laboured and he drew from his models and he sketched round about everything that suited his pencil on both sides of tiber and he laboured at the life academy of nightsa model himself to other young students the symptoms of his sentimental malady began to abate he took an interest in the affairs of jack and tom and harry round about him art exercised its great healing influence on his wounded spirit which to be sure had never given in the meeting of the painters at the cafe greco and at their private houses was very jovial pleasant and lively clive smoked his pipe drank his glass of marsala sang his song and took part in the general chorus as gaily as the jolliest of the boys he was the cock of the whole painting school the favourite of all and to be liked by the people you may be pretty sure that we for our parts must like them  then besides the painters he had as he has informed us the other society of rome every winter there is a gay and pleasant english colony in that capital of course more or less remarkable for rank fashion and agreeability with every varying year in clives year some very pleasant folks set up their winter quarters in the usual foreigners resort round about the piazza di spagna i was amused to find lately looking over the travels of the respectable m de poellnitz that a hundred and twenty years ago the same quarter the same streets and palaces scarce changed from those days were even then polite foreigners resort of one or two of the gentlemen clive had made the acquaintance in the huntingfield others he had met during his brief appearance in the london world being a youth of great personal agility fitted thereby to the graceful performance of polkas etc having good manners and good looks and good credit with prince poloni or some other banker mr newcome was thus made very welcome to the angloroman society and as kindly received in genteel houses where they drank tea and danced the galop as in those dusky taverns and retired lodgings where his bearded comrades the painters held their meetings  thrown together every day and night after night flocking to the same picturegalleries statuegalleries pincian drives and church functions the english colonists at rome perforce became intimate and in many cases friendly they have an english library where the various meets for the week are placarded on such a day the vatican galleries are open the next is the feast of saint soandso on wednesday there will be music and vespers at the sistine chapelon thursday the pope will bless the animalssheep horses and whatnot and flocks of english accordingly rush to witness the benediction of droves of donkeys in a word the ancient city of the caesars the august fanes of the popes with their splendour and ceremony are all mapped out and arranged for english diversion and we run in a crowd to high mass at st peters or to the illumination on easter day as we run when the bell rings to the bosjesmen at cremorne or the fireworks at vauxhall  running to see fireworks alone rushing off to examine bosjesmen by ones self is a dreary work i should think very few men would have the courage to do it unattended and personally would not prefer a pipe in their own rooms hence if clive went to see all these sights as he did it is to be concluded that he went in company and if he went in company and sought it we may suppose that little affair which annoyed him at baden no longer tended to hurt his peace of mind very seriously the truth is our countrymen are pleasanter abroad than at home most hospitable kindly and eager to be pleased and to please you see a family half a dozen times in a week in the little roman circle whom you shall not meet twice in a season afterwards in the enormous london round when easter is over and everybody is going away at rome you and your neighbour shake hands sincerely sorry to part in london we are obliged to dilute our kindness so that there is hardly any smack of the original milk as one by one the pleasant families dropped off with whom clive had spent his happy winter as admiral freemans carriage drove away whose pretty girls he had caught at st peters kissing st peters toe as dick denbys family ark appeared with all denbys sweet young children kissing farewells to him out of the window as those three charming miss baliols with whom he had that glorious day in the catacombs as friend after friend quitted the great city with kind greetings warm pressures of the hand and hopes of meeting in a yet greater city on the banks of the thames young clive felt a depression of spirit rome was rome but it was pleasanter to see it in company our painters are smoking still at the oafs greco but a society all smoke and all painters did not suit him if mr clive is not a michael angelo or a beethoven if his genius is not gloomy solitary gigantic shining alone like a lighthouse a storm round about him and breakers dashing at his feet i cannot help myself he is as heaven made him brave honest gay and friendly and persons of a gloomy turn must not look to him as a hero  so clive and his companion worked away with all their hearts from november until far into april when easter came and the glorious gala with which the roman church celebrates that holy season by this time clives books were full of sketches ruins imperial and mediaeval peasants and bagpipemen passionists with shaven polls capuchins and the equally hairy frequenters of the cafe greco painters of all nations who resort there cardinals and their queer equipages and attendants the holy father himself it was gregory sixteenth of the name the dandified english on the pincio and the wonderful roman members of the huntwere not all these designed by the young man and admired by his friends in afterdays j js sketches were few but he had painted two beautiful little pictures and sold them for so good a price that prince polonias people were quite civil to him he had orders for yet more pictures and having worked very hard thought himself authorised to accompany mr clive upon a pleasuretrip to naples which the latter deemed necessary after his own tremendous labours he for his part had painted no pictures though he had commenced a dozen and turned them to the wall but he had sketched and dined and smoked and danced as we have seen so the little britzska was put behind horses again and our two friends set out on their tour having quite a crowd of brotherartists to cheer them who had assembled and had a breakfast for the purpose at that comfortable osteria near the lateran gate how the fellows flung their hats up and shouted lebe wohl and adieu and god bless you old boy in many languages clive was the young swell of the artists of that year and adored by the whole of the jolly company his sketches were pronounced on all hands to be admirable it was agreed that if he chose he might do anything  so with promises of a speedy return they left behind them the noble city which all love who once have seen it and of which we think afterwards ever with the kindness and the regard of home they dashed across the campagna and over the beautiful hills of albano and sped through the solemn pontine marshes and stopped to roost at terracing which was not at all like fra diavolos terracing at covent garden as j j was distressed to remark and so galloping onwards through a hundred ancient cities that crumble on the shores of the beautiful mediterranean behold on the second day as they ascended a hill about noon vesuvius came in view its great shape shimmering blue in the distant haze its banner of smoke in the cloudless sky and about five oclock in the evening as everybody will who starts from terracing early and pays the postboy well the travellers came to an ancient city walled and fortified with drawbridges over the shining moats  here is capua says j j and clive burst out laughing thinking of his capua which he had lefthow many monthsyears it seemed ago from capua to naples is a fine straight road and our travellers were landed at the latter place at suppertime where if they had quarters at the vittoria hotel they were as comfortable as any gentlemen painters need wish to be in this world  the aspect of the place was so charming and delightful to clivethe beautiful sea stretched before his eyes when waking capri a fairy island in the distance in the amethyst rocks of which sirens might be playingthat fair line of cities skirting the shore glittering white along the purple waterover the whole brilliant scene vesuvius rising with cloudlets playing round its summit and the country bursting out into that glorious vegetation with which sumptuous nature decorates every springthis city and scene of naples were so much to clives liking that i have a letter from him dated a couple of days after the young mans arrival in which he announces his intention of staying there for ever and gives me an invitation to some fine lodgings in a certain palazzo on which he has cast his eye he is so enraptured with the place that he says to die and be buried there even would be quite a treat so charming is the cemetery where the neapolitan dead repose  the fates did not however ordain that clive newcome should pass all his life at naples his roman banker presently forwarded a few letters to his address some which had arrived after his departure others which had been lying at the poste restante with his name written in perfectly legible characters but which the authorities of the post according to their custom would not see when clive sent for them  it was one of these letters which clive clutched the most eagerly it had been lying since october actually at the roman post though clive had asked for letters there a hundred times it was that little letter from ethel in reply to his own whereof we have made mention in a previous chapter there was not much in the little letter nothing of course that virtue or grandmamma might not read over the young writers shoulder it was affectionate simple rather melancholy described in a few words sir brians seizure and present condition spoke of lord kew who was mending rapidly as if clive of course was aware of his accident of the children of clives father and ended with a hearty god bless you to clive from his sincere ethel  you boast of its being over you see it is not over says clives monitor and companion else why should you have dashed at that letter before all the others clive j j had been watching not without interest clives blank face as he read the young ladys note  how do you know who wrote the letter asks clive  i can read the signature in your face says the other and i could almost tell the contents of the note why have you such a telltale face clive  it is over but when a man has once you know gone through an affair like that says clive looking very grave hehes anxious to hear of alice grey and how shes getting on you see my good friend and he began to shout out as of old      her heart it is anothers shenevercanbemine  and to laugh at the end of the song well well says he it is a very kind note a very proper little note the expression elegant j j the sentiment is most correct all the little ts most properly crossed and all the little is have dots over their little heads its a sort of a prize note dont you see and one such as in the old spellingbook story the good boy received a plumcake for writing perhaps you werent educated on the old spellingbook j j my good old father taught me to read out of hisi say i think it was a shame to keep the old boy waiting whilst i have been giving an audience to this young lady dear old father and he apostrophised the letter i beg your pardon sir miss newcome requested five minutes conversation and i was obliged from politeness you know to receive theres nothing between us nothing but whats most correct upon my honour and conscience and he kissed his fathers letter and calling out again dear old father proceeded to read as follows  your letters my dearest clive have been the greatest comfort to me i seem to hear you as i read them i cant but think that this the modern and natural style is a great progress upon the oldfashioned manner of my day when we used to begin to our fathers honoured father or even honoured sir some precisians used to write still from mr lords academy at tooting where i went before grey friarsthough i suspect parents were no more honoured in those days than nowadays i know one who had rather be trusted than honoured and you may call me what you please so as you do that  it is not only to me your letters give pleasure last week i took yours from baden baden no 3 september 15 into calcutta and could not help showing it at government house where i dined your sketch of the old russian princess and her little boy gambling was capital colonel buckmaster lord bagwigs private secretary knew her and says it is to a t and i read out to some of my young fellows what you said about play and how you had given it over i very much fear some of the young rogues are at dice and brandypawnee before tiffin what you say of young ridley i take cum grano his sketches i thought very agreeable but to compare them to a certain gentlemansnever mind i shall not try to make him think too well of himself i kissed dear ethels hand in your letter i write her a long letter by this mail  if paul de florac in any way resembles his mother between you and him there ought to be a very warm regard i knew her when i was a boy long before you were born or thought of and in wandering forty years through the world since i have seen no woman in my eyes so good or so beautiful your cousin ethel reminded me of her as handsome but not so lovely yes it was that pale lady you saw at paris with eyes full of care and hair streaked with grey so it will be the turn of you young folks come eight more lustres and your heads will be bald like mine or grey like madame de floracs and bending over the ground where we are lying in quiet i understand from you that young paul is not in very flourishing circumstances if he still is in need mind and be his banker and i will be yours any child of hers must never want when i have a spare guinea i do not mind telling you sir that i cared for her more than millions of guineas once and half broke my heart about her when i went to india as a young chap so if any such misfortunes happen to you consider my boy you are not the only one  binnie writes me word that he has been ailing i hope you are a good correspondent with him what made me turn to him just after speaking of unlucky love affairs could i be thinking about little rosie mackenzie she is a sweet little lass and james will leave her a pretty piece of money verbum sap i should like you to marry but god forbid you should marry for a million of gold mohurs  and gold mohurs bring me to another subject do you know i narrowly missed losing half a lakh of rupees which i had at an agents here and who do you think warned me about him our friend rummun loll who has lately been in england and with whom i made the voyage from southampton he is a man of wonderful tact and observation i used to think meanly of the honesty of natives and treat them haughtily as i recollect doing this very gentleman at your uncle newcomes in bryanstone square he heaped coals of fire on my head by saving my money for me and i have placed it with interest in his house if i would but listen to him my capital might be trebled in a year he says and the interest immensely increased he enjoys the greatest esteem among the moneyed men here keeps a splendid establishment and house here in barrackpore is princely in his benefactions he talks to me about the establishment of a bank of which the profits are so enormous and the scheme so seemingly clear that i dont know whether i maynt be tempted to take a few shares nous verrons several of my friends are longing to have a finger in it but be sure this i shall do nothing rashly and without the very best advice  i have not been frightened yet by your draughts upon me draw as many of these as you please you know i dont half like the other kind of drawing except as a delassement but if you chose to be a weaver like my grandfather i should not say you nay dont stint yourself of money or of honest pleasure of what good is money unless we can make those we love happy with it there would be no need for me to save if you were to save too so and as you know as well as i what our means are in every honest way use them i should like you not to pass the whole of next year in italy but to come home and pay a visit to honest james binnie i wonder how the old barrack in fitzroy square looks without me try and go round by paris on your way home and pay your visit and carry your fathers fond remembrances to madame la comtesse de florac i dont say remember me to my brother as i write brian by this mail adieu mon fils je tembrasseand am always my clives affectionate father                                                         t n  isnt he a noble old trump that point had been settled by the young men any time these three years and now mr j j remarked that when clive had read his fathers letter once then he read ethels over again and put it in his breastpocket and was very disturbed in mind that day pishing and pshawing at the statuegallery which they went to see at the museo  after all says clive what rubbish these secondrate statues are what a great hulking abortion is this brute of a farnese hercules theres only one bit in the whole gallery that is worth a twopennypiece  it was the beautiful fragment called psyche j j smiled as his comrade spoke in admiration of this statuein the slim shape in the delicate formation of the neck in the haughty virginal expression the psyche is not unlike the diana of the louvreand the diana of the louvre we have said was like a certain young lady  after all continues clive looking up at the great knotted legs of that clumsy caricatured porter which glykon the athenian sculptured in bad times of art surelyshe could not write otherwise than she diddont you see her letter is quite kind and affectionate you see she says she shall always hear of me with pleasure hopes ill come back soon and bring some good pictures with me since pictures i will do she thinks small beer of painters j jwell we dont think small beer of ourselves my noble friend ii suppose it must be over by this time and i may write to her as the countess of kew the custode of the apartment had seen admiration and wonder expressed by hundreds of visitors to his marble giant but he had never known hercules occasion emotion before as in the case of the young stranger who after staring a while at the statue dashed his hand across his forehead with a groan and walked away from before the graven image of the huge strongman who had himself been made such a fool by women  my father wants me to go and see james and madame de florac says clive as they stride down the street to the toledo  j j puts his arm through his companions which is deep the pocket of his velvet paletot you must not go home till you hear it is over clive whispers j j  of course not old boy says the other blowing tobacco out of his shaking head  not very long after their arrival we may be sure they went to pompeii of which place as this is not an italian tour but a history of clive newcome esquire and his most respectable family we shall offer to give no description the young man had read sir bulwer lyttons delightful story which has become the history of pompeii before they came thither and plinys description apud the guidebook admiring the wonderful ingenuity with which the english writer had illustrated the place by his text as if the houses were so many pictures to which he had appended a story clive the wag who was always indulging his vein for caricature was proposing that that they should take the same place names people and make a burlesque story what would be a better figure says he than plinys mother whom the historian describes as exceedingly corpulent and walking away from the catastrophe with slaves holding cushions behind her to shield her plump person from the cinders yes old mrs pliny shall be my heroine says clive a picture of her on a dark grey paper and touched up with red at the extremities exists in clives album to the present day  as they were laughing rattling wondering mimicking the cicerone attending them with his nasal twaddle anon pausing and silent yielding to the melancholy pity and wonder which the aspect of that strange and smiling place inspiresbehold they come upon another party of english two young men accompanying a lady  what clive cries one  my dear dear lord kew shouts the other and as the young man rushes up and grasps the two hands of the other they begin to blush  lord kew and his family resided in a neighbouring hotel on the chiafa at naples and that very evening on returning from the pompeian excursion the two painters were invited to take tea by those friendly persons j j excused himself and sate at home drawing all night clive went and passed a pleasant evening in which all sorts of future tours and pleasureparties were projected by the young men they were to visit paestum capri sicily why not malta and the east asked lord kew  lady walham was alarmed had not kew been in the east already clive was surprised and agitated too could kew think of going to the east and making long journeys when he hadhe had other engagements that would necessitate his return home no he must not go to the east lord kews mother avowed kew had promised to stay with her during the summer at castellammare and mr newcome must come and paint their portraits thereall their portraits she would like to have an entire picturegallery of kews if her son would remain at home during the sittings  at an early hour lady walham retired to rest exacting clives promise to come to castellammare and george barnes disappeared to array himself in an evening costume and to pay his round of visits as became a young diplomatist this part of diplomatic duty does not commence until after the opera at naples and society begins when the rest of the world has gone to bed  kew and clive sate till one oclock in the morning when the latter returned to his hotel not one of those fine parties at paestum sicily etc was carried out clive did not go to the east at all and it was j j who painted lord kews portrait that summer at castellammare the next day clive went for his passport to the embassy and a steamer departing direct for marseilles on that very afternoon behold mr newcome was on board of her lord kew and his brother and j j waving their hats to him as the vessel left the shore  away went the ship cleaving swiftly through the azure waters but not swiftly enough for clive j j went back with a sigh to his sketchbook and easels i suppose the other young disciple of art had heard something which caused him to forsake his sublime mistress for one who was much more capricious and earthly     chapter xl returns from rome to pall mall   one morning in the month of july when there was actually sunshine in lamb court and the two gentlemen who occupied the thirdfloor chambers there in partnership were engaged as their custom was over their pipes and their manuscripts and their times newspaper behold a fresh sunshine burst into their room in the person of a young clive with a bronzed face and a yellow beard and mustachios and those bright cheerful eyes the sight of which was always so welcome to both of us what clive what the young one what benjamin shout pendennis and warrington clive had obtained a very high place indeed in the latters affections so much so that if i could have found it in my heart to be jealous of such a generous brave fellow i might have grudged him his share of warringtons regard he blushed up with pleasure to see us again pidgeon our boy introduced him with a jubilant countenance and flanagan the laundress came smirking out of the bedroom eager to get a nod of recognition from him and bestow a smile of welcome upon everybodys favourite clive  in two minutes an armchair full of magazines slips of copy and books for review was emptied over the neighbouring coalscuttle and clive was in the seat a cigar in his mouth as comfortable as if he had never been away when did he come last night he was back in charlotte street at his old lodgings he had been to breakfast in fitzroy square that morning james binnie chirped for joy at seeing him his father had written to him desiring him to come back and see james binnie pretty miss rosey was very well thank you and mrs mack wasnt mrs mackenzie delighted to behold him come sir on your honour and conscience didnt the widow give you a kiss on your return clive sends an uncut number of the pall mall gazette flying across the room at the head of the inquirer but blushes as sweetly that i have very little doubt some such pretty meeting had taken place  what a pity it is he had not been here a short while since for a marriage in high life to give away his dear barnes and sign the book along with the other dignitaries we described that ceremony to him and announced the promotion of his friend florac now our friend also director of the great anglogallic railway the prince de moncontour then clive told us of his deeds during the winter of the good fun he had had at rome and the jolly fellows he had met there was he going to astonish the world by some grand pictures he was not the more he worked the more discontented he was with his performances somehow but j j was coming out very strong j j was going to be a stunner we turned with pride and satisfaction to that very number of the pall mall gazette which the youth had flung at us and showed him a fine article by f bayham esq in which the picture sent home by j j was enthusiastically lauded by the great critic  so he was back amongst us and it seemed but yesterday he had quitted us to londoners everything seems to have happened but yesterday nobody has time to miss his neighbour who goes away people go to the cape or on a campaign or on a tour round the world or to india and return with a wife and two or three children and we fancy it was only the other day they left us so engaged is every man in his individual speculations studies struggles so selfish does our life make usselfish but not illnatured we are glad to see an old friend though we do not weep when he leaves us we humbly acknowledge if fate calls us away likewise that we are no more missed than any other atom  after talking for a while mr clive must needs go into the city whither i accompanied him his interview with messrs jolly and baines at the house in fog court must have been very satisfactory clive came out of the parlour with a radiant countenance do you want any money old boy says he the dear old governor has placed a jolly sum to my account and mr baines has told me how delighted mrs baines and the girls will be to see me at dinner he says my father has made a lucky escape out of one house in india and a famous investment in another nothing could be more civil how uncommonly kind and friendly everybody is in london everybody then bestowing ourselves in a hansom cab which had probably just deposited some other capitalist in the city we made for the west end of the town where mr clive had some important business to transact with his tailors he discharged his outstanding little account with easy liberality blushing as he pulled out of his pocket a new chequebook page 1 of which he bestowed on the delighted artist from mr bs shop to mr truefitts is but a step our young friend was induced to enter the hairdressers and leave behind him a great portion of the flowing locks and the yellow beard which he had brought with him from rome with his mustachios he could not be induced to part painters and cavalry officers having a right to those decorations and why should not this young fellow wear smart clothes and a smart moustache and look handsome and take his pleasure and bask in his sun when it shone time enough for flannel and a fire when the winter comes and for grey hair and corksoled boots in the natural decline of years  then we went to pay a visit at a hotel in jermyn street to our friend florac who was now magnificently lodged there a powdered giant lolling in the hall his buttons emblazoned with prodigious coronets took our cards up to the prince as the door of an apartment on the first floor opened we heard a cry as of joy and that nobleman in a magnificent persian dressinggown rushing from the room plunged down the stairs and began kissing clive to the respectful astonishment of the titan in livery  come that i present you my friends our good little frenchman exclaimed to madame lato my wife we entered the drawingroom a demure little little lady of near sixty years of age was seated there and we were presented in form to madame princesse de moncontour nee higg of manchester she made us a stiff little curtsey but looked not illnatured indeed few women could look at clive newcomes gallant figure and brave smiling countenance and keep a frown on their own very long  i have eard of you from somebodys else besides the prince said the lady with rather a blush your uncle has spoke to me hoften about you mr clive and about your good father  cest son directeur whispers florac to me i wondered which of the firm of newcome had taken that office upon him  now you are come to england the lady continued whose lancashire pronunciation being once indicated we shall henceforth out of respect to the princesss rank generally pretermitnow you are come to england we hope to see you often not here in this noisy hotel which i cant bear but in the country our house is only three miles from newcomenot such a grand place as your uncles but i hope we shall see you there a great deal and your friend mr pendennis if he is passing that way the invitation to mr pendennis i am bound to say was given in terms by no means so warm as those in which the princesss hospitality to clive were professed  shall we meet you at your huncle obsons the lady continued to clive his wife is a most charming wellinformed woman has been most kind and civil and we dine there today barnes and his wife is gone to spend the honeymoon at newcome lady clara is a sweet dear thing and her pa and ma most affable i am sure what a pity sir brian couldnt attend the marriage there was everybody there in london amost sir harvey diggs says he is mending very slowly in life we are in death mr newcome isnt it sad to think of him in the midst of all his splendour and prosperity and he so infirm and unable to enjoy them but let us hope for the best and that his health will soon come round  with these and similar remarks in which poor florac took but a very small share for he seemed dumb and melancholy in the company of the princess his elderly spouse the visit sped on mr pendennis to whom very little was said having leisure to make his silent observations upon the person to whom he had been just presented  as there lay on the table two neat little packages addressed the princess de moncontouran envelope to the same address with the prescription no 9396 further inscribed on the paper and a sheet of notepaper bearing cabalistic characters and the signature of that most fashionable physician sir harvey diggs i was led to believe that the lady of moncontour was or fancied herself in a delicate state of health by the side of the physic for the body was medicine for the soula number of pretty little books in middleage bindings in antique type many of theist adorned with pictures of the german school representing demure ecclesiastics with their heads on one side children in long starched nightgowns virgins bearing lilies and so forth from which it was to be concluded that the owner of the volumes was not so hostile to rome as she had been at an earlier period of her religious life and that she had migrated in spirit from clapham to knightsbridgeso many wealthy mercantile families have likewise done in the body a long strip of embroidery of the gothic pattern furthermore betrayed her present inclinations and the person observing these things whilst nobody was taking any notice of him was amused when the accuracy of his conjectures was confirmed by the reappearance of the gigantic footman calling out oneyman in a loud voice and preceding that divine into the room  cest le directeur venez fumer dans ma chambre pen growled florac as honeyman came sliding over the carpet his elegant smile changing to a blush when he beheld clive his nephew seated by the princesss side this then was the uncle who had spoken about clive and his father to madame de florac charles seemed in the best condition he held out two brannew lavendercoloured kid gloves to shake hands with his dear clive florac and mr pendennis vanished out of the room as he appeared so that no precise account can be given of this affecting interview  when i quitted the hotel a brown brougham with a pair of beautiful horses the harness and panels emblazoned with the neatest little ducal coronets you ever saw and a cypher under each crown as easy to read as the arrowheaded inscriptions on one of mr layards assyrian chariots was in waiting and i presumed that madame la princesse was about to take an airing  clive had passed the avuncular bankinghouse in the city without caring to face his relatives there mr newcome was now in sole command mr barnes being absent at newcome the baronet little likely ever to enter bankparlour again but his bounden duty was to wait on the ladies and of course only from dutys sake he went the very first day and called in park lane  the family was habsent ever since the marriage simminery last week the footman who had accompanied the party to baden informed clive when he opened the door and recognised that gentleman sir brian pretty well thank you sir the family was at brighting that is miss newcome is in london staying with her grandmamma in queen street mayfear sir the varnished doors closed upon jeames within the brazen knockers grinned their familiar grin at clive and he went down the blank steps discomfited must it be owned that he went to a club and looked in the directory for the number of lady kews house in queen street her ladyship had a furnished house for the season no such noble name to be found among the inhabitants of queen street  mr hobson was from home that is thomas had orders not to admit strangers on certain days or before certain hours so that aunt hobson saw clive without being seen by the young man i cannot say how much he regretted that mischance his visits of propriety were thus all paid and he went off to dine dutifully with james binnie after which meal he came to a certain rendezvous given to him by some bachelors friends for the evening  james binnies eyes lightened up with pleasure on beholding his young clive the youth obedient to his fathers injunction had hastened to fitzroy square immediately after taking possession of his old lodgingshis during the time of his absence the old properties and carved cabinets the picture of his father looking melancholy out of the canvas greeted clive strangely on the afternoon of his arrival no wonder he was glad to get away from a solitude peopled with a number of dismal recollections to the near hospitality of fitzroy square and his guardian and friend there  james had not improved in health during clives ten months absence he had never been able to walk well or take his accustomed exercise after his fall he was no more used to riding than the late mr gibbon whose person jamess somewhat resembled and of whose philosophy our scottish friend was an admiring scholar the colonel gone james would have arguments with mr honeyman over their claret bring down the famous xvth and xvith chapters of the decline and fall upon him and quite get the better of the clergyman james like many other sceptics was very obstinate and for his part believed that almost all parsons had as much belief as the roman augurs in their ceremonies certainly poor honeyman in their controversies gave up one article after another flying from jamess assault but the battle over charles honeyman would pick up these accoutrements which he had flung away in his retreat wipe them dry and put them on again  lamed by his fall and obliged to remain much within doors where certain society did not always amuse him james binnie sought excitement in the pleasures of the table partaking of them the more freely now that his health could afford them the less clive the sly rogue observed a great improvement in the commissariat since his good fathers time ate his dinner with thankfulness and made no remarks nor did he confide to us for a while his opinion that mrs mack bored the good gentleman most severely that he pined away under her kindnesses sneaked off to bis studychair and his nap was only too glad when some of the widows friends came or she went out seeming to breathe more freely when she was gone and drink his wine more cheerily when rid of the intolerable weight of her presence  i protest the great ills of life are nothingthe loss of your fortune is a mere fleabite the loss of your wifehow many men have supported it and married comfortably afterwards it is not what you lose but what you have daily to bear that is hard i can fancy nothing more cruel after a long easy life of bachelorhood than to have to sit day after day with a dull handsome woman opposite to have to answer her speeches about the weather housekeeping and what not to smile appropriately when she is disposed to be lively that laughing at the jokes is the hardest part and to model your conversation so as to suit her intelligence knowing that a word used out of its downright signification will not be understood by your fair breakfastmaker women go through this simpering and smiling life and bear it quite easily theirs is a life of hypocrisy what good woman does not laugh at her husbands or fathers jokes and stories time after time and would not laugh at breakfast lunch and dinner if he told them flattery is their natureto coax flatter and sweetly befool some one is every womans business she is none if she declines this office but men are not provided with such powers of humbug or endurancethey perish and pine away miserably when boredor they shrink off to the club or publichouse for comfort i want to say as delicately as i can and never liking to use rough terms regarding a handsome woman that mrs mackenzie herself being in the highest spirits and the best humour extinguished her halfbrother james binnie esq that she was as a malaria to him poisoning his atmosphere numbing his limbs destroying his sleepthat day after day as he sate down at breakfast and she levelled commonplaces at her dearest james her dearest james became more wretched under her and no one could see what his complaint was he called in the old physicians at the club he dosed himself with poppy and mandragora and blue pilllower and lower went poor jamess mercury if he wanted to move to brighton or cheltenham well and good whatever were her engagements or whatever pleasures darling rosey might have in store dear thingat her age my dear mrs newcome would not one do all to make a young creature happyunder no circumstances could i think of leaving my poor brother  mrs mackenzie thought herself a most highly principled woman mrs newcome had also a great opinion of her these two ladies had formed a considerable friendship in the past months the captains widow having an unaffected reverence for the bankers lady and thinking her one of the best informed and most superior women in the world when she had a high opinion of a person mrs mack always wisely told it mrs newcome in her turn thought mrs mackenzie a very clever agreeable ladylike womannot accomplished but one could not have everything no no my dear says simple hobson never would do to have every woman as clever as you are maria women would have it all their own way then  maria as her custom was thanked god for being so virtuous and clever and graciously admitted mrs and miss mackenzie into the circle of adorers of that supreme virtue and talent mr newcome took little rosey and her mother to some parties when any took place in bryanstone square they were generally allowed to come to tea  when on the second day of his arrival the dutiful clive went to dine with mr james the ladies in spite of their raptures at his return and delight at seeing him were going in the evening to his aunt their talk was about the princess all dinnertime the prince and princess were to dine in bryanstone square the princess had ordered such and such things at the jewellersthe princess would take rank over an english earls daughterover lady anne newcome for instance oh dear i wish the prince and princess were smothered in the tower growled james binnie since you have got acquainted with em i have never heard of anything else  clive like a wise man kept his counsel about the prince and princess with whom we have seen that he had had the honour of an interview that very day but after dinner rosey came round and whispered to her mamma and after roseys whisper mamma flung her arms round roseys neck and kissed her and called her a thoughtful darling what do you think this creature says clive says mrs mack still holding her darlings little hand i wonder i had not thought of it myself  what is it mrs mackenzie asks clive laughing  she says why should not you come to your aunts with us we are sure mrs newcome would be most happy to see you  rosey with a little hand put to mammas mouth said why did you tellyou naughty mamma isnt she a naughty mamma uncle james more kisses follow after this sally of which uncle james receives one with perfect complacency mamma crying out as rosey retires to dress that darling child is always thinking of othersalways  clive says he will sit and smoke a cheroot with mr binnie if they please jamess countenance falls we have left off that sort of thing here my dear clive a long time cries mrs mackenzie departing from the diningroom  but we have improved the claret clive my boy whispers uncle james let us have another bottle and we will drink to the dear colonels good health and speedy returngod bless him i say clive tom seems to have had a most fortunate escape out of winters housethanks to our friend rummun loll and to have got into a capital good thing with this bundelcund bank they speak famously of it at hanover square and i see the hurkara quotes the shares at a premium already  clive did not know anything about the bundelcund bank except a few words found in a letter from his father which he had in the city this morning and an uncommonly liberal remittance the governor has sent me home sir upon which they fill another bumper to the colonels health  mamma and rosey come and show their pretty pink dresses before going to mrs newcomes and clive lights a cigar in the halland isnt there a jubilation at the haunt when the young fellows face appears above the smokeclouds there    chapter xli an old story   many of clives roman friends were by this time come to london and the young man renewed his acquaintance with them and had speedily a considerable circle of his own he thought fit to allow himself a good horse or two and appeared in the park among other young dandies he and monsieur de moncontour were sworn allies lord fareham who had purchased j js picture was clives very good friend major pendennis himself pronounced him to be a young fellow of agreeable manners and very favourably vu as the major happened to know in some very good quarters  ere many days clive had been to brighton to see lady anne and sir brian and good aunt honeyman in whose house the baronet was lodged and i suppose he found out by some means or other where lady kew lived in mayfair  but her ladyship was not at home nor was she at home on the second day nor did there come any note from ethel to her cousin she did not ride in the park as of old clive bien vu as he was did not belong to that great world as yet in which he would be pretty sure to meet her every night at one of those parties where everybody goes he read her name in the paper morning after morning as having been present at lady thiss entertainment and lady thats ministerial reunion at first he was too shy to tell what the state of the case was and took nobody into his confidence regarding his little tendre  there he was riding through queen street mayfair attired in splendid raiment never missing the park actually going to places of worship in the neighbourhood and frequenting the operaa waste of time which one would never have expected in a youth of his nurture at length a certain observer of human nature remarking his state rightly conjectured that he must be in love and taxed him with the soft impeachmenton which the young man no doubt anxious to open his heart to some one poured out all that story which has before been narrated and told how he thought his passion cured and how it was cured but when he heard from kew at naples that the engagement was over between him and miss newcome clive found his own flame kindle again with new ardour he was wild to see her he dashed off from naples instantly on receiving the news that she was free he had been ten days in london without getting a glimpse of her that mrs mackenzie bothers me so i hardly know where to turn said poor clive and poor little rosey is made to write me a note about something twice a day shes a good dear little thinglittle roseyand i really had thought once ofofoh never mind that oh pen im up another tree now and a poor miserable young beggar i am in fact mr pendennis was installed as confidant vice j jabsent on leave  this is a part which especially for a few days the present biographer has always liked well enough for a while at least i think almost every man or woman is interesting when in love if you know of two or three such affairs going on in any soiree to which you may be invitedis not the party straightway amusing yonder goes augustus tomkins working his way through the rooms to that far corner where demure miss hopkins is seated to whom the stupid grinning bumpkins thinks he is making himself agreeable yonder sits miss fanny distraite and yet trying to smile as the captain is talking his folly the parson his glib compliments and see her face lights up all of a sudden her eyes beam with delight at the captains stories and at that delightful young clergyman likewise it is because augustus has appeared their eyes only meet for one semisecond but that is enough for miss fanny go on captain with your twaddleproceed my reverend friend with your smirking commonplaces in the last two minutes the world has changed for miss fanny that moment has come for which she has been fidgeting and longing and scheming all day how different an interest i say has a meeting of people for a philosopher who knows of a few such little secrets to that which your vulgar lookeron feels who comes but to eat the ices and stare at the ladies dresses and beauty there are two frames of mind under which london society is bearable to a manto be an actor in one of those sentimental performances above hinted at or to be a spectator and watch it but as for the mere dessus de carteswould not an armchair and the dullest of books be better than that dull game  so i not only became clives confidant in this affair but took a pleasure in extracting the young fellows secrets from him or rather in encouraging him to pour them forth thus was the great part of the previous tale revealed to me thus jack belsizes misadventures of the first part of which we had only heard in london and whither he returned presently to be reconciled to his father after his elder brothers death thus my lord kews secret history came into my possession let us hope for the publics future delectation and the chroniclers private advantage and many a night until daylight did appear has poor clive stamped his chamber or my own pouring his story out to me his griefs and raptures recalling in his wild young way recollections of ethels sayings and doings uttering descriptions of her beauty and raging against the cruelty which she exhibited towards him  as soon as the new confidant heard the name of the young lovers charmer to do mr pendennis justice he endeavoured to fling as much cold water upon clives flame as a small private engine could be brought to pour on such a conflagration miss newcome my dear clive says the confidant do you know what you are aspiring to for the last three months miss newcome has been the greatest lioness in london the reigning beauty winning the horse the first favourite out of the whole belgravian harem no young woman of this year has come near her those of past seasons she has distanced and utterly put to shame miss blackcap lady blanch blackcaps daughter was as perhaps you are not aware considered by her mamma the great beauty of last season and it was considered rather shabby of the young marquis of farintosh to leave town without offering to change miss blackcaps name heaven bless you this year farintosh will not look at miss blackcap he finds people at home when ha i see you wince my suffering innocentwhen he calls in queen street yes and lady kew who is one of the cleverest women in england will listen for hours to lord farintoshs conversation than whom the rotten row of hyde park cannot show a greater booby miss blackcap may retire like jephthahs daughter for all farintosh will relieve her then my dear fellow there were as possibly you do not know lady hermengilde and lady yseult lady rackstraws lovely twins whose appearance created such a sensation at lady hautbois firstwas it her first or was it her secondyes it was her secondbreakfast whom werent they going to marry crackthorpe as mad they said about bothbustington sir john fobsby the young baronet with the immense northern propertythe bishop of windsor was actually said to be smitten with one of them but did not like to offer as her present my like qun elzbth of gracious memory is said to object to bishops as bishops marrying where is bustington where is crackthorpe where is fobsby the young baronet of the north my dear fellow when those two girls come into a room now they make no more sensation than you or i miss newcome has carried their admirers away from them fobsby has actually it is said proposed for her and the real reason of that affair between lord bustington and captain crackthorpe of the royal horse guards green was a speech of bustingtons hinting that miss newcome had not behaved well in throwing lord kew over dont you know what old lady kew will do with this girl clive she will marry miss newcome to the best man if a richer and better parti than lord farintosh presents himselfthen it will be farintoshs turn to find that lady kew is not at home is there any young man in the peerage unmarried and richer than farintosh i forget why does not some one publish a list of the young male nobility and baronetage their names weights and probable fortunes i dont mean for the matrons of mayfairthey have the list by heart and study it in secretbut for young men in the world so that they may know what their chances are and who naturally has the pull over them let me seethere is young lord gaunt who will have a great fortune and is desirable because you know his father is locked upbut he is only ten years oldnothey can scarcely bring him forward as farintoshs rival  you look astonished my poor boy you think it is wicked in me to talk in this brutal way about bargain and sale and say that your hearts darling is at this minute being paced up and down the mayfair market to be taken away by the best bidder can you count purses with sultan farintosh can you compete even with sir john fobsby of the north what i say is wicked and worldly is it so it is but it is true as true as tattersallsas true as circassia or virginia dont you know that the circassian girls are proud of their bringing up and take rank according to the prices which they fetch and you go and buy yourself some new clothes and a fiftypound horse and put a penny rose in your buttonhole and ride past her window and think to win this prize oh you idiot a penny rosebud put money in your purse a fiftypound hack when a butcher rides as good a oneput money in your purse a brave young heart all courage and love and honour put money in thy pursetother coin dont pass in the marketat least where old lady kew has the stall  by these remonstrances playful though serious clives adviser sought to teach him wisdom about his love affair and the advice was received as advice upon those occasions usually is  after calling thrice and writing to miss newcome there came a little note from that young lady saying dear clivewe were so sorry we were out when you called we shall be at home tomorrow at lunch when lady kew hopes you will come and see yours ever e n  clive wentpoor clive he had the satisfaction of shaking ethels hand and a finger of lady kew of eating a muttonchop in ethels presence of conversing about the state of art at rome with lady kew and describing the last works of gibson and macdonald the visit lasted but for half an hour not for one minute was clive allowed to see ethel alone at three oclock lady kews carriage was announced and our young gentleman rose to take his leave and had the pleasure of seeing the most noble peer marquis of farintosh and earl of rossmont descend from his lordships brougham and enter at lady kews door followed by a domestic bearing a small stack of flowers from covent garden  it befell that the goodnatured lady fareham had a ball in these days and meeting clive in the park her lord invited him to the entertainment mr pendennis had also the honour of a card accordingly clive took me up at bayss and we proceeded to the ball together  the lady of the house smiling upon all her guests welcomed with particular kindness her young friend from rome are you related to the miss newcome lady anne newcomes daughter her cousin she will be here tonight very likely lady fareham did not see clive wince and blush at this announcement her ladyship having to occupy herself with a thousand other people clive found a dozen of his roman friends in the room ladies young and middleaged plain and handsome all glad to see his kind face the house was splendid the ladies magnificently dressed the ball beautiful though it appeared a little dull until that event took place whereof we treated two pages back in the allegory of mr tomkins and miss hopkins and lady kew and her granddaughter made their appearance  that old woman who began to look more and more like the wicked fairy of the stories who is not invited to the princesss christening feast had this advantage over her likeness that she was invited everywhere though how she at her age could fly about to so many parties unless she was a fairy no one could say behind the fairy up the marble stairs came the most noble farintosh with that vacuous leer which distinguishes his lordship ethel seemed to be carrying the stack of flowers which the marquis had sent to her the noble bustington viscount bustington i need scarcely tell the reader is the heir of the house of podbury the baronet of the north the gallant crackthorpe the first men in town in a word gathered round the young beauty forming her court and little dick hitchin who goes everywhere you may be sure was near her with a compliment and a smile ere this arrival the twins had been giving themselves great airs in the roomthe poor twins when ethel appeared they sank into shuddering insignificance and had to put up with the conversation and attentions of secondrate men belonging to secondrate clubs in heavy dragoon regiments one of them actually walked with a dancing barrister but he was related to a duke and it was expected the lord chancellor would give him something very good  before he saw ethel clive vowed he was aware of her indeed had not lady fareham told him miss newcome was coming ethel on the contrary not expecting him or not having the prescience of love exhibited signs of surprise when she beheld him her eyebrows arching her eyes darting looks of pleasure when grandmamma happened to be in another room she beckoned clive to her dismissing crackthorpe and fobsby farintosh and bustington the amorous youth who around her bowed and summoning mr clive to an audience with the air of a young princess  and so she was a princess and this the region of her special dominion the wittiest and handsomest she deserved to reign in such a place by right of merit and by general election clive felt her superiority and his own shortcomings he came up to her as to a superior person perhaps she was not sorry to let him see how she ordered away grandees and splendid bustingtons informing them with a superb manner that she wished to speak to her cousinthat handsome young man with the light moustache yonder  do you know many people this is your first appearance in society shall i introduce you to some nice girls to dance with what very pretty buttons  is that what you wanted to say asked clive rather bewildered  what does one say at a ball one talks conversation suited to the place if i were to say to captain crackthorpe what pretty buttons he would be delighted but youyou have a soul above buttons i suppose  being as you say a stranger in this sort of society you see i am not accustomed toto the exceeding brilliancy of its conversation said clive  what you want to go away and we havent seen each other for near a year cries ethel in quite a natural voice sir john fobsby im very sorrybut do let me off this dance i have just met my cousin whom i have not seen for a whole year and i want to talk to him  it was not my fault that you did not see me sooner i wrote to you that i only got your letter a month ago you never answered the second i wrote you from rome your letter lay there at the post ever so long and was forwarded to me at naples  where asked ethel  i saw lord kew there ethel was smiling with all her might and kissing her hand to the twins who passed at that moment with their mamma oh indeed you sawhow do you dolord kew  and having seen him i came over to england said clive  ethel looked at him gravely what am i to understand by that cliveyou came over because it was very hot at naples and because you wanted to see your friends here nestce pas how glad mamma was to see you you know she loves you as if you were her own son  what as much as that angel barnes cries clive bitterly impossible  ethel looked once more her present mood and desire was to treat clive as a chit as a young fellow without consequencea thirteenth younger brother but in his looks and behaviour there was that which seemed to say not too many liberties were to be taken with him  why werent you here a month sooner and you might have seen the marriage it was a very pretty thing everybody was there clara and so did barnes really looked quite handsome  it must have been beautiful continued clive quite a touching sight i am sure poor charles belsize could not be present because his brother was dead and  and what else pray mr newcome cries miss in great wrath her pink nostrils beginning to quiver i did not think really that when we met after so many months i was to be insulted yes insulted by the mention of that name  i most humbly ask pardon said clive with a grave bow heaven forbid that i should wound your sensibility ethel it is as you say my first appearance in society i talk about things or persons that i should not mention i should talk about buttons should i which you were good enough to tell me was the proper subject of conversation maynt i even speak of connexions of the family mr belsize through this marriage has the honour of being connected with you and even i in a remote degree may boast of a sort of an eversodistant cousinship with him what an honour for me  pray what is the meaning of all this cries miss ethel surprised and perhaps alarmed indeed clive scarcely knew he had been chafing all the while he talked with her smothering anger as he saw the young men round about her revolting against himself for the very humility of his obedience and angry at the eagerness and delight with which he had come at her call  the meaning is ethelhe broke out seizing the opportunitythat when a man comes a thousand miles to see you and shake your hand you should give it him a little more cordially than you choose to do to me that when a kinsman knocks at your door time after time you should try and admit him and that when you meet him you should treat him like an old friend not as you treated me when my lady kew vouchsafed to give me admittance not as you treat these fools that are fribbling round about you cries mr clive in a great rage folding his arms and glaring round on a number of the most innocent young swells and he continued looking as if he would like to knock a dozen of their heads together am i keeping miss newcomes admirers from her  that is not for me to say she said quite gently he was but to see him angry did not displease miss newcome  that young man who came for you just now clive went onthat sir john  are you angry with me because i sent him away said ethel putting out a hand hark there is the music take me in and waltz with me dont you know it is not my door at which you knocked she said looking up into his face as simply and kindly as of old she whirled round the dancingroom with him in triumph the other beauties dwindling before her she looked more and more beautiful with each rapid move of the waltz her colour heightening and her eyes seeming to brighten not till the music stopped did she sink down on a seat panting and smiling radiantas many many hundred years ago i remember to have seen taglioni after a conquering pas seul she nodded a thank you to clive it seemed that there was a perfect reconciliation lady kew came in just at the end of the dance scowling when she beheld ethels partner but in reply to her remonstrances ethel shrugged her fair shoulders with a look which seemed to say je le veux gave an arm to her grandmother an walked off saucily protecting her  clives friend had been looking on observingly and curiously as the scene between them had taken place and at the dance with which the reconciliation had been celebrated i must tell you that this arch young creature had formed the object of my observation for some months past and that i watched her as i have watched a beautiful panther at the zoological gardens so bright of eye so sleek of coat so slim in form so sweet and agile in her spring  a more brilliant young coquette than miss newcome in her second season these eyes never looked upon that is the truth in her first year being engaged to lord kew she was perhaps a little more reserved and quiet besides her mother went out with her that first season to whom miss newcome except for a little occasional flightiness was invariably obedient and ready to come to call but when lady kew appeared as her duenna the girls delight seemed to be to plague the old lady and she would dance with the very youngest sons merey to put grandmamma in a passion in this way poor young cubley who has two hundred a year of allowance besides eighty and an annual rise of five in the treasury actually thought that ethel was in love with him and consulted with the young men in his room in downing street whether two hundred and eighty a year with five pound more next year would be enough for them to keep house on young tandy of the temple lord skibbereens younger son who sate in the house for some time on the irish catholic side was also deeply smitten and many a night in our walks home from the parties at the other end of the town would entertain me with his admiration and passion for her  if you have such a passion for her why not propose it was asked of mr tandy  propose propose to a russian archduchess cries young tandy shes beautiful shes delightful shes witty i have never seen anything like her eyes they send me wildwild says tandyslapping his waistcoat under temple barbut a more audacious little flirt never existed since the days of cleopatra  with this opinion likewise in my mind i had been looking on during clives proceedings with miss ethelnot i say without admiration of the young lady who was leading him such a dance the waltz over i congratulated him on his own performance his continental practice had greatly improved him and as for your partner it is delightful to see her i went on i always like to be by when miss newcome dances i had sooner see her than anybody since taglioni look at her now with her neck up and her little foot out just as she is preparing to start happy lord bustington  you are angry with her because she cut you growls clive you know you said she cut you or forgot you and your vanitys wounded that is why you are so satirical  how can miss newcome remember all the men who are presented to her says the other last year she talked to me because she wanted to know about you this year she doesnt talk because i suppose she doesnt want to know about you any more  hang it doont pen cries clive as a schoolboy cries out to another not to hit him  she does not pretend to observe and is in full conversation with the amiable bustington delicious interchange of noble thoughts but she is observing us talking and knows that we are talking about her if ever you marry her clive which is absurd i shall lose you for a friend you will infallibly tell her what i think of her and she will order you to give me up clive had gone off in a brown study as his interlocutor continued yes she is a flirt she cant help her nature she tries to vanquish every one who comes near her she is a little out of breath from waltzing and so she pretends to be listening to poor bustington who is out of breath too but puffs out his best in order to make himself agreeable with what a pretty air she appears to listen her eyes actually seem to brighten  what says clive with a start  i could not comprehend the meaning of the start nor did i care much to know supposing that the young man was waking up from some lovers reverie and the evening sped away clive not quitting the ball until miss newcome and the countess of kew had departed no further communication appeared to take place between the cousins that evening i think it was captain crackthorpe who gave the young lady an arm into her carriage sir john fobsby having the happiness to conduct the old countess and carrying the pink bag for the shawls wrappers etc on which her ladyships coronet and initials are emblazoned clive may have made a movement as if to step forward but a single finger from miss newcome warned him back  clive and his two friends in lamb court had made an engagement for the next saturday to dine at greenwich but on the morning of that day there came a note from him to say that he thought of going down to see his aunt miss honeyman and begged to recall his promise to us saturday is a holiday with gentlemen of our profession we had invited f bayham esquire and promised ourselves a merry evening and were unwilling to baulk ourselves of the pleasure on account of the absence of our young roman so we three went to london bridge station at an early hour proposing to breathe the fresh air of greenwich park before dinner and at london bridge by the most singular coincidence lady kews carriage drove up to the brighton entrance and miss ethel and her maid stepped out of the brougham  when miss newcome and her maid entered the brighton station did mr clive by another singular coincidence happen also to be there what more natural and dutiful than that he should go and see his aunt miss honeyman what more proper than that miss ethel should pass the saturday and sunday with her sick father and take a couple of wholesome nights rest after those five weary past evenings for each of which we may reckon a couple of soirees and a ball and that relations should travel together the young lady being protected by her femmedechambre that surely as every one must allow was perfectly right and proper  that a biographer should profess to know everything which passes even in a confidential talk in a firstclass carriage between two lovers seems perfectly absurd not that grave historians do not pretend to the same wonderful degree of knowledgereporting meetings of the most occult of conspirators private interviews between monarchs and their ministers even the secret thoughts and motives of those personages which possibly the persons themselves did not knowall for which the present writer will pledge his known character for veracity is that on a certain day certain parties had a conversation of which the upshot was soandso he guesses of course at a great deal of what took place knowing the characters and being informed at some time of their meeting you do not suppose that i bribed the femmedechambre or that those two city gents who sate in the same carriage with our young friends and could not hear a word they said reported their talk to me if clive and ethel had had a coupe to themselves i would yet boldly tell what took place but the coupe was taken by other three young city gents who smoked the whole way  well then the bonnet begins close up to the hat tell me sir is it true that you were so very much epris of the miss freemans at rome and that afterwards you were so wonderfully attentive to the third miss baliol did you draw her portrait you know you drew her portrait you painters always pretend to admire girls with auburn hair because titian and raphael painted it has the fornarina red hair why we are at croydon i declare  the fornarinathe hat replies to the bonnet if that picture at the borghese palace be an original or a likeness of heris not a handsome woman with vulgar eyes and mouth and altogether a most mahoganycoloured person she is so plain in fact i think that very likely it is the real woman for it is with their own fancies that men fall in loveor rather every woman is handsome to the lover you know how old helen must have been  i dont know any such thing or anything about her who was helen asks the bonnet and indeed she did not know  its a long story and such an old scandal now that there is no use in repeating it says clive  you only talk about helen because you wish to turn away the conversation from miss freeman cries the young ladyfrom miss baliol i mean  we will talk about whichever you please which shall we begin to pull to pieces says clive you see to be in this carriageto be actually with herto be looking into those wonderful lucid eyesto see her sweet mouth dimpling and hear her sweet voice ringing with its delicious laughterto have that hour and a half his own in spite of all the worlddragons grandmothers convenances the futuremade the young fellow so happy filled his whole frame and spirit with a delight so keen that no wonder he was gay and brisk and lively  and so you knew of my goingson he asked o me they were at reigate by this time there was gatton park flying before them on the wings of the wind  i know of a number of things says the bonnet nodding with ambrosial curls  and you would not answer the second letter i wrote to you  we were in great perplexity one cannot be always answering young gentlemens letters i had considerable doubt about answering a note i got from charlotte street fitzroy square says the ladys chapeau no clive we must not write to one another she continued more gravely or only very very seldom nay my meeting you here today is by the merest chance i am sure for when i mentioned at lady farehams the other evening that i was going to see papa at brighton today i never for one moment thought of seeing you in the train but as you are here it cant be helped and i may as well tell you that there are obstacles  what other obstacles clive gasped out  nonsenseyou silly boy no other obstacles but those which always have existed and must when we partedthat is when you left us at baden you knew it was for the best you had your profession to follow and could not go on idling aboutabout a family of sick people and children every man has his profession and you yours as you would have it we are so nearly allied that we maywe may like each other like brother and sister almost i dont know what barnes would say if he heard me wherever you and your father are how can i ever think of you butbut you know how i always shall always there are certain feelings we have which i hope never can change though if you please about them i intend never to speak any more neither you nor i can alter our conditions but must make the best of them you shall be a fine clever painter and iwho knows what will happen to me i know what is going to happen today i am going to see papa and mamma and be as happy as i can till monday morning  i know what i wish would happen now said clivethey were going screaming through a tunnel  what said the bonnet in the darkness and the engine was roaring so loudly that he was obliged to put his head quite close to say  i wish the tunnel would fall in and close upon us or that we might travel on for ever and ever  here there was a great jar of the carriage and the ladysmaid and i think miss ethel gave a shriek the lamp above was so dim that the carriage was almost totally dark no wonder the ladysmaid was frightened but the daylight came streaming in and all poor clives wishes of rolling and rolling on for ever were put an end to by the implacable sun in a minute  ah why was it the quick train suppose it had been the parliamentary traineven that too would have come to an end they came and said tickets please and clive held out the three of their partyhis and ethels and her maids i think for such a ride as that he was right to give up greenwich mr kuhn was in waiting with a carriage for miss ethel she shook hands with clive returning his pressure  i may come and see you he said  you may come and see mammayes  and where are you staying  bless my soulthey were staying at miss honeymans clive burst into a laugh why he was going there too of course aunt honeyman had no room for him her house being quite full with the other newcomes  it was a most curious coincidence their meeting but altogether lady anne thought it was best to say nothing about the circumstance to grandmamma i myself am puzzled to say which would have been the better course to pursue under the circumstances there were so many courses open as they had gone so far should they go on farther together suppose they were going to the same house at brighton oughtnt they to have gone in the same carriage with kuhn and the maid of course suppose they met by chance at the station ought they to have travelled in separate carriages i ask any gentleman and father of a family when he was immensely smitten with his present wife mrs brown if he had met her travelling with her maid in the mail when there was a vacant place what would he himself have done     chapter xlii injured innocence   from clive newcome esq to lieutcol newcome cb  brighton june 12 18  my dearest fatheras the weather was growing very hot at naples and you wished i should come to england to see mr binnie i came accordingly and have been here three weeks and write to you from aunt honeymans parlour at brighton where you ate your last dinner before embarking for india i found your splendid remittance calling in fog court and have invested a part of the sum in a good horse to ride upon which i take my diversion with other young dandies in the park florac is in england but he has no need of your kindness only think he is prince de moncontour now the second title of the duc divrys family and m le comte de florac is duc divry in consequence of the demise of tother old gentleman i believe the late dukes wife shortened his life oh what a woman she caused a duel between lord kew and a frenchman which has in its turn occasioned all sorts of evil and division in families as you shall hear  in the first place in consequence of the duel and of incompatibility of temper the match between kew and e n has been broken off i met lord kew at naples with his mother and brother nice quiet people as you would like them kews wound and subsequent illness have altered him a good deal he has become much more serious than he used to be not ludicrously so at all but he says he thinks his past life has been useless and even criminal and he wishes to change it he has sold his horses and sown his wild oats he has turned quite a sober quiet gentleman  at our meeting he told me of what had happened between him and ethel of whom he spoke most kindly and generously but avowing his opinion that they never could have been happy in married life and now i think my dear old father will see that there may be another reason besides my desire to see mr binnie which has brought me tumbling back to england again if need be to speak i never shall have i hope any secrets from you i have not said much about one which has given me the deuces disquiet for ten months past because there was no good in talking about it or vexing you needlessly with reports of my griefs and woes  well when we were at baden in september last and e and i wrote those letters in common to you i dare say you can fancy what my feelings might have been towards such a beautiful young creature who has a hundred faults for which i love her just as much as for the good that is in her i became dreadfully smitten indeed and knowing that she was engaged to lord kew i did as you told me you did once when the enemy was too strong for youi ran away i had a bad time of it for two or three months at rome however i began to take matters more easily my naturally fine appetite returned and at the end of the season i found myself uncommonly happy in the society of the miss baliols and the miss freemans but when kew told me at naples of what had happened there was straightway a fresh eruption in my heart and i was fool enough to come almost without sleep to london in order to catch a glimpse of the bright eyes of e n  she is now in this very house upstairs with one aunt whilst the other lets lodgings to her i have seen her but very seldom indeed since i came to london where sir brian and lady anne do not pass the season and ethel goes about to a dozen parties every week with old lady kew who neither loves you nor me hearing e say she was coming down to her parents at brighton i made so bold as to waylay her at the train though i didnt tell her that i passed three hours in the waitingroom and we made the journey together and she was very kind and beautiful and though i suppose i might just as well ask the royal princess to have me i cant help hoping and longing and hankering after her and aunt honeyman must have found out that i am fond of her for the old lady has received me with a scolding uncle charles seems to be in very good condition again i saw him in full clerical featherat madame de moncontours a goodnatured body who drops her hs though florac is not aware of their absence pendennis and warrington i know would send you their regards pen is conceited but much kinder in reality than he has the air of being fred bayham is doing well and prospering in his mysterious way  mr binnie is not looking at all well and mrs mackwell as i know you never attack a lady behind her lovely back i wont say a word of mrs mackbut she has taken possession of uncle james and seems to me to weigh upon him somehow rosey is as pretty and goodnatured as ever and has learned two new songs but you see with my sentiments in another quarter i feel as it were guilty and awkward in company of rosey and her mamma they have become the very greatest friends with bryanstone square and mrs mack is always citing aunt hobson as the most superior of women in which opinion i daresay aunt hobson concurs  goodbye my dearest father my sheet is full i wish i could put my arm in yours and pace up and down the pier with you and tell you more and more but you know enough now and that i am your affectionate son always c n  in fact when mr clive appeared at steyne gardens stepping out of the fly and handing miss ethel thence miss honeyman of course was very glad to see her nephew and saluted him with a little embrace to show her sense of pleasure at his visit but the next day being sunday when clive with a most engaging smile on his countenance walked over to breakfast from his hotel miss honeyman would scarcely speak to him during the meal looked out at him very haughtily from under her sunday cap and received his stories about italy with oh ah indeed in a very unkind manner and when breakfast was over and she had done washing her age chins she fluttered up to clive with such an agitation of plumage redness of craw and anger of manner as a maternal hen shows if she has reason to think you menace her chickens she fluttered up to clive i say and cried out not in this house clivenot in this house i beg you to understand that  clive looking amazed said certainly not maam i never did do it in the house as i know you dont like it i was going into the square the young man meaning that he was about to smoke and conjecturing that his aunts anger applied to that practice  you know very well what i mean sir dont try to turn me off in that hightytighty way my dinner today is at halfpast one you can dine or not as you like and the old lady flounced out of the room  poor clive stood rolling his cigar in sad perplexity of spirit until mrs honeymans servant hannah entered who for her part grinned and looked particularly sly in the name of goodness hannah what is the row about cries mr clive what is my aunt scolding at what are you grinning at you old cheshire cat  git long master clive says hannah patting the cloth  get along why get along and where am i to get along to  did ee do ut really now master clive cries mrs honeymans attendant grinning with the utmost goodhumour well she be as pretty a young lady as ever i saw and as i told my missis miss martha says i theres a pair on em though missis was mortal angry to be sure she never could bear it  bear what you old goose cries clive who by these playful names had been wont to designate hannah these twenty years past  a young gentleman and a young lady a kissing of each other in the railway coach says hannah jerking up with her finger to the ceiling as much as to say there she is lar she be a pretty young creature that she be and so i told miss martha thus differently had the news which had come to them on the previous night affected the old lady and her maid  the news was that miss newcomes maid a giddy thing from the county who had not even learned as yet to hold her tongue had announced with giggling delight to lady annes maid who was taking tea with mrs hicks that mr clive had given miss ethel a kiss in the tunnel and she supposed it was a match this intelligence hannah hicks took to her mistress of whose angry behaviour to clive the next morning you may now understand the cause  clive did not know whether to laugh or to be in a rage he swore that he was as innocent of all intention of kissing miss ethel as of embracing queen elizabeth he was shocked to think of his cousin walking above fancyfree in maiden meditation whilst this conversation regarding her was carried on below how could he face her or her mother or even her maid now he had cognisance of this naughty calumny of course hannah had contradicted it of course i have a done no such indeed replied master clives old friend of course i have set em down a bit for when little trimmer said it and she supposed it was all settled between you seeing how it had been a going on in foreign parts last year mrs pincott says hold your silly tongue trimmer she says miss ethel marry a painter indeed trimmer says she while she has refused to be a countess she says and can be a marchioness any day and will be a marchioness marry a painter indeed mrs pincott says trimmer im surprised at your impidence so my dear i got angry at that clives champion continued and says i if my young master aint good enough for any young lady in this world says i id like you to show her to me and if his dear father the colonel says i aint as good as your old gentleman upstairs says i who has gruel and dines upon doctors stuff the mrs pincott says i my name isnt what it is says i those were my very words master clive my dear and then mrs pincott says mrs hicks she says you dont understand society she says you dont understand society he he and the country lady with considerable humour gave an imitation of the town ladys manner  at this juncture miss honeyman reentered the parlour arrayed in her sunday bonnet her stiff and spotless collar her cashmere shawl and agra brooch and carrying her bible and prayerbook each stitched in its neat cover of brown silk dont stay chattering here you idle woman she cried to her attendant with extreme asperity and you sir if you wish to smoke your cigar you had best walk down to the cliff where the cockneys are she added glowering at clive  now i understand it all clive said trying to deprecate her anger my dear good aunt its a most absurd mistake upon my honour miss ethel is as innocent as you are  innocent or not this house is not intended for assignations clive as long as sir brian newcome lodges here you will be pleased to keep away from it sir and though i dont approve of sunday travelling i think the very best thing you can do is to put yourself in the train and go back to london  and now young people who read my moral pages you will see how highly imprudent it is to sit with your cousins in railway carriages and how though you may not mean the slightest harm in the world a great deal may be attributed to you and how when you think you are managing your little absurd loveaffairs ever so quietly jeames and betsy in the servantshall are very likely talking about them and you are putting yourself in the power of those menials if the perusal of these lines has rendered one single young couple uncomfortable surely my amiable end is answered and i have written not altogether in vain  clive was going away innocent though he was yet quivering under his aunts reproof and so put out of countenance that he had not even thought of lighting the great cigar which he stuck into his foolish mouth when a shout of clive clive from half a dozen little voices roused him and presently as many little newcomes came toddling down the stairs and this one clung round his knees and that at the skirts of his coat and another took his hand and said he must come and walk with them on the beach  so away went clive to walk with his cousins and then to see his old friend miss cann with whom and the elder children he walked to church and issuing thence greeted lady anne and ethel who had also attended the service in the most natural way in the world  while engaged in talking with these miss honeyman came out of the sacred edifice crisp and stately in the famous agra brooch and cashmere shawls the goodnatured lady anne had a smile and a kind word for her as for everybody clive went up to his maternal aunt to offer his arm you must give him up to us for dinner miss honeyman if you please to be so very kind he was so goodnatured in escorting ethel down lady anne said  hm my lady says miss honeyman perking her head up in her collar clive did not know whether to laugh or not but a fine blush illuminated his countenance as for ethel she was and looked perfectly unconscious so rustling in her stiff black silk martha honeyman walked with her nephew silent by the shore of the muchsounding sea the idea of courtship of osculatory processes of marrying and giving in marriage made this elderly virgin chafe and fume she never having at any period of her life indulged in any such ideas or practices and being angry against them as childless wives will sometimes be angry and testy against matrons with their prattle about their nurseries now miss cann was a different sort of spinster and loved a bit of sentiment with all her heart from which i am led to concludebut pray is this the history of miss cann or of the newcomes  all these newcomes then entered into miss honeymans house where a number of little knives and forks were laid for them ethel was cold and thoughtful lady anne was perfectly goodnatured as her wont was sir brian came in on the arm of his valet presently wearing that look of extra neatness which invalids have who have just been shaved and combed and made ready by their attendants to receive company he was voluble though there was a perceptible change in his voice he talked chiefly of matters which had occurred forty years ago and especially of clives own father when he was a boy in a manner which interested the young man and ethel he threw me down in a chaisesad chapalways reading ormes history of indiawanted marry frenchwoman he wondered mrs newcome didnt leave tom anythingpon my word quite sprise the events of today the house of commons the city had little interest for him all the children went up and shook him by the hand with awe in their looks and he patted their yellow heads vacantly and kindly he asked clive several times where he had been and said he himself had had a slight tackvay slightwas getting well evy daystrong as a horsego back to parliament drectly and then he became a little peevish with parker his man about his broth the man retired and came back presently with profound bows and gravity to tell sir brian dinner was ready and he went away quite briskly at this news giving a couple of fingers to clive before he disappeared into the upper apartments goodnatured lady anne was as easy about this as about the other events of this world in later days with what a strange feeling we remember that last sight we have of the old friend that nod of farewell and shake of the hand that last look of the face and figure as the door closes on him or the coach drives away so the roast mutton was ready and all the children dined very heartily  the infantile meal had not been long concluded when servants announced the marquis of farintosh and that nobleman made his appearance to pay his respects to miss newcome and lady anne he brought the very last news of the very last party in london where really upon my honour now it was quite a stupid party because miss newcome wasnt there it was now really  miss newcome remarked if he said so upon his honour of course she was satisfied  as you werent there the young nobleman continued the miss rackstraws came out quite strong really they did now upon my honour it was quite a quiet thing lady merriborough hadnt even got a new gown on lady anne you shirk london society this year and we miss you we expected you to give us two or three things this season we did now really i said to tufthunt only yesterday why has not lady anne newcome given anything you know tufthunt they say hes a clever fellow and thatbut hes a low little beast and i hate him  lady anne said sir brians bad state of health prevented her from going out this season or receiving at home  it dont prevent your mother from going out though continued my lord upon my honour i think unless she got two or three things every night i think shed die lady kews like one of those horses you know that unless they go they drop  thank you for my mother said lady anne  she is upon my honour last night i know she was at ever so many places she dined at the bloxams for i was there then she said she was going to sit with old mrs crackthorpe who has broke her collarbone that crackthorpe in the life guards her grandson is a brute and i hope she wont leave him a shillin and then she came on to lady hawkstones where i heard her say she had been at theat the flowerdales too people begin to go to those flowerdales hangedif i know where they wont go next cottonspinner wasnt he  so were we my lord says miss newcome  oh yes i forgot but youre of an old familyvery old family  we cant help it said miss ethel archly indeed she thought she was  do you believe in the barbersurgeon asked clive and my lord looked at him with a noble curiosity as much as to say who the deuce was the barbersurgeon and who the devil are you  why should we disown our family miss ethel said simply in those early days i suppose people diddid all sorts of things and it was not considered at all out of the way to be surgeon to william the conqueror  edward the confessor interposed clive and it must be true because i have seen a picture of the barbersurgeon a friend of mine mcollop did the picture and i dare say it is for sale still  lady anne said she should be delighted to see it lord farintosh remembered that the mcollop had the moor next to his in argyleshire but did not choose to commit himself with the stranger and preferred looking at his own handsome face and admiring it in the glass until the last speaker had concluded his remarks  as clive did not offer any further conversation but went back to a table where he began to draw the barbersurgeon lord farintosh resumed the delightful talk what infernal bad glasses these are in these brighton lodginghouses they make a man look quite green really they doand theres nothing green in me is there lady anne  but you look very unwell lord farintosh indeed you do miss newcome said gravely i think late hours and smoking and going to that horrid platts where i dare say you go  go dont i but dont call it horrid really now dont call it horrid cried the noble marquis  wellsomething has made you look far from well you know how very well lord farintosh used to look mammaand to see him now in only his second seasonoh it is melancholy  god bless my soul miss newcome what do you mean i think i look pretty well and the noble youth passed his hand through his hair it is a hard life i know that tearin about night after night and sittin up till ever so much oclock and then all these races you know comin one after anotherits enough to knock up any fellow ill tell you what ill do miss newcome ill go down to codlington to my mother i will upon my honour and lie quiet all july and then ill go to scotlandand you shall see whether i dont look better next season  do lord farintosh said ethel greatly amused as much perhaps at the young marquis as at her cousin clive who sat whilst the other was speaking fuming with rage at his table  what are you doing clive she asks  i was trying to draw lord knows wholord newcome who was killed at the battle of bosworth said the artist and the girl ran to look at the picture  why you have made him like punch cries the young lady  its a shame caricaturing ones own flesh and blood isnt it asked clive gravely  what a droll funny picture exclaims lady anne isnt it capital lord farintosh  i dare sayi confess i dont understand that sort of thing says his lordship dont upon my honour theres odo carton always making those caricaturesi dont understand em youll come up to town tomorrow wont you and youre goin to lady hms and to hm and hms aint you the names of these aristocratic places of resort were quite inaudible you mustnt let miss blackcap have it all her own way you know that you mustnt  she wont have it all her own way says miss ethel lord farintosh will you do me a favour lady innishowan is your aunt  of course she is my aunt  will you be so very good as to get a card for her party on tuesday for my cousin mr clive newcome clive please be introduced to the marquis of farintosh  the young marquis perfectly well recollected those mustachios and their wearer on a former night though he had not thought fit to make any sign of recognition anything you wish miss newcome he said delighted im sure and turning to clivein the army i suppose  i am an artist says clive turning very red  oh really i didnt know cries the nobleman and my lord bursting out laughing presently as he was engaged in conversation with miss ethel on the balcony clive thought very likely with justice he is making fun of my mustachios confound him i should like to pitch him over into the street but this was only a kind wish on mr newcomes part not followed out by any immediate fulfilment  as the marquis of farintosh seemed inclined to prolong his visit and his company was exceedingly disagreeable to clive the latter took his departure for an afternoon walk consoled to think that he should have ethel to himself at the evenings dinner when lady anne would be occupied about sir brian and would be sure to be putting the children to bed and in a word would give him a quarter of an hour of delightful teteatete with the beautiful ethel  clives disgust was considerable when he came to dinner at length and found lord farintosh likewise invited and sprawling in the drawingroom his hopes of a teteatete were over ethel and lady anne and my lord talked as all people will about their mutual acquaintance what parties were coming off who was going to marry whom and so forth and as the persons about whom they conversed were in their own station of life and belonged to the fashionable world of which clive had but a slight knowledge he chose to fancy that his cousin was giving herself airs and to feel sulky and uneasy during their dialogue  miss newcome had faults of her own and was worldly enough as perhaps the reader has begun to perceive but in this instance no harm sure was to be attributed to her if two gossips in aunt honeymans parlour had talked over the affairs of mr jones and mr brown clive would not have been angry but a young man of spirit not unfrequently mistakes his vanity for independence and it is certain that nothing is more offensive to us of the middle class than to hear the names of great folks constantly introduced into conversation  so clive was silent and ate no dinner to the alarm of martha who had put him to bed many a time and always had a maternal eye over him when he actually refused currant and raspberry tart and custard the chef doeuvre of miss honeyman for which she had seen him absolutely cry in his childhood the good martha was alarmed  law master clive she said do ee eat some missis made it you know she did and she insisted on bringing back the tart to him  lady anne and ethel laughed at this eagerness on the worthy old womans part do ee eat some clive says ethel imitating honest mrs hicks who had left the room  its doosid good remarked lord farintosh  then do ee eat some more said miss newcome on which the young nobleman holding out his plate observed with much affability that the cook of the lodgings was really a stunner for tarts  the cook dear me its not the cook cries miss ethel dont you remember the princess in the arabian nights who was such a stunner for tarts lord farintosh  lord farintosh couldnt say that he did  well i thought not but there was a princess in arabia or china or somewhere who made such delicious tarts and custards that nobodys could compare with them and there is an old lady in brighton who has the same wonderful talent she is the mistress of this house  and she is my aunt at your lordships service said mr clive with great dignity  upon my honour did you make em lady anne asked my lord  the queen of hearts made tarts cried out miss newcome rather eagerly and blushing somewhat  my good old aunt miss honeyman made this one clive would go on to say  mr honeymans sister the preacher you know where we go on sunday miss ethel interposed  the honeyman pedigree is not a matter of very great importance lady anne remarked gently kuhn will you have the goodness to take away these things when did you hear of colonel newcome clive  an air of deep bewilderment and perplexity had spread over lord farintoshs fine countenance whilst this talk about pastry had been going on the arabian princess the queen of hearts making tarts miss honeyman who the deuce were all these such may have been his lordships doubts and queries whatever his cogitations were he did not give utterance to them but remained in silence for some time as did the rest of the little party clive tried to think he had asserted his independence by showing that he was not ashamed of his old aunt but the doubt may be whether there was any necessity for presenting her in this company and whether mr clive had not much better have left the tart question alone  ethel evidently thought so for she talked and rattled in the most lively manner with lord farintosh for the rest of the evening and scarcely chose to say a word to her cousin lady anne was absent with sir brian and her children for the most part of the time and thus clive had the pleasure of listening to miss newcome uttering all sorts of odd little paradoxes firing the while sly shots at mr clive and indeed making fun of his friends exhibiting herself in not the most agreeable light her talk only served the more to bewilder lord farintosh who did not understand a tithe of her allusions for heaven which had endowed the young marquis with personal charms a large estate an ancient title and the pride belonging to it had not supplied his lordship with a great quantity of brains or a very feeling heart  lady anne came back from the upper regions presently with rather a grave face and saying that sir brian was not so well this evening upon which the young men rose to depart my lord said he had a most delightful dinner and a most delightful tart pon his honour and was the only one of the little company who laughed at his own remark miss ethels eyes flashed scorn at mr clive when that unfortunate subject was introduced again  my lord was going back to london tomorrow was miss newcome going back wouldnt he like to go back in the train with heranother unlucky observation lady anne said it would depend on the state of sir brians health the next morning whether ethel would return and both of you gentlemen are too young to be her escort added the kind lady then she shook hands with clive as thinking she had said something too for him  farintosh in the meantime was taking leave of miss newcome pray pray said his lordship dont throw me over at lady innishowans you know i hate balls and never go to em except when you go i hate dancing i do pon my honour  thank you said miss newcome with a curtsey  except with one persononly one person upon my honour ill remember and get the invitation for your friend and if you would but try that mare i give you my honour i bred her at codlington shes a beauty to look at and as quiet as a lamb  i dont want a horse like a lamb replied the young lady  wellshell go like blazes now and over timber shes splendid now she is upon my honour  when i come to london perhaps you may trot her out said miss ethel giving him her hand and a fine smile  clive came up biting his lips i suppose you dont condescend to ride bhurtpore any more now he said  poor old bhurtpore the children ride him now said miss ethelgiving clive at the same time a dangerous look of her eyes as though to see if her shot had hit then she added nohe has not been brought up to town this year he is at newcome and i like him very much perhaps she thought the shot had struck too deep  but if clive was hurt he did not show his wound you have had him these four yearsyes its four years since my father broke him for you and you still continue to like him what a miracle of constancy you use him sometimes in the countrywhen you have no better horsewhat a compliment to bhurtpore  nonsense miss ethel here made clive a sign in her most imperious manner to stay a moment when lord farintosh had departed  but he did not choose to obey this order good night he said before i go i must shake hands with my aunt downstairs and he was gone following close upon lord farintosh who i dare say thought why the deuce cant he shake hands with his aunt up here and when clive entered miss honeymans backparlour making a bow to the young nobleman my lord went away more perplexed than ever and the next day told friends at whites what uncommonly queer people those newcomes were i give you my honour there was a fellow at lady annes whom they call clive who is a painter by tradehis uncle is a preacherhis father is a horsedealer and his aunt lets lodgings and cooks the dinner     chapter xliii returns to some old friends   the haggard youth burst into my chambers in the temple on the very next morning and confided to me the story which has been just here narrated when he had concluded it with many ejaculations regarding the heroine of the tale i saw her sir he added walking with the children and miss cann as i drove round in the fly to the stationand didnt even bow to her  why did you go round by the cliff asked clives friend  that is not the way from the steyne arms to the railroad  hang it says clive turning very red i wanted to pass just under her windows and if i saw her not to see her and thats what i did  why did she walk on the cliff mused clives friend at that early hour not to meet lord farintosh i should think he never gets up before twelve it must have been to see you didnt you tell her you were going away in the morning  i tell you what she does with me continues mr clive sometimes she seems to like me and then she leaves me sometimes she is quite kindkind she always isi mean you know penyou know what i mean and then up comes the old countess or a young marquis or some fellow with a handle to his name and she whistles me off till the next convenient opportunity  women are like that my ingenuous youth says clives counsellor  i wont stand it i wont be made a fool of he continues she seems to expect everybody to bow to her and moves through the world with her imperious airs oh how confoundedly handsome she is with them i tell you what i feel inclined to tumble down and feel one of her pretty little feet on my neck and say there trample my life out make a slave of me let me get a silver collar and mark ethel on it and go through the world with my badge  and a blue ribbon for a footman to hold you by and a muzzle to wear in the dogdays bow wow says mr pendennis  at this noise mr warrington puts his head in from the neighbouring bedchamber and shows a beard just lathered for shaving we are talking sentiment go back till you are wanted says mr pendennis exit he of the soapsuds  dont make fun of a fellow clive continues laughing ruefully you see i must talk about it to somebody i shall die if i dont sometimes sir i rise up in my might and i defy her lightning the sarcastic dodge is the best i have borrowed that from you pen old boy that puzzles her that would beat her if i could but go on with it but there comes a tone of her sweet voice a look out of those killing grey eyes and all my frame is in a thrill and a tremble when she was engaged to lord kew i did battle with the confounded passionand i ran away from it like an honest man and the gods rewarded me with ease of mind after a while but now the thing rages worse than ever last night i give you my honour i heard every one of the confounded hurs toll except the last when i was dreaming of my father and the chambermaid woke me with a hot water jug  did she scald you what a cruel chambermaid i see you have shaven the mustachios off  farintosh asked me whether i was going in the army said clive and she laughed i thought i had best dock them oh i would like to cut my head off as well as my hair  have you ever asked her to marry you asked clives friend  i have seen her but five times since my return from abroad the lad went on there has been always somebody by who am i a painter with five hundred a year for an allowance isnt she used to walk up on velvet and dine upon silver and hasnt she got marquises and barons and all sorts of swells in her train i darent ask her  here his friend hummed montroses lineshe either fears his fate too much or his desert is small who dares not put it to the touch and win or lose it all  i own i dare not ask her if she were to refuse me i know i should never ask again this isnt the moment when all swelldom is at her feet for me to come forward and say maiden i have watched thee daily and i think thou lovest me well i read that ballad to her at baden sir i drew a picture of the lord of burleigh wooing the maiden and asked what she would have done  oh you did i thought when we were at baden we were so modest that we did not even whisper our condition  a fellow cant help letting it be seen and hinting it says clive with another blush they can read it in our looks fast enough and what is going on in our minds hang them i recollect she said in her grave cool way that after all the lord and lady of burleigh did not seem to have made a very good marriage and that the lady would have been much happier in marrying one of her own degree  that was a very prudent saying for a young lady of eighteen remarks clives friend  yes but it was not an unkind one say ethel thoughtthought what was the case and being engaged herself and knowing how friends of mine had provided a very pretty little partner for meshe is a dear good little girl little rosey and twice as good pen when her mother is awayknowing this and that i say suppose ethel wanted to give me a hint to keep quiet was she not right in the counsel she gave me she is not fit to be a poor mans wife fancy ethel newcome going into the kitchen and making pies like aunt honeyman  the circassian beauties dont sell under so many thousand purses remarked mr pendennis if theres a beauty in a wellregulated georgian family they fatten her they feed her with the best racahout des arabes they give her silk robes and perfumed baths have her taught to play on the dulcimer and dance and sing and when she is quite perfect send her down to constantinople for the sultans inspection the rest of the family think never of grumbling but eat coarse meat bathe in the river wear old clothes and praise allah for their sisters elevation bah do you suppose the turkish system doesnt obtain all over the world my poor clive this article in the mayfair market is beyond your worships price some things in this world are made for our betters young man let dives say grace for his dinner and the dogs and lazarus be thankful for the crumbs here comes warrington shaven and smart as if he was going out acourting  thus it will be seen that in his communication with certain friends who approached nearer to his own time of life clive was much more eloquent and rhapsodical than in the letter which he wrote to his father regarding his passion for miss ethel he celebrated her with pencil and pen he was for ever drawing the outline of her head the solemn eyebrow the nose that wondrous little nose descending from the straight forehead the short upper lip and chin sweeping in a full curve to the neck etc etc a frequenter of his studio might see a whole gallery of ethels there represented when mrs mackenzie visited that place and remarked one face and figure repeated on a hundred canvases and papers grey white and brown i believe she was told that the original was a famous roman model from whom clive had studied a great deal during his residence in italy on which mrs mack gave it as her opinion that clive was a sad wicked young fellow the widow thought rather the better of him for being a sad wicked young fellow and as for miss rosey she was of course of mammas way of thinking rosey went through the world constantly smiling at whatever occurred she was goodhumoured through the dreariest long evenings at the most stupid parties sate goodhumouredly for hours at shoolbreds whilst mamma was making purchases heard goodhumouredly those old old stories of her mothers day after day bore an hours joking or an hours scolding with equal goodhumour and whatever had been the occurrences of her simple day whether there was sunshine or cloudy weather or flashes of lightning and bursts of rain i fancy miss mackenzie slept after them quite undisturbedly and was sure to greet the morrows dawn with a smile  had clive become more knowing in his travels had love or experience opened his eyes that they looked so differently now upon objects which before used well enough to please them it is a fact that until he went abroad he thought widow mackenzie a dashing lively agreeable woman he used to receive her stories about cheltenham the colonies the balls at government house the observations which the bishop made and the peculiar attention of the chief justice to mrs major mshane with the majors uneasy behaviourall these to hear at one time did clive not ungraciously incline our friend mrs mack the good old colonel used to say is a clever woman of the world and has seen a great deal of company that story of sir thomas sadman dropping a pockethandkerchief in his court at colombo which the queens advocate ogoggarty picked up and on which laura macs was embroidered whilst the major was absolutely in the witnessbox giving evidence against a native servant who had stolen one of his cockedhatsthat story always made good thomas newcome laugh and clive used to enjoy it too and the widows mischievous fun in narrating it and now behold one day when mrs mackenzie recounted the anecdote in her best manner to messrs pendennis and warrington and frederick bayham who had been invited to meet mr clive in fitzroy squarewhen mr binnie chuckled when rosey as in duty bound looked discomposed and said law mammanot one sign of goodhumour not one ghost of a smile made its apparition on clives dreary face he painted imaginary portraits with a strawberry stalk he looked into his waterglass as though he would plunge and drown there and bayham had to remind him that the claret jug was anxious to have another embrace from its constant friend f b when mrs mack went away distributing smiles clive groaned out good heavens how that story does bore me and lapsed into his former moodiness not giving so much as a glance to rosey whose sweet face looked at him kindly for a moment as she followed in the wake of her mamma  the mothers the woman for my money i heard f b whisper to warrington splendid figurehead sirmagnificent build sir from bows to sterni like em of that sort thank you mr binnie i will take a backhander as clive dont seem to drink the youth sir has grown melancholy with his travels im inclined to think some noble roman has stolen the young mans heart why did you not send us over a picture of the charmer clive young ridley mr binnie you will be happy to hear is bidding fair to take a distinguished place in the world of arts his picture has been greatly admired and my good friend mrs ridley tells me that lord todmorden has sent him over an order to paint him a couple of pictures at a hundred guineas apiece  i should think so j js pictures will be worth five times a hundred guineas ere five years are over says clive  in that case it wouldnt be a bad speculation for our friend sherrick remarked f b to purchase a few of the young mans works i would only i havent the capital to spare mine has been vested in an odessa venture sir in a large amount of wild oats which up to the present moment make me no return but it will always be a consolation to me to think that i have been the meansthe humble meansof furthering that deserving young mans prospects in life  you f b and how we asked  by certain humble contributions of mine to the press answered bayham majestically mr warrington the claret happens to stand with you and exercise does it good sir yes the articles trifling as they may appear have attracted notice continued f b sipping his wine with great gusto they are noticed pendennis give me leave to say by parties who dont value so much the literary or even the political part of the pall mall gazette though both i am told by those who read them are conducted with considerableconsummate ability john ridley sent a hundred pounds over to his father the other day who funded it in his sons name and ridley told the story to lord todmorden when the venerable nobleman congratulated him on having such a child i wish f b had one of the same sort sir in which sweet prayer we all of us joined with a laugh  one of us had told mrs mackenzie let the criminal blush to own that quizzing his fellowcreatures used at one time to form part of his youthful amusement that f b was the son of a gentleman of most ancient family and vast landed possessions and as bayham was particularly attentive to the widow and grandiloquent in his remarks she was greatly pleased by his politeness and pronounced him a most distinque manreminding her indeed of general hopkirk who commanded in canada and she bade rosey sing for mr bayham who was in a rapture at the young ladys performances and said no wonder such an accomplished daughter came from such a mother though how such a mother could have a daughter of such an age he f b was at a loss to understand oh sir mrs mackenzie was charmed and overcome at this novel compliment meanwhile the little artless rosey warbled on her pretty ditties  it is a wonder growled out mr warrington that that sweet girl can belong to such a woman i dont understand much about women but that one appears to me to behum  what george asked warringtons friend  well an ogling leering scheming artful old campaigner grumbled the misogynist as for the little girl i should like to have her to sing to me all night long depend upon it she would make a much better wife for clive than that fashionable cousin of his he is hankering after i heard him bellowing about her the other day in chambers as i was dressing what the deuce does the boy want with a wife at all and roseys song being by this time finished warrington went up with a blushing face and absolutely paid a compliment to miss mackenziean almost unheardof effort on georges part  i wonder whether it is every young fellows lot quoth george as we trudged home together to pawn his heart away to some girl thats not worth the winning psha its all mad rubbish this sentiment the women ought not to be allowed to interfere with us married if a man must be a suitable wife should be portioned out to him and there an end of it why doesnt the young man marry this girl and get back to his business and paint his pictures because his father wishes itand the old nabob yonder who seems a kindlydisposed easygoing old heathen philosopher heres a pretty little girl money i suppose in sufficiencyeverything satisfactory except i grant you the campaigner the lad might daub his canvases christen a child a year and be as happy as any young donkey that browses on this common of oursbut he must go and heehaw after a zebra forsooth a lusus naturae is she i never spoke to a woman of fashion thank my starsi dont know the nature of the beast and since i went to our raceballs as a boy scarcely ever saw one as i dont frequent operas and parties in london like you young flunkeys of the aristocracy i heard you talking about this one i couldnt help it as my door was open and the young one was shouting like a madman what does he choose to hang on on sufferance and hope to be taken provided miss can get no better do you mean to say that is the genteel custom and that women in your confounded society do such things every day rather than have such a creature i would take a savage woman who should nurse my dusky brood and rather than have a daughter brought up to the trade i would bring her down from the woods and sell her in virginia with which burst of indignation our friends anger ended for that night  though mr clive had the felicity to meet his cousin ethel at a party or two in the ensuing weeks of the season every time he perused the features of lady kews brass knocker in queen street no result came of the visit at one of their meetings in the world ethel fairly told him that her grandmother would not receive him you know clive i cant help myself nor would it be proper to make you signs out of the window but you must call for all that grandmamma may become more goodhumoured or if you dont come she may suspect i told you not to come and to battle with her day after day is no pleasure sir i assure you here is lord farintosh coming to take me to dance you must not speak to me all the evening mind that sir and away goes the young lady in a waltz with the marquis  on the same eveningas he was biting his nails or cursing his fate or wishing to invite lord farintosh into the neighbouring garden of berkeley square whence the policeman might carry to the stationhouse the corpse of the survivorlady kew would bow to him with perfect graciousness on other nights her ladyship would pass and no more recognise him than the servant who opened the door  if she was not to see him at her grandmothers house and was not particularly unhappy at his exclusion why did miss newcome encourage mr clive so that he should try and see her if clive could not get into the little house in queen street why was lord farintoshs enormous cabhorse looking daily into the firstfloor windows of that street why were little quiet dinners made for him before the opera before going to the play upon a halfdozen occasions when some of the old old kew port was brought out of the cellar where cobwebs had gathered round it ere farintosh was born the diningroom was so tiny that not more than five people could sit at the little round table that is not more than lady kew and her granddaughter miss crochet the late vicars daughter at kewbury one of the miss toadins and captain walleye or tommy henchman farintoshs kinsman and admirer who were of no consequence or old fred tiddler whose wife was an invalid and who was always ready at a moments notice crackthorpe once went to one of these dinners but that young soldier being a frank and highspirited youth abused the entertainment and declined more of them i tell you what i was wanted for the captain told his mess and clive at the regents park barracks afterwards i was expected to go as farintoshs groom of the stole dont you know to stand or if i could sit in the back seat of the box whilst his royal highness made talk with the beauty to go out and fetch the carriage and walk downstairs with that d crooked old dowager that looks as if she usually rode on a broomstick by jove or else with that bony old painted sheepfaced companion whos raddled like an old bellwether i think newcome you seem rather hit by the belle cousineso was i last season so were ever so many of the fellows by jove sir theres nothing i know more comfortable or inspiritin than a younger sons position when a marquis cuts in with fifteen thousand a year we fancy weve been making running and suddenly we find ourselves nowhere miss mary or miss lucy or miss ethel saving your presence will no more look at us than my dog will look at a bit of bread when i offer her this cutlet will youold woman no you old slut that you wont to mag an isle of skye terrier who in fact prefers the cutlet having snuffed disdainfully at the breadthat you wont no more than any of your sex why do you suppose if jacks eldest brother had been deadbarebones belsize they used to call him i dont believe he was a bad fellow though he was fond of psalmsingingdo you suppose that lady clara would have looked at that cocktail barney newcome beg your pardon if hes your cousinbut a more odious little snob i never saw  i give you up barnes said clive laughing anybody may shy at him and i shant interfere  i understand but at nobody else of the family well what i mean is that that old woman is enough to spoil any young girl she takes in hand she dries em up and poisons em sir and i was never more glad than when i heard that kew had got out of her old clutches frank is a fellow that will always be led by some woman or another and im only glad it should be a good one they say his mothers serious and that but why shouldnt she bet continues honest crackthorpe puffing his cigar with great energy they say the old dowager doesnt believe in god nor devil but that shes in such a funk to be left in the dark that she howls and raises the dooses own delight if her candle goes out toppleton slept next room to her at groningham and heard her didnt you top  heard her howling like an old cat on the tiles says toppletonthought she was at first my man told me that she used to fling all sorts of thingsbootjacks and things give you my honourat her maid and that the woman was all over black and blue  capital head that is newcome has done of jack belsize says crackthorpe from out of his cigar  and kews toofamous likeness i say newcome if you have em printed the whole brigadell subscribe make your fortune see if you wont cries toppleton  hes such a heavy swell he dont want to make his fortune ejaculates butts  butts old boy hell paint you for nothing and send you to the exhibition where some widow will fall in love with you and you shall be put as frontispiece for the book of beauty by jove cries another military satiristto whom butts  you hold your tongue you old saracens head theyre going to have you done on the bearsgrease pots i say i suppose jacks all right now when did he write to you last cracky  he wrote from palermoa most jolly letter from him and kew he hasnt touched a card for nine months is going to give up play so is frank too grown quite a good boy so will you too butts you old miscreant repent of your sins pay your debts and do something handsome for that poor deluded milliner in albany street jack says kews mother has written over to lord highgate a beautiful letterand the old boys relenting and theyll come together againjacks eldest son now you know bore for lady susan only having girls  not a bore for jack though cries another and what a good fellow jack was and what a trump kew is how famously he stuck by him went to see him in prison and paid him out and what good fellows we all are in general became the subject of the conversation the latter part of which took place in the smokingroom of the regents park barracks then occupied by that regiment of life guards of which lord kew and mr belsize had been members both were still fondly remembered by their companions and it was because belsize had spoken very warmly of clives friendliness to him that jacks friend the gallant crackthorpe had been interested in our hero and found an opportunity of making his acquaintance  with these frank and pleasant young men clive soon formed a considerable intimacy and if any of his older and peaceful friends chanced to take their afternoon airing in the park and survey the horsemen there we might have the pleasure of beholding mr newcome in rotten row riding side by side with other dandies who had mustachios blonde or jet who wore flowers in their buttons themselves being flowers of spring who rode magnificent thoroughbred horses scarcely touching their stirrups with the tips of their varnished boots and who kissed the most beautiful primrosecoloured kid gloves to lovely ladies passing them in the ride clive drew portraits of half the officers of the life guards green and was appointed painter in ordinary to that distinguished corps his likeness of the colonel would make you die with laughing his picture of the surgeon was voted a masterpiece he drew the men in the saddle in the stable in their flannel dresses sweeping their flashing swords about receiving lancers repelling infantrynay cuttinga sheep in two as some of the warriors are known to be able to do at one stroke detachments of life guardsmen made their appearance in charlotte street which was not very distant from their barracks the most splendid cabs were seen prancing before his door and curlywhiskered youths of aristocratic appearance smoking cigars out of his paintingroom window how many times did clives nextdoor neighbour little mr finch the miniaturepainter run to peep through his parlour blinds hoping that a sitter was coming and a carriageparty driving up what wrath mr scowler ara was in because a young hopomythumb dandy who wore gold chains and his collars turned down should spoil the trade and draw portraits for nothing why did none of the young men come to scowler scowler was obliged to own that mr newcome had considerable talent and a good knack at catching a likeness he could not paint a bit to be sure but his heads in blackandwhite were really tolerable his sketches of horses very vigorous and lifelike mr gandish said if clive would come for three or four years into his academy he could make something of him mr smee shook his head and said he was afraid that kind of loose desultory study that keeping of aristocratic company was anything but favourable to a young artistsmee who would walk five miles to attend an evening party of ever so little a great man     chapter xliv in which mr charles honeyman appears in an amiable light   mr frederick bayham waited at fitzroy square while clive was yet talking with his friends there and favoured that gentleman with his company home to the usual smoky refreshment clive always rejoiced in f bs society whether he was in a sportive mood or as now in a solemn and didactic vein f b had been more than ordinarily majestic all the evening i dare say you find me a good deal altered clive he remarked i am a good deal altered since that good samaritan your kind father had compassion on a poor fellow fallen among thieves though i dont say mind you he was much better than his company f b has mended some of his ways i am trying a course of industry sir powers perhaps naturally great have been neglected over the winecup and the die i am beginning to feel my way and my chiefs yonder who have just walked home with their cigars in their mouths and without as much as saying f b my boy shall we go to the haunt and have a cool lobster and a glass of tablebeerwhich they certainly do not consider themselves to bei say sir the politician and the literary critic there was a most sarcastic emphasis laid on these phrases characterising messrs warrington and pendennis may find that there is a humble contributor to the pall mall gazette whose name may be the amateur shall one day reckon even higher than their own mr warrington i do not say so muchhe is an able man sir an able manbut there is that about your exceedin selfsatisfied friend mr arthur pendennis whichwell welllet time show you did notget thehempaper at rome and naples i suppose  forbidden by the inquisition says clive delighted and at naples the king furious against it  i dont wonder they dont like it at rome sir theres serious matter in it which may set the prelates of a certain church rather in a tremor you havent readtheahemthe pulpit pencillings in the p m g slight sketches mental and corporeal of our chief divines now in londonand signed latimer  i dont do much in that way said clive  so much the worse for you my young friend not that i mean to judge any other fellow harshlyi mean any other fellow sinner harshlyor that i mean that those pulpit pencillings would be likely to do you any great good but such as they are they have been productive of benefitthank you mary and my dear the tap is uncommonly good and i drink to your future husbands good healtha glass of good sound beer refreshes after all that claret well sir to return to the pencillings pardon my vanity in saying that though mr pendennis laughs at them they have been of essential service to the paper they give it a character they rally round it the respectable classes they create correspondence i have received many interesting letters chiefly from females about the pencillings some complain that their favourite preachers are slighted others applaud because the clergymen they sit under are supported by f b i am laud latimer sirthough i have heard the letters attributed to the rev mr bunker and to a member of parliament eminent in the religious world  so you are the famous laud latimer cries clive who had in fact seen letters signed by those right reverend names in our paper  famous is hardly the word one who scoffs at everythingi need not say i allude to mr arthur pendenniswould have had the letters signedthe beadle of the parish he calls me the venerable beadle sometimesit being i grieve to say his way to deride grave subjects you wouldnt suppose now my young clive that the same hand which pens the art criticisms occasionally when his highness pendennis is lazy takes a minor theatre or turns the sportive epigram or the ephemeral paragraph should adopt a grave theme on a sunday and chronicle the sermons of british divines for eighteen consecutive sunday evenings clive in mrs ridleys front parlour which i now occupy vice miss cann promoted i have written the pencillingsscarcely allowing a drop of refreshment except under extreme exhaustion to pass my lips pendennis laughs at the pencillings he wants to stop them and says they bore the publici dont want to think a man is jealous who was himself the cause of my engagement at the p m gperhaps my powers were not developed then  pen thinks he writes better now than when he began remarked clive i have heard him say so  his opinion of his own writings is high whatever their date mine sir are only just coming into notice they begin to know f b sir in the sacred edifices of his metropolitan city i saw the bishop of london looking at me last sunday week and am sure his chaplain whispered him its mr bayham my lord nephew of your lordships right reverend brother the lord bishop of bullocksmithy and last sunday being at churchat saint mungo the martyrs rev sawdersby wednesday i got in a female handmrs sawderss no doubtthe biography of the incumbent of st mungo an account of his early virtues a copy of his poems and a hint that he was the gentleman destined for the vacant deanery  ridley is not the only man i have helped in this world f b continued perhaps i should blush to own iti do blush but i feel the ties of early acquaintance and i own that i have puffed your uncle charles honeyman most tremendously it was partly for the sake of the ridleys and the tick he owes em partly for old times sake sir are you aware that things are greatly changed with charles honeyman and that the poor f b has very likely made his fortune  i am delighted to hear it cried clive and how f b have you wrought this miracle  by common sense and enterprise ladby a knowledge of the world and a benevolent disposition youll see lady whittleseas chapel bears a very different aspect now that miscreant sherrick owns that he owes me a turn and has sent me a few dozen of winewithout any stamped paper on my part in returnas an acknowledgment of my service it chanced sir soon after your departure for italy that going to his private residence respecting a little bill to which a heedless friend had put his hand sherrick invited me to partake of tea in the bosom of his family i was thirstyhaving walked in from jack straws castle at hampstead where poor kitely and i had been taking a chopand accepted the proffered entertainment the ladies of the family gave us music after the domestic muffinand then sir a great idea occurred to me you know how magnificently miss sherrick and the mother sing thy sang mozart sir why i asked of sherrick should those ladies who sing mozart to a piano not sing handel to an organ  dash it you dont mean a hurdygurdy  sherrick says i you are no better than a heathen ignoramus i mean why shouldnt they sing handes church music and church music in general in lady whittleseas chapel behind the screen up in the organloft whats to prevent em by jingo your singingboys have gone to the cave of harmody you and your choir have splitwhy should not these ladies lead it he caught at the idea you never heard the chants more finely givenand they would be better still if the congregation would but hold their confounded tongues it was an excellent though a harmless dodge sir and drew immensely to speak profanely they dress the part sir to admirationa sort of nunlike costume they come in mrs sherrick has the soul of an artist stillby jove sir when they have once smelt the lamps the love of the trade never leaves em the ladies actually practised by moonlight in the chapel and came over to honeymans to an oyster afterwards the thing took sir people began to take boxseats i mean againand charles honeyman easy in his mind through your noble fathers generosity perhaps inspirited by returning good fortune has been preaching more eloquently than ever he took some lessons of husler of the haymarket sir his sermons are old i believe but so to speak he has got them up with new scenery dresses and effects sir they have flowers sir about the buildinpious ladies are supposed to provide em but entre nous sherrick contracts for them with nathan or some one in covent garden anddont tell this now upon your honour  tell what f b asks clive  i got up a persecution against your uncle for popish practices summoned a meetin at the running footman in bolingbroke street billings the butterman sharwood the turner and blackingmaker and the honourable phelin ocurragh lord scullabogues son made speeches two or three respectable families your aunt mrs whatdyoucallem newcome amongst the number quitted the chapel in disgusti wrote an article of controversial biography in the p m g set the business going in the daily press and the thing was done sir that property is a paying one to the incumbent and to sherrick over him charless affairs are getting all right sir he never had the pluck to owe much and if it be a sin to have wiped his slate clean satisfied his creditors and made charles easyupon my conscience i must confess that f b has done it i hope i may never do anything worse in this life clive it aint bad to see him doing the martyr sir sebastian riddled with paper pellets bartholomew on a cold gridiron here comes the lobster upon my word mary a finer fish ive seldom seen  now surely this account of his uncles affairs and prosperity was enough to send clive to lady whittleseas chapel and it was not because miss ethel had said that she and lady kew went there that clive was induced to go there too he attended punctually on the next sunday and in the incumbents pew whither the pewwoman conducted him sate mr sherrick in great gravity with large gold pins who handed him at the anthem a large new gilt hymnbook  an odour of millefleurs rustled by them as charles honeyman accompanied by his ecclesiastical valet passed the pew from the vestry and took his place at the desk formerly he used to wear a flaunting scarf over his surplice which was very wide and full and clive remembered when as a boy he entered the sacred robingroom how his uncle used to pat and puff out the scarf and the sleeves of his vestment and to arrange the natty curl on his forehead and take his place a fine example of florid church decoration now the scarf was trimmed down to be as narrow as your neckcloth and hung loose and straight over the back the ephod was cut straight and as close and short as might bei believe there was a little trimming of lace to the narrow sleeves and a slight arabesque of tape or other substance round the edge of the surplice as for the curl on the forehead it was no more visible than the maypole in the strand or the cross at charing honeymans hair was parted down the middle short in front and curling delicately round his ears and the back of his head he read the service in a swift manner and with a gentle twang when the music began he stood with head on one side and two slim fingers on the book as composed as a statue in a mediaeval niche it was fine to hear sherrick who had an uncommonly good voice join in the musical parts of the service the produce of the marketgardener decorated the church here and there and the impresario of the establishment having picked up a flemish painted window from old moss in wardour street had placed it in his chapel labels of faint green and gold with long gothic letters painted thereon meandered over the organloft and galleries and strove to give as mediaeval a look to lady whittleseas as the place was capable of assuming  in the sermon charles dropped the twang with the surplice and the priest gave way to the preacher he preached short stirring discourses on the subjects of the day it happened that a noble young prince the hope of a nation and heir of a royal house had just then died by a sudden accident absalom the son of david furnished honeyman with a parallel he drew a picture of the two deaths of the grief of kings of the fate that is superior to them it was indeed a stirring discourse and caused thrills through the crowd to whom charles imparted it famous aint it says sherrick giving clive a hand when the rite was over how hes come out hasnt he didnt think he had it in him sherrick seemed to have become of late impressed with the splendour of charless talents and spoke of himwas it not disrespectfulas a manager would of a successful tragedian let us pardon sherrick he had been in the theatrical way that irishman was no go at all he whispered to mr newcome got rid of himlets see at michaelmas  on account of clives tender years and natural levity a little inattention may be allowed to the youth who certainly looked about him very eagerly during the service the house was filled by the ornamental classes the bonnets of the newest parisian fashion away in a darkling corner under the organ sate a squad of footmen surely that powdered one in livery wore lady kews colours so clive looked under all the bonnets and presently spied old lady kews face as grim and yellow as her brass knocker and by it ethels beauteous countenance he dashed out of church when the congregation rose to depart stop and see honeyman wont you asked sherrick surprised  yes yes come back again said clive and was gone  he kept his word and returned presently the young marquis and an elderly lady were in lady kews company clive had passed close under lady kews venerable roman nose without causing that organ to bow in ever so slight a degree towards the ground ethel had recognised him with a smile and a nod my lord was whispering one of his noble pleasantries in her ear she laughed at the speech or the speaker the steps of a fine belozenged carriage were let down with a bang the yellow one had jumped up behind it by the side of his brother giant canary lady kews equipage had disappeared and mrs cantertons was stopping the way  clive returned to the chapel by the little door near to the vestiarium all the congregation had poured out by this time only two ladies were standing near the pulpit and sherrick with his hands rattling his money in his pockets was pacing up and down the aisle  capital house mr newcome wasnt it i counted no less than fourteen nobs the princess of moncontour and her husband i suppose that chap with the beard who yawns so during the sermon im blessed if i

julia  oh yes says julia whose hand the pastor is now pressing  when you described the young man i thought of my poor boy didnt i julia cries the mother with tears streaming down her face  we had a

his uncles fond embrace by this time who rebukes him for not having called in walpole street  now when will you two gents come up to my shop to ave a family dinner asks sherrick  ah mr newcome do come says julia in her deep rich voice looking up to him with her great black eyes and if clive had been a vain fellow like some folks who knows but he might have thought he had made an impression on the handsome julia  thursday now make it thursday if mr h is disengaged come along girls for the flies bites the ponies when theyre astanding still and makes em mad this weather anything you like for dinner cut of salmon and cucumber no pickled salmons best this weather  whatever you give me you know im thankful says honeyman in a sweet sad voice to the two ladies who were standing looking at him

you must not callahim in that way dont say mr h ma says julia  call me what you please says charles with the most heartrending simplicity and mrs sherrick straightway kisses her daughter sherrick meanwhile has been pointing out the improvement of the chapel to clive which now has indeed a look of the gothic hall at rosherville and has confided to him the sum for which he screwed the painted window out of old moss when he come to see it up in this place sir the old man was mad i give you my word his son aint no good says he knows you hes such a screw that chap that hell overreach himself mark my words at least hell never die rich did you ever hear of me screwing no i spend my money like a man how those girls are agoin on about their music with honeyman i dont let em sing in the evening or him do duty more than once a day and you can calclate how the music draws because in the evenin there aint half the number of people here rev mr journyman does the duty nowquiet hogford manill i suppose this morning h sits in his pew where we was and coughs thats to say i told him to cough the women like a consumptive parson sir come gals  clive went to his uncles lodgings and was received by mr and mrs ridley with great glee and kindness both of those good people had made it a point to pay their duty to mr clive immediately on his return to england and thank him over and over again for his kindness to john james never never would they forget his goodness and the colonels they were sure a cake a heap of biscuits a pyramid of jams six frizzling muttonchops and four kinds of hot wine came bustling up to mr honeymans room twenty minutes after clive had entered itas a token of the ridleys affection for him  clive remarked with a smile the pall mall gazette upon a sidetable and in the chimneyglass almost as many cards as in the time of honeymans early prosperity that he and his uncle should be very intimate together was impossible from the nature of the two men clive being frank clearsighted and imperious charles timid vain and doublefaced conscious that he was a humbug and that most people found him out so that he would quiver and turn away and be more afraid of young clive and his direct straightforward way than of many older men then there was the sense of the money transactions between him and the colonel which made charles honeyman doubly uneasy in fine they did not like each other but as he is a connection of the most respectable newcome family surely he is entitled to a page or two in these their memoirs  thursday came and with it mr sherricks entertainment to which also mr binnie and his party had been invited to meet colonel newcomes son uncle james and rosey brought clive in their carriage mrs mackenzie sent a headache as an apology she chose to treat uncle jamess landlord with a great deal of hauteur and to be angry with her brother for visiting such a person in fact you see how fond i must be of dear little rosey clive that i put up with all mammas tantrums for her sake remarks mr binnie  oh uncle says little rosey and the old gentleman stopped her remonstrances with a kiss  yes says he your mother does have tantrums miss and though you never complain theres no reason why i shouldnt you will not tell on me it was oh uncle again and clive wont i am surethis little thing sir james went on holding roseys pretty little hand and looking fondly in her pretty little face is her old uncles only comfort in life i wish i had had her out to india to me and never come back to this great dreary town of yours but i was tempted home by tom newcome and im too old to go back sir where the stick falls let it lie rosey would have been whisked out of my house in india in a month after i had her there some young fellow would have taken her away from me and now she has promised never to leave her old uncle james hasnt she  no never uncle said rosey  we dont want to fall in love do we child we dont want to be breaking our hearts like some young folks and dancing attendance at balls night after night and capering about in the park to see if we can get a glimpse of the beloved object eh rosey  rosey blushed it was evident that she and uncle james both knew of clives love affair in fact the front seat and back seat of the carriage both blushed and as for the secret why mrs mackenzie and mrs hobson had talked it a hundred times over  this little rosey sir has promised to take care of me on this side of styx continued uncle james and if she could but be left alone and to do it without mammathere i wont say a word more against herwe should get on none the worse  uncle james i must make a picture of you for rosey said clive goodhumouredly and rosey said oh thank you clive and held out that pretty little hand and looked so sweet and kind and happy that clive could not but be charmed at the sight of so much innocence and candour  quasty peecoly rosiny says james in a fine scotch italian e la piu bella la piu cara ragazza ma la mawdry e il diav  dont uncle cried rosey again and clive laughed at uncle jamess wonderful outbreak in a foreign tongue  eh i thought ye didnt know a word of the sweet language rosey its just the lenguy toscawny in bocky romawny that i thought to try in compliment to this young monkey who has seen the world and by this time saint johns wood was reached and mr sherricks handsome villa at the door of which the three beheld the rev charles honeyman stepping out of a neat brougham  the drawingroom contained several pictures of mrs sherrick when she was in the theatrical line smees portrait of her which was never half handsome enoughfor my betsy sherrick said indignantly the print of her in artaxerxes with her signature as elizabeth folthorpe not in truth a fine specimen of calligraphy the testimonial presented to her on the conclusion of the triumphal season of 18 at drury lane by her ever grateful friend adolphus smacker lessee who of course went to law with her next year and other thespian emblems but clive remarked with not a little amusement that the drawingroom tables were now covered with a number of those books which he had seen at madame de moncontours and many french and german ecclesiastical gimcracks such as are familiar to numberless readers of mine these were the lives of st botibol of islington and st willibald of bareacres with pictures of those confessors then there was the legend of margery dawe virgin and martyr with a sweet double frontispiece representing 1 the sainted woman selling her featherbed for the benefit of the poor and 2 reclining upon straw the leanest of invalids there was old daddy longlegs and how he was brought to say his prayers a tale for children by a lady with a preface dated st chads eve and signed c h the rev charles honeymans sermons delivered at lady whittleseas chapel poems of early days by charles honeyman am the life of good dame whittlesea by do do yes charles had come out in the literary line and there in a basket was a strip of berlin work of the very same gothic pattern which madame de moncontour was weaving and which you afterwards saw round the pulpit of charless chapel rosey was welcomed most kindly by the kind ladies and as the gentlemen sat over their wine after dinner in the summer evening clive beheld rosey and julia pacing up and down the lawn miss julias arm around her little friends waist he thought they would make a pretty little picture  my girl aint a bad one to look at is she said the pleased father a fellow might look far enough and see not prettier than them two  charles sighed out that there was a german print the two leonoras which put him in mind of their various styles of beauty  i wish i could paint them said clive  and why not sir asks his host let me give you your first commission now mr clive i wouldnt mind paying a good bit for a picture of my julia i forget how much old smee got for betsys the old humbug  clive said it was not the will but the power that was deficient he succeeded with men but the ladies were too much for him as yet  those youve done up at albany street barracks are famous ive seen em said mr sherrick and remarking that his guest looked rather surprised at the idea of his being in such company sherrick said what you think they are too great swells for me law bless you i often go there ive business with several of em had with captain belsize with the earl of kew whos every inch the gentlemanone of natures aristocracy and paid up like a man the earl and me has had many dealings together  honeyman smiled faintly and nobody complying with mr sherricks boisterous entreaties to drink more the gentlemen quitted the dinnertable which had been served in a style of prodigious splendour and went to the drawingroom for a little music  this was all of the gravest and best kind so grave indeed that james binnie might be heard in a corner giving an accompaniment of little snores to the singers and the piano but rosey was delighted with the performance and sherrick remarked to clive thats a good gal that is i like that gal she aint jealous of julia cutting her out in the music but listens as pleased as any one shes a sweet little pipe of her own too miss mackenzie if ever you like to go to the opera send a word either to my west end or my city office ive boxes every week and youre welcome to anything i can give you  so all agreed that the evening had been a very pleasant one and they of fitzroy square returned home talking in a most comfortable friendly waythat is two of them for uncle james fell asleep again taking possession of the back seat and clive and rosey prattled together he had offered to try and take all the young ladies likenesses you know what a failure the last was roseyhe had very nearly said dear rosey  yes but miss sherrick is so handsome that you will succeed better with her than with my round face mr newcome  mr what cries clive  well clive then says rosey in a little voice  he sought for a little hand which was not very far away you know we are like brother and sister dear rosey he said this time  yes said she and gave a little pressure of the hand and then uncle james woke up and it seemed as if the whole drive didnt occupy a minute and they shook hands very very kindly at the door of fitzroy square  clive made a famous likeness of miss sherrick with which mr sherrick was delighted and so was mr honeyman who happened to call upon his nephew once or twice when the ladies happened to be sitting then clive proposed to the rev charles honeyman to take his head off and made an excellent likeness in chalk of his unclethat one in fact from which the print was taken which you may see any day at hogarths in the haymarket along with a whole regiment of british divines charles became so friendly that he was constantly coming to charlotte street once or twice a week  mr and mrs sherrick came to look at the drawing were charmed with it and when rosey was sitting they came to see her portrait which again was not quite so successful one monday the sherricks and honeyman too happened to call to see the picture of rosey who trotted over with her uncle to clives studio and they all had a great laugh at a paragraph in the pall mall gazette evidently from f bs hand to the following effect  conversion in high lifea foreign nobleman of princely rank who has married an english lady and has resided among us for some time is likely we hear and trust to join the english church the prince de mncntr has been a constant attendant at lady whittleseas chapel of which the rev c honeyman is the eloquent incumbent and it is said this sound and talented divine has been the means of awakening the prince to a sense of the erroneous doctrines in which he has been bred his ancestors were protestant and fought by the side of henry iv at ivry in louis xivs time they adopted the religion of that persecuting monarch we sincerely trust that the present heir of the house of ivry will see fit to return to the creed which his forefathers so unfortunately abjured  the ladies received this news with perfect gravity and charles uttered a meek wish that it might prove true as they went away they offered more hospitalities to clive and mr binnie and his niece they liked the music would they not come and hear it again  when they had departed with mr honeyman clive could not help saying to uncle james why are those people always coming here praising me and asking me to dinner do you know i cant help thinking that they rather want me as a pretender for miss sherrick  binnie burst into a loud guffaw and cried out o vanitas vanitawtum rosa laughed too  i dont think it any joke at all said clive  why you stupid lad dont you see it is charles honeyman the girls in love with cried uncle james rosey saw it in the very first instant we entered their drawingroom three weeks ago  indeed and how asked clive  byby the way she looked at him said little rosey     chapter xlv a stag of ten   the london season was very nearly come to an end and lord farintosh had danced i dont know how many times with miss newcome had drunk several bottles of the old kew port had been seen at numerous breakfasts operas races and public places by the young ladys side and had not as yet made any such proposal as lady kew expected for her granddaughter clive going to see his military friends in the regents park once and finish captain buttss portrait in barracks heard two or three young men talking and one say to another i bet you three to two farintosh dont marry her and i bet you even that he dont ask her then as he entered mr buttss room where these gentlemen were conversing there was a silence and an awkwardness the young fellows were making an event out of ethels marriage and sporting their money freely on it  to have an old countess hunting a young marquis so resolutely that all the world should be able to look on and speculate whether her game would be run down by that staunch toothless old pursuerthat is an amusing sport isnt it and affords plenty of fun and satisfaction to those who follow the hunt but for a heroine of a story be she ever so clever handsome and sarcastic i dont think for my part at this present stage of the tale miss ethel newcome occupies a very dignified position to break her heart in silence for tomkins who is in love with another to suffer no end of poverty starvation capture by ruffians illtreatment by a bullying husband loss of beauty by the smallpox death even at the end of the volume all these mishaps a young heroine must endure and has endured in romances over and over again without losing the least dignity or suffering any diminution of the sentimental readers esteem but a girl of great beauty high temper and strong natural intellect who submits to be dragged hither and thither in an old grandmothers leash and in pursuit of a husband who will run away from the couple such a person i say is in a very awkward position as a heroine and i declare if i had another ready to my hand and unless there were extenuating circumstances ethel should be deposed at this very sentence  but a novelist must go on with his heroine as a man with his wife for better or worse and to the end for how many years have the spaniards borne with their gracious queen not because she was faultless but because she was there so chambers and grandees cried god save her alabarderos turned out drums beat cannons fired and people saluted isabella segunda who was no better than the humblest washerwoman of her subjects are we much better than our neighbours do we never yield to our peculiar temptation our pride or our avarice or our vanity or what not ethel is very wrong certainly but recollect she is very young she is in other peoples hands she has been bred up and governed by a very worldly family and taught their traditions we would hardly for instance the staunchest protestant in england would hardly be angry with poor isabella segunda for being a catholic so if ethel worships at a certain image which a great number of good folks in england bow to let us not be too angry with her idolatry and bear with our queen a little before we make our pronunciamiento  no miss newcome yours is not a dignified position in life however you may argue that hundreds of people in the world are doing like you o me what a confession it is in the very outset of life and blushing brightness of youths morning to own that the aim with which a young girl sets out and the object of her existence is to marry a rich man that she was endowed with beauty so that she might buy wealth and a title with it that as sure as she has a soul to be saved her business here on earth is to try and get a rich husband that is the career for which many a woman is bred and trained a young man begins the world with some aspirations at least he will try to be good and follow the truth he will strive to win honours for himself and never do a base action he will pass nights over his books and forgo ease and pleasure so that he may achieve a name many a poor wretch who is wornout now and old and bankrupt of fame and money too has commenced life at any rate with noble views and generous schemes from which weakness idleness passion or overpowering hostile fortune have turned him away but a girl of the world bon dieu the doctrine with which she begins is that she is to have a wealthy husband the article of faith in her catechism is i believe in elder sons and a house in town and a house in the country they are mercenary as they step fresh and blooming into the world out of the nursery they have been schooled there to keep their bright eyes to look only on the prince and the duke croesus and dives by long cramping and careful process their little natural hearts have been squeezed up like the feet of their fashionable little sisters in china as you see a paupers child with an awful premature knowledge of the pawnshop able to haggle at market with her wretched halfpence and battle bargains at hucksters stalls you shall find a young beauty who was a child in the schoolroom a year since as wise and knowing as the old practitioners on that exchange as economical of her smiles as dexterous in keeping back or producing her beautiful wares as skilful in setting one bidder against another as keen as the smartest merchant in vanity fair  if the young gentlemen of the life guards green who were talking about miss newcome and her suitors were silent when clive appeared amongst them it was because they were aware not only of his relationship to the young lady but his unhappy condition regarding her certain men there are who never tell their love but let concealment like a worm in the bud feed on their damask cheeks others again must be not always thinking but talking about the darling object so it was not very long before captain crackthorpe was taken into clives confidence and through crackthorpe very likely the whole mess became acquainted with his passion these young fellows who had been early introduced into the world gave clive small hopes of success putting to him in their downright phraseology the point of which he was already aware that miss newcome was intended for his superiors and that he had best not make his mind uneasy by sighing for those beautiful grapes which were beyond his reach  but the goodnatured crackthorpe who had a pity for the young painters condition helped him so far and gained clives warmest thanks for his good offices by asking admission for clive to entertain evening parties of the beaumonde where he had the gratification of meeting his charmer ethel was surprised and pleased and lady kew surprised and angry at meeting clive newcome at these fashionable houses the girl herself was touched very likely at his pertinacity in following her as there was no actual feud between them she could not refuse now and again to dance with her cousin and thus he picked up such small crumbs of consolation as a youth in his state can get lived upon six words vouchsafed to him in a quadrille or brought home a glance of the eyes which she had presented to him in a waltz or the remembrance of a squeeze of the hand on parting or meeting how eager he was to get a card to this party or that how attentive to the givers of such entertainments some friends of his accused him of being a tufthunter and flatterer of the aristocracy on account of his politeness to certain people the truth was he wanted to go wherever miss ethel was and the ball was blank to him which she did not attend  this business occupied not only one season but two by the time of the second season mr newcome had made so many acquaintances that he needed few more introductions into society he was very well known as a goodnatured handsome young man and a very good waltzer the only son of an indian officer of large wealth who chose to devote himself to painting and who was supposed to entertain an unhappy fondness for his cousin the beautiful miss newcome kind folks who heard of this little tendre and were sufficiently interested in mr clive asked him to their houses in consequence i dare say those people who were good to him may have been themselves at one time unlucky in their own loveaffairs  when the first season ended without a declaration from my lord lady kew carried off her young lady to scotland where it also so happened that lord farintosh was going to shoot and people made what surmises they chose upon this coincidence surmises why not you who know the world know very well that if you see mrs soandsos name in the list of people at an entertainment on looking down the list you will presently be sure to come on mr whatdyoucallems if lord and lady of suchandsuch castle received a distinguished circle including lady dash for christmas or easter without reading farther the names of the guests you may venture on any wager that captain asterisk is one of the company these coincidences happen every day and some people are so anxious to meet other people and so irresistible is the magnetic sympathy i suppose that they will travel hundreds of miles in the worst of weather to see their friends and break your door open almost provided the friend is inside it  i am obliged to own the fact that for many months lady kew hunted after lord farintosh this rheumatic old woman went to scotland where as he was pursuing the deer she stalked his lordship from scotland she went to paris where he was taking lessons in dancing at the chaumiere from paris to an english countryhouse for christmas where he was expected but didnt comenot being his professor said quite complete in the polka and so on if ethel were privy to these manoeuvres or anything more than an unwittingly consenting party i say we would depose her from her place of heroine at once but she was acting under her grandmothers orders a most imperious irresistible managing old woman who exacted everybodys obedience and managed everybodys business in her family lady anne newcome being in attendance on her sick husband ethel was consigned to the countess of kew her grandmother who hinted that she should leave ethel her property when dead and whilst alive expected the girl should go about with her she had and wrote as many letters as a secretary of state almost she was accustomed to set off without taking anybodys advice or announcing her departure until within an hour or two of the event in her train moved ethel against her own will which would have led her to stay at home with her father but at the special wish and order of her parents was such a sum as that of which lady kew had the disposal hobson brothers knew the amount of it quite well to be left out of the family forbid it all ye powers barneswho would have liked the money himself and said truly that he would live with his grandmother anywhere she liked if he could get itbarnes joined most energetically with sir brian and lady anne in ordering ethels obedience to lady kew you know how difficult it is for one young woman not to acquiesce when the family council strongly orders in fine i hope there was a good excuse for the queen of this history and that it was her wicked domineering old prime minister who led her wrong otherwise i say we would have another dynasty oh to think of a generous nature and the world and nothing but the world to occupy itof a brave intellect and the milliners bandboxes and the scandal of the coteries and the fiddlefaddle etiquette of the court for its sole exercise of the rush and hurry from entertainment to entertainment of the constant smiles and cares of representation of the prayerless rest at night and the awaking to a godless morrow this was the course of life to which fate and not her own fault altogether had for awhile handed over ethel newcome let those pity her who can feel their own weakness and misgoing let those punish her who are without fault themselves  clive did not offer to follow her to scotland he knew quite well that the encouragement he had had was only of the smallest that as a relation she received him frankly and kindly enough but checked him when he would have adopted another character but it chanced that they met in paris whither he went in the easter of the ensuing year having worked to some good purpose through the winter and despatched as on a former occasion his three or four pictures to take their chance at the exhibition  of these it is our pleasing duty to be able to corroborate to some extent mr f bayhams favourable report fancy sketches and historical pieces our young man had eschewed having convinced himself either that he had not an epic genius or that to draw portraits of his friends was a much easier task than that which he had set himself formerly whilst all the world was crowding round a pair of j js little pictures a couple of chalk heads were admitted into the exhibition his great picture of captain crackthorpe on horseback in full uniform i must admit was ignominiously rejected and the friends of the parties had the pleasure of recognising in the miniature room no 1246 picture of an officerviz augustus butts esq of the life guards green and portrait of the rev charles honeyman no 1272 miss sherrick the hangers refused mr binnie clive had spoiled as usual in the painting the heads however beforenamed were voted to be faithful likenesses and executed in a very agreeable and spirited manner f bayhams criticism on these performances it need not be said was tremendous since the days of michael angelo you would have thought there never had been such drawings in fact f b as some other critics do clapped his friends so boisterously on the back and trumpeted their merits with such prodigious energy as to make his friends themselves sometimes uneasy  mr clive whose good father was writing home more and more wonderful accounts of the bundelcund bank in which he had engaged and who was always pressing his son to draw for more money treated himself to comfortable rooms at paris in the very same hotel where the young marquis of farintosh occupied lodgings much more splendid and where he lived no doubt so as to be near the professor who was still teaching his lordship the polka indeed it must be said that lord farintosh made great progress under this artist and that he danced very much better in his third season than in the first and second years after he had come upon the town from the same instructor the marquis learned the latest novelties in french conversation the choicest oaths and phrases for which he was famous so that although his french grammar was naturally defective he was enabled to order a dinner at philippes and to bully a waiter or curse a hackneycoachman with extreme volubility a young nobleman of his rank was received with the distinction which was his due by the french sovereign of that period and at the tuileries and the houses of the french nobility which he visited monsieur le marquis de farintosh excited considerable remark by the use of some of the phrases which his young professor had taught to him people even went so far as to say that the marquis was an awkward and dull young man of the very worst manners  whereas the young clive newcomeand it comforted the poor fellows heart somewhat and be sure pleased ethel who was looking on at his triumphswas voted the most charming young englishman who had been seen for a long time in our salons madame de florac who loved him as a son of her own actually went once or twice into the world in order to see his debut madame de moncontour inhabited a part of the hotel de florac and received society there the french people did not understand what bad english she talked though they comprehended lord farintoshs french blunders monsieur newcome is an artist what a noble career cries a great french lady the wife of a marshal to the astonished miss newcome this young man is the cousin of the charming mees you must be proud to possess such a nephew madame says another french lady to the countess of kew who you may be sure is delighted to have such a relative and the french lady invites clive to her receptions expressly in order to make herself agreeable to the old comtesse before the cousins have been three minutes together in madame de floracs salon she sees that clive is in love with ethel newcome she takes the boys hand and says jai votre secret mon ami and her eyes regard him for a moment as fondly as tenderly as ever they looked at his father oh what tears have they shed gentle eyes oh what faith has it kept tender heart if love lives through all life and survives through all sorrow and remains steadfast with us through all changes and in all darkness of spirit burns brightly and if we die deplores us for ever and loves still equally and exists with the very last gasp and throb of the faithful bosomwhence it passes with the pure soul beyond death surely it shall be immortal though we who remain are separated from it is it not ours in heaven if we love still those we lose can we altogether lose those we love forty years have passed away youth and dearest memories revisit her and hope almost wakes up again out of its grave as the constant lady holds the young mans hand and looks at the son of thomas newcome     chapter xlvi the hotel de florac   since the death of the duc divry the husband of mary queen of scots the comte de florac who is now the

son had become a cordelier i went to hear him and found he was a jacobin let me make my salut in quiet my good leonore my director answers for me and plays a game at trictrac into the bargain with me our history has but little to do with this venerable nobleman he has his chamber looking out into the garden of his hotel his faithful old domestic to wait upon him his house of peers to attend when he is well enough his few acquaintances to help him to pass the evening the rest of the hotel he gives up to his son the vicomte de florac and madame la princesse de moncontour his daughterinlaw  when florac has told his friends of the club why it is he has assumed a new titleas a means of reconciliation a reconciliation all philosophical my friends with his wife nee higg of manchester who adores titles like all anglaises and has recently made a great succession everybody allows that the measure was dictated by prudence and there is no more laughter at his change of name the princess takes the first floor of the hotel at the price paid for it by the american general who has returned to his original pigs at cincinnati had not cincinnatus himself pigs on his farm and was he not a general and member of congress too the honest princess has a bedchamber which to her terror she is obliged to open of receptionevenings when gentlemen and ladies play cards there it is fitted up in the style of louis xvi in her bed is an immense lookingglass surmounted by stucco cupids it is an alcove which some powdered venus before the revolution might have reposed in opposite that lookingglass between the tall windows at some forty feet distance is another huge mirror so that when the poor princess is in bed in her prim old curlpapers she sees a vista of elderly princesses twinkling away into the dark perspective and is so frightened that she and betsy her lancashire maid pin up the jonquil silk curtains over the bedmirror after the first night though the princess never can get it out of her head that her image is still there behind the jonquil hangings turning as she turns waking as she wakes etc the chamber is so vast and lonely that she has a bed made for betsy in the room it is of course whisked away into a closet on receptionevenings a boudoir rosetendre with more cupids and nymphs by boucher sporting over doorpanelsnymphs who may well shock old betsy and her old mistressis the pricesss morningroom ah mum what would mr humper at manchester mr jowls of newcome the minister whom in early days miss higg used to sit under say if they was browt into this room but there is no question of jowls and mr humper excellent dissenting divines who preached to miss higg being brought into the princesse de moncontours boudoir  that paragraph respecting a conversion in high life which f b in his enthusiasm inserted in the pall mall gazette caused no small excitement in the florac family the florac family read the pall mall gazette knowing that clives friends were engaged in that periodical when madame de florac who did not often read newspapers happened to cast her eye upon that poetic paragraph of f bs you may fancy with what a panic it filled the good and pious lady her son become a protestant after all the grief and trouble his wildness had occasioned to her paul forsake his religion but that her husband was so ill and aged as not to be able to bear her absence she would have hastened to london to rescue her son out of that perdition she sent for her younger son who undertook the embassy and the prince and princesse de moncontour in their hotel at london were one day surprised by the visit of the abbe de florac  as paul was quite innocent of any intention of abandoning his religion the mothers kind heart was very speedily set at rest by her envoy far from pauls conversion to protestantism the abbe wrote home the most encouraging accounts of his sisterinlaws precious dispositions he had communications with madame de moncontours anglican director a man of not powerful mind wrote m labbe though of considerable repute for eloquence in his sect the good dispositions of his sisterinlaw were improved by the french clergyman who could be most captivating and agreeable when a work of conversion was in hand the visit reconciled the family to their english relative in whom goodnature and many other good qualities were to be seen now that there were hopes of reclaiming her it was agreed that madame de moncontour should come and inhabit the hotel de florac at paris perhaps the abbe tempted the worthy lady by pictures of the many pleasures and advantages she would enjoy in that capital she was presented at her own court by the french ambassadress of that day and was received at the tuileries with a cordiality which flattered and pleased her  having been presented herself madame la princesse in turn presented to her august sovereign mrs t higg and miss higg of manchester mrs samuel higg of newcome the husbands of those ladies the princesss brothers also sporting a courtdress for the first time sam higgs neighbour the member for newcome sir brian newcome bart was too ill to act as higgs sponsor before majesty but barnes newcome was uncommonly civil to the two lancashire gentlemen though their politics were different to his and sam had voted against sir brian at his last election barnes took them to dine at a clubrecommended his tailorand sent lady clara pulleyn to call on mrs higgwho pronounced her to be a pretty young woman and most haffable the countess of dorking would have been delighted to present these ladies had the princess not luckily been in london to do that office the hobson newcomes were very civil to the lancashire party and entertained them splendidly at dinner i believe mrs and mr hobson themselves went to court this year the latter in a deputylieutenants uniform  if barnes newcome was so very civil to the higg family we may suppose he had good reason the higgs were very strong in newcome and it was advisable to conciliate them they were very rich and their account would not be disagreeable at the bank madame de moncontoursa large easy private accountwould be more pleasant still and hobson brothers having entered largely into the anglocontinental railway whereof mention has been made it was a bright thought of barnes to place the prince of moncontour etc etc on the french direction of the railway and to take the princely prodigal down to newcome with his new title and reconcile him to his wife and the higg family barnes we may say invented the principality rescued the vicomte de florac out of his dirty lodgings in leicester square and sent the prince of moncontour back to his worthy middleaged wife again the disagreeable dissenting days were over a brilliant young curate of doctor bulders who also wore long hair straight waistcoats and no shirtcollars had already reconciled the vicomtesse de florac to the persuasion whereof the ministers are clad in that queer uniform the landlord of their hotel at st jamess got his wine from sherrick and sent his families to lady whittleseas chapel the rev charles honeymans eloquence and amiability were appreciated by his new disciplethus the historian has traced here step by step how all these people became acquainted  sam higg whose name was very good on change in manchester and london joined the direction of the anglocontinental a brother had died lately leaving his money amongst them and his wealth had added considerably to madame de floracs means his sister invested a portion of her capital in the railway in her husbands name the shares were at a premium and gave a good dividend the prince de moncontour took his place with great gravity at the paris board whither barnes made frequent flying visits the sense of capitalism sobered and dignified paul de florac at the age of fiveandforty he was actually giving up being a young man and was not ill pleased at having to enlarge his waistcoats and to show a little grey in his moustache his errors were forgotten he was bien vu by the government he might have had the embassy extraordinary to queen pomare but the health of madame la princesse was delicate he paid his wife visits every morning appeared at her parties and her opera box and was seen constantly with her in public he gave quiet little dinners still at which clive was present sometimes and had a private door and key to his apartments which were separated by all the dreary length of the receptionrooms from the mirrored chamber and jonquil couch where the princess and betsy reposed when some of his london friends visited paris he showed us these rooms and introduced us duly to madame la princesse he was as simple and as much at home in the midst of these splendours as in the dirty little lodgings in leicester square where he painted his own boots and cooked his herring over the tongs as for clive he was the infant of the house madame la princesse could not resist his kind face and paul was as fond of him in his way as pauls mother in hers would he live at the hotel de florac there was an excellent atelier in the pavilion with a chamber for his servant no you will be most at ease in apartments of your own you will have here but the society of women i do not rise till late and my affairs my board call me away for the greater part of the day thou wilt but be ennuyd to play trictrac with my old father my mother waits on him my sister au second is given up entirely to her children who always have the pituite madame la princesse is not amusing for a young man come and go when thou wilt clive my garcon my son thy cover is laid wilt thou take the portraits of all the family hast thou want of money i had at thy age and almost ever since mon ami but now we swim in gold and when there is a louis in my purse there are ten francs for thee to show his mother that he did not think of the reformed religion paul did not miss going to mass with her on sunday sometimes madame paul went too between whom and her motherinlaw there could not be any liking but there was now great civility they saw each other once a day madame paul always paid her visit to the comte de florac and betsy her maid made the old gentleman laugh by her briskness and talk she brought back to her mistress the most wonderful stories which the old man told her about his doings during the emigrationbefore he married madame la comtessewhen he gave lessons in dancing parbleu there was his fiddle still a trophy of those old times he chirped and coughed and sang in his cracked old voice as he talked about them lor bless you mum says betsy he must have been a terrible old man he remembered the times well enough but the stories he sometimes told over twice or thrice in an hour i am afraid he had not repented sufficiently of those wicked old times else why did he laugh and giggle so when he recalled them he would laugh and giggle till he was choked with his old cough and old s jean his man came and beat m le comte on the back and made m le comte take a spoonful of his syrup  between two such women as madame de florac and lady kew of course there could be little liking or sympathy religion love duty the family were the french ladys constant occupationduty and the family perhaps lady kews aim tooonly the notions of duty were different in either person lady kews idea of duty to her relatives being to push them on in the world madame de floracs to soothe to pray to attend them with constant watchfulness to strive to mend them with pious counsel i dont know that one lady was happier than the other madame de floracs eldest son was a kindly prodigal her second had given his whole heart to the church her daughter had centred hers on her own children and was jealous if their grandmother laid a finger on them so leonore de florac was quite alone it seemed as if heaven had turned away all her childrens hearts from her her daily business in life was to nurse a selfish old man into whose service she had been forced in early youth by a paternal decree which she never questioned giving him obedience striving to give him respecteverything but her heart which had gone out of her keeping many a good womans life is no more cheerful a spring of beauty a little warmth and sunshine of love a bitter disappointment followed by pangs and frantic tears then a long monotonous story of submission not here my daughter is to be your happiness says the priest whom heaven loves it afflicts and he points out to her the agonies of suffering saints of her sex assures her of their present beatitudes and glories exhorts her to bear her pains with a faith like theirs and is empowered to promise her a like reward  the other matron is not less alone her husband and son are dead without a tear for eitherto weep was not in lady kews nature her grandson whom she had loved perhaps more than any human being is rebellious and estranged from her her children separated from her save one whose sickness and bodily infirmity the mother resents as disgraces to herself her darling schemes fail somehow she moves from town to town and ball to ball and hall to castle for ever uneasy and always alone she sees people scared at her coming is received by sufferance and fear rather than by welcome likes perhaps the terror which she inspires and to enter over the breach rather than through the hospitable gate she will try and command wherever she goes and trample over dependants and society with a grim consciousness that it dislikes her a rage at its cowardice and an unbending will to domineer to be old proud lonely and not have a friend in the worldthat is her lot in it as the french lady may be said to resemble the bird which the fables say feeds her young with her blood this one if she has a little natural liking for her brood goes hunting hither and thither and robs meat for them and so i suppose to make the simile good we must compare the marquis of farintosh to a lamb for the nonce and miss ethel newcome to a young eaglet is it not a rare provision of nature or fiction of poets who have their own natural history that the strongwinged bird can soar to the sun and gaze at it and then come down from heaven and pounce on a piece of carrion  after she became acquainted with certain circumstances madame de florac was very interested about ethel newcome and strove in her modest way to become intimate with her miss newcome and lady kew attended madame de moncontours wednesday evenings it is as well my dear for the interests of the family that we should be particularly civil to these people lady kew said and accordingly she came to the hotel de florac and was perfectly insolent to madame la princesse every thursday evening towards madame de florac even lady kew could not be rude she was so gentle as to give no excuse for assault lady kew vouchsafed you to pronounce that madame de florac was tres grande dameof the sort which is almost impossible to find nowadays lady kew said who thought she possessed this dignity in her own person when madame de florac blushing asked ethel to come and see her ethels grandmother consented with the utmost willingness she is very devote i have heard and will try and convert you of course you will hold your own about that sort of thing and have the good sense to keep off theology there is no roman catholic parti in england or scotland that is to be thought for a moment you will see they will marry young lord derwenwater to an italian princess but he is only seventeen and his directors never lose sight of him sir bartholomew bawkes will have a fine property when lord campion dies unless lord campion leaves the money to the convent where his daughter isand of the other families who is there i made every inquiry purposelythat is of course one is anxious to know about the catholics as about ones own people and little mr rood who was one of my poor brother steynes lawyers told me there is not one young man of that party at this moment who can be called a desirable person be very civil to madame de florac she sees some of the old legitimists and you know i am brouillee with that party of late years  there is the marquis de montluc who has a large fortune for france said ethel gravely he has a humpback but he is very spiritual monsieur de cadillan paid me some compliments the other night and even asked george barnes what my dot was he is a widower and has a wig and two daughters which do you think would be the greatest encumbrance grandmammaa humpback or a wig and two daughters i like madame de florac for the sake of the borough i must try and like poor madame de moncontour and i will go and see them whenever you please  so ethel went to see madame de florac she was very kind to madame de previlles children madame de floracs grandchildren she was gay and gracious with madame de moncontour she went again and again to the hotel de florac not caring for lady kews own circle of statesmen and diplomatists russian and spanish and french whose talk about the courts of europewho was in favour at st petersburg and who was in disgrace at schoenbrunnnaturally did not amuse the lively young person the goodness of madame de floracs life the tranquil grace and melancholy kindness with which the french lady received her soothed and pleased miss ethel she came and reposed in madame de floracs quiet chamber or sate in the shade in the sober old garden of her hotel away from all the trouble and chatter of the salons the gossip of the embassies the fluttering ceremonial of the parisian ladies visits in their fine toilettes the fadaises of the dancing dandies and the pompous mysteries of the old statesmen who frequented her grandmothers apartment the world began for her at night when she went in the train of the old countess from hotel to hotel and danced waltz after waltz with prussian and neapolitan secretaries with princes officers of ordonnancewith personages even more lofty very likelyfor the court of the citizen king was then in its splendour and there must surely have been a number of nimble young royal highnesses who would like to dance with such a beauty as miss newcome the marquis of farintosh had a share in these polite amusements his english conversation was not brilliant as yet although his french was eccentric but at the court balls whether he appeared in his uniform of the scotch archers or in his native glenlivat tartar there certainly was not in his own or the public estimation a handsomer young nobleman in paris that season it has been said that he was greatly improved in dancing and for a young man of his age his whiskers were really extraordinarily large and curly  miss newcome out of consideration for her grandmothers strange antipathy to him did not inform lady kew that a young gentleman by the name of clive occasionally came to visit the hotel de florac at first with her french education madame de florac never would have thought of allowing the cousins to meet in her house but with the english it was different paul assured her that in the english chateaux les meess walked for entire hours with the young men made parties of the fish mounted to horse with them the whole with the permission of the mothers when i was at newcome miss ethel rode with me several times paul said a preuve that we went to visit an old relation of the family who adores clive and his father when madame de florac questioned her son about the young marquis to whom it was said ethel was engaged florac flouted the idea engaged this young marquis is engaged to the theatre des varietes my mother he laughs at the notion of an engagement when one charged him with it of late at the club and asked how mademoiselle louqsorshe is so tall that they call her the louqsorshe is an odalisque obelisque ma mere when one asked how the louqsor would pardon his pursuit of miss newcome my ecossois permitted himself to say in full club that it was miss newcome pursued himthat nymph that diane that charming and peerless young creature on which as the others laughed and his friend monsieur walleye applauded i dared to say in my turn monsieur le marquis as a young man not familiar with our language you have said what is not true milor and therefore luckily not mischievous i have the honour to count of my friends the parents of the young lady of whom you have spoken you never could have intended to say that a young miss who lives under the guardianship of her parents and is obedient to them whom you meet in society all the nights and at whose door your carriage is to be seen every day is capable of that with which you charge her so gaily these things say themselves monsieur in the coulisses of the theatre of women from whom you learn our language not of young persons pure and chaste monsieur de farintosh learn to respect your compatriots to honour youth and innocence everywhere monsieur and when you forget yourself permit one who might be your father to point where you are wrong  and what did he answer asked the countess  i attended myself to a soufflet replied florac but his reply was much more agreeable the young insulary with many blushes and a gros juron as his polite way is said he had not wished to say a word against that person of whom the name cried i ought never to be spoken in these places herewith our little dispute ended  so occasionally mr clive had the good luck to meet with his cousin at the hotel de florac where i dare say all the inhabitants wished he should have his desire regarding this young lady the colonel had talked early to madame de florac about this wish of his life impossible then to gratify because ethel was engaged to lord kew clive in the fulness of his heart imparted his passion to florac and in answer to pauls offer to himself had shown the frenchman that kind letter in which his father bade him carry aid to leonore de floracs son in case he should need it the case was all clear to the lively paul between my mother and your good colonel there must have been an affair of the heart in the early days during the emigration clive owned his father had told him as much at least that he himself had been attached to mademoiselle de blois it is for that that her heart yearns towards thee that i have felt myself entrained toward thee since i saw theeclive momentarily expected to be kissed again tell thy father that i feelam touched by his goodness with an eternal gratitude and love every one that loves my mother as far as wishes went these two were eager promoters of clives little loveaffair and madame la princesse became equally not less willing clives good looks and goodnature had had their effects upon that goodnatured woman and he was as great a favourite with her as with her husband and thus it happened that when miss ethel came to pay her visit and sate with madame de florac and her grandchildren in the garden mr newcome would sometimes walk up the avenue there and salute the ladies  if ethel had not wanted to see him would she have come yes she used to say she was going to madame de previlles not madame de floracs and would insist i have no doubt that it was madame de preville whom she went to see whose husband was a member of the chamber of deputies a conseiller detat or other french bigwig and that she had no idea of going to meet clive or that he was more than a casual acquaintance at the hotel de florac there was no part of her conduct in all her life which this lady when it was impugned would defend more strongly than this intimacy at the hotel de florac it is not with this i quarrel especially my fair young readers who have seen a halfdozen of seasons can you call to mind the time when you had such a friendship for emma tomkins that you were always at the tomkinss and notes were constantly passing between your house and hers when her brother paget tomkins returned to india did not your intimacy with emma fall off if your younger sister is not in the room i know you will own as much to me i think you are always deceiving yourselves and other people i think the motive you put forward is very often not the real one though you will confess neither to yourself nor to any human being what the real motive is i think that what you desire you pursue and are as selfish in your way as your bearded fellowcreatures are and as for the truth being in you of all the women in a great acquaintance i protest there are butnever mind a perfectly honest woman a woman who never flatters who never manages who never cajoles who never conceals who never uses her eyes who never speculates on the effect which she produces who never is conscious of unspoken admiration what a monster i say would such a female be miss hopkins you have been a coquette since you were a year old you worked on your papas friends in the nurses arms by the fascination of your lace frock and pretty new sash and shoes when you could just toddle you practised your arts upon other children in the square poor little lambkins sporting among the daisies and nunc in ovilia mox in reluctantes dracones proceeding from the lambs to reluctant dragoons you tried your arts upon captain paget tomkins who behaved so ill and went to india withoutwithout making those proposals which of course you never expected your intimacy was with emma it has cooled your sets are different the tomkinss are not quite etc etc you believe captain tomkins married a miss ogrady etc etc ah my pretty my sprightly miss hopkins be gentle in your judgment of your neighbours     chapter xlvii contains two or three acts of a little comedy   all this story is told by one who if he was not actually present at the circumstances here narrated yet had information concerning them and could supply such a narrative of facts and conversations as is indeed not less authentic than the details we have of other histories how can i tell the feelings in a young ladys mind the thoughts in a young gentlemans bosomas professor owen or professor agassiz takes a fragment of a bone and builds an enormous forgotten monster out of it wallowing in primeval quagmires tearing down leaves and branches of plants that flourished thousands of years ago and perhaps may be coal by this timeso the novelist puts this and that together from the footprint finds the foot from the foot the brute who trod on it from the brute the plant he browsed on the marsh in which he swamand thus in his humble way a physiologist too depicts the habits size appearance of the beings whereof he has to treattraces this slimy reptile through the mud and describes his habits filthy and rapacious prods down this butterfly with a pin and depicts his beautiful coat and embroidered waistcoat points out the singular structure of yonder more important animal the megatherium of his history  suppose then in the quaint old garden of the hotel de florac two young people are walking up and down in an avenue of limetrees which are still permitted to grow in that ancient place in the centre of that avenue is a fountain surmounted by a triton so grey and mosseaten that though he holds his conch to his swelling lips curling his tail in the arid basin his instrument has had a sinecure for at least fifty years and did not think fit even to play when the bourbons in whose time he was erected came back from their exile at the end of the limetree avenue is a brokennosed damp faun with a marble panpipe who pipes to the spirit ditties which i believe never had any tune the perron of the hotel is at the other end of the avenue a couple of caesars on either side of the doorwindow from which the inhabitants of the hotel issue into the gardencaracalla frowning over his mouldy shoulder at nerva on to whose clipped hair the roofs of the grey chateau have been dribbling for ever so many long years there are more statues gracing this noble place there is cupid who has been at the point of kissing psyche this halfcentury at least though the delicious event has never come off through all those blazing summers and dreary winters there is venus and her boy under the damp little dome of a cracked old temple through the alley of this old garden in which their ancestors have disported in hoops and powder monsieur de floracs chair is wheeled by st jean his attendant madame de previlles children trot about and skip and play at cachecache the r p de florac when at home paces up and down and meditates his sermons madame de florac sadly walks sometimes to look at her roses and clive and ethel newcome are marching up and down the children and their bonne of course being there jumping to and fro and madame de florac having just been called away to monsieur le comte whose physician has come to see him  ethel says how charming and odd this solitude is and how pleasant to hear the voices of the children playing in the neighbouring convent garden of which they can see the new chapel rising over the trees  clive remarks that the neighbouring hotel has curiously changed its destination one of the members of the directory had it and no doubt in the groves of its garden madame tallien and madame recamier and madame beauharnais have danced under the lamps then a marshal of the empire inhabited it then it was restored to its legitimate owner monsieur le marquis de bricquabracque whose descendants having a lawsuit about the bricquabracque succession sold the hotel to the convent  after some talk about nuns ethel says there were convents in england she often thinks she would like to retire to one and she sighs as if her heart were in that scheme  clive with a laugh says yes if you could retire after the season when you were very weary of the balls a convent would be very nice at rome he had seen san pietro in montorio and sant onofrio that delightful old place where tasso died people go and make a retreat there in the ladies convents the ladies do the same thingand he doubts whether they are much more or less wicked after their retreat than gentlemen and ladies in england or france  ethel why do you sneer at all faith why should not a retreat do people good do you suppose the world is so satisfactory that those who are in it never wish for a while to leave itd she heaves a sigh and looks down towards a beautiful new dress of many flounces which madame de flouncival the great milliner has sent her home that very day  clive i do not know what the world is except from afar off i am like the peri who looks into paradise and sees angels within it i live in charlotte street fitzroy square which is not within the gates of paradise i take the gate to be somewhere in davies street leading out of oxford street into grosvenor square theres another gate in hay hill and another in bruton street bond  ethel dont be a goose  clive why not it is as good to be a goose as to be a ladyno a gentleman of fashion suppose i were a viscount an earl a marquis a duke would you say goose no you would say swan  ethel unkind and unjustungenerous to make taunts which common people make and to repeat to me those silly sarcasms which your low radical literary friends are always putting in their books have i ever made any difference to you would i not sooner see you

was that you should come herethat we should both come here today how surprised i was to see you at the ministers grandmamma was so angry that boy pursues us wherever we go she said i am sure i dont know why we shouldnt meet clive it seems to be wrong even my seeing you by chance here do you know sir what a scolding i had aboutabout going to brighton with you my grandmother did not hear of it till we were in scotland when that foolish maid of mine talked of it to her maid and there was oh such a tempest if there were a bastile here she would like to lock you into it she says that you are always upon our wayi dont know how i am sure she says but for you i should have beenyou know what i should have been but i am thankful that i wasnt and kew has got a much nicer wife in henrietta pulleyn than i could ever have been to him she will be happier than clara clive kew is one of the kindest creatures in the worldnot very wise not very strong but he is just such a kind easy generous little man as will make a girl like henrietta quite happy  clive but not you ethel  ethel no nor i him my temper is difficult clive and i fear few men would bear with me i feel somehow always very lonely how old am i twentyi feel sometimes as if i was a hundred and in the midst of all these admirations and fetes and flatteries so tired oh so tired and yet if i dont have them i miss them how i wish i was religious like madame de florac there is no day that she does not go to church she is for ever busy with charities clergymen conversions i think the princess will be brought over ere longthat dear old madame de florac and yet she is no happier than the rest of us hortense is an empty little thing who thinks of her prosy fat camille with spectacles and of her two children and of nothing else in the world besides who is happy clive  clive you say barness wife is not  ethel we are like brother and sister so i may talk to you barnes is very cruel to her at newcome last winter poor clara used to come into my room with tears in her eyes morning after morning he calls her a fool and seems to take a pride in humiliating her before company my poor father has luckily taken a great liking to her and before him for he has grown very very hottempered since his illness barnes leaves poor clara alone we were in hopes that the baby might make matters better but as it is a little girl barnes chooses to be very much disappointed he wants papa to give up his seat in parliament but he clings to that more than anything oh dear me who is happy in the world what a pity lord highgates father had not died sooner he and barnes have been reconciled i wonder my brothers spirit did not revolt against it the old lord used to keep a great sum of money at the bank i believe and the present one does so still he has paid all his debts off and barnes is actually friends with him he is always abusing the dorkings who want to borrow money from the bank he says this eagerness for money is horrible if i had been barnes i would never have been reconciled with mr belsize never never and yet they say he was quite right and grandmamma is even pleased that lord highgate should be asked to dine in park lane poor papa is there come to attend his parliamentary duties as he thinks he went to a division the other night and was actually lifted out of his carriage and wheeled into the lobby in a chair the ministers thanked him for coming i believe he thinks he will have his peerage yet oh what a life of vanity ours is  enter madame de moncontour what are you young folks atalkin aboutballs and operas when first i was took to the opera i did not like itand fell asleep but now oh its eavenly to hear grisi sing  the clock ting ting  ethel two oclock already i must run back to

                              exit ethel as far as we can judge from the above conversation which we need not prolongas the talk between madame de moncontour and monsieur clive after a few complimentary remarks about ethel had nothing to do with the history of the newcomesas far as we can judge the above little colloquy took place on monday and about wednesday madame la comtesse de florac received a little note from clive in which he said that one day when she came to the louvre where he was copying she had admired a picture of a virgin and child by sasso ferrato since when he had been occupied in making a watercolour drawing after the picture and hoped she would be pleased to accept the copy from her affectionate and grateful servant clive newcome the drawing would be done the next day when he would call with it in his hand of course madame de florac received this announcement very kindly and sent back by clives servant a note of thanks to that young gentleman  now on thursday morning about one oclock by one of those singular coincidences which etc etc who should come to the hotel de florac but miss ethel newcome madame la comtesse was at home waiting to receive clive and his picture but miss ethels appearance frightened the good lady so much so that she felt quite guilty at seeing the girl whose parents might thinki dont know what they might not thinkthat madame de florac was trying to make a match between the young people hence arose the words uttered by the countess after a while in   conversation iii madame de florac at work and so you like to quit the world and to come to our triste old hotel after today you will find it still more melancholy my poor child  ethel and why  madame de f some one who has been here to egager our little meetings will come no more  ethel is the abbe de florac going to quit paris madam  madame de f it is not of him that i speak thou knowest it very well my daughter thou hast seen my poor clive twice here he will come once again and then no more my conscience reproaches me that i have admitted him at all but he is like a son to me and was so confided to me by his father five years ago when we met after an absenceof how many yearscolonel newcome told me what hopes he had cherished for his boy you know well my daughter with whom those hopes were connected then he wrote me that family arrangements rendered his plans impossiblethat the hand of miss newcome was promised elsewhere when i heard from my son paul how these negotiations were broken my heart rejoiced ethel for my friends sake i am an old woman now who have seen the world and all sorts of men men more brilliant no doubt i have known but such a heart as his such a faith as his such a generosity and simplicity as thomas newcomesnever  ethel smiling indeed dear lady i think with you  madame de f i understand thy smile my daughter i can say to thee that when we were children almost i knew thy good uncle my poor father took the pride of his family into exile with him our poverty only made his pride the greater even before the emigration a contract had been passed between our family and the count de florac i could not be wanting to the word given by my father for how many long years have i kept it but when i see a young girl who may be made the victimthe subject of a marriage of convenience as i wasmy heart pities her and if i love her as i love you i tell her my thoughts better poverty ethel better a cell in a convent than a union without love is it written eternally that men are to make slaves of us here in france above all our fathers sell us every day and what a society ours is thou wilt know this when thou art married there are some laws so cruel that nature revolts against theme and breaks themor we die in keeping them you smile i have been nearly fifty years dyingnestce pasand am here an old woman complaining to a young girl it is because our recollections of youth are always young and because i have suffered so that i would spare those i love a like grief do you know that the children of those who do not love in marriage seem to bear an hereditary coldness and do not love their parents as other children do they witness our differences and our indifferences hear our recriminations take one side or the other in our disputes and are partisans for father or mother we force ourselves to be hypocrites and hide our wrongs from them we speak of a bad father with false praises we wear feint smiles over our tears and deceive our childrendeceive them do we even from the exercise of that pious deceit there is no woman but suffers in the estimation of her sons they may shield her as champions against their fathers selfishness or cruelty in this case what a war what a home where the son sees a tyrant in the father and in the mother but a trembling victim i speak not for myselfwhatever may have been the course of our long wedded life i have not to complain of these ignoble storms but when the family chief neglects his wife or prefers another to her the children too courtiers as we are will desert her you look incredulous about domestic love tenez my child if i may so surmise i think you cannot have seen it  ethel blushing and thinking perhaps how she esteems her father how her mother and how much they esteem each other my father and mother have been most kind to all their children madame and no one can say that their marriage has been otherwise than happy my mother is the kindest and most affectionate mother andhere a vision of sir brian alone in his room and nobody really caring for him so much as his valet who loves him to the extent of fifty pounds a year and perquisites or perhaps miss cann who reads to him and plays a good deal of evenings much to sir brians likinghere this vision we say comes and stops miss ethels sentence  madame de f your father in his infirmityand yet he is five years younger than colonel newcomeis happy to have such a wife and such children they comfort his age they cheer his sickness they confide their griefs and pleasures to himis it not so his closing days are soothed by their affection  ethel oh no no and yet it is not his fault or ours that he is a stranger to us he used to be all day at the bank or at night in the house of commons or he and mamma went to parties and we young ones remained with the governess mamma is very kind i have never almost known her angry never with us about us sometimes with the servants as children we used to see papa and mamma at breakfast and then when she was dressing to go out since he has been ill she has given up all parties i wanted to do so too i feel ashamed in the world sometimes when i think of my poor father at home alone i wanted to stay but my mother and my grandmother forbade me grandmamma has a fortune which she says i am to have since then they have insisted on my being with her she is very clever you know she is kind too in her way but she cannot live out of society and i who pretend to revolt i like it too and i who rail and scorn flatterersoh i like admiration i am pleased when the women hate me and the young men leave them for me though i despise many of these yet i cant help drawing them towards me one or two of them i have seen unhappy about me and i like it and if they are indifferent i am angry and never tire till they come back i love beautiful dresses i love jewels i love a great name and a fine houseoh i despise myself when i think of these things when i lie in bed and say i have been heartless and a coquette i cry with humiliation and then rebel and say why notand tonightyes tonightafter leaving you i shall be wicked i know i shall  madame de f sadly one will pray for thee my child  ethel sadly i thought i might be good once i used to say my own prayers then now i speak them but by rote and feel ashamedyes ashamed to speak them is it not horrid to say them and next morning to be no better than you were last night often i revolt at these as at other things and am dumb the vicar comes to see us at newcome and eats so much dinner and pays us such court and sir brians papa and your ladyships mamma with grandmamma i go to hear a fashionable preacherclives uncle whose sister lets lodgings at brighton such a queer bustling pompous honest old lady do you know that clives aunt lets lodgings at brighton  madame de f my father was an usher in a school monsieur de florac gave lessons in the emigration do you know in what  ethel oh the old nobility that is different you know that mr honeyman is so affected that i have no patience with him  madame de f with a sigh i wish you could attend the services of a better church and when was it you thought you might be good ethel  ethel when i was a girl before i came out when i used to take long rides with my dear uncle newcome and he used to talk to me in his sweet simple way and he said i reminded him of some one he once knew  madame de f whowho was that ethel  ethel looking up at gerards picture of the countess de florac what odd dresses you wore in the time of the empire madame de florac how could you ever have such high waists and such wonderful fraises madame de florac kisses ethel tableau  enter saint jean preceding a gentleman with a drawingboard under his arm  saint jean monsieur claive exit saint jean  clive how do you do madame la comtesse mademoiselle jai lhonneur de vous souhaiter le bon jour  madame de f do you come from the louvre have you finished that beautiful copy mon ami  clive i have brought it for you it is not very good there are always so many petites demoiselles copying that sasso ferrato and they chatter about it so and hop from one easel to another and the young artists are always coming to give them adviceso that there is no getting a good look at the picture but i have brought you the sketch and am so pleased that you asked for it  madame de f surveying the sketch it is charmingcharming what shall we give to our painter for his chefdoeuvre  clive kisses her hand there is my pay and you will be glad to hear that two of my portraits have been received at the exhibition my uncle the clergyman and mr butts of the life guards  ethel mr buttsquel nom je ne connois aucun m butts  clive he has a famous head to draw they refused crackthorpe andand one or two other heads i sent in  ethel tossing up hers miss mackenzies i suppose  clive yes miss mackenzies it is a sweet little face too delicate for my hand though  ethel so is a waxdolls a pretty face pink cheeks chinablue eyes and hair the colour of old madame hempenfeldsnot her last hairher last but one she goes to a window that looks into the court  clive to the countess miss mackenzie speaks more respectfully of other peoples eyes and hair she thinks there is nobody in the world to compare to miss newcome  madame de f aside and you mon ami this is the last time entendezvous you must never come here again if m le comte knew it he never would pardon me encore he kisses her ladyships hand again  clive a good action gains to be repeated miss newcome does the view of the courtyard please you the old trees and the garden are better that dear old faun without a nose i must have a sketch of him the creepers round the base are beautiful  miss n i was looking to see if the carriage had come for me it is time that i return home  clive that is my brougham may i carry you anywhere i hire him by the hour and i will carry you to the end of the world  miss n where are you going madame de florasto show that sketch to m le comte dear me i dont fancy that m de florac can care for such things i am sure i have seen many as pretty on the quays for twentyfive sous i wonder the carriage is not come for me  clive you can take mine without my company as that seems not to please you  miss n your company is sometimes very pleasantwhen you please sometimes as last night for instance when you particularly lively  clive last night after moving heaven and earth to get an invitation to madame de briei say heaven and earth that is a french phrasei arrive there i find miss newcome engaged for almost every dance waltzing with m de klingenspohr galloping with count de capri galloping and waltzing with the most noble the marquis of farintosh she will scarce speak to me during the evening and when i wait till midnight her grandmamma whisks her home and i am left alone for my pains lady kew is in one of her high moods and the only words she condescends to say to me are oh i thought you had returned to london with which she turns her venerable back upon me  miss n a fortnight ago you said you were going to london you said the copies you were about here would not take you another week and that was three weeks since  clive it were best i had gone  miss n if you think so i cannot but think so  clive why do i stay and hover about you and follow you knowi follow you can i live on a smile vouchsafed twice a week and no brighter than you give to all the world what i do i get but to hear your beauty praised and to see you night after night happy and smiling and triumphant the partner of other men does it add zest to your triumph to think that i behold it i believe you would like a crowd of us to pursue you  miss n to pursue me and if they find me alone by chance to compliment me with such speeches as you make that would be pleasure indeed answer me here in return clive have i ever disguised from any of my friends the regard i have for you why should i have not i taken your part when you were maligned in former days whenwhen lord kew asked me as he had a right to do theni said it was as a brother i held you and always would if i have been wrong it has been for two or three times in seeing you at allor seeing you thus in letting you speak to me as you doinjure me as you do do you think i have not hard enough words said to me about you but that you must attack me too in turn last night only because you were at the ballit was very very wrong of me to tell you i was going thereas we went home lady kewgo sir i never thought you would have seen in me this humiliation  clive is it possible that i should have made ethel newcome shed tears oh dry them dry them forgive me ethel forgive me i have no right to jealousy or to reproach youi know that if others admire you surely i ought to know that theythey do but as i do i should be proud not angry that they admire my ethelmy sister if you can be no more  ethel i will be that always whatever harsh things you think or say of me there sir i am not going to be so foolish as to cry again have you been studying very hard are your pictures good at the exhibition i like you with your mustachios best and order you not to cut them off again the young men here wear them i hardly knew charles beardmore when he arrived from berlin the other day like a sapper and miner his little sisters cried out and were quite frightened by his apparition why are you not in diplomacy that day at brighton when lord farintosh asked whether you were in the army i thought to myself why is he not  clive a man in the army may pretend to anything nestce pas he wears a lovely uniform he may be a general a kcb a viscount an earl he may be valiant in arms and wanting a leg like the lover in the song it is peacetime you say so much the worse career for a soldier my father would not have me he said for ever dangling in barracks or smoking in country billiardrooms i have no taste for law and as for diplomacy i have no relations in the cabinet and no uncles in the house of peers could my uncle who is in parliament help me much do you think or would he if he couldor barnes his noble son and heir after him  ethel musing barnes would not perhaps but papa might even still and you have friends who are fond of you  clive nono one can help me and my art ethel is not only my choice and my love but my honour too i shall never distinguish myself in it i may take smart likenesses but that is all i am not fit to grind my friend ridleys colours for him nor would my father who loves his own profession so make a good general probably he always says so i thought better of myself when i began as a boy and was a conceited youngster expecting to carry it all before me but as i walked the vatican and looked at raphael and at the great michaeli knew i was but a poor little creature and in contemplating his genius shrunk up till i felt myself as small as a man looks under the dome of st peters why should i wish to have a great geniusyes there is one reason why i should like to have it  ethel and that is  clive to give it you if it pleased you ethel but i might wish for the rocs egg there is no way of robbing the bird i must take a humble place and you want a brilliant one a brilliant one oh ethel what a standard we folks measure fame by to have your name in the morning post and to go to three balls every night to have your dress described at the drawingroom and your arrival from a round of visits in the country at your townhouse and the entertainment of the marchioness of farin  ethel sir if you please no calling names  clive i wonder at it for you are in the world and you love the world whatever you may say and i wonder that one of your strength of mind should so care for it i think my simple old father is much finer than all your grandees his singlemindedness more lofty than all their bowing and haughtiness and scheeming what are you thinking of as you stand in that pretty attitudelike mnemosynewith your finger on your chin  ethel mnemosyne who was she i think i like you best when you are quiet and gentle and not when you are flaming out and sarcastic sir and so you think you will never be a famous painter they are quite in society here i was so pleased because two of them dined at the tuileries when grandmamma was there and she mistook one who was covered all over with crosses for an ambassador i believe till the queen call him monsieur delaroche she says there is no knowing people in this country and do you think you will never be able to paint as well as m delaroche  clive nonever  ethel andandyou will never give up painting  clive nonever that would be like leaving your friend who was poor or deserting your mistress because you were disappointed about her money they do those things in the great world ethel  ethel with a sigh yes  clive if it is so false and base and hollow this great worldif its aims are so mean its successes so paltry the sacrifices it asks of you so degrading the pleasures it gives you so wearisome shameful even why does ethel newcome cling to it will you be fairer dear with any other name than your own will you be happier after a month at bearing a great title with a man whom you cant esteem tied for ever to you to be the father of ethels children and the lord and master of her life and actions the proudest woman in the world consents to bend herself to this ignominy and own that a coronet is a bribe sufficient for her honour what is the end of a christian life ethel a girls pure nurtureit cant be this last week as we walked in the garden here and heard the nuns singing in their chapel you said how hard it was that poor women should be imprisoned so and were thankful that in england we had abolished that slavery then you cast your eyes to the ground and mused as you paced the walk and thought i know that perhaps their lot was better than some others  ethel yes i did i was thinking that almost all women are made slaves one way or other and that these poor nuns perhaps were better off than we are  clive i never will quarrel with nun or matron for following her vocation but for our women who are free why should they rebel against nature shut their hearts up sell their lives for rank and money and forgo the most precious right of their liberty look ethel dear i love you so that if i thought another had your heart an honest man a loyal gentleman likelike him of last year even i think i could go back with a god bless you and take to my pictures again and work on in my own humble way you seem like a queen to me somehow and i am but a poor humble fellow who might be happy i think if you were in those balls where i have seen you surrounded by those brilliant young men noble and wealthy admirers like me i have often thought how could i aspire to such a creature and ask her to forgo a palace to share the crust of a poor painter  ethel you spoke quite scornfully of palaces just now clive i wont say a word about thethe regard which you express for me i think you have it indeed i do but it were best not said clive best for me perhaps not to own that i know it in your speeches my poor boyand you will please not to make any more or i never can see you or speak to you again neveryou forgot one part of a girls duty obedience to her parents they would never agree to my marrying any one belowany one whose union would not be advantageous in a worldly point of view i never would give such pain to the poor father or to the kind soul who never said a harsh word to me since i was born my grandmamma is kind too in her way i came to her of my own free will when she said she would leave me her fortune do you think it was for myself alone that i was glad my fathers passion was to make an estate and all my brothers and sisters will be but slenderly portioned lady kew said she would help them if i came to herandit is the welfare of those little people that depends upon me clive now do you see brother why you must speak to me so no more there is the carriage god bless you dear clive  clive sees the carriage drive away after miss newcome has entered it without once looking up to the window where he stands when it is gone he goes to the opposite windows of the salon which are open towards the garden the chapel music begins to play from the convent next door as he hears it he sinks down his head in his hands  enter madame de florac she goes to him with anxious looks what hast thou my child hast thou spoken  clive very steadily yes  madame de f and she loves thee i know she loves thee  clive you hear the organ of the convent  madame de f quas tu  clive i might as well hope to marry one of the sisters of yonder convent dear lady he sinks down again and she kisses him  clive i never had a mother but you seem like one  madame de f mon fils oh mon fils     chapter xlviii in which benedick is a married man   we have all heard of the dying french duchess who viewed her coming dissolution and subsequent fate so easily because she said she was sure that heaven must deal politely with a person of her qualityi suppose lady kew had some such notions regarding people of rank her longsuffering towards them was extreme in fact there were vices which the old lady thought pardonable and even natural in a young nobleman of high station which she never would have excused in persons of vulgar condition  her ladyships little knot of associates and scandalbearerselderly roues and ladies of the world whose business it was to know all sorts of noble intrigues and exalted tittletattle what was happening among the devotees of the exiled court at frobsdorf what among the citizen princes of the tuileries who was the reigning favourite of the queen mother at aranjuez who was smitten with whom at vienna or naples and the last particulars of the chroniques scandaleuses of paris and londonlady kew i say must have been perfectly aware of my lord farintoshs amusements associates and manner of life and yet she never for one moment exhibited any anger or dislike towards that nobleman her amiable heart was so full of kindness and forgiveness towards the young prodigal that even without any repentance on his part she was ready to take him to her old arms and give him her venerable benediction pathetic sweetness of nature charming tenderness of disposition with all his faults and wickednesses his follies and his selfishness there was no moment when lady kew would not have received the young lord and endowed him with the hand of her darling ethel  but the hopes which this fond forgiving creature had nurtured for one season and carried on so resolutely to the next were destined to be disappointed yet a second time by a most provoking event which occurred in the newcome family ethel was called away suddenly from paris by her fathers third and last paralytic seizure when she reached her home sir brian could not recognise her a few hours after her arrival all the vanities of the world were over for him and sir barnes newcome baronet reigned in his stead the day after sir brian was laid in his vault at newcomea letter appeared in the local papers addressed to the independent electors of that borough in which his orphan son feelingly alluding to the virtue the services and the political principles of the deceased offered himself as a candidate for the seat in parliament now vacant sir barnes announced that he should speedily pay his respects in person to the friends and supporters of his lamented father that he was a staunch friend of our admirable constitution need not be said that he was a firm but conscientious upholder of our protestant religion all who knew barnes newcome must be aware that he would do his utmost to advance the interests of this great agricultural this great manufacturing county and borough we may be sure he avowed as that he would be if returned to represent newcome in parliament the advocate of every rational reform the unhesitating opponent of every reckless innovation in fine barnes newcomes manifesto to the electors of newcome was as authentic a document and gave him credit for as many public virtues as that slab over poor sir brians bones in the chancel of newcome church which commemorated the good qualities of the defunct and the grief of his heir  in spite of the virtues personal and inherited of barnes his seat for newcome was not got without a contest the dissenting interest and the respectable liberals of the borough wished to set up samuel higg esq against sir barnes newcome and now it was that barness civilities of the previous year aided by madame de moncontours influence over her brother bore their fruit mr higg declined to stand against sir barnes newcome although higgs political principles were by no means those of the honourable baronet and the candidate from london whom the newcome extreme radicals set up against barnes was nowhere on the poll when the day of election came so barnes had the desire of his heart and within two months after his fathers demise he sate in parliament as member for newcome  the bulk of the late baronets property descended of course to his eldest son who grumbled nevertheless at the provision made for his brothers and sisters and that the townhouse should have been left to lady anne who was too poor to inhabit it but park lane is the best situation in london and lady annes means were greatly improved by the annual produce of the house in park lane which as we all know was occupied by a foreign minister for several subsequent seasons strange mutations of fortune old places new faces what londoner does not see and speculate upon them every day coelias boudoir who is dead with the daisies over her at kensal green is now the chamber where delia is consulting dr locock or julias children are romping florios diningtables have now pollios wine upon them calista being a widow and to the surprise of everybody who knew trimalchio and enjoyed his famous dinners left but very poorly off lets the house and the rich chaste and appropriate planned furniture by dowbiggin and the proceeds go to keep her little boys at eton the next year as mr clive newcome rode by the once familiar mansion whence the hatchment had been removed announcing that there was in coelo quies for the late sir brian newcome bart alien faces looked from over the flowers in the balconies he got a card for an entertainment from the occupant of the mansion he the bulgarian minister and there was the same crowd in the receptionroom and on the stairs the same grave men from gunters distributing the refreshments in the diningroom the same old smee r a always in the room where the edibles were cringing and flattering to the new occupants and the same effigy of poor sir brian in his deputylieutenants uniform looking blankly down from over the sideboard at the feast which his successors were giving a dreamy old ghost of a picture have you ever looked at those round george ivs banquetinghall at windsor their frames still hold them but they smile ghostly smiles and swagger in robes and velvets which are quite faint and faded their crimson coats have a twilight tinge the lustre of their stars has twinkled out they look as if they were about to flicker off the wall and retire to join their originals in limbo                                       nearly three years had elapsed since the good colonels departure for india and during this time certain changes had occurred in the lives of the principal actors and the writer of this history as regards the latter it must be stated that the dear old firm of lamb court had been dissolved the junior member having contracted another partnership the chronicler of these memoirs was a bachelor no longer my wife and i had spent the winter at rome favourite resort of young married couples and had heard from the artists there clives name affectionately repeated and many accounts of his sayings and doings his merry supperparties and the talents of young ridley his friend when we came to london in the spring almost our first visit was to clives apartments in charlotte street whither my wife delightedly went to give her hand to the young painter  but clive no longer inhabited that quiet region on driving to the house we found a bright brass plate with the name of mr j j ridley on the door and it was j js hand which i shook his other being engaged with a great palette and a sheaf of paintingbrushes when we entered the wellknown quarters clives picture hung over the mantelpiece where his fathers head used to hang in our timea careful and beautifully executed portrait of the lad in a velvet coat and a roman hat with that golden beard which was sacrificed to the exigencies of london fashion i showed laura the likeness until she could become acquainted with the original on her expressing her delight at the picture the painter was pleased to say in his modest blushing way that he would be glad to execute my wifes portrait too nor as i think could any artist find a subject more pleasing  after admiring others of mr ridleys works our talk naturally reverted to his predecessor clive had migrated to much more splendid quarters had we not heard he had become a rich man a man of fashion i fear he is very lazy about the arts said j j with regret on his countenance though i begged and prayed him to be faithful to his profession he would have done very well in it in portraitpainting especially look here and here and here said ridley producing fine vigorous sketches of clives he had the art of seizing the likeness and of making all his people look like gentlemen too he was improving every day when this abominable bank came in the way and stopped him  what bank i did not know the new indian bank of which the colonel was a director then of course i was aware that the mercantile affair in question was the bundelcund bank about which the colonel had written to me from india more than a year since announcing that fortunes were to be made by it and that he had reserved shares for me in the company laura admired all clives sketches which his affectionate brotherartist showed to her with the exception of one representing the readers humble servant which mrs pendennis considered by no means did justice to the original  bidding adieu to the kind j j and leaving him to pursue his art in that silent serious way in which he daily laboured at it we drove to fitzroy square hard by where i was not displeased to show the good old hospitable james binnie the young lady who bore my name but here too we were disappointed placards wafered in the windows announced that the old house was to let the woman who kept it brought a card in mrs mackenzies frank handwriting announcing mr james binnies address was posterestante pau in the pyrenees and that his london agents were messrs soandso the woman said she believed the gentleman had been unwell the house too looked very pale dismal and disordered we drove away from the door grieving to think that illhealth or any other misfortunes had befallen good old james  mrs pendennis drove back to our lodgings brixhams in jermyn street while i sped to the city having business in that quarter it has been said that i kept a small account with hobson brothers to whose bank i went and entered the parlour with that trepidation which most poor men feel on presenting themselves before city magnates and capitalists mr hobson newcome shook hands most jovially and goodnaturedly congratulated me on my marriage and so forth and presently sir barnes newcome made his appearance still wearing his mourning for his deceased father  nothing could be more kind pleasant and cordial than sir barness manner he seemed to know well about my affairs complimented me on every kind of good fortune had heard that i had canvassed the borough in which i lived hoped sincerely to see me in parliament and on the right side was most anxious to become acquainted with mrs pendennis of whom lady rockminster said all sorts of kind things and asked for our address in order that lady clara newcome might have the pleasure of calling on my wife this ceremony was performed soon afterwards and an invitation to dinner from sir barnes and lady clara newcome speedily followed it  sir barnes newcome bart mp i need not say no longer inhabited the small house which he had occupied immediately after his marriage but dwelt in a much more spacious mansion in belgravia where he entertained his friends now that he had come into his kingdom i must say that barnes was by no means so insufferable as in the days of his bachelorhood he had sown his wild oats and spoke with regret and reserve of that season of his moral culture he was grave sarcastic statesmanlike did not try to conceal his baldness as he used before his fathers death by bringing lean wisps of hair over his forehead from the back of his head talked a great deal about the house was assiduous in his attendance there and in the city and conciliating with all the world it seemed as if we were all his constituents and though his efforts to make himself agreeable were rather apparent the effect succeeded pretty well we met mr and mrs hobson newcome and clive and miss ethel looking beautiful in her black robes it was a family party sir barnes said giving us to understand with a decorous solemnity in face and voice that no large parties as yet could be received in that house of mourning  to this party was added rather to my surprise my lord highgate who under the sobriquet of jack belsize has been presented to the reader of this history lord highgate gave lady clara his arm to dinner but went and took a place next miss newcome on the other side of her that immediately by lady clara being reserved for a guest who had not as yet made his appearance  lord highgates attentions to his neighbour his laughing and talking were incessant so much so that clive from his end of the table scowled in wrath at jack belsizes assiduities it was evident that the youth though hopeless was still jealous and in love with his charming cousin  barnes newcome was most kind to all his guests from aunt hobson to your humble servant there was not one but the of master the house had an agreeable word for him even for his cousin samuel newcome a gawky youth with an eruptive countenance barnes had appropriate words of conversation and talked about kings college of which the lad was an ornament with the utmost affability he complimented that institution and young samuel and by that shot knocked not only over sam but his mamma too he talked to uncle hobson about his crops to clive about his pictures to me about the great effect which a certain article in the pall mall gazette had produced in the house where the chancellor of the exchequer was perfectly livid with fury and lord john bursting out laughing at the attack in fact nothing could be more amiable than our host on this day lady clara was very prettygrown a little stouter since her marriage the change only became her she was a little silent but then she had uncle hobson on her lefthand side between whom and her ladyship there could not be much in common and the place at the right hand was still vacant the person with whom she talked most freely was clive who had made a beautiful drawing of her and her little girl for which the mother and the father too as it appeared were very grateful  what had caused this change in barness behaviour our particular merits or his own private reform in the two years over which this narrative has had to run in the course of as many chapters the writer had inherited a property so small that it could not occasion a bankers civility and i put down sir barnes newcomes politeness to a sheer desire to be well with me but with lord highgate and clive the case was different as you must now hear  lord highgate having succeeded to his fathers title and fortune had paid every shilling of his debts and had sowed his wild oats to the very last corn his lordships account at hobson brothers was very large painful events of three years date let us hope were forgottengentlemen cannot go on being in love and despairing and quarrelling for ever when he came into his funds highgate behaved with uncommon kindness to rooster who was always straitened for money and when the late lord dorking died and rooster succeeded to him there was a meeting at chanticlere between highgate and barnes newcome and his wife which went off very comfortably at chanticlere the dowager lady kew and miss newcome were also staying when lord highgate announced his prodigious admiration for the young lady and it was said corrected farintosh as a lowminded foultongued young cub for daring to speak disrespectfully of her nevertheless vous concevez when a man of the marquiss rank was supposed to look with the eyes of admiration upon a young lady lord highgate would not think of spoiling sport and he left chanticlere declaring that he was always destined to be unlucky in love when old lady kew was obliged to go to vichy for her lumbago highgate said to barnes do ask your charming sister to come to you in london she will bore herself to death with the old woman at vichy or with her mother at rugby whither lady anne had gone to get her boys educated and accordingly miss newcome came on a visit to her brother and sister at whose house we have just had the honour of seeing her  when rooster took his seat in the house of lords he was introduced by highgate and kew as highgate had been introduced by kew previously thus these three gentlemen all rode in gold coaches had all got coronets on their heads as you will my respected young friend if you are the eldest son of a peer who dies before you and now they were rich they were all going to be very good boys let us hope kew we know married one of the dorking family that second lady henrietta pulleyn whom we described as frisking about at baden and not in the least afraid of him how little the reader knew to whom we introduced the girl in that chatty offhand way that one day the young creature would be a countess but we knew it all the whileand when she was walking about with the governess or romping with her sisters and when she had dinner at one oclock and when she wore a pinafore very likelywe secretly respected her as the future countess of kew and mother of the viscount walham  lord kew was very happy with his bride and very good to her he took lady kew to paris for a marriage trip but they lived almost altogether at kewbury afterwards where his lordship sowed tame oats now after his wild ones and became one of the most active farmers of his county he and the newcomes were not very intimate friends for lord kew was heard to say that he disliked barnes more after his marriage than before and the two sisters lady clara and lady kew had a quarrel on one occasion when the latter visited london just before the dinner at which we have just assistednay at which we are just assisting took placea quarrel about highgates attentions to ethel very likely kew was dragged into it and hot words passed between him and jack belsize and jack did not go down to kewbury afterwards though kews little boy was christened after him all these interesting details about people of the very highest rank we are supposed to whisper in the readers ear as we are sitting at a belgravian dinnertable my dear barmecide friend isnt it pleasant to be in such fine company  and now we must tell how it is that clive newcome esq whose eyes are flashing fire across the flowers of the table at lord highgate who is making himself so agreeable to miss ethelnow we must tell how it is that clive and his cousin barnes have grown to be friends again  the bundelcund bank which had been established for four years had now grown to be one of the most flourishing commercial institutions in bengal founded as the prospectus announced at a time when all private credit was shaken by the failure of the great agency houses of which the downfall had carried dismay and ruin throughout the presidency the b b had been established on the only sound principle of commercial prosperitythat is association the native capitalists headed by the great firm of rummun loll and co of calcutta had largely embarked in the b b and the officers of the two services and the european mercantile body of calcutta had been invited to take shares in an institution which to merchants native and english civilian and military men was alike advantageous and indispensable how many young men of the latter services had been crippled for life by the ruinous cost of agencies of which the profits to the agents themselves were so enormous the shareholders of the b b were their own agents and the greatest capitalist in india as well as the youngest ensign in the service might invest at the largest and safest premium and borrow at the smallest interest by becoming according to his means a shareholder in the b b their correspondents were established in each presidency and in every chief city of india as well as at sydney singapore canton and of course london with china they did an immense opiumtrade of which the profits were so great that it was only in private sittings of the b b managing committee that the details and accounts of these operations could be brought forward otherwise the books of the bank were open to every shareholder and the ensign or the young civil servant was at liberty at any time to inspect his own private account as well as the common ledger with new south wales they carried on a vast trade in wool supplying that great colony with goods which their london agents enabled them to purchase in such a way as to give them the command of the market as if to add to their prosperity coppermines were discovered on lands in the occupation of the b banking company which gave the most astonishing returns and throughout the vast territories of british india through the great native firm of rummun loll and co the bundelcund banking company had possession of the native markets the order from birmingham for idols alone made with their copper and paid in their wool was enough to make the low church party in england cry out and a debate upon this subject actually took place in the house of commons of which the effect was to send up the shares of the bundelcund banking company very considerably upon the london exchange  the fifth halfyearly dividend was announced at twelve and a quarter per cent of the paidup capital the accounts from the coppermine sent the dividend up to a still greater height and carried the shares to an extraordinary premium in the third year of the concern the house of hobson brothers of london became the agents of the bundelcund banking company of india and amongst our friends james binnie who had prudently held out for some time and clive newcome esq became shareholders clives good father having paid the first instalments of the lads shares up in calcutta and invested every rupee he could himself command in this enterprise when hobson brothers joined it no wonder james binnie was convinced clives friend the frenchman and through that connexion the house of higg of newcome and manchester entered into the affair and amongst the minor contributors in england we may mention miss cann who took a little fiftypoundnote share and dear old miss honeyman and j j and his father ridley who brought a small bag of savingall knowing that their colonel who was eager that his friends should participate in his good fortune would never lead them wrong to clives surprise mrs mackenzie between whom and himself there was a considerable coolness came to his chambers and with a solemn injunction that the matter between them should be quite private requested him to purchase 1500 pounds worth of bundelcund shares for her and her darling girls which he did astonished to find the thrifty widow in possession of so much money had mr pendenniss mind not been bent at this moment on quite other subjects he might have increased his own fortune by the bundelcund bank speculation but in these two years i was engaged in matrimonial affairs having clive newcome esq as my groomsman on a certain interesting occasion when we returned from our tour abroad the india bank shares were so very high that i did not care to purchase though i found an affectionate letter from our good colonel enjoining me to make my fortune awaiting me at the agents and my wife received a pair of beautiful cashmere shawls from the same kind friend     chapter xlix contains at least six more courses and two desserts   the bankers dinnerparty over we returned to our apartments having dropped major pendennis at his lodgings and there as the custom is amongst most friendly married couples talked over the company and the dinner i thought my wife would naturally have liked sir barnes newcome who was very attentive to her took her to dinner as the bride and talked ceaselessly to her during the whole entertainment  laura said noshe did not know whycould there be any better reason there was a tone about sir barnes newcome she did not likeespecially in his manner to women  i remarked that he spoke sharply and in a sneering manner to his wife and treated one or two remarks which she made as if she was an idiot  mrs pendennis flung up her head as much as to say and so she is  mr pendennis what the wife too my dear laura i should have thought such a pretty simple innocent young woman with just enough good looks to make her pass muster who is very well bred and not brilliant at alli should have thought such a one might have secured a sisters approbation  mrs pendennis you fancy we are all jealous of one another no protests of ours can take that notion out of your heads my dear pen i do not intend to try we are not jealous of mediocrity we are not patient of it i dare say we are angry because we see men admire it so you gentlemen who pretend to be our betters give yourselves such airs of protection and profess such a lofty superiority over us prove it by quitting the cleverest woman in the room for the first pair of bright eyes and dimpled cheeks that enter it was those charms which attracted you in lady clara sir  pendennis i think she is very pretty and very innocent and artless  mrs p not very pretty and perhaps not so very artless  pendennis how can you tell you wicked woman are you such a profound deceiver yourself that you can instantly detect artifice in others o laura  mrs p we can detect all sorts of things the inferior animals have instincts you know i must say my wife is always very satirical upon this point of the relative rank of the sexes one thing i am sure of is that she is not happy and oh pen that she does not care much for her little girl  pendennis how do you know that my dear  mrs p we went upstairs to see the child after dinner it was at my wish the mother did not offer to go the child was awake and crying lady clara did not offer to take it ethelmiss newcome took it rather to my surprise for she seems very haughty and the nurse who i suppose was at supper came running up at the noise and then the poor little thing was quiet  pendennis i remember we heard the music as the diningroom door was open and newcome said that is what you will have to expect pendennis  mrs p hush sir if my baby cries i think you must expect me to run out of the room i liked miss newcome after seeing her with the poor little thing she looked so handsome as she walked with it i longed to have it myself  pendennis tout vient a fin a qui sait  mrs p dont be silly what a dreadful dreadful place this great world of yours is arthur where husbands do not seem to care for their wives where mothers do not love their children where children love their nurses best where men talk what they call gallantry  pendennis what  mrs p yes such as that dreary languid pale bald cadaverous leering man whispered to me oh how i dislike him i am sure he is unkind to his wife i am sure he has a bad temper and if there is any excuse for  pendennis for what  mrs p for nothing but you heard yourself that he had a bad temper and spoke sneeringly to his wife what could make her marry him  pendennis money and the desire of papa and mamma for the same reason clives flame poor miss newcome was brought out today that vacant seat at her side was for lord farintosh who did not come and the marquis not being present the baron took his innings did you not see how tender he was to her and how fierce poor clive looked  mrs p lord highgate was very attentive to miss newcome was he  pendennis and some years ago lord highgate was breaking his heart about whom do you think about lady clara pulleyn our hostess of last night he was jack belsize then a younger son plunged over head and ears in debt and of course there could be no marriage clive was present at baden when a terrible scene took place and carried off poor jack to switzerland and italy where he remained till his father died and he came into the title in which he rejoices and now he is off with the old love laura and on with the new why do you look at me so are you thinking that other people have been in love two or three times too  mrs p i am thinking that i should not like to live in london arthur  and this was all that mrs laura could be brought to say when this young woman chooses to be silent there is no power that can extract a word from her it is true that she is generally in the right but that is only the more aggravating indeed what can be more provoking after a dispute with your wife than to find it is you and not she who has been in the wrong   sir barnes newcome politely caused us to understand that the entertainment of which we had just partaken was given in honour of the bride clive must needs not be outdone in hospitality and invited us and others to a fine feast at the star and garter at richmond where mrs pendennis was placed at his right hand i smile as i think how much dining has been already commemorated in these veracious pages but the story is an everyday record and does not dining form a certain part of the pleasure and business of every day it is at that pleasant hour that our set has the privilege of meeting the other the morning man and woman alike devote to business or pass mainly in the company of their own kind john has his office jane her household her nursery her milliner her daughters and their masters in the country he has his hunting his fishing his farming his letters she her schools her poor her garden or what not parted through the shining hours and improving them let us trust we come together towards sunset only we make merry and amuse ourselves we chat with our pretty neighbour or survey the young ones sporting we make love and are jealous we dance or obsequiously turn over the leaves of cecilias musicbook we play whist or go to sleep in the armchair according to our ages and conditions snooze gently in thy armchair thou easy baldhead play your whist or read your novel or talk scandal over your work ye worthy dowagers and fogies meanwhile the young ones frisk about or dance or sing or laugh or whisper behind curtains in moonlit windows or shirk away into the garden and come back smelling of cigars nature having made them so to do  nature at this time irresistibly impelled clive newcome towards lovemaking it was pairingseason with him mr clive was now some threeandtwenty years old enough has been said about his good looks which were in truth sufficient to make him a match for the young lady on whom he had set his heart and from whom during this entertainment which he gave to my wife he could never keep his eyes away for three minutes lauras did not need to be so keen as they were in order to see what poor clives condition was she did not in the least grudge the young fellows inattention to herself or feel hurt that he did not seem to listen when she spoke she conversed with j j her neighbour who was very modest and agreeable while her husband not so well pleased had mrs hobson newcome for his partner during the chief part of the entertainment mrs hobson and lady clara were the matrons who gave the sanction of their presence to this bachelorparty neither of their husbands could come to clives little fete had they not the city and the house of commons to attend my uncle major pendennis was another of the guests who for his part found the party was what you young fellows call very slow dreading mrs hobson and her powers of conversation the old gentleman nimbly skipped out of her neighbourhood and fell by the side of lord highgate to whom the major was inclined to make himself very pleasant but lord highgates broad back was turned upon his neighbour who was forced to tell stories to captain crackthorpe which had amused dukes and marquises in former days and were surely quite good enough for any baron in this realm lord highgate sweet upon la belle newcome is he said the testy major afterwards he seemed to me to talk to lady clara the whole time when i awoke in the garden after dinner as mrs hobson was telling one of her confounded long stories i found her audience was diminished to one crackthorpe lord highgate and lady clara we had all been sitting there when the bankeress cut in in the mid of a very good story i was telling them which entertained them very much and never ceased talking till i fell off into a doze when i roused myself begad she was still going on crackthorpe was off smoking a cigar on the terrace my lord and lady clara were nowhere and you four with the little painter were chatting cosily in another arbour behaved himself very well the little painter doosid good dinner ellis gave us but as for highgate being aux soins with la belle banquiere trust me my boy he isupon my word my dear it seemed to me his thoughts went quite another way to be sure lady clara is a belle banquiere too now he he he how could he say he had no carriage to go home in he came down in crackthorpes cab who passed us just now driving back young whatdyecall the painter  thus did the major discourse as we returned towards the city i could see in the open carriage which followed us lady clara newcomes lord highgates white hat by clives on the back seat  laura looked at her husband the same thought may have crossed their minds though neither uttered it but although sir barnes and lady clara newcome offered us other civilities during our stay in london no inducements could induce laura to accept the proffered friendship of that lady when lady clara called my wife was not at home when she invited us laura pleaded engagements at first she bestowed on miss newcome too a share of this haughty dislike and rejected the advances which that young lady who professed to like my wife very much made towards an intimacy when i appealed to her for newcomes house was after all a very pleasant one and you met the best people there my wife looked at me with an expression of something like scorn and said why dont i like miss newcome of course because i am jealous of herall women you know arthur are jealous of such beauties i could get for a long while no better explanation than these sneers for my wifes antipathy towards this branch of the newcome family but an event presently came which silenced my remonstrances and showed to me that laura had judged barnes and his wife only too well  poor mrs hobson newcome had reason to be sulky at the neglect which all the richmond party showed her for nobody not even major pendennis as we have seen would listen to her intellectual conversation nobody not even lord highgate would drive back to town in her carriage though the vehicle was large and empty and lady claras barouche in which his lordship chose to take a place had already three occupants within itbut in spite of these rebuffs and disappointments the virtuous lady of bryanstone square was bent upon being goodnatured and hospitable and i have to record in the present chapter yet one more feast of which mr and mrs pendennis partook at the expense of the most respectable newcome family  although mrs laura here also appeared and had the place of honour in her character of bride i am bound to own my opinion that mrs hobson only made us the pretext of her party and that in reality it was given to persons of a much more exalted rank we were the first to arrive our good old major the most punctual of men bearing us company our hostess was arrayed in unusual state and splendour her fat neck was ornamented with jewels rich bracelets decorated her arms and this bryanstone square cornelia had likewise her family jewels distributed round her priceless male and female newcome gems from the kings college youth with whom we have made a brief acquaintance and his elder sister now entering into the world down to the last little ornament of the nursery in a prodigious new sash with ringlets hot and crisp from the tongs of a marylebone hairdresser we had seen the cherub faces of some of these darlings pressed against the drawingroom windows as our carriage drove up to the door when after a few minutes conversation another vehicle arrived away they dashed to the windows again the innocent little dears crying out heres the marquis and in sadder tones no it isnt the marquis by which artless expressions they showed how eager they were to behold an expected guest of a rank only inferior to dukes in this great empire  putting two and two together as the saying is it was not difficult for me to guess who the expected marquis wasand indeed the kings college youth set that question at once to rest by wagging his head at me and winking his eye and saying we expect farintosh  why my dearest children matronly virtue exclaimed this anxiety to behold the young marquis of farintosh whom we expect at our modest table mrs pendennis today twice you have been at the window in your eagerness to look for him louisa you silly child do you imagine that his lordship will appear in his robes and coronet rodolf you absurd boy do you think that a marquis is other than a man i have never admired aught but intellect mrs pendennis that let us be thankful is the only true title to distinction in our country nowadays  begad sir whispers the old major to me intellect may be a doosid fine thing but in my opinion a marquisate and eighteen or twenty thousand a yeari should say the farintosh property with the glenlivat estate and the roy property in england must be worth nineteen thousand a year at the very lowest figure and i remember when this young mans father was only tom roy of the 42nd with no hope of succeeding to the title and doosidly out at elbows tooi say what does the bankeress mean by chattering about intellect hang me a marquis is a marquis and mrs newcome knows it as well as i do my good major was growing old and was not unnaturally a little testy at the manner in which his hostess received him truth to tell she hardly took any notice of him and cut down a couple of the old gentlemans stories before he had been five minutes in the room  to our party presently comes the host in a flurried countenance with a white waistcoat holding in his hand an open letter towards which his wife looks with some alarm how dy doo lady clara how dy doo ethel he says saluting those ladies whom the second carriage had brought to us sir barnes is not coming thats one place vacant that lady clara you wont mind you see him at home but heres a disappointment for you miss newcome lord farintosh cant come  at this two of the children cry out oh oh with such a melancholy accent that miss newcome and lady clara burst out laughing  got a dreadful toothache said mr hobson heres his letter  hang it what a bore cries artless young kings college  why a bore samuel a bore as you call it for lord farintosh i grant but do you suppose that the high in station are exempt from the ills of mortality i know nothing more painful than a toothache exclaims a virtuous matron using the words of philosophy but showing the countenance of anger  hang it why didnt he have it out says samuel  miss ethel laughed lord farintosh would not have that tooth out for the world samuel she cried gaily he keeps it in on purpose and it always aches when he does not want to go out to dinner  i know one humble family who will never ask him again mrs hobson exclaims rustling in all her silks and tapping her fan and her foot the eclipse however passes off her countenance and light is restored when at this moment a cab having driven up during the period of darkness the door is flung open and lord highgate is announced by a loudvoiced butler  my wife being still the bride on this occasion had the honour of being led to the dinnertable by our banker and host lord highgate was reserved for mrs hobson who in an engaging manner requested poor clive to conduct his cousin maria to dinner handing over miss ethel to another guest our major gave his arm to lady clara and i perceived that my wife looked very grave as he passed the place where she sat and seated lady clara in the next chair to that which lord highgate chanced to occupy feeling himself en vein and the company being otherwise rather mum and silent my uncle told a number of delightful anecdotes about the beaumonde of his time about the peninsular war the regent brummell lord steyne pea green payne and so forth he said the evening was very pleasant though some others of the party as it appeared to me scarcely seemed to think so clive had not a word for his cousin maria but looked across the table at ethel all dinnertime what could ethel have to say to her partner old colonel sir donald mcraw who gobbled and drank as his wont is and if he had a remark to make imparted it to mrs hobson at whose right hand he was sitting and to whom during the whole course or courses of the dinner my lord highgate scarcely uttered one single word  his lordship was whispering all the while into the ringlets of lady clara they were talking a jargon which their hostess scarcely understood of people only known to her by her study of the peerage when we joined the ladies after dinner lord highgate again made way towards lady clara and at an order from her as i thought left her ladyship and strove hard to engage in a conversation with mrs newcome i hope he succeeded in smoothing the frowns in that round little face mrs laura i own was as grave as a judge all the evening very grave even and reserved with my uncle when the hour for parting came and we took him home  he he said the old man coughing and nodding his old head and laughing in his senile manner when i saw him on the next day that was a pleasant evening we had yesterday doosid pleasant and i think my two neighbours seemed to be uncommonly pleased with each other not an amusing fellow that young painter of yours though he is goodlooking enough but theres no conversation in him do you think of giving a little dinner arthur in return for these hospitalities greenwich hey or something of that sort ill go you halves sir and well ask the young banker and bankeressnot yesterdays amphitryon nor his wife no no hang it but barnes newcome is a devilish clever rising man and moves in about as good society as any in london well ask him and lady clara and highgate and one or two more and have a pleasant party  but to this proposal when the old man communicated it to her in a very quiet simple artful way laura with a flushing face said no quite abruptly and quitted the room rustling in her silks and showing at once dignity and indignation   not many more feasts was arthur pendennis senior to have in this world not many more great men was he to flatter nor schemes to wink at nor earthly pleasures to enjoy his long days were wellnigh ended on his last couch which laura tended so affectionately with his last breath almost he faltered out to me i had other views for you my boy and once hoped to see you in a higher position in life but i begin to think now arthur that i was wrong and as for that girl sir i am sure she is an angel  may i not inscribe the words with a grateful heart blessed heblessed though maybe undeservingwho has the love of a good woman     chapter l clive in new quarters   my wife was much better pleased with clive than with some of his relatives to whom i had presented her his face carried a recommendation with it that few honest people could resist he was always a welcome friend in our lodgings and even our uncle the major signified his approval of the lad as a young fellow of very good manners and feelings who if he chose to throw himself away and be a painter ma foi was rich enough no doubt to follow his own caprices clive executed a capital head of major pendennis which now hangs in our drawingroom at fairoaks and reminds me of that friend of my youth clive occupied ancient lofty chambers in hanover square now he had furnished them in an antique manner with hangings cabinets carved work venice glasses fine prints and watercolour sketches of good pictures by his own and other hands he had horses to ride and a liberal purse full of paternal money many fine equipages drew up opposite to his chambers few artists had such luck as young mr clive and above his own chambers were other three which the young gentleman had hired and where says he i hope ere very long my dear old father will be lodging with me in another year he says he thinks he will be able to come home when the affairs of the bank are quite settled you shake your head why the shares are worth four times what we gave for them we are men of fortune pen i give you my word you should see how much they make of me at baynes and jollys and how civil they are to me at hobson brothers i go into the city now and then and see our manager mr blackmore he tells me such stories about indigo and wool and copper and sicca rupees and companys rupees i dont know anything about the business but my father likes me to go and see mr blackmore dear cousin barnes is for ever asking me to dinner i might call lady clara clara if i liked as sam newcome does in bryanstone square you cant think how kind they are to me there my aunt reproaches me tenderly for not going there oftenerits not very good fun dining in bryanstone square is it and she praises my cousin maria to meyou should hear my aunt praise her i have to take maria down to dinner to sit by the piano and listen to her songs in all languages do you know maria can sing hungarian and polish besides your common german spanish and italian those i have at our other agents baynes and jollysbayness that is in the regents park where the girls are prettier and just as civil to me as at aunt hobsons and here clive would amuse us by the accounts which he gave us of the snares which the misses baynes those young sirens of regents park set for him of the songs which they sang to enchant him the albums in which they besought him to drawthe thousand winning ways which they employed to bring him into their cave in york terrace but neither circes smiles nor calypsos blandishments had any effect on him his ears were stopped to their music and his eyes rendered dull to their charms by those of the flighty young enchantress with whom my wife had of late made acquaintance  capitalist though he was our young fellow was still very affable he forgot no old friends in his prosperity and the lofty antique chambers would not unfrequently be lighted up at nights to receive f b and some of the old cronies of the haunt and some of the gandishites who if clive had been of a nature that was to be spoiled by flattery had certainly done mischief to the young man gandish himself when clive paid a visit to that illustrious artists academy received his former pupil as if the young fellow had been a sovereign prince almost accompanied him to his horse and would have held his stirrup as he mounted whilst the beautiful daughters of the house waved adieus to him from the parlourwindow to the young men assembled in his gandish studio was never tired of talking about clive the professor would take occasion to inform them that he had been to visit his distinguished young friend mr newcome son of colonel newcome that last evening he had been present at an elegant entertainment at mr newcomes news apartments clives drawings were hung up in gandishs gallery and pointed out to visitors by the worthy professor on one or two occasions i was allowed to become a bachelor again and participate in these jovial meetings how guilty my coat was on my return home how haughty the looks of the mistress of my house as she bade martha carry away the obnoxious garment how grand f b used to be as president of clives smokingparty where he laid down the law talked the most talk sang the jolliest song and consumed the most drink of all the jolly talkers and drinkers clives popularity rose prodigiously not only youngsters but old practitioners of the fine arts lauded his talents what a shame that his pictures were all refused this year at the academy alfred smee esq ra was indignant at their rejection but j j confessed with a sigh and clive owned goodnaturedly that he had been neglecting his business and that his pictures were not so good as those of two years before i am afraid mr clive went to too many balls and parties to clubs and jovial entertainments besides losing yet more time in that other pursuit we wot of meanwhile j j went steadily on with his work no day passed without a line and fame was not very far off though this he heeded but little and art his sole mistress rewarded him for his steady and fond pursuit of her  look at him clive would say with a sigh isnt he the mortal of all others the most to be envied he is so fond of his art that in all the world there is no attraction like it for him he runs to his easel at sunrise and sits before it caressing his picture all day till nightfall he takes leave of it sadly when dark comes spends the night in a life academy and begins next morning da capo of all the pieces of good fortune which can befall a man is not this the greatest to have your desire and then never tire of it i have been in such a rage with my own shortcomings that i have dashed my foot through the canvases and vowed i would smash my palette and easel sometimes i succeed a little better in my work and then it will happen for half an hour that i am pleased but pleased at what pleased at drawing mr mugginss head rather like mr muggins why a thousand fellows can do better and when one day i reach my very best yet thousands will be able to do better still ours is a trade for which nowadays there is no excuse unless one can be great in it and i feel i have not the stuff for that no 666 portrait of joseph muggins esq newcome great george street no 979 portrait of mrs muggins on her grey pony newcome no 579 portrait of joseph muggins esqs dog toby newcomethis iswhat im fit for these are the victories i have set myself on achieving oh mrs pendennis isnt it humiliating why isnt there a war why cant i go and distinguish myself somewhere and be a general why havent i a genius i say pen sir why havent i a genius there is a painter who lives hard by and who sends sometimes to beg me to come and look at his work he is in the muggins line too he gets his canvases with a good light upon them excludes the contemplation of all other objects stands beside his pictures in an attitude himself and thinks that he and they are masterpieces masterpieces oh me what drivelling wretches we are fameexcept that of just the one or twowhats the use of it i say pen would you feel particularly proud now if you had written hayleys poems and as for a second place in painting who would care to be caravaggio or caracci i wouldnt give a straw to be caracci or caravaggio i would just as soon be yonder artist who is painting up fokers entire over the publichouse at the corner he will have his payment afterwards five shillings a day and a pot of beer your head a little more to the light mrs pendennis if you please i am tiring you i dare say but then oh i am doing it so badly  i for my part thought clive was making a very pretty drawing of my wife and having affairs of my own to attend to would often leave her at his chambers as a sitter or find him at our lodgings visiting her they became the very greatest friends i knew the young fellow could have no better friend than laura and not being ignorant of the malady under which he was labouring concluded naturally and justly that clive grew so fond of my wife not for her sake entirely but for his own because he could pour his heart out to her and her sweet kindness and compassion would soothe him in his unhappy condition  miss ethel i have said also professed a great fondness for mrs pendennis and there was that charm in the young ladys manner which speedily could overcome even female jealousy perhaps laura determined magnanimously to conquer it perhaps she hid it so as to vex me and prove the injustice of my suspicions perhaps honestly she was conquered by the young beauty and gave her a regard and admiration which the other knew she could inspire whenever she had the will my wife was fairly captivated by her at length the untameable young creature was docile and gentle in lauras presence modest natural amiable full of laughter and spirits delightful to see and to hear her presence cheered our quiet little household her charm fascinated my wife as it had subjugated poor clive even the reluctant farintosh was compelled to own her power and confidentially told his male friends that hang it she was so handsome and so clever and so confoundedly pleasant and fascinating and thatthat he had been on the point of popping the fatal question ever so many times by jove and hang it you know his lordship would say i dont want to marry until i have had my fling you know as for clive ethel treated him like a boy like a big brother she was jocular kind pert pleasant with him ordered him on her errands accepted his bouquets and compliments admired his drawings liked to hear him praised and took his part in all companies laughed at his sighs and frankly owned to laura her liking for him and her pleasure in seeing him why said she should not i be happy as long as the sunshine lasts tomorrow i know will be glum and dreary enough when grandmamma comes back i shall scarcely be able to come and see you when i am settled in lifeeh i shall be settled in life do not grudge me my holiday laura oh if you knew how stupid it is to be in the world and how much pleasanter to come and talk and laugh and sing and be happy with you than to sit in that dreary eaton place with poor clara  why do you stay in eaton place asks laura  why because i must go out with somebody what an unsophisticated little country creature you are grandmamma is away and i cannot go about to parties by myself  but why should you go to parties and why not go back to your mother says mrs pendennis gently  to the nursery and my little sisters and miss cann i like being in london best thank you you look grave you think a girl should like to be with her mother and sisters best my dear mamma wishes me to be here and i stay with barnes and clara by grandmammas orders dont you know that i have been made over to lady kew who has adopted me do you think a young lady of my pretensions can stop at home in a damp house in warwickshire and cut breadandbutter for little schoolboys dont look so very grave and shake your head so mrs pendennis if you had been bred as i have you would be as i am i know what you are thinking madam  i am thinking said laura blushing and bowing her headi am thinking if it pleases god to give me children i should like to live at home at fairoaks my wifes thoughts though she did not utter them and a certain modesty and habitual awe kept her silent upon subjects so very sacred went deeper yet she had been bred to measure her actions by a standard which the world may nominally admit but which it leaves for the most part unheeded worship love duty as taught her by the devout study of the sacred law which interprets and defines itif these formed the outward practice of her life they were also its constant and secret endeavours and occupation she spoke but very seldom of her religion though it filled her heart and influenced all her behaviour whenever she came to that sacred subject her demeanour appeared to her husband so awful that he scarcely dared to approach it in her company and stood without as this pure creature entered into the holy of holies what must the world appear to such a person its ambitious rewards disappointments pleasures worth how much compared to the possession of that priceless treasure and happiness unspeakable a perfect faith what has life to offer i see before me now her sweet grave face as she looks out from the balcony of the little richmond villa we occupied during the first happy year after our marriage following ethel newcome who rides away with a staid groom behind her to her brothers summer residence not far distant clive had been with us in the morning and had brought us stirring news the good colonel was by this time on his way home if clive could tear himself away from london the good man wrote and we thus saw he was acquainted with the state of the young mans mind why should not clive go and meet his father at malta he was feverish and eager to go and his two friends strongly counselled him to take the journey in the midst of our talk miss ethel came among us she arrived flushed and in high spirits she rallied clive upon his gloomy looks she turned rather pale as it seemed to us when she heard the news then she coldly told him she thought the voyage must be a pleasant one and would do him good it was pleasanter than that journey she was going to take herself with her dreary grandmother to those german springs which the old countess frequented year after year mr pendennis having business retired to his study whither presently mrs laura followed having to look for her scissors or a book she wanted or upon some pretext or other she sate down in the conjugal study not one word did either of us say for a while about the young people left alone in the drawingroom yonder laura talked about our own home at fairoaks which our tenants were about to vacate she vowed and declared that we must live at fairoaks that clavering with all its tittletattle and stupid inhabitants was better than this wicked london besides there were some new and very pleasant families settled in the neighbourhood clavering park was taken by some delightful peopleand you know pen you were always very fond of flyfishing and may fish the brawl as you used in old days when the lips of the pretty satirist who alluded to these unpleasant bygones were silenced as they deserved to be by mr pendennis do you think sir i did not know says the sweetest voice in the world when you went out on your fishing excursions with miss amory again the flow of words is checked by the styptic previously applied  i wonder says mr pendennis archly bending over his wifes fair handi wonder whether this kind of thing is taking place in the drawingroom  nonsense arthur it is time to go back to them why i declare i have been threequarters of an hour away  i dont think they will much miss you my dear says the gentleman  she is certainly very fond of him she is always coming here i am sure it is not to hear you read shakspeare arthur or your new novel though it is very pretty i wish lady kew and her sixty thousand pounds were at the bottom of the sea  but she says she is going to portion her younger brothers with a part of it she told clive so remarks mr pendennis  for shame why does not barnes newcome portion his younger brothers i have no patience with thatwhy goodness there is clive going away actually clive mr newcome but though my wife ran to the studywindow and beckoned our friend he only shook his head jumped on his horse and rode away gloomily  ethel had been crying when i went into the room laura afterwards told me i knew she had but she looked up from some flowers over which she was bending began to laugh and rattle would talk about nothing but lady hautbois great breakfast the day before and the most insufferable mayfair jargon and then declared it was time to go home and dress for mrs booths dejeuner which was to take place that afternoon  and so miss newcome rode awayback amongst the roses and the rougesback amongst the fiddling flirting flattery falsenessand lauras sweet serene face looked after her departing mrs booths was a very grand dejeuner we read in the newspapers a list of the greatest names there a royal duke and duchess a german highness a hindoo nabob etc and amongst the marquises farintosh and amongst the lords highgate and lady clara newcome and miss newcome who looked killing our acquaintance captain crackthorpe informs us and who was in perfectly stunning spirits his imperial highness the grand duke of farintosh is wild about her the captain said and our poor young friend clive may just go and hang himself dine with us at the gar and starter jolly party oh i forgot married man now so saying the captain entered the hostelry near which i met him leaving this present chronicler to return to his own home     chapter li an old friend   i might open the present chapter as a contemporary writer of romance is occasionally in the habit of commencing his tales of chivalry by a description of a november afternoon falling leaves tawny forests gathering storms and other autumnal phenomena and two horsemen winding up the romantic road which leads fromfrom richmond bridge to the star and garter the one rider is youthful and has a blonde moustache the cheek of the other has been browned by foreign suns it is easy to see by the manner in which he bestrides his powerful charger that he has followed the profession of arms he looks as if he had faced his countrys enemies on many a field of eastern battle the cavaliers alight before the gate of a cottage on richmond hill where a gentleman receives them with eager welcome their steeds are accommodated at a neighbouring hostelryi pause in the midst of the description for the reader has made the acquaintance of our two horsemen long since it is clive returned from malta from gibraltar from seville from cadiz and with him our dear old friend the colonel his campaigns are over his sword is hung up he leaves eastern suns and battles to warm younger blood welcome back to england dear colonel and kind friend how quickly the years have passed since he has been gone there is a streak or two more silver in his hair the wrinkles about his honest eyes are somewhat deeper but their look is as steadfast and kind as in the early almost boyish days when first we knew them  we talk a while about the colonels voyage home the pleasures of the spanish journey the handsome new quarters in which clive has installed his father and himself my own altered condition in life and what not during the conversation a little querulous voice makes itself audible abovestairs at which noise mr clive begins to laugh and the colonel to smile it is for the first time in his life mr clive listens to the little voice indeed it is only since about six weeks that that small organ has been heard in the world at all laura pendennis believes its tunes to be the sweetest the most interesting the most mirthinspiring the most pitiful and pathetic that ever baby uttered which opinions of course are backed by mrs hokey the confidential nurse lauras husband is not so rapturous but let us trust behaves in a way becoming a man and a father we forgo the description of his feelings as not pertaining to the history at present under consideration a little while before the dinner is served the lady of the cottage comes down to greet her husbands old friends  and here i am sorely tempted to a third description which has nothing to do with the story to be sure but which if properly his off might fill half a page very prettily for is not a young mother one of the sweetest sights which life shows us if she has been beautiful before does not her present pure joy give a character of refinement and sacredness almost to her beauty touch her sweet cheeks with fairer blushes and impart i know not what serene brightness to her eyes i give warning to the artist who designs the pictures for this veracious story to make no attempt at this subject i never would be satisfied with it were his drawing ever so good  when sir charles grandison stepped up and made his very beautifullest bow to miss byron i am sure his gracious dignity never exceeded that of colonel newcomes first greeting to mrs pendennis of course from the very moment they beheld one another they became friends are not most of our likings thus instantaneous before she came down to see him laura had put on one of the colonels shawlsthe crimson one with the red palmleaves and the border of many colours as for the white one the priceless the gossamer the fairy web which might pass through a ring that every lady must be aware was already appropriated to cover the cradle or what i believe is called the bassinet of master pendennis  so we all became the very best of friends and during the winter months whilst we still resided at richmond the colonel was my wifes constant visitor he often came without clive he did not care for the world which the young gentleman frequented and was more pleased and at home by my wifes fireside than at more noisy and splendid entertainments and laura being a sentimental person interested in pathetic novels and all unhappy attachments of course she and the colonel talked a great deal about mr clives little affair over which they would have such deep confabulations that even when the master of the house appeared pater familias the man whom in the presence of the rev dr portman mrs laura had sworn to love and honour these two guilty ones would be silent or change the subject of conversation not caring to admit such an unsympathising person as myself into their conspiracy  from many a talk which they have had together since the colonel and his son embraced at malta clives father had been led to see how strongly the passion which our friend had once fought and mastered had now taken possession of the young man the unsatisfied longing left him indifferent to all other objects of previous desire or ambition the misfortune darkened the sunshine of his spirit and clouded the world before his eyes he passed hours in his paintingroom though he tore up what he did there he forsook his usual haunts or appeared amongst his old comrades moody and silent from cigarsmoking which i own to be a reprehensible practice he plunged into still deeper and darker dissipation for i am sorry to say he took to pipes and the strongest tobacco for which there is no excuse our young man was changed during the last fifteen or twenty months the malady had been increasing on him of which we have not chosen to describe at length the stages knowing very well that the reader the male reader at least does not care a fig about other peoples sentimental perplexities and is not wrapped up heart and soul in clives affairs like his father whose rest was disturbed if the boy had a headache or who would have stripped the coat off his back to keep his darlings feet warm  the object of this hopeless passion had meantime returned to the custody of the dark old duenna from which she had been liberated for a while lady kew had got her health again by means of the prescriptions of some doctors or by the efficacy of some baths and was again on foot and in the world tramping about in her grim pursuit of pleasure lady julia we are led to believe had retired upon halfpay and into an inglorious exile at brussels with her sister the outlaws wife by whose bankrupt fireside she was perfectly happy miss newcome was now her grandmothers companion and they had been on a tour of visits in scotland and were journeying from countryhouse to countryhouse about the time when our good colonel returned to his native shores  the colonel loved his nephew barnes no better than before perhaps though we must say that since his return from india the young baronets conduct had been particularly friendly no doubt marriage had improved him lady clara seemed a goodnatured young woman enough besides says the colonel wagging his good old head knowingly tom newcome of the bundelcund bank is a personage to be conciliated whereas tom newcome of the bengal cavalry was not worth master barness attention he has been very good and kind on the whole so have his friends been uncommonly civil there was clives acquaintance mr belsize that was lord highgate who is now entertained our whole family sumptuously last weekwants us and barnes and his wife to go to his countryhouse at christmasis as hospitable my dear mrs pendennis as man can be he met you at barness and as soon as we are alone says the colonel turning round to lauras husband i will tell you in what terms lady clara speaks of your wife yes she is a goodnatured kind little woman that lady clara here lauras face assumed that gravity and severeness which it always wore when lady claras name was mentioned and the conversation took another turn  returning home from london one afternoon i met the colonel who hailed me on the omnibus and rode on his way towards the city i knew of course that he had been colloquying with my wife and taxed that young woman with these continued flirtations two or three times a week mrs laura you dare to receive a colonel of dragoons you sit for hours closeted with the young fellow of sixty you change the conversation when your own injured husband enters the room and pretend to talk about the weather or the baby you little arch hypocrite you know you do dont try to humbug me miss what will richmond what will society what will mrs grundy in general say to such atrocious behaviour  oh pen says my wife closing my mouth in a way which i do not choose further to particularise that man is the best the dearest the kindest creature i never knew such a good man you ought to put him into a book do you know sir that i felt the very greatest desire to give him a kiss when he went away and that one which you had just now was intended for him  take back thy gift false girl says mr pendennis and then finally we come to the particular circumstance which had occasioned so much enthusiasm on mrs lauras part  colonel newcome had summoned heart of grace and in clives behalf had regularly proposed him to barnes as a suitor to ethel taking an artful advantage of his nephew barnes newcome and inviting that barnes to a private meeting where they were to talk about the affairs of the bundelcund banking company  now this bundelcund banking company in the colonels eyes was in reality his son clive but for clive there might have been a hundred banking companies established yielding a hundred per cent in as many districts of india and thomas newcome who had plenty of money for his own wants would never have thought of speculation his desire was to see his boy endowed with all the possible gifts of fortune had he built a palace for clive and been informed that a rocs egg was required to complete the decoration of the edifice tom newcome would have travelled to the worlds end in search of the wanting article to see prince clive ride in a gold coach with a princess beside him was the kind old colonels ambition that done he would be content to retire to a garret in the princes castle and smoke his cheroot there in peace so the world is made the strong and eager covet honour and enjoyment for themselves the gentle and disappointed once they may have been strong and eager too desire these gifts for their children i think clives father never liked or understood the lads choice of a profession he acquiesced in it as he would in any of his sons wishes but not being a poet himself he could not see the nobility of that calling and felt secretly that his son was demeaning himself by pursuing the art of painting had he been a soldier now thought thomas newcome though i prevented that had he been richer than he is he might have married ethel instead of being unhappy as he now is god help him i remember my own time of grief well enough and what years it took before my wound wound was scarred over  so with these things occupying his brain thomas newcome artfully invited barnes his nephew to dinner under pretence of talking of the affairs of the great b b c with the first glass of wine at dessert and according to the colonels good oldfashioned custom of proposing toasts they drank the health of the b b c barnes drank the toast with all his generous heart the b b c sent to hobson brothers and newcome a great deal of business was in a most prosperous condition kept a great balance at the bank a balance that would not be overdrawn as sir barnes newcome very well knew barnes was for having more of these bills provided there were remittances to meet the same barnes was ready to do any amount of business with the indian bank or with any bank or with any individual christian or heathen white or black who could do good to the firm of hobson brothers and newcome he spoke upon this subject with great archness and candour of course as a city man he would be glad to do a profitable business anywhere and the b b cs business was profitable but the interested motive which he admitted frankly as a man of the world did not prevent other sentiments more agreeable my dear colonel says barnes i am happy most happy to think that our house and our name should have been useful as i know they have been in the establishment of a concern in which one of our family is interested one whom we all so sincerely respect and regard and he touched his glass with his lips and blushed a little as he bowed towards his uncle he found himself making a little speech indeed and to do so before one single person seems rather odd had there been a large company present barnes would not have blushed at all but have tossed off his glass struck his waistcoat possibly and looked straight in the face of his uncle as the chairman well he did very likely believe that he respected and regarded the colonel  the colonel saidthank you barnes with all my heart it is always good for men to be friends much more for blood relations as we are  a relationship which honours me im sure says barnes with a tone of infinite affability you see he believed that heaven had made him the colonels superior  and i am very glad the elder went on that you and my boy are good friends  friends of course it would be unnatural if such near relatives were otherwise than good friends  you have been hospitable to him and lady clara very kind and he wrote to me telling me of your kindness ahem this is tolerable claret i wonder where clive gets it  you were speaking about that indigo colonel here barnes interposes our house has done very little in that way to be sure but i suppose that our credit is about as good as batties and jollys and if but the colonel is in a brown study  clive will have a good bit of money when i die resumes clives father  why you are a hale manupon my word quite a young man and may marry again colonel replies the nephew fascinatingly  i shall never do that replies the other ere many years are gone i shall be seventy years old barnes  nothing in this country my dear sir positively nothing why there was titus my neighbour in the countrywhen will you come down to newcomewho married a devilish pretty girl of very good family too miss burgeon one of the devonshire burgeons he looks i am sure twenty years older than you do why should not you do likewise  because i like to remain single and want to leave clive a rich man look here barnes you know the value of our bank shares now  indeed i do rather speculative but of course i know what some sold for last week says barnes  suppose i realise now i think i am worth six lakhs i had nearly two from my poor father i saved some before and since i invested in this affair and could sell out tomorrow with sixty thousand pounds  a very pretty sum of money colonel says barnes  i have a pension of a thousand a year  my dear colonel you are a capitalist we know it very well remarks sir barnes  and two hundred a year is as much as i want for myself continues the capitalist looking into the fire and jingling his money in his pockets a hundred a year for a horse a hundred a year for pocketmoney for i calculate you know that clive will give me a bedroom and my dinner  he he if your son wont your nephew will my dear colonel says the affable barnes smiling sweetly  i can give the boy a handsome allowance you see resumes thomas newcome  you can make him a handsome allowance now and leave him a good fortune when you die says the nephew in a noble and courageous mannerand as if he said twelve times twelve are a hundred and fortyfour and you have sir barnes newcomes authoritysir barnes newcomes mind youto say so  not when i die barnes the uncle goes on i will give him every shilling i am worth tomorrow morning if he marries as i wish him  tant mieux pour lui cries the nephew and thought to himself lady clara must ask clive to dinner instantly confound the fellow i hate himalways have but what luck he has  a man with that property may pretend to a good wife as the french say hey barnes asks the colonel rather eagerly looking up in his nephews face  that countenance was lighted up with a generous enthusiasm to any woman in any rankto a noblemans daughter my dear sir exclaims sir barnes  i want your sister i want dear ethel for him barnes cries thomas newcome with a trembling voice and a twinkle in his eyes that was the hope i always had till my talk with your poor father stopped it your sister was engaged to my lord kew then and my wishes of course were impossible the poor boy is very much cut up and his whole heart is bent upon possessing her she is not she cant be indifferent to him i am sure she would not be if her family in the least encouraged him can either of these young folks have a better chance of happiness again offered to them in life theres youth theres mutual liking theres wealth for them almostonly saddled with the encumbrance of an old dragoon who wont be much in their way give us your good word barnes and let them come together and upon my word the rest of my days will be made happy if i can eat my meal at their table  whilst the poor colonel was making his appeal barnes had time to collect his answer which since in our character of historians we take leave to explain gentlemens motives as well as record their speeches and actions we may thus interpret confound the young beggar thinks barnes then he will have three or four thousand a year will he hang him but its a good sum of money what a fool his father is to give it away is he joking no he was always half crazythe colonel highgate seemed uncommonly sweet on her and was always hanging about our house farintosh has not been brought to book yet and perhaps neither of them will propose for her my grandmother i should think wont hear of her making a low marriage as this certainly is but its a pity to throw away four thousand a year aint it all these natural calculations passed briskly through barnes newcomes mind as his uncle from the opposite side of the fireplace implored him in the above little speech  my dear colonel said barnes my dear kind colonel i neednt tell you that your proposal flatters us as much as your extraordinary generosity surprises me i never heard anything like itnever could i consult my own wishes i would at oncei would permit me to say from sheer admiration of your noble character say yes with all my heart to your proposal but alas i havent that power  isis she engaged asks the colonel looking as blank and sad as clive himself when ethel had conversed with him  noi cannot say engagedthough a person of the very highest rank has paid her the most marked attention but my sister has in a way gone from our family and from my influence as the head of itan influence which i i am sure had most gladly exercised in your favour my grandmother lady kew has adopted her purposes i believe to leave ethel the greater part of her fortune upon certain conditions and of course expects thethe obedience and so forth which is customary in such cases by the way colonel is our young soupirant aware that papa is pleading his cause for him  the colonel said no and barnes lauded the caution which his uncle had displayed it was quite as well for the young mans interests which sir barnes had most tenderly at heart that clive newcome should not himself move in the affair or present himself to lady kew barnes would take the matter in hand at the proper season the colonel might be sure it would be most eagerly most ardently pressed clive came home at this juncture whom barnes saluted affectionately he and the colonel had talked over their money business their conversation had been most satisfactory thank you has it not colonel the three parted the very best of friends  as barnes newcome professed that extreme interest for his cousin and uncle it is odd he did not tell them that lady kew and miss ethel newcome were at that moment within a mile of them at her ladyships house in queen street mayfair in the hearing of clives servant barnes did not order his brougham to drive to queen street but waited until he was in bond street before he gave the order  and of course when he entered lady kews house he straightway asked for his sister and communicated to her the generous offer which the good colonel had made  you see lady kew was in town and not in town her ladyship was but passing through on her way from a tour of visits in the north to another tour of visits somewhere else the newspapers were not even off the blinds the proprietor of the house cowered over a bedcandle and a furtive teapot in the back drawingroom lady kews gens were not here the tall canary ones with white polls only showed their plumage and sang in spring the solitary wretch who takes charge of london houses and the two servants specially affected to lady kews person were the only people in attendance in fact her ladyship was not in town and that is why no doubt barnes newcome said nothing about her being there     chapter lii family secrets   the figure cowering over the furtive teapot glowered grimly at barnes as he entered and an old voice saidho its you  i have brought you the notes maam says barnes taking a packet of those documents from his pocketbook i could not come sooner i have been engaged upon bank business until now  i dare say you smell of smoke like a courier  a foreign capitalist he would smoke they will maam i didnt smoke upon my word  i dont see why you shouldnt if you like it you will never get anything out of me whether you do or dont how is clara is she gone to the country with the children newcome is the best place for her  doctor bambury thinks she can move in a fortnight the boy has had a little  a little fiddlestick i

and invite your mother and little brothers and sisters to stay christmas there the way in which you neglect them is shameful it is barnes  upon my word maam i propose to manage my own affairs without your ladyships assistance cries barnes starting up and did not come at this time of night to hear this kind of  of good advice i sent for you to give it you when i wrote to you to bring me the money i wanted it was but a pretext barkins might have fetched it from the city in the morning i want you to send clara and the children to newcome they ought to go sir that is why i sent for you to tell you that have you been quarrelling as much as usual  pretty much as usual says barnes drumming on his hat  dont beat that devils tattoo you agacez my poor old nerves when clara was given to you she was as well broke a girl as any in london  sir barnes responded by a groan  she was as gentle and amenable to reason as goodnatured a girl as could be a little vacant and silly but you men like dolls for your wives and now in three years you have utterly spoiled her she is restive she is artful she flies into rages she fights you and beats you he he and that comes of your beating her  i didnt come to hear this maam says barnes livid with rage  you struck her you know you did sir barnes newcome she rushed over to me last year on the night you did it you know she did  great god maam you know the provocation screams barnes  provocation or not i dont say but from that moment she has beat you you fool to write her a letter and ask her pardon if i had been a man i would rather have strangled my wife than have humiliated myself so before her she will never forgive that blow  i was mad when i did it and she drove me mad says barnes she has the temper of a fiend and the ingenuity of the devil in two years an entire change has come over her if i had used a knife to her i should not have been surprised but it is not with you to reproach me about clara your ladyship found her for me  and you spoilt her after she was found sir she told me part of her story that night she came to me i know it is true barnes you have treated her dreadfully sir  i know that she makes my life miserable and there is no help for it says barnes grinding a curse between his teeth well well no more about this how is ethel gone to sleep after her journey what do you think maam i have brought for her a proposal  bon dieu you dont mean to say charles belsize was in earnest cries the dowager i always thought it was a  it is not from lord highgate maam sir barnes said gloomily it is some time since i have known that he was not in earnest and he knows that i am now  gracious goodness come to blows with him too you have not that would be the very thing to make the world talk says the dowager with some anxiety  no answers barnes he knows well enough that there can be no open rupture we had some words the other day at a dinner he gave at his own house colonel newcome and that young beggar clive and that fool mr hobson were there lord highgate was confoundedly insolent he told me that i did not dare to quarrel with him because of the account he kept at our house i should like to have massacred him she has told him that i struck herthe insolent brutehe says he will tell it at my clubs and threatens personal violence to me there if i do it again lady kew im not safe from that man and that woman cries poor barnes in an agony of terror  fighting is jack belsizes business barnes newcome banking is yours luckily said the dowager as old lord highgate was to die and his eldest son too it is a pity certainly they had not died a year or two earlier and left poor clara and charles to come together you should have married some woman in the serious way my daughter walham could have found you one frank i am told and his wife go on very sweetly together her motherinlaw governs the whole family they have turned the theatre back into a chapel again they have six little ploughboys dressed in surplices to sing the service and frank and the vicar of kewbury play at cricket with them on holidays stay why should not clara go to kewbury  she and her sister have quarrelled about this very affair with lord highgate some time ago it appears they had words about it and when i told kew that bygones had best be bygones that highgate was very sweet upon ethel now and that i did not choose to lose such a good account as his kew was very insolent to me his conduct was blackguardly maam quite blackguardly and you may be sure but for our relationship i would have called him to  here the talk between barnes and his ancestress was interrupted by the appearance of miss ethel newcome taper in hand who descended from the upper regions enveloped in a shawl  how do you do barnes how is clara i long to see my little nephew is he like his pretty papa cries the young lady giving her fair cheek to her brother  scotland has agreed with our newcome rose says barnes gallantly my dear ethel i never saw you in greater beauty  by the light of one bedroom candle what should i be if the whole room were lighted you would see my face then was covered all over with wrinkles and quite pale and woebegone with the dreariness of the scotch journey oh what a time we have spent havent we grandmamma i never wish to go to a great castle again above all i never wish to go to a little shootingbox scotland may be very well for men but for womenallow me to go to paris when next there is talk of a scotch expedition i had rather be in a boardingschool in the champs elysees than in the finest castle in the highlands if it had not been for a blessed quarrel with fanny follington i think i should have died at glen shorthorn have you seen my dear dear uncle the colonel when did he arrive  is he come why is he come asks lady kew  is he come look here grandmamma did you ever see such a darling shawl i found it in a packet in my room  well it is beautiful cries the dowager bending her ancient nose over the web your colonel is a galant homme that must be said of him and in this does not quite take after the rest of the family hum hum is he going away again soon  he has made a fortune a very considerable fortune for a man in that rank in life says sir barnes he cannot have less than sixty thousand pounds  is that much asks ethel  not in england at our rate of interest but his money is in india where he gets a great percentage his income must be five or six thousand pounds maam says barnes turning to lady kew  a few of the indians were in society in my time my dear says lady kew musingly my father has often talked to me about barbell of stanstead and his house in st jamess square the man who ordered more curricles when there were not carriages enough for his guests i was taken to mr hastingss trial it was very stupid and long the young man the painter i suppose will leave his paintpots now and set up as a gentleman i suppose they were very poor or his father would not have put him to such a profession barnes why did you not make him a clerk in the bank and save him from the humiliation  humiliation why he is proud of it my uncle is as proud as a plantagenet though he is as humble asas what give me a simile barnes do you know what my quarrel with fanny follington was about she said we were not descended from the barbersurgeon and laughed at the battle of bosworth she says our greatgrandfather was a weaver was he a weaver  how should i know and what on earth does it matter my child except the gaunts the howards and one or two more there is scarcely any good blood in england you are lucky in sharing some of mine my poor lord kews grandfather was an apothecary at hampton court and founded the family by giving a dose of rhubarb to queen caroline as a rule nobody is of a good family didnt that young man that son of the colonels go about last year how did he get in society where did we meet him oh at baden yes when barnes was courting and my grandsonyes my grandson acted so wickedly here she began to cough and to tremble so that her old stick shook under her hand ring the bell for ross ross i will go to bed go you too ethel you have been travelling enough today  her memory seems to fail her a little ethel whispered to her brother or she will only remember what she wishes dont you see that she has grown very much older  i will be with her in the morning i have business with her said barnes  good night give my love to clara and kiss the little ones for me have you done what you promised me barnes  what  to beto be kind to clara dont say cruel things to her she has a high spirit and she feels them though she says nothing  doesnt she said barnes grimly  ah barnes be gentle with her seldom as i saw you together when i lived with you in the spring i could see that you were harsh though she affected to laugh when she spoke of your conduct to her be kind i am sure it is the best barnes better than all the wit in the world look at grandmamma how witty she was and is what a reputation she had how people were afraid of her and see her nowquite alone  ill see her in the morning quite alone my dear says barnes waving a little gloved hand byebye and his brougham drove away while ethel newcome had been under her brothers roof where i and friend clive and scores of others had been smartly entertained there had been quarrels and recriminations misery and heartburning cruel words and shameful struggles the wretched combatants in which appeared before the world with smiling faces resuming their battle when the feast was concluded and the company gone  on the next morning when barnes came to visit his grandmother miss newcome was gone away to see her sisterinlaw lady kew said with whom she was going to pass the morning so barnes and lady kew had an uninterrupted teteatete in which the former acquainted the old lady with the proposal which colonel newcome had made to him on the previous night  lady kew wondered what the impudence of the worlds would come to an artist propose for ethel one of her footmen might propose next and she supposed barnes would bring the message the father came and proposed for this young painter and you didnt order him out of the room  barnes laughed the colonel is one of my constituents i cant afford to order the bundelcund banking company out of its own room  you did not tell ethel this pretty news i suppose  of course i didnt tell ethel nor did i tell the colonel that ethel was in london he fancies her in scotland with your ladyship at this moment  i wish the colonel were at calcutta and his son with him i wish he was in the ganges i wish he was under juggernauts car cried the old lady how much money has the wretch really got if he is of importance to the bank of course you must keep well with him five thousand a year and he says he will settle it all on his son he must be crazy there is nothing some of these people will not do no sacrifice they will not make to ally themselves with good families certainly you must remain on good terms with him and his bank and we must say nothing of the business to ethel and trot out of town as quickly as we can let me see we go to drummington on saturday this is tuesday barkins you will keep the front drawingroom shutters shut and remember we are not in town unless lady glenlivat or lord farintosh should call  do you think farintosh willwill call maam asked sir barnes demurely  he will be going through to newmarket he has been where we have been at two or three places in scotland replies the lady with equal gravity his poor mother wishes him to give up his bachelors lifeas well she mayfor you young men are terribly dissipated rossmont is quite a regal place his norfolk house is not inferior a young man of that station ought to marry and live at his places and be an example to his people instead of frittering away his time at paris and vienna amongst the most odious company  is he going to drummington asks the grandson  i believe he has been invited we shall go to paris for november he probably will be there answered the dowager casually and tired of the dissipated life he has been leading let us hope he will mend his ways and find a virtuous wellbred young woman to keep him right with this her ladyships apothecary is announced and her banker and grandson takes his leave  sir barnes walked into the city with his umbrella read his letters conferred with his partners and confidential clerks was for a while not the exasperated husband or the affectionate brother or the amiable grandson but the shrewd brisk banker engaged entirely with his business presently he had occasion to go on change or elsewhere to confer with brothercapitalists and in cornhill behold he meets his uncle colonel newcome riding towards the india house a groom behind him  the colonel springs off his horse and barnes greets him in the blandest manner have you any news for me barnes cries the officer  the accounts from calcutta are remarkably good that cotton is of admirable quality really mr briggs of our house who knows cotton as well as any man in england says  its not the cotton my dear sir barnes cries the other  the bills are perfectly good there is no sort of difficulty about them our house will take half a million of em if  you are talking of bills and i am thinking of poor clive the colonel interposes i wish you could give me good news for him barnes  i wish i could i heartily trust that i may some day my good wishes you know are enlisted in your sons behalf cries barnes gallantly droll place to talk sentiment incornhill isnt it but ethel as i told you is in the hands of higher powers and we must conciliate lady kew if we can she has always spoken very highly of clive very  had i not best go to her asks the colonel  into the north my good sir she isahshe is travelling about i think you had best depend upon me good morning in the city we have no hearts you know colonel be sure you shall hear from me as soon as lady kew and ethel come to town  and the banker hurried away shaking his fingertips to his uncle and leaving the good colonel utterly surprised at his statements for the fact is the colonel knew that lady kew was in london having been apprised of the circumstance in the simplest manner in the world namely by a note from miss ethel which billet he had in his pocket whilst he was talking with the head of the house of hobson brothers  my dear uncle the note said how glad i shall be to see you how shall i thank you for the beautiful shawl and the kind kind remembrance of me i found your present yesterday evening on our arrival from the north we are only here en passant and see nobody in queen street but barnes who has just been about business and he does not count you know i shall go and see clara tomorrow and make her take me to see your pretty friend mrs pendennis how glad i should be if you happened to pay mrs p a visit about two goodnight i thank you a thousand times and am always your affectionate e  queen street tuesday night twelve oclock  this note came to colonel newcomes breakfasttable and he smothered the exclamation of wonder which was rising to his lips not choosing to provoke the questions of clive who sate opposite to him clives father was in a woeful perplexity all that forenoon tuesday night twelve oclock thought he why barnes must have gone to his grandmother from my dinnertable and he told me she was out of town and said so again just now when we met in the city the colonel was riding towards richmond at this time what cause had the young man to tell me these lies lady kew may not wish to be at home for me but need barnes newcome say what is untrue to mislead me the fellow actually went away simpering and kissing his hand to me with a falsehood on his lips what a pretty villain a fellow would deserve and has got a horsewhipping for less and to think of a newcome doing this to his own flesh and blood a young judas very sad and bewildered the colonel rode towards richmond where he was to happen to call on mrs pendennis  it was not much of a fib that barnes had told lady kew announcing that she was out of town her grandson no doubt thought himself justified in saying so as any other of her servants would have done but if he had recollected how ethel came down with the colonels shawl on her shoulders how it was possible she might have written to thank her uncle surely barnes newcome would not have pulled that unlucky longbow the banker had other things to think of than ethel and her shawl  when thomas newcome dismounted at the door of honeymoon cottage richmond the temporary residence of a pendennis esq one of the handsomest young women in england ran into the passage with outstretched arms called him her dear old uncle and gave him two kisses that i dare say brought blushes on his lean sunburnt cheeks ethel clung always to his affection she wanted that man rather than any other in the whole world to think well of her when she was with him she was the amiable and simple the loving impetuous creature of old times she chose to think of no other worldliness heartlessness eager scheming cold flirtations marquishunting and the like disappeared for a whileand were not as she sate at that honest mans side o me that we should have to record such charges against ethel newcome  he was come home for good now he would never leave that boy he spoiled so who was a good boy too she wished she could see him oftener at paris at madame de floracsi found out all about madame de florac sir says miss ethel with a laughwe used often to meet there and here sometimes in london but in london it was different you know what peculiar notions some people have and as i live with grandmamma who is most kind to me and my brothers of course i must obey her see her etc etc that the young lady went on talking defending herself whom nobody attacked protesting her dislike to gaiety and dissipationyou would have fancied her an artless young country lass only longing to trip back to her village milk her cows at sunrise and sit spinning of winter evenings by the fire  why do you come and spoil my teteatete with my uncle mr pendennis cries the young lady to the master of the house who happens to enter of all the men in the world the one i like best to talk to does he not look younger than when he went to india when clive marries that pretty little miss mackenzie you will marry again uncle and i will be jealous of your wife  did barnes tell you that we had met last night my dear asks the colonel  not one word your shawl and your dear kind note told me you were come why did not barnes tell us why do you look so grave  he has not told her that i was here and would have me believe her absent thought newcome as his countenance fell shall i give her my own message and plead my poor boys cause with her i know not whether he was about to lay his suit before her he said himself subsequently that his mind was not made up but at this juncture a procession of nurses and babies made their appearance followed by the two mothers who had been comparing their mutual prodigies each lady having her own private opinionlady clara and my wifethe latter for once gracious to lady clara newcome in consideration of the infantine company with which she came to visit mrs pendennis  luncheon was served presently the carriage of the newcomes drove away my wife smilingly pardoning ethel for the assignation which the young person had made at our house and when those ladies were gone our good colonel held a council of war with us his two friends and told us what had happened between him and barnes on that morning and the previous night his offer to sacrifice every shilling of his fortune to young clive seemed to him to be perfectly simple though the recital of the circumstance brought tears into my wifes eyeshe mentioned it by the way and as a matter that was scarcely to call for comment much less praise  barness extraordinary statements respecting lady kews absence puzzled the elder newcome and he spoke of his nephews conduct with much indignation in vain i urged that her ladyship desiring to be considered absent from london her grandson was bound to keep her secret keep her secret yes tell me lies no cries out the colonel sir barness conduct was in fact indefensible though not altogether unusualthe worst deduction to be drawn from it in my opinion was that clives chance with the young lady was but a poor one and that sir barnes newcome inclined to keep his uncle in goodhumour would therefore give him no disagreeable refusal  now this gentleman could no more pardon a lie than he could utter one he would believe all and everything a man told him until deceived once after which he never forgave and wrath being once roused in his simple mind and distrust firmly fixed there his anger and prejudices gathered daily he could see no single good quality in his opponent and hated him with a daily increasing bitterness  as ill luck would have it that very same evening at his return to town thomas newcome entered bayss club of which at our request he had become a member during his last visit to england and there was sir barnes as usual on his way homewards from the city barnes was writing at a table and sealing and closing a letter as he saw the colonel enter he thought he had been a little inattentive and curt with his uncle in the morning had remarked perhaps the expression of disapproval on the colonels countenance he simpered up to his uncle as the latter entered the clubroom and apologised for his haste when they met in the city in the morningall city men were so busy and i have been writing about that little affair just as you came in he said quite a moving letter to lady kew i assure you and i do hope and trust we shall have a favourable answer in a day or two  you said her ladyship was in the north i think said the colonel drily  oh yesin the north atat lord wallsendsgreat coalproprietor you know  and your sister is with her  ethel is always with her  i hope you will send her my very best remembrances said the colonel  ill open the letter and add em in a postscript said barnes  confounded liar cried the colonel mentioning the circumstance to me afterwards why does not somebody pitch him out of the bowwindow  if we were in the secret of sir barnes newcomes correspondence and could but peep into that particular letter to his grandmother i dare say we should read that he had seen the colonel who was very anxious about his darling youths suit but pursuant to lady kews desire barnes had stoutly maintained that her ladyship was still in the north enjoying the genial hospitality of lord wallsend that of course he should say nothing to ethel except with lady kews full permission that he wished her a pleasant trip to  and was etc etc  then if we could follow him we might see him reach his belgravian mansion and fling an angry word to his wife as she sits alone in the darkling drawingroom poring over the embers he will ask her probably with an oath why the  she is not dressed and if she always intends to keep her company waiting an hour hence each with a smirk and the lady in smart raiment with flowers in her hair will be greeting their guests as they arrive then will come dinner and such conversation as it brings then at night sir barnes will issue forth cigar in mouth to return to his own chamber at his own hour to breakfast by himself to go citywards moneygetting he will see his children once a fortnight and exchange a dozen sharp words with his wife twice in that time  more and more sad does the lady clara become from day to day liking more to sit lonely over the fire careless about the sarcasms of her husband the prattle of her children she cries sometimes over the cradle of the young heir she is aweary aweary you understand the man to whom her parents sold her does not make her happy though she has been bought with diamonds two carriages several large footmen a fine countryhouse with delightful gardens and conservatories and with all this she is miserableis it possible     chapter liii in which kinsmen fall out   not the least difficult part of thomas newcomes present business was to keep from his son all knowledge of the negotiation in which he was engaged on clives behalf if my gentle reader has had sentimental disappointments he or she is aware that the friends who have given him most sympathy under these calamities have been persons who have had dismal histories of their own at some time of their lives and i conclude colonel newcome in his early days must have suffered very cruelly in that affair of which we have a slight cognisance or he would not have felt so very much anxiety about clives condition  a few chapters back and we described the first attack and clives manful cure then we had to indicate the young gentlemans relapse and the noisy exclamations of the youth under this second outbreak of fever calling him back after she had dismissed him and finding pretext after pretext to see himwhy did the girl encourage him as she certainly did i allow with mrs grundy and most moralists that miss newcomes conduct in this matter was highly reprehensible that if she did not intend to marry clive she should have broken with himaltogether that a virtuous young woman of high principle etc etc having once determined to reject a suitor should separate from him utterly then and therenever give him again the least chance of a hope or reillume the extinguished fire in the wretchs bosom  but coquetry but kindness but family affection and a strong very strong partiality for the rejected loverare these not to be taken in account and to plead as excuses for her behaviour to her cousin the least unworthy part of her conduct some critics will say was that desire to see clive and be well with him as she felt the greatest regard for him the showing it was not blameable and every flutter which she made to escape out of the meshes which the world had cast about her was but the natural effort at liberty it was her prudence which was wrong and her submission wherein she was most culpable in the early church story do we not read how young martyrs constantly had to disobey worldly papas and mammas who would have had them silent and not utter their dangerous opinions how their parents locked them up kept them on breadandwater whipped and tortured them in order to enforce obediencenevertheless they would declare the truth they would defy the gods by law established and deliver themselves up to the lions or the tormentors are not there heathen idols enshrined among us still does not the world worship them and persecute those who refuse to kneel do not many timid souls sacrifice to them and other bolder spirits rebel and with rage at their hearts bend down their stubborn knees at their altars see i began by siding with mrs grundy and the world and at the next turn of the seesaw have lighted down on ethels side and am disposed to think that the very best part of her conduct has been those escapades whichwhich rightminded persons most justly condemn at least that a young beauty should torture a man with alternate liking and indifference allure dismiss and call him back out of banishment practise arts to please upon him and ignore them when rebuked for her coquetrythese are surely occurrences so common in young womens history as to call for no special censure and if on these charges miss newcome is guilty is she of all her sex alone in her criminality  so ethel and her duenna went away upon their tour of visits to mansions so splendid and among hosts and guests so polite that the present modest historian does not dare to follow them suffice it to say that duke this and earl that were according to their hospitable custom entertaining a brilliant circle of friends at their respective castles all whose names the morning post gave and among them those of the dowager countess of kew and miss newcome  during her absence thomas newcome grimly awaited the result of his application to barnes that baronet showed his uncle a letter or rather a postscript from lady kew which probably had been dictated by barnes himself in which the dowager said she was greatly touched by colonel newcomes noble offer that though she owned she had very different views for her granddaughter miss newcomes choice of course lay with herself meanwhile lady k and ethel were engaged in a round of visits to the country and there would be plenty of time to resume this subject when they came to london for the season and lest dear ethels feelings should be needlessly agitated by a discussion of the subject and the colonel should take a fancy to write to her privately lady kew gave orders that all letters from london should be despatched under cover to her ladyship and carefully examined the contents of the packet before ethel received her share of the correspondence  to write to her personally on the subject of the marriage thomas newcome had determined was not a proper course for him to pursue they consider themselves says he above us forsooth in their rank of life oh mercy what pigmies we are and dont angels weep at the brief authority in which we dress ourselves up and of course the approaches on our side must be made in regular form and the parents of the young people must act for them clive is too honourable a man to wish to conduct the affair in any other way he might try the influence of his beaux yeux and run off to gretna with a girl who had nothing but the young lady being wealthy and his relation sir we must be on the point of honour and all the kews in christendom shant have more pride than we in this matter  all this time we are keeping mr clive purposely in the background his face is so woebegone that we do not care to bring it forward in the family picture his case is so common that surely its lugubrious symptoms need not be described at length he works away fiercely at his pictures and in spite of himself improves in his art he sent a combat of cavalry and a picture of sir brian the templar carrying off rebecca to the british institution this year both of which pieces were praised in other journals besides the pall mall gazette he did not care for the newspaper praises he was rather surprised when a dealer purchased his sir brian the templar he came and went from our house a melancholy swain he was thankful for lauras kindness and pity j js studio was his principal resort and i dare say as he set up his own easel there and worked by his friends side he bemoaned his lot to his sympathising friend  sir barnes newcomes family was absent from london during the winter his mother and his brothers and sisters his wife and his two children were gone to newcome for christmas some six weeks after seeing him ethel wrote her uncle a kind merry letter they had been performing private theatricals at the countryhouse where she and lady kew were staying captain crackthorpe made an admirable jeremy diddler in raising the wind lord farintosh broke down lamentably as fusbos in bombastes furioso miss ethel had distinguished herself in both of these facetious little comedies i should like clive to paint me as miss plainways she wrote i wore a powdered front painted my face all over wrinkles imitated old lady griffin as well as i could and looked sixty at least  thomas newcome wrote an answer to his fair nieces pleasant letter clive he said would be happy to bargain to paint her and nobody else but her all the days of his life and the colonel was sure would admire her at sixty as much as he did now when she was forty years younger but determined on maintaining his appointed line of conduct respecting miss newcome he carried his letter to sir barnes and desired him to forward it to his sister sir barnes took the note and promised to despatch it the communications between him and his uncle had been very brief and cold since the telling of these little fibs concerning old lady kews visits to london which the baronet dismissed from his mind as soon as they were spoken and which the good colonel never could forgive barnes asked his uncle to dinner once or twice but the colonel was engaged how was barnes to know the reason of the elders refusal a london man a banker and a member of parliament has a thousand things to think of and no time to wonder that friends refuse his invitations to dinner barnes continued to grin and smile most affectionately when he met the colonel to press his hand to congratulate him on the last accounts from india unconscious of the scorn and distrust with which his senior mentally regarded him old boy is doubtful about the young cubs loveaffair the baronet may have thought well ease his old mind on that point some time hence no doubt barnes thought he was conducting the business very smartly and diplomatically  i heard myself news at this period from the gallant crackthorpe which being interested in my young friends happiness filled me with some dismay our friend the painter and glazier has been hankering about our barracks at knightsbridge the noble life guards green had now pitched their tents in that suburb and pumping me about la belle cousin i dont like to break it to himi dont really now but its all up with his chance i think those private theatricals at fallowfield have done farintoshs business he used to rave about the newcomes to me as we were riding home from hunting he gave bob henchman the lie who told a story which bob got from his man who had it from miss newcomes ladysmaid aboutabout some journey to brighton which the cousins took here mr crackthorpe grinned most facetiously farintosh swore hed knock henchman down and vows he will be the death ofwill murder our friend clive when he comes to town as for henchman he was in a desperate way he lives on the marquis you know and farintoshs anger or his marriage will be the loss of free quarters and ever so many good dinners a year to him i did not deem it necessary to impart crackthorpes story to clive or explain to him the reason why lord farintosh scowled most fiercely upon the young painter and passed him without any other sign of recognition one day as clive and i were walking together in pall mall if my lord wanted a quarrel young clive was not a man to balk him and would have been a very fierce customer to deal with in his actual state of mind  a pauper child in london at seven years old knows how to go to market to fetch the beer to pawn fathers coat to choose the largest fried fish or the nicest hambone to nurse mary jane of threeto conduct a hundred operations of trade or housekeeping which a little belgravian does not perhaps acquire in all the days of her life poverty and necessity force this precociousness on the poor little brat there are children who are accomplished shoplifters and liars almost as soon as they can toddle and speak i dare say little princes know the laws of etiquette as regards themselves and the respect due to their rank at a very early period of their royal existence every one of us according to his degree can point to the princekins of private life who are flattered and worshipped and whose little shoes grown men kiss as soon almost as they walk upon ground  it is a wonder what human nature will support and that considering the amount of flattery some people are crammed with from their cradles they do not grow worse and more selfish than they are our poor little pauper just mentioned is dosed with daffys elixir and somehow survives the drug princekin or lordkin from his earliest days has nurses dependants governesses little friends schoolfellows schoolmasters fellowcollegians college tutors stewards and valets led captains of his suite and women innumerable flattering him and doing him honour the tradesmans manner which to you and me is decently respectful becomes straightway frantically servile before princekin honest folks at railway stations whisper to their families thats the marquis of farintosh and look hard at him as he passes landlords cry this way my lord this room for your lordship they say at public schools princekin is taught the beauties of equality and thrashed into some kind of subordination psha toadeaters in pinafores surround princekin do not respectable people send their children so as to be at the same school with him dont they follow him to college and eat his toads through life  and as for womenoh my dear friends and brethren in this vale of tearsdid you ever see anything so curious monstrous and amazing as the way in which women court princekin when he is marriageable and pursue him with their daughters who was the british nobleman in old old days who brought his three daughters to the king of mercia that his majesty might choose one after inspection mercia was but a petty province and its king in fact a princekin ever since those extremely ancient and venerable times the custom exists not only in mercia but in all the rest of the provinces inhabited by the angles and before princekins the daughters of our nobles are trotted out  there was no day of his life which our young acquaintance the marquis of farintosh could remember on which he had not been flattered and no society which did not pay him court at a private school he could recollect the masters wife stroking his pretty curls and treating him furtively to goodies at college he had the tutor simpering and bowing as he swaggered over the grassplat old men at clubs would make way for him and fawn on himnot your mere piqueassiettes and penniless parasites but most respectable toadeaters fathers of honest families gentlemen themselves of good station who respected this young gentleman as one of the institutions of their country and the admired wisdom of the nation that set him to legislate over us when lord farintosh walked the streets at night he felt himself like haroun alraschidthat is he would have felt so had he ever heard of the arabian potentatea monarch in disguise affably observing and promenading the city and let us be sure there was a mesrour in his train to knock at the doors for him and run the errands of this young caliph of course he met with scores of men in life who neither flattered him nor would suffer his airs but he did not like the company of such or for the sake of truth undergo the ordeal of being laughed at he preferred toadies generally speaking i like says he you know those fellows who are always saying pleasant things you know and who would run from here to hammersmith if i asked emmuch better than those fellows who are always making fun of me you know a man of his station who likes flatterers need not shut himself up he can get plenty of society  as for women it was his lordships opinion that every daughter of eve was bent on marrying him a scotch marquis an english earl of the best blood in the empire with a handsome person and a fortune of fifteen thousand a year how could the poor creatures do otherwise than long for him he blandly received their caresses took their coaxing and cajolery as matters of course and surveyed the beauties of his time as the caliph the moonfaces of his harem my lord intended to marry certainly he did not care for money nor for rank he expected consummate beauty and talent and some day would fling his handkerchief to the possessor of these and place her by his side upon the farintosh throne  at this time there were but two or three young ladies in society endowed with the necessary qualifications or who found favour in his eyes his lordship hesitated in his selection from these beauties he was not in a hurry he was not angry at the notion that lady kew and miss newcome with her hunted him what else should they do but pursue an object so charming everybody hunted him the other young ladies whom we need not mention languished after him still more longingly he had little notes from these presents of purses worked by them and cigarcases embroidered with his coronet they sang to him in cosy boudoirsmamma went out of the room and sister ann forgot something in the drawingroom they ogled him as they sang trembling they gave him a little foot to mount them that they might ride on horseback with him they tripped along by his side from the hall to the pretty country church on sundays they warbled hymns sweetly looking at him the while mamma whispered confidentially to him what an angel cecilia is and so forth and so forthwith which chaff our noble bird was by no means to be caught when he had made up his great mind that the time was come and the woman he was ready to give a marchioness of farintosh to the english nation   miss newcome has been compared ere this to the statue of huntress diana at the louvre whose haughty figure and beauty the young lady indeed somewhat resembled i was not present when diana and dianas grandmother hunted the noble scottish stag of whom we have just been writing nor care to know how many times lord farintosh escaped and how at last he was brought to bay and taken by his resolute pursuers paris it appears was the scene of his fall and capture the news was no doubt well known amongst lord farintoshs brotherdandies among exasperated matrons and virgins in mayfair and in polite society generally before it came to simple tom newcome and his son not a word on the subject had sir barnes mentioned to the colonel perhaps not choosing to speak till the intelligence was authenticated perhaps not wishing to be the bearer of tidings so painful  though the colonel may have read in his pall mall gazette a paragraph which announced an approaching marriage in high life between a noble young marquis and an accomplished and beautiful young lady daughter and sister of a northern baronet he did not know who were the fashionable persons about to be made happy nor until he received a letter from an old friend who lived at paris was the fact conveyed to him here is the letter preserved by him along with all that he ever received from the same hand  rue st dominique st germain  paris 10 fev  so behold you of return my friend you quit for

care to be there bring him to paris to make the court to my little antoinette bring him to paris to his good friend comtesse de florac  i read marvels of his works in an english journal which one sends me   clive was not by when this letter reached his father clive was in his paintingroom and lest he should meet his son and in order to devise the best means of breaking the news to the lad thomas newcome retreated out of doors and from the oriental he crossed oxford street and from oxford street he stalked over the roomy pavements of gloucester place and there he bethought him how he had neglected mrs hobson newcome of late and the interesting family of bryanstone square so he went to leave his card at marias door her daughters as we have said are quite grown girls if they have been lectured and learning and backboarded and practising and using the globes and laying in a store of ologies ever since what a deal they must know colonel newcome was admitted to see his nieces and consummate virtue their parent maria was charmed to see her brotherinlaw she greeted him with reproachful tenderness why why her fine eyes seemed to say have you so long neglected us do you think because i am wise and gifted and good and you are it must be confessed a poor creature with no education i am not also affable come let the prodigal be welcomed by his virtuous relatives come and lunch with us colonel he sate down accordingly to the family tiffin  when the meal was over the mother who had matter of importance to impart to him besought him to go to the drawingroom and there poured out such a eulogy upon her childrens qualities as fond mothers know how to utter they knew this and they knew that they were instructed by the most eminent professors that wretched frenchwoman whom you may remember here mademoiselle lenoir maria remarked parenthetically turned out oh frightfully she taught the girls the worst accent it appears her father was not a colonel he wasoh never mind it is a mercy i got rid of that fiendish woman and before my precious ones knew what she was and then followed details of the perfections of the two girls with occasional sideshots at lady annes family just as in the old time why dont you bring your boy whom i have always loved as a son and who avoids me why does not clive know his cousins they are very different from others of his kinswomen who think best of the heartless world  i fear maria there is too much truth in what you say sighs the colonel drumming on a book on the drawingroom table and looking down sees it is a great large square gilt peerage open at farintosh marquis offergus angus malcolm mungo roy marquis of farintosh earl of glenlivat in the peerage of scotland also earl of rossmont in that of the united kingdom son of angus fergus malcolm earl of glenlivat and grandson and heir of malcolm mungo angus first marquis of farintosh and twentyfifth earl etc etc  you have heard the news regarding ethel remarks hobson  i have just heard says the poor colonel  i have a letter from anne this morning maria continues they are of course delighted with the match lord farintosh is wealthy handsome has been a little wild i hear is not such a husband as i would choose for my darlings but poor brians family have been educated to love the world and ethel no doubt is flattered by the prospects before her i have heard that some one else was a little epris in that quarter how does clive bear the news my dear colonel  he has long expected it says the colonel rising and i left him very cheerful at breakfast this morning  send him to see us the naughty boy cries maria we dont change we remember old times to us he will ever be welcome and with this confirmation of madame de floracs news thomas newcome walked sadly homewards  and now thomas newcome had to break the news to his son who received the shot in such a way as caused his friends and confidants to admire his high spirit he said he had long been expecting some such announcement it was many months since ethel had prepared him for it under her peculiar circumstances he did not see how she could act otherwise than she had done and he narrated to the colonel the substance of the conversation which the two young people had had together several months before in madame de floracs garden  clives father did not tell his son of his own bootless negotiation with barnes newcome there was no need to recall that now but the colonels wrath against his nephew exploded in conversation with me who was the confidant of father and son in this business ever since that luckless day when barnes thought proper toto give a wrong address for lady kew thomas newcomes anger had been growing he smothered it yet for a while sent a letter to lady anne newcome briefly congratulating her on the choice which he had heard miss newcome had made and in acknowledgment of madame de floracs more sentimental epistle he wrote a reply which has not been preserved but in which he bade her rebuke miss newcome for not having answered him when he wrote to her and not having acquainted her old uncle with her projected union  to this message ethel wrote back a brief hurried reply it said  i saw madame de florac last night at her daughters reception and she gave me my dear uncles messages yes the news is true which you have heard from madame de florac and in bryanstone square i did not like to write it to you because i know one whom i regard as a brother and a great great deal better and to whom i know it will give pain he knows that i have done my duty and why i have acted as i have done god bless him and his dear father  what is this about a letter which i never answered grandmamma knows nothing about a letter mamma has enclosed to me that which you wrote to her but there has been no letter from t n to his sincere and affectionate e n  rue de rivoli friday   this was too much and the cup of thomas newcomes wrath overflowed barnes had lied about ethels visit to london barnes had lied in saying that he delivered the message with which his uncle charged him barnes had lied about the letter which he had received and never sent with these accusations firmly proven in his mind against his nephew the colonel went down to confront that sinner  wherever he should find barnes thomas newcome was determined to tell him his mind should they meet on the steps of a church on the flags of change or in the newspaperroom at bayss at eveningpaper time when men most do congregate thomas the colonel was determined upon exposing and chastising his fathers grandson with ethels letter in his pocket he took his way into the city penetrated into the unsuspecting backparlour of hobsons bank and was disappointed at first at only finding his halfbrother hobson there engaged over his newspaper the colonel signified his wish to see sir barnes newcome sir barnes was not come in yet youve heard about the marriage says hobson great news for the barness aint it the head of the house is as proud as a peacock about it said he was going out to samuels the diamond merchants going to make his sister some uncommon fine present jolly to be uncle to a marquis aint it colonel ill have nothing under a duke for my girls i say i know whose nose is out of joint but young fellows get over these things and clive wont die this time i dare say  while hobson newcome made these satiric and facetious remarks his halfbrother paced up and down the glass parlour scowling over the panes into the bank where the busy young clerks sate before their ledgers at last he gave an ah as of satisfaction indeed he had seen sir barnes newcome enter into the bank  the baronet stopped and spoke with a clerk and presently entered followed by that young gentleman into his private parlour barnes tried to grin when he saw his uncle and held out his hand to greet the colonel but the colonel put both his behind his backthat which carried his faithful bamboo cane shook nervously barnes was aware that the colonel had the news i was going toto write to you this morning withwith some intelligence that i amveryvery sorry to give  this young gentleman is one of your clerks asked thomas newcome blandly  yes mr boltby who has your private account this is colonel newcome mr boltby says sir barnes in some wonder  mr boltby brother hobson you heard what sir barnes newcome said just now respecting certain intelligence which he grieved to give me  at this the three other gentlemen respectively wore looks of amazement  allow me to say in your presence that i dont believe one single word sir barnes newcome says when he tells me that he is very sorry for some intelligence he has to communicate he lies mr boltby he is very glad i made up my mind that in whatsoever company i met him and on the very first day i found himhold your tongue sir you shall speak afterwards and tell more lies when i have donei made up my mind i say that on the very first occasion i would tell sir barnes newcome that he was a liar and a cheat he takes charge of letters and keeps them back did you break the seal sir there was nothing to steal in my letter to miss newcome he tells me people are out of town when he goes to see in the next street after leaving my table and whom i see myself half an hour before he lies to me about their absence  dn you go out and dont stand staring there you booby screams out sir barnes to the clerk stop boltby colonel newcome unless you leave this room i shalli shall  you shall call a policeman send for the gentleman and i will tell the lord mayor what i think of sir barnes newcome baronet mr boltby shall we have the constable in  sir you are an old man and my fathers brother or you know very well i would  you would what sir upon my word barnes newcome here the colonels two hands and the bamboo cane came from the rear and formed in front but that you are my fathers grandson after a menace like that i would take you out and cane you in the presence of your clerks i repeat sir that i consider you guilty of treachery falsehood and knavery and if i ever see you at bayss club i will make the same statement to your acquaintance at the west end of the town a man of your baseness ought to be known sir and it shall be my business to make men of honour aware of your character mr boltby will you have the kindness to make out my account sir barnes newcome for fear of consequences that i should deplore i recommend you to keep a wide berth of me sir and the colonel twirled his mustachios and waved his cane in an ominous manner and barnes started back spontaneously out of its dangerous circle  what mr boltbys sentiments may have been regarding this extraordinary scene in which his principal cut so sorry a figurewhether he narrated the conversation to other gentlemen connected with the establishment of hobson brothers or prudently kept it to himself i cannot say having no means of pursuing mr bs subsequent career he speedily quitted his desk at hobson brothers and let us presume that barnes thought mr b had old all the other clerks of the avuncular quarrel that conviction will make us imagine barnes still more comfortable hobson newcome no doubt was rejoiced at barness discomfiture he had been insolent and domineering beyond measure of late to his vulgar goodnatured uncle whereas after the above interview with the colonel he became very humble and quiet in his demeanour and for a long long time never said a rude word nay i fear hobson must have carried an account of the transaction to mrs hobson and the circle in bryanstone square for sam newcome now entered at cambridge called the baronet barnes quite familiarly asked after clara and ethel and requested a small loan of barnes  of course the story did not get wind at bayss of course tom eaves did not know all about it and say that sir barnes had been beaten blackandblue having been treated very ill by the committee in a complaint which he made about the club cookery sir barnes newcome never came to bayss and at the end of the year took off his name from the lists of the club  sir barnes though a little taken aback in the morning and not ready with an impromptu reply to the colonel and his cane could not allow the occurrence to pass without a protest and indited a letter which thomas newcome kept along with some others previously quoted by the compiler of the present memoirs  it is as follows   belgrave st feb 15 18  colonel newcome cb private  sirthe incredible insolence and violence of your behaviour today inspired by whatever causes or mistakes of your own cannot be passed without some comment on my part i laid before a friend of your own profession a statement of the words which you applied to me in the presence of my partner and one of my clerks this morning and my adviser is of opinion that considering the relationship unhappily subsisting between us i can take no notice of insults for which you knew when you uttered them i could not call you to account  there is some truth in that said the colonel he couldnt fight you know but then he was such a liar i could not help speaking my mind  i gathered from the brutal language which you thought fit to employ towards a disarmed man the ground of one of your monstrous accusations against me that i deceived you in stating that my relative lady kew was in the country when in fact she was at her house in london  to this absurd charge i at once plead guilty the venerable lady in question was passing through london where she desired to be free from intrusion at her ladyships wish i stated that she was out of town and would under the same circumstances unhesitatingly make the same statement your slight acquaintance with the person in question did not warrant that you should force yourself on her privacy as you would doubtless know were you more familiar with the customs of the society in which she moves  i declare upon my honour as a gentleman that i gave her the message which i promised to deliver from you and also that i transmitted a letter with which you entrusted me and repel with scorn and indignation the charges which you were pleased to bring against me as i treat with contempt the language and the threats which you thought fit to employ  our books show the amount of xl xs xd to your credit which you will be good enough to withdraw at your earliest convenience as of course all intercourse must cease henceforth between you andyours etc  b newcome newcome   i think sir he doesnt make out a bad case mr pendennis remarked to the colonel who showed him this majestic letter  it would be a good case if i believed a single word of it arthur replied my friend placidly twirling the old grey moustache if you were to say soandso and say that i had brought false charges against you i should cry mea culpa and apologise with all my heart but as i have a perfect conviction that every word this fellow says is a lie what is the use of arguing any more about the matter i would not believe him if he brought twenty as witnesses and if he lied till he was black in the other liars face give me the walnuts i wonder who sir barness military friend was  barness military friend was our gallant acquaintance general sir george tufto kcb who a short while afterwards talked over the quarrel with the colonel and manfully told him that in sir georges opinion he was wrong the little beggar behaved very well i thought in the first business you bullied him so and in the front of his regiment too that it was almost past bearing and when he deplored with tears in his eyes almost the little humbug that his relationship prevented him calling you out ecod i believed him it was in the second affair that poor little barnes showed he was a cocktail  what second affair asked thomas newcome  dont you know he he this is famous cries sir george why sir two days after your business he comes to me with another letter and a face as long as my mares by jove and that letter newcome was from your young un stop here it is and from his padded bosom general sir george tufto drew a pocketbook and from the pocketbook a copy of a letter inscribed clive newcome esq to sir b n newcome theres no mistake about your fellow colonel nohim and the man of war fired a volley of oaths as a salute to clive  and the colonel on horseback riding by the other cavalry officers side read as follows   george street hanover square february 16  sircolonel newcome this morning showed me a letter bearing your signature in which you state1 that colonel newcome has uttered calumnious and insolent charges against you 2 that colonel newcome so spoke knowing that you could take no notice of his charges of falsehood and treachery on account of the relationship subsisting between you  your statements would evidently imply that colonel newcome has been guilty of ungentlemanlike conduct and of cowardice towards you  as there can be no reason why we should not meet in any manner that you desire i here beg leave to state on my own part that i fully coincide with colonel newcome in his opinion that you have been guilty of falsehood and treachery and that the charge of cowardice which you dare to make against a gentleman of his tried honour and courage is another wilful and cowardly falsehood on your part  and i hope you will refer the bearer of this note my friend mr george warrington of the upper temple to the military gentleman whom you consulted in respect to the just charges of colonel newcome waiting a prompt reply believe me siryour obedient servant clive newcome  sir barnes newcome newcome bart m p etc   what a blunderhead i am cries the colonel with delight on his countenance spite of his professed repentance it never once entered my head that the youngster would take any part in the affair i showed him his cousins letter casually just to amuse him i think for he has been deuced low lately aboutabout a young mans scrape that he has got into and he must have gone off and despatched his challenge straightway i recollect he appeared uncommonly brisk at breakfast the next morning and so you say general the baronet did not like the poulet  by no means never saw a fellow show such a confounded white feather at first i congratulated him thinking your boys offer must please him as it would have pleased any fellow in our time to have a shot dammy but i was mistaken in my man he entered into some confounded longwinded story about a marriage you wanted to make with that infernal pretty sister of his who is going to marry young farintosh and how you were in a rage because the scheme fell to the ground and how a family duel might occasion unpleasantries to miss newcome though i showed him how this could be most easily avoided and that the ladys name need never appear in the transaction confound it sir barnes says i i recollect this boy when he was a youngster throwing a glass of wine in your face well put it upon that and say its an old feud between you he turned quite pale and he said your fellow had apologised for the glass of wine  yes said the colonel sadly my boy apologised for the glass of wine it is curious how we have disliked that barnes ever since we set eyes on him  well newcome sir george resumed as his mettled charger suddenly jumped and curvetted displaying the padded warriors cavalryseat to perfection quiet old ladyeasy my dear well when i found the little beggar turning tail in this way i said to him dash me sir if you dont want me why the dash do you send for me dash me yesterday you talked as if you would bite the colonels head off and today when his son offers you every accommodation by dash sir youre afraid to meet him its my belief you had better send for a policeman a 22 is your man sir barnes newcome and with that i turned on my heel and left him and the fellow went off to newcome that very night  a poor devil cant command courage general said the colonel quite peaceably any more than he can make himself six feet high  then why the dash did the beggar send for me called out general sir george tufto in a loud and resolute voice and presently the two officers parted company  when the colonel reached home mr warrington and mr pendennis happened to be on a visit to clive and all three were in the young fellows paintingroom we knew our lad was unhappy and did our little best to amuse and console him the colonel came in it was in the dark february days we lighted the gas in the studio clive had made a sketch from some favourite verses of mine and georges those charming lines of scotts      he turned his charger as he spake        beside the river shore      he gave his bridlerein a shake        with adieu for evermore                        my dear      adieu for evermore  thomas newcome held up a finger at warrington and he came up to the picture and looked at it and george and i trolled out      adieu for evermore                 my dear      adieu for evermore  from the picture the brave old colonel turned to the painter regarding his son with a look of beautiful inexpressible affection and he laid his hand on his sons shoulder and smiled and stroked clives yellow moustache  andand did barnes send no answer to that letter you wrote him he said slowly  clive broke out into a laugh that was almost a sob he took both his fathers hands my dear dear old father says he what awhat anoldtrump you are my eyes were so dim i could hardly see the two men as they embraced     chapter liv has a tragical ending   clive presently answered the question which his father put to him in the last chapter by producing from the ledge of his easel a crumpled paper full of cavendish now but on which was written sir barnes newcomes reply to his cousins polite invitation sir barnes newcome wrote that he thought a reference to a friend was quite unnecessary in the most disagreeable and painful dispute in which mr clive desired to interfere as a principal that the reasons which prevented sir barnes from taking notice of colonel newcomes shameful and ungentlemanlike conduct applied equally as mr clive newcome very well knew to himself that if further insult was offered or outrage attempted sir barnes should resort to the police for protection that he was about to quit london and certainly should not delay his departure on account of mr clive newcomes monstrous proceedings and that he desired to take leave of an odious subject as of an individual whom he had striven to treat with kindness but from whom from youth upwards sir barnes newcome had received nothing but insolence enmity and illwill  he is an ill man to offend remarked mr pendennis i dont think he has ever forgiven that claret clive  pooh the feud dates from long before that said clive barnes wanted to lick me when i was a boy and i declined in fact i think he had rather the worst of it but then i operated freely on his shins and that wasnt fair in war you know  heaven forgive me cries the colonel i have always felt the fellow was my enemy and my mind is relieved now war is declared it has been a kind of hypocrisy with me to shake his hand and eat his dinner when i trusted him it was against my better instinct and i have been struggling against it these ten years thinking it was a wicked prejudice and ought to be overcome  why should we overcome such instincts asks mr warrington why shouldnt we hate what is hateful in people and scorn what is mean from what friend pen has described to me and from some other accounts which have come to my ears your respectable nephew is about as loathsome a little villain as crawls on the earth good seems to be out of his sphere and away from his contemplation he illtreats every one he comes near or if gentle to them it is that they may serve some base purpose since my attention has been drawn to the creature i have been contemplating his ways with wonder and curiosity how much superior natures rogues are pen to the villains you novelists put into your books this man goes about his life business with a natural propensity to darkness and evilas a bug crawls and stings and stinks i dont suppose the fellow feels any more remorse than a cat that runs away with a muttonchop i recognise the evil spirit sir and do honour to ahrimanes in taking off my hat to this young man he seduced a poor girl in his fathers country townis it not natural deserted her and her childrendont you recognise the beast married for rankcould you expect otherwise from him invites my lord highgate to his house in consideration of his balance at the banksir unless somebodys heel shall crunch him on the way there is no height to which this aspiring vermin maynt crawl i look to see sir barnes newcome prosper more and more i make no doubt he will die an immense capitalist and an exalted peer of this realm he will have a marble monument and a pathetic funeral sermon there is a divine in your family clive that shall preach it i will weep respectful tears over the grave of baron newcome viscount newcome earl newcome and the children whom he has deserted and who in the course of time will be sent by a grateful nation to new south wales will proudly say to their brother convictsyes the earl was our honoured father  i fear he is no better than he should be mr warrington says the colonel shaking his head i never heard the story about the deserted children  how should you o you guileless man cries warrington  i am not in the ways of scandalhearing myself much but this tale i had from sir barnes newcomes own country mr batters of the newcome independent is my esteemed client i write leading articles for his newspaper and when he was in town last spring he favoured me with the anecdote and proposed to amuse the member for newcome by publishing it in his journal this kind of writing is not much in my line and out of respect to you and your young one i believei strove with mr batters andentreated him and prevailed with him not to publish the story that is how i came to know it  i sate with the colonel in the evening when he commented on warringtons story and sir barness adventures in his simple way he said his brother hobson had been with him the morning after the dispute reiterating barness defence of his conduct and professing on his own part nothing but goodwill towards his brother between ourselves the young baronet carries matters with rather a high hand sometimes and i am not sorry that you gave him a little dressing but you were too hard upon him colonelreally you were had i known that childdeserting story i would have given it harder still sir says thomas newcome twirling his mustachios but my brother had nothing to do with the quarrel and very rightly did not wish to engage in it he has an eye to business has master hobson too my friend continued for he brought me a cheque for my private account which of course he said could not remain after my quarrel with barnes but the indian bank account which is pretty large he supposed need not be taken away and indeed why should it so that which is little business of mine remains where it was and brother hobson and i remain perfectly good friends  i think clive is much better since he has been quite put out of his suspense he speaks with a great deal more kindness and goodnature about the marriage than i am disposed to feel regarding it and depend on it has too high a spirit to show that he is beaten but i know he is a good deal cut up though he says nothing and he agreed willingly enough to take a little journey arthur and be out of the way when this business takes place we shall go to paris i dont know where else besides these misfortunes do good in one way hard as they are to bear they unite people who love each other it seems to me my boy has been nearer to me and likes his old father better than he has done of late and very soon after this talk our friends departed  the crimean minister having been recalled and lady anne newcomes house in park lane being vacant her ladyship and her family came to occupy the mansion for this eventful season and sate once more in the dismal diningroom under the picture of the defunct sir brian a little of the splendour and hospitality of old days was revived in the house entertainments were given by lady anne and amongst other festivities a fine ball took place when pretty miss alice miss ethels younger sister made her first appearance in the world to which she was afterwards to be presented by the marchioness of farintosh all the little sisters were charmed no doubt that the beautiful ethel was to become a beautiful marchioness who as they came up to womanhood one after another would introduce them severally to amiable young earls dukes and marquises when they would be married off and wear coronets and diamonds of their own right at lady annes ball i saw my acquaintance young mumford who was going to oxford next october and about to leave rugby where he was at the head of the school looking very dismal as miss alice whirled round the room dancing in viscount bustingtons armsmiss alice with whose mamma he used to take tea at rugby and for whose pretty sake mumford did alfred newcomes verses for him and let him off his thrashings poor mumford he dismally went about under the protection of young alfred a fourthform boynot one soul did he know in that rattling london ballroom his young faceas white as the large white tie donned two hours since at the tavistock with such nervousness and beating of heart  with these lads and decorated with a tie equally splendid moved about young sam newcome who was shirking from his sister and his mamma mrs hobson had actually assumed clean gloves for this festive occasion sam stared at all the nobs and insisted upon being introduced to farintosh and congratulated his lordship with much graceful ease and then pushed about the rooms perseveringly hanging on to alfreds jacket i say i wish you wouldnt call me al i heard mr alfred say to his cousin seeing my face mr samuel ran up to claim acquaintance he was good enough to say he thought farintosh seemed devilish haughty even my wife could not help saying that mr sam was an odious little creature  so it was for young alfred and his brothers and sisters who would want help and protection in the world that ethel was about to give up her independence her inclination perhaps and to bestow her life on yonder young nobleman looking at her as a girl devoting herself to her family her sacrifice gave her a melancholy interest in our eyes my wife and i watched her grave and beautiful moving through the rooms receiving and returning a hundred greetings bending to compliments talking with this friend and that with my lords lordly relations with himself to whom she listened deferentially faintly smiling as he spoke now and again doing the honours of her mothers house lady after lady of his lordships clan and kinsfolk complimented the girl and her pleased mother old lady kew was radiant if one can call radiance the glances of those darkling old eyes she sate in a little room apart and thither people went to pay their court to her unwillingly i came in on this levee with my wife on my arm lady kew scowled at me over her crutch but without a sign of recognition what an awful countenance that old woman has laura whispered as we retreated out of that gloomy presence  and doubt as its wont is whispered too a question in my ear is it for her brothers and sisters only that miss ethel is sacrificing herself is it not for the coronet and the triumph and the fine houses when two motives may actuate a friend we surely may try and believe in the good one says laura but but i am glad clive does not marry herpoor fellowhe would not have been happy with her she belongs to this great world she has spent all her life in it clive would have entered into it very likely in her train and you know sir it is not good that we should be our husbands superiors adds mrs laura with a curtsey  she presently pronounced that the air was very hot in the rooms and in fact wanted to go home to see her child as we passed out we saw sir barnes newcome eagerly smiling smirking bowing and in the fondest conversation with his sister and lord farintosh by sir barnes presently brushed lieutenantgeneral sir george tufto kcb who when he saw on whose foot he had trodden grunted out hm beg your pardon and turning his back on barnes forthwith began complimenting ethel and the marquis served with your lordships father in spain glad to make your lordships acquaintance says sir george ethel bows to us as we pass out of the rooms and we hear no more of sir georges conversation  in the cloakroom sits lady clara newcome with a gentleman bending over her just in such an attitude as the bride is in hogarths marriage a la mode as the counsellor talks to her lady clara starts up as a crowd of blushes come into her wan face and tries to smile and rises to greet my wife and says something about its being so dreadfully hot in the upper rooms and so very tedious waiting for the carriages the gentleman advances towards me with a military stride and says how do you do mr pendennis hows our young friend the painter i answer lord highgate civilly enough whereas my wife will scarce speak a word in reply to lady clara newcome  lady clara asked us to her ball which my wife declined altogether to attend sir barnes published a series of quite splendid entertainments on the happy occasion of his sisters betrothal we read the names of all the clan farintosh in the morning post as attending these banquets mr and mrs hobson newcome in bryanstone square gave also signs of rejoicing at their nieces marriage they had a grand banquet followed by a tea to which latter amusement the present biographer was invited lady anne and lady kew and her granddaughter and the baronet and his wife and my lord highgate and sir george tufto attended the dinner but it was rather a damp entertainment farintosh whispers sam newcome sent word just before dinner that he had a sore throat and barnes was as sulky as possible sir george wouldnt speak to him and the dowager wouldnt speak to lord highgate scarcely anything was drank concluded mr sam with a slight hiccup i say pendennis how sold clive will be and the amiable youth went off to commune with others of his parents guests  thus the newcomes entertained the farintoshes and the farintoshes entertained the newcomes and the dowager countess of kew went from assembly to assembly every evening and to jewellers and upholsterers and dressmakers every morning and lord farintoshs townhouse was splendidly redecorated in the newest fashion and he seemed to grow more and more attentive as the happy day approached and he gave away all his cigars to his brother rob and his sisters were delighted with ethel and constantly in her company and his mother was pleased with her and thought a girl of her spirit and resolution would make a good wife for her son and select crowds flocked to see the service of plate at handymans and the diamonds which were being set for the lady and smee ra painted her portrait as a souvenir for mamma when miss newcome should be miss newcome no more and lady kew made a will leaving all she could leave to her beloved granddaughter ethel daughter of the late sir brian newcome baronet and lord kew wrote an affectionate letter to his cousin congratulating her and wishing her happiness with all his heart and i was glancing over the times newspaper at breakfast one morning when i laid it down with an exclamation which caused my wife to start with surprise  what is it cries laura and i read as follows  death of the countess dowager of kewwe regret to have to announce the awfully sudden death of this venerable lady her ladyship who had been at several parties of the nobility the night before last seemingly in perfect health was seized with a fit as she was waiting for her carriage and about to quit lady pallgraves assembly immediate medical assistance was procured and her ladyship was carried to her own house in queen street mayfair but she never rallied or we believe spoke after the first fatal seizure and sank at eleven oclock last evening the deceased louisa joanna gaunt widow of frederic first earl of kew was daughter of charles earl of gaunt and sister of the late and aunt of the present marquis of steyne the present earl of kew is her ladyships grandson his lordships father lord walham having died before his own father the first earl many noble families are placed in mourning by this sad event society has to deplore the death of a lady who has been its ornament for more than half a century and who was known we may say throughout europe for her remarkable sense extraordinary memory and brilliant wit     chapter lv barness skeleton closet   the demise of lady kew of course put a stop for a while to the matrimonial projects so interesting to the house of newcome hymen blew his torch out put it into the cupboard for use on a future day and exchanged his garish saffroncoloured robe for decent temporary mourning charles honeyman improved the occasion at lady whittleseas chapel hard by and death at the festival was one of his most thrilling sermons reprinted at the request of some of the congregation there were those of his flock especially a pair whose quarter of the fold was the organloft who were always charmed with the piping of that melodious pastor  shall we too while the coffin yet rests on the earths outer surface enter the chapel whither these void remains of our dear sister departed are borne by the smug undertakers gentlemen and pronounce an elegy over that bedizened box of corruption when the young are stricken down and their roses nipped in an hour by the destroying blight even the stranger can sympathise who counts the scant years on the gravestone or reads the notice in the newspaper corner the contrast forces itself on you a fair young creature bright and blooming yesterday distributing smiles levying homage inspiring desire conscious of her power to charm and gay with the natural enjoyment of her conquestswho in his walk through the world has not looked on many such a one and at the notion of her sudden call away from beauty triumph pleasure her helpless outcries during her short pain her vain pleas for a little respite her sentence and its execution has not felt a shock of pity when the days of a long life come to its close and a white head sinks to rise no more we bow our own with respect as the mourning train passes and salute the heraldry and devices of yonder pomp as symbols of age wisdom deserved respect and merited honour long experience of suffering and action the wealth he may have achieved is the harvest which he sowed the titles on his hearse fruits of the field he bravely and laboriously wrought in but to live to fourscore years and be found dancing among the idle virgins to have had near a century of allotted time and then be called away from the giddy notes of a mayfair fiddle to have to yield your roses too and then drop out of the bony clutch of your old fingers a wreath that came from a parisian bandbox one fancies around some graves unseen troops of mourners waiting many and many a poor pensioner trooping to the place many weeping charities many kind actions many dear friends beloved and deplored rising up at the toll of that bell to follow the honoured hearse dead parents waiting above and calling come daughter lost children heavens fondlings hovering round like cherubim and whispering welcome mother here is one who reposes after a long feast where no love has been after girlhood without kindly maternal nurture marriage without affection matronhood without its precious griefs and joys after fourscore years of lonely vanity let us take off our hats to that procession too as it passes admiring the different lots awarded to the children of men and the various usages to which heaven puts its creatures  leave we yonder velvetpalled box spangled with fantastic heraldry and containing within the aged slough and envelope of a soul gone to render its account look rather at the living audience standing round the shellthe deep grief on barnes newcomes fine countenance the sadness depicted in the face of the most noble the marquis of farintosh the sympathy of her ladyships medical man who came in the third mourning carriage better than these the awe and reverence and emotion exhibited in the kind face of one of the witnesses of this scene as he listens to those words which the priest rehearses over our dead what magnificent words what a burning faith what a glorious triumph what a heroic life death hope they record they are read over all of us alike as the sun shines on just and unjust we have all of us heard them and i have fancied for my part that they fell and smote like the sods on the coffin  the ceremony over the undertakers gentlemen clamber on the roof of the vacant hearse into which palls tressels trays of feathers are inserted and the horses break out into a trot and the empty carriages expressing the deep grief of the deceased ladys friends depart homeward it is remarked that lord kew hardly has any communication with his cousin sir barnes newcome his lordship jumps into a cab and goes to the railroad issuing from the cemetery the marquis of farintosh hastily orders that thing to be taken off his hat and returns to town in his brougham smoking a cigar sir barnes newcome rides in the brougham beside lord farintosh as far as oxford street where he gets a cab and goes to the city for business is business and must be attended to though grief be ever so severe  a very short time previous to her demise mr rood that was mr roodthat other little gentleman in black who shared the third mourning coach along with her ladyships medical man had executed a will by which almost all the countesss property was devised to her granddaughter ethel newcome lady kews decease of course delayed the marriage projects for a while the young heiress returned to her mothers house in park lane i dare say the deep mourning habiliments in which the domestics of that establishment appeared were purchased out of the funds left in his hands which ethels banker and brother had at her disposal  sir barnes newcome who was one of the trustees of his sisters property grumbled no doubt because his grandmother had bequeathed to him but a paltry recompense of five hundred pounds for his pains and trouble of trusteeship but his manner to ethel was extremely bland and respectful an heiress now and to be a marchioness in a few months sir barnes treated her with a very different regard to that which he was accustomed to show to other members of his family for while this worthy baronet would contradict his mother at every word she uttered and take no pains to disguise his opinion that lady annes intellect was of the very poorest order he would listen deferentially to ethels smallest observations exert himself to amuse her under her grief which he chose to take for granted was very severe visit her constantly and show the most charming solicitude for her general comfort and welfare  during this time my wife received constant notes from ethel newcome and the intimacy between the two ladies much increased laura was so unlike the women of ethels circle the young lady was pleased to say that to be with her was ethels greatest comfort miss newcome was now her own mistress had her carriage and would drive day after day to our cottage at richmond the frigid society of lord farintoshs sisters the conversation of his mother did not amuse ethel and she escaped from both with her usual impatience of control she was at home every day dutifully to receive my lords visits but though she did not open her mind to laura as freely regarding the young gentleman as she did when the character and disposition of her future mother and sistersinlaw was the subject of their talk i could see from the grave look of commiseration which my wifes face bore after her young friends visits that mrs pendennis augured rather ill of the future happiness of this betrothed pair once at miss newcomes special request i took my wife to see her in park lane where the marquis of farintosh found us his lordship and i had already a halfacquaintance which was not however improved after my regular presentation to him by miss newcome he scowled at me with a countenance indicative of anything but welcome and did not seem in the least more pleased when ethel entreated her friend laura not to take her bonnet not to think of going away so soon she came to see us the very next day stayed much longer with us than usual and returned to town quite late in the evening in spite of the entreaties of the inhospitable laura who would have had her leave us long before i am sure says clearsighted mrs laura she is come out of bravado and after we went away yesterday that there were words between her and lord farintosh on our account  confound the young man breaks out mr pendennis in a fume what does he mean by his insolent airs  he may think we are partisans de lautre says mrs pendennis with a smile first and a sigh afterwards as she said poor clive  do you ever talk about clive asks the husband  never once twice perhaps in the most natural manner in the world we mentioned where he is but nothing further passes the subject is a sealed one between us she often looks at his drawings in my album clive had drawn our baby there and its mother in a great variety of attitudes and gazes at his sketch of his dear old father but of him she never says a word  so it is best says mr pendennis  yesbest echoes laura with a sigh  you think laura continues the husband you think she  she what what did mr pendennis mean laura his wife certainly understood him though upon my conscience the sentence went no furtherfor she answered at once  yesi think she certainly did poor boy but that of course is over now and ethel though she cannot help being a worldly woman has such firmness and resolution of character that if she has once determined to conquer any inclination of that sort i am sure she will master it and make lord farintosh a very good wife  since the colonels quarrel with sir barnes cries mr pendennis adverting by a natural transition from ethel to her amiable brother our banking friend does not invite us any more lady clara sends you no cards i have a great mind to withdraw my account  laura who understands nothing about accounts did not perceive the fine irony of this remark but her face straightway put on the severe expression which it chose to assume whenever sir barness family was mentioned and she said my dear i am very glad indeed that lady clara sends us no more of her invitations you know very well why i disliked them  why  i hear baby crying says laura oh laura laura how could you tell your husband such a fiband she quits the room without deigning to give any answer to that why  let us pay a brief visit to newcome in the north of england and there we may get some answer to the question of which mr pendennis had just in vain asked a reply from his wife my design does not include a description of that great and flourishing town of newcome and of the manufactures which caused its prosperity but only admits of the introduction of those newcomites who are concerned in the affairs of the family which has given its respectable name to these volumes  thus in previous pages we have said nothing about the mayor and corporation of newcome the magnificent bankers and manufacturers who had their places of business in the town and their splendid villas outside its smoky precincts people who would give their thousand guineas for a picture or a statue and write you off a cheque for ten times the amount any day people who if there was a talk of a statue to the queen or the duke would come down to the town all and subscribe their one two three undred apiece especially if in the neighbouring city of slowcome they were putting up a statue to the duke or the queennot of such men have i spoken the magnates of the place but of the humble sarah mason in jubilee rowof the reverend dr bulders the vicar mr vidler the apothecary mr puff the bakerof tom potts the jolly reporter of the newcome independent and  batters esq the proprietor of that journalpersons with whom our friends have had already or will be found presently to have some connexion and it is from these that we shall arrive at some particulars regarding the newcome family which will show us that they have a skeleton or two in their closets as well as their neighbours  now how will you have the story worthy mammas of familiesif you do not like to have your daughters told that bad husbands will make bad wives that marriages begun in indifference make homes unhappy that men whom girls are brought to swear to love and honour are sometimes false selfish and cruel and that women forget the oaths which they have been made to swearif you will not hear of this ladies close the book and send for some other banish the newspaper out of your houses and shut your eyes to the truth the awful truth of life and sin is the world made of jennies and jessamies and passion the play of schoolboys and schoolgirls scribbling valentines and interchanging lollipops is life all over when jenny and jessamy are married and are there no subsequent trials griefs wars bitter heartpangs dreadful temptations defeats remorses sufferings to bear and dangers to overcome as you and i friend kneel with our children round about us prostrate before the father of us all and asking mercy for miserable sinners are the young ones to suppose the words are mere form and dont apply to usto some outcasts in the free seats probably or those naughty boys playing in the churchyard are they not to know that we err too and pray with all our hearts to be rescued from temptation if such a knowledge is wrong for them send them to church apart go you and worship in private or if not too proud kneel humbly in the midst of them owning your wrong and praying heaven to be merciful to you a sinner  when barnes newcome became the reigning prince of the newcome family and after the first agonies of grief for his fathers death had subsided he made strong attempts to conciliate the principal persons in the neighbourhood and to render himself popular in the borough he gave handsome entertainments to the townsfolk and to the county gentry he tried even to bring those two warring classes together he endeavoured to be civil to the newcome independent the opposition paper as well as to the newcome sentinel that true old uncompromising blue he asked the dissenting clergyman to dinner and the low church clergyman as well as the orthodox doctor bulders and his curates he gave a lecture at the newcome athenaeum which everybody said was very amusing and which sentinel and independent both agreed in praising of course he subscribed to that statue which the newcomites were raising to the philanthropic missions which reverend low church gentlemen were engaged in to the for the young newcomite manufacturers are as sporting as any gents in the north to the hospital the peoples library the restoration of the roodscreen and the great painted window in newcome old church rev j bulders and he had to pay in fine a most awful price for his privilege of sitting in parliament as representative of his native placeas he called it in his speeches the cradle of his forefathers the home of his race etc though barnes was in fact born at clapham  lady clara could not in the least help this young statesman in his designs upon newcome and the newcomites after she came into barness hands a dreadful weight fell upon her she would smile and simper and talk kindly and gaily enough at first during sir brians life and among women when barnes was not present but as soon as he joined the company it was remarked that his wife became silent and looked eagerly towards him whenever he ventured to speak she blundered her eyes filled with tears the little wit she had left her in her husbands presence he grew angry and tried to hide his anger with a sneer or broke out with gibe and an oath when he lost patience and clara whimpering would leave the room everybody at newcome knew that barnes bullied his wife  people had worse charges against barnes than wifebullying do you suppose that little interruption which occurred at barness marriage was not known in newcome his victim had been a newcome girl the man to whom she was betrothed was in a newcome factory when barnes was a young man and in his occasional visits to newcome lived along with those dashing young blades sam jollyman jollyman brothers and bowcher bob homer cross country bill al rackner for whom his father had to pay eighteen thousand pounds after the leger the year toggery won it and that wild lot all sorts of stories were told of them and of barnes especially most of them were settled and steady business men by this time al it was known had become very serious besides making his fortune in cotton bob homer managed the bank and as for s jollyman mrs s j took uncommon good care that he didnt break out of bounds any more why he was not even allowed to play a game at billiards or to dine out without heri could go on giving you interesting particulars of a hundred members of the newcome aristocracy were not our attention especially directed to one respectable family  all barness endeavours at popularity were vain partly from his own fault and partly from the nature of mankind and of the newcome folks especially whom no single person could possibly conciliate thus suppose he gave the advertisements to the independent the old blue paper the sentinel was very angry suppose he asked mr hunch the dissenting minister to bless the tablecloth after dinner as he had begged dr bulders to utter a benediction on the first course hunch and bulders were both angry he subscribed to the raceswhat heathenism to the missionarieswhat sanctimonious humbug and the worst was that barnes being young at that time and not able to keep his tongue in order could not help saying not to but of such and such a man that he was an infernal ass or a confounded old idiot and so forthpeevish phrases which undid in a moment the work of a dozen dinners countless compliments and months of grinning goodhumour  now he is wiser he is very proud of being newcome of newcome and quite believes that the place is his hereditary principality but still he says his father was a fool for ever representing the borough dammy sir cries sir barnes never sit for a place that lies at your parkgates and above all never try to conciliate em curse em hate em well sir take a line and flog the fellows on the other side since i have sate in parliament for another place i have saved myself i dont know how much a year i never go to high church or low dont give a shillin to the confounded races or the infernal souptickets or to the miserable missionaries and at last live in quiet  so in spite of all his subscriptions and his coaxing of the various orders of newcomites sir barnes newcome was not popular among them and while he had enemies on all sides had sturdy friends not even on his own scarce a man but felt barnes was laughing at him bulders in his pulpit holder who seconded him in his election the newcome society and the ladies even more than the men were uneasy under his ominous familiarity and recovered their goodhumour when he left them people felt as if it was a truce only and not an alliance with him and always speculated on the possibility of war when he turned his back on them in the market men felt relieved and as they passed his gate looked with no friendly glances over his parkwall  what happened within was perfectly familiar to many persons our friend was insolent to all his servants and of course very well served but very much disliked in consequence the butler was familiar with taplowthe housekeeper had a friend at newcome mrs taplow in fact of the kings armsone of the grooms at newcome park kept company with mrs bulders maid the incomings and outgoings the quarrels and tears the company from london and all the doings of the folks at newcome park were thus known to the neighbourhood round about the apothecary brought an awful story back from newcome he had been called to lady clara in strong hysterical fits he found her ladyship with a bruise on her face when sir barnes approached her he would not allow the medical man to see her except in his presence she screamed and bade him not come near her these things did mr vidler weakly impart to mrs vidler these under solemn vows of secrecy mrs vidler told to one or two friends sir barnes and lady clara were seen shopping together very graciously in newcome a short time afterwards persons who dined at the park said the baronet and his wife seemed on very good terms butbut that story of the bruised cheek remained in the minds of certain people and lay by at compound interest as such stories will  now say people quarrel and make it up or dont make it up but wear a smirking face to society and call each other my dear and my love and smooth over their countenances before john who enters with the coals as they are barking and biting or who announces the dinner as they are tearing each others eyes out suppose a woman is ever so miserable and yet smiles and doesnt show her grief quite right say her prudent friends and her husbands relations above all my dear you have too much propriety to exhibit your grief before the world or above all before the darling children so to lie is your duty to lie to your friends to yourself if you can to your children  does this discipline of hypocrisy improve any mortal woman say she learns to smile after a blow do you suppose in this matter alone she will be a hypocrite poor lady clara i fancy a better lot for you than that to which fate handed you over i fancy there need have been no deceit in your fond simple little heart could it but have been given into other keeping but you were consigned to a master whose scorn and cruelty terrified you under whose sardonic glances your scared eyes were afraid to look up and before whose gloomy coldness you dared not be happy suppose a little plant very frail and delicate from the first but that might have bloomed sweetly and borne fair flowers had it received warm shelter and kindly nurture suppose a young creature taken out of her home and given over to a hard master whose caresses are as insulting as his neglect consigned to cruel usage to weary loneliness to bitter bitter recollections of the past suppose her schooled into hypocrisy by tyrannyand then quick let us hire an advocate to roar out to a british jury the wrongs of her injured husband to paint the agonies of his bleeding heart if mr advocate gets plaintiffs brief in time and before defendants attorney has retained him and to show society injured through him let us console that martyr i say with thumping damages and as for the womanthe guilty wretchlet us lead her out and stone her     chapter lvi rosa quo locorum sera moratur   clive newcome bore his defeat with such a courage and resolution as those who knew the young fellows character were sure he would display it was whilst he had a little lingering hope still that the poor lad was in the worst condition as a gambler is restless and unhappy whilst his last few guineas remain with him and he is venturing them against the overpowering chances of the bank his last piece however gone our friend rises up from that unlucky table beaten at the contest but not broken in spirit he goes back into the world again and withdraws from that dangerous excitement sometimes when he is alone or wakeful tossing in his bed at nights he may recall the fatal game and think how he might have won itthink what a fool he was ever to have played it at allbut these cogitations clive kept for himself he was magnanimous enough not even to blame ethel much and to take her side against his father who it must be confessed now exhibited a violent hostility against that young lady and her belongings slow to anger and utterly beyond deceit himself when thomas newcome was once roused or at length believed that he was cheated woe to the offender from that day forth thomas believed no good of him every thought or action of his enemys life seemed treason to the worthy colonel if barnes gave a dinnerparty his uncle was ready to fancy that the banker wanted to poison somebody if he made a little speech in the house of commons barnes did make little speeches in the house of commons the colonel was sure some infernal conspiracy lay under the villains words the whole of that branch of the newcomes fared little better at their kinsmans handsthey were all deceitful sordid heartless worldlyethel herself no better now than the people who had bred her up people hate as they love unreasonably whether is it the more mortifying to us to feel that we are disliked or liked undeservedly  clive was not easy until he had the sea between him and his misfortune and now thomas newcome had the chance of making that tour with his son which in early days had been such a favourite project with the good man they travelled rhineland and switzerland togetherthey crossed into italywent from milan to venice where clive saluted the greatest painting in the worldthe glorious assumption of titianthey went to trieste and over the beautiful styrian alps to viennathey beheld danube and the plain where the turk and sobieski fought they travelled at a prodigious fast pace they did not speak much to one another they were a pattern pair of english travellers i dare say many persons whom they met smiled to observe them and shrugged their shoulders at the aspect of ces anglais they did not know the care in the young travellers mind and the deep tenderness and solicitude of the elder clive wrote to say it was a very pleasant tour but i think i should not have liked to join it let us dismiss it in this single sentence other gentlemen have taken the same journey and with sorrow perhaps as their silent fellowtraveller how you remember the places afterwards and the thoughts which pursued you if in after days when your grief is dead and buried you revisit the scenes in which it was your companion how its ghost rises and shows itself again suppose this part of mr clives life were to be described at length in several chapters and not in a single brief sentence what dreary pages they would be in two or three months our friends saw a number of men cities mountains rivers and what not it was yet early autumn when they were back in france again and september found them at brussels where james binnie esq and his family were established in comfortable quarters and where we may be sure clive and his father were very welcome  dragged abroad at first sorely against his will james binnie had found the continental life pretty much to his liking he had passed a winter at pau a summer at vichy where the waters had done him good his ladies had made several charming foreign acquaintances mrs mackenzie had quite a list of counts and marchionesses among her friends the excellent captain goby wandered about the country with them was it to rosey was it to her mother the captain was most attached rosey received him as a godpapa mrs mackenzie as a wicked odious goodfornothing dangerous delightful creature is it humiliating is it consolatory to remark with what small wit some of our friends are amused the jovial sallies of goby appeared exquisite to roseys mother and to the girl probably though that young bahawder of a clive newcome chose to wear a grave face confound his insolent airs at the very best of the goby jokes  in gobys train was his fervent admirer and inseparable young friend clarence hoby captain hoby and captain goby travelled the world together visited hombourg and baden cheltenham and leamington paris and brussels in company belonged to the same club in londonthe centre of all pleasure fashion and joy for the young officer and the older campaigner the jokes at the flag the dinners at the flag the committee of the flag were the theme of their constant conversation goby fifty years old unattached and with dyed moustaches was the affable comrade of the youngest member of his club when absent a friend wrote him the last riddle from the smokingroom when present his knowledge of horses of cookery wines and cigars and military history rendered him a most acceptable companion he knew the history and achievements of every regiment in the army of every general and commanding officer he was known to have been out more than once himself and had made up a hundred quarrels he was certainly not a man of an ascetic life or a profound intellectual culture but though poor he was known to be most honourable though more than middleaged he was cheerful busy and kindly and though the youngsters called him old goby he bore his years very gaily and handsomely and i dare say numbers of ladies besides mrs mackenzie thought him delightful gobys talk and rattle perhaps somewhat bored james binnie but thomas newcome found the captain excellent company and goby did justice to the good qualities of the colonel  clives father liked brussels very well he and his son occupied very handsome quarters near the spacious apartments in the park which james binnies family inhabited waterloo was not far off to which the indian officer paid several visits with captain goby for a guide and many of marlboroughs battlefields were near in which goby certainly took but a minor interest but on the other hand clive beheld these with the greatest pleasure and painted more than one dashing piece in which churchill and eugene cutts and cadogan were the heroes whose flowing periwigs huge boots and thundering flemish chargers were he thought more novel and picturesque than the dukes surtout and the french grenadiers hairy caps which so many english and french artists have portrayed  mr and mrs pendennis were invited by our kind colonel to pass a monthsix months if they choseat brussels and were most splendidly entertained by our friends in that city a suite of handsome rooms was set apart for us my study communicated with clives atelier many an hour did we pass and many a ride and walk did we take together i observed that clive never mentioned miss newcomes name and laura and i agreed that it was as well not to recall it only once when we read the death of lady glenlivat lord farintoshs mother in the newspaper i remember to have said i suppose that marriage will be put off again  quest ce que cela me fait says mr clive gloomily over his picturea cheerful piece representing count egmont going to execution in which i have the honour to figure as a halberdier captain hoby as the count and captain goby as the duke of alva looking out of window  mrs mackenzie was in a state of great happiness and glory during this winter she had a carriage and worked that vehicle most indefatigably she knew a great deal of good company at brussels she had an evening for receiving she herself went to countless eveningparties and had the joy of being invited to a couple of court balls at which i am bound to say her daughter and herself both looked very handsome the colonel brushed up his old uniform and attended these entertainments m newcome fils as i should judge was not the worstlooking man in the room and as these young people waltzed together in which accomplishment clive was very much more skilful than captain goby i dare say many people thought he and rosey made a pretty couple  most persons my wife included difficult as that lady is to please were pleased with the pretty little rosey she sang charmingly now and looked so while singing if her mother would but have omitted that chorus which she cackled perseveringly behind her daughters pretty back about roseys angelic temper about the compliments signor polonini paid her about sir horace dash our minister insisting upon her singing batti batti over again and the archduke clapping his hands and saying oh yes about count vanderslaapens attentions to her etc etc but for these constant remarks of mrs macks i am sure no one would have been better pleased with miss roseys singing and behaviour than myself as for captain hoby it was easy to see how he was affected towards miss rosalinds music and person  and indeed few things could be pleasanter than to watch the behaviour of this pretty little maid with her uncle james and his old chum the colonel the latter was soon as fond of her as james binnie himself whose face used to lighten with pleasure whenever it turned towards hers she seemed to divine his wants as she would trip across the room to fulfil them she skipped into the carriage and covered his feet with a shawl james was lazy and chilly now when he took his drive she sate opposite to him and smiled on him and if he dozed quick another handkerchief was round his neck i do not know whether she understood his jokes but she saluted them always with a sweet kind smile how she kissed him and how delighted she was if he bought her a bouquet for her ball that night one day upon occasion of one of these balls james and thomas those two old boys absolutely came into mrs mackenzies drawingroom with a bouquet apiece for miss rosey and there was a fine laughing  oh you little susanna says james after taking his usual payment now go and pay tother elder rosey did not quite understand at first being you see more ready to laugh at jokes than to comprehend them but when she did i promise you she looked uncommonly pretty as she advanced to colonel newcome and put that pretty fresh cheek of hers up to his grizzled moustache  i protest i dont know which of you blushes the most chuckles james binnieand the truth is the old man and the young girl had both hung out those signals of amiable distress  on this day and as miss rosey was to be overpowered by flowers who should come presently to dinner but captain hoby with another bouquet on which uncle james said rosey should go to the ball like an american indian with her scalps at her belt  scalps cries mrs mackenzie  scalps oh law uncle exclaims miss rosey what can you mean by anything so horrid  goby recalls to mrs mack hookeemagoosh the indian chief whom she must have seen when the hundred and fiftieth were at quebec and who had his lodge full of them and who used to lie about the barracks so drunk and who used to beat his poor little european wife and presently mr clive newcome joins this company when the chirping tittering joking laughing cease somehow  has clive brought a bouquet too no he has never thought about a bouquet he is dressed in black with long hair a long moustache and melancholy imperial he looks very handsome but as glum as an undertaker and james binnie says egad tom they used to call you the knight of the woeful countenance and clive has just inherited the paternal mug then james calls out in a cheery voice dinner dinner and trots off with mrs pendennis under his arm rosey nestles up against the colonel goby and mrs mack walk away arminarm very contentedly and i dont know with which of her three nosegays pretty rosey appears at the ball  our stay with our friends at brussels could not be prolonged beyond a month for at the end of that period we were under an engagement to other friends in england who were good enough to desire the presence of mrs pendennis and her suite of baby nurse and husband so we presently took leave of rosey and the campaigner of the two stout elders and our melancholy young clive who bore us company to antwerp and who won lauras heart by the neat way in which he took her child on board ship poor fellow how sad he looked as he bowed to us and took off his hat his eyes did not seem to be looking at us though they and his thoughts were turned another way he moved off immediately with his head down puffing his eternal cigar and lost in his own meditations our going or our staying was of very little importance to the lugubrious youth  i think it was a great pity they came to brussels says laura as we sate on the deck while her unconscious infant was cheerful and while the water of the lazy scheldt as yet was smooth  who the colonel and clive they are very handsomely lodged they have a good maitre dhotel their dinners i am sure are excellent and your child madam is as healthy as it possibly can be  blessed darling yes blessed darling crows moos jumps in his nurses arms and holds out a little mottled hand for a biscuit of savoy which mamma supplies i cant help thinking arthur that rosey would have been much happier as mrs hoby than she will be as mrs newcome  who thinks of her being mrs newcome  her mother her uncle and clives father since the colonel has been so rich i think mrs mackenzie sees a great deal of merit in clive rosey will do anything her mother bids her if clive can be brought to the same obedience uncle james and the colonel will be delighted uncle james has set his heart on this marriage he and his sister agree upon this point he told me last night that he would sing nunc dimittis could he but see the two children happy and that he should lie easier in purgatory if that could be brought about  and what did you say laura  i laughed and told uncle james i was of the hoby faction he is very goodnatured frank honest and gentlemanlike mr hoby but uncle james said he thought mr hoby was sowell so stupidthat his rosey would be thrown away upon the poor captain so i did not tell uncle james that before clives arrival rosey had found captain hoby far from stupid he used to sing duets with her he used to ride with her before clive came last winter when they were at pau i feel certain miss rosey thought captain hoby very pleasant indeed she thinks she was attached to clive formerly and now she admires him and is dreadfully afraid of him he is taller and handsomer and richer and cleverer than captain hoby certainly  i should think so indeed breaks out mr pendennis why my dear clive is as fine a fellow as one can see on a summers day it does one good to look at him what a frank pair of bright blue eyes he has or used to have till this mishap overclouded them what a pleasant laugh he has what a wellbuilt agile figure it iswhat pluck and spirit and honour there is about my young chap i dont say he is a genius of the highest order but he is the staunchest the bravest the cheeriest the most truthtelling the kindest heart compare him and hoby why clive is an eagle and yonder little creature a mousing owl  i like to hear you speak so cries mrs laura very tenderly people say that you are always sneering arthur but i know my husband better we know papa better dont we baby here my wife kisses the infant pendennis with great effusion who has come up dancing on his nurses arms but says she coming back and snuggling by her husbands side againbut suppose your favourite clive is an eagle arthur dont you think he had better have an eagle for a mate if he were to marry little rosey i dare say he would be very good to her but i think neither he nor she would be very happy my dear she does not care for his pursuits she does not understand him when he talks the two captains and rosey and i and the campaigner as you call her laugh and talk and prattle and have the merriest little jokes with one another and we all are as quiet as mice when you and clive come in  what am i an eagle too i have no aquiline pretensions at all mrs pendennis  no well we are not afraid of you we are not afraid of papa are we darling this young woman now calls out to the other member of her family who if you will calculate has just had time to be walked twice up and down the deck of the steamer whilst laura has been making her speech about eagles and soon the mother child and attendant descend into the lower cabins and then dinner is announced and captain jackson treats us to champagne from his end of the table and yet a short while and we are at sea and conversation becomes impossible and morning sees us under the grey london sky and amid the million of masts in the thames     chapter lvii rosebury and newcome   the friends to whom we were engaged in england were florac and his wife madame la princesse de moncontour who were determined to spend the christmas holidays at the princesss country seat it was for the first time since their reconciliation that the prince and princess dispensed their hospitalities at the latters chateau it is situated as the reader has already been informed at some five miles from the town of newcome away from the chimneys and smoky atmosphere of that place in a sweet country of rural woodlands over which quiet villages grey church spires and ancient gabled farmhouses are scattered still wearing the peaceful aspect which belonged to them when newcome was as yet but an antiquated country town before mills were erected on its riverbanks and dyes and cinders blackened its stream twenty years since newcome park was the only great house in that district now scores of fine villas have sprung up in the suburb lying between the town and park newcome new town as everybody knows has grown round the parkgates and the new town hotel where the railway station is is a splendid structure in the tudor style more ancient in appearance than the park itself surrounded by little antique villas with spiked gables stacks of crooked chimneys and plateglass windows looking upon trim lawns with glistening hedges of evergreens spotless gravel walks and elizabethan gighouses under the great railway viaduct of the new town goes the old tranquil winding london highroad once busy with a score of gay coaches and ground by innumerable wheels but at a few miles from the new town station the road has become so mouldy that the grass actually grows on it and rosebury madame de moncontours house stands at one end of a villagegreen which is even more quiet now than it was a hundred years ago  when first madame de florac bought the place it scarcely ranked amongst the countryhouses and she the sister of manufacturers at newcome and manchester did not of course visit the county families a homely little body married to a frenchman from whom she was separated may or may not have done a great deal of good in her village have had pretty gardens and won prizes at the newcome flower and fruit shows but of course she was nobody in such an aristocratic county as we know shire is she had her friends and relatives from newcome many of them were quakersmany were retail shopkeepers she even frequented the little branch ebenezer on rosebury green and it was only by her charities and kindness at christmastime that the rev dr potter the rector at rosebury knew her the old clergy you see live with the county families good little madame de florac was pitied and patronised by the doctor treated with no little superciliousness by mrs potter and the young ladies who only kept the first society even when her rich brother died and she got her share of all that money mrs potter said poor madame de florac did well in not trying to move out of her natural sphere mrs p was the daughter of a bankrupt hatter in london and had herself been governess in a noble family out of which she married mr p who was private tutor madame de florac did well she said not to endeavour to leave her natural sphere and that the county never would receive her tom potter the rectors son with whom i had the good fortune to be a fellowstudent at saint boniface college oxbridgea rattling forward and it must be owned vulgar youthasked me whether florac was not a billiardmarker by profession and was even so kind as to caution his sisters not to speak of billiards before the lady of rosebury tom was surprised to learn that monsieur paul de florac was a gentleman of lineage incomparably better than that of any except two or three families in england including your own my dear and respected reader of course if you hold to your pedigree but the truth is heraldically speaking that union with the higgs of manchester was the first misalliance which the florac family had made for long long years not that i would wish for a moment to insinuate that any nobleman is equal to an english nobleman nay that an english snob with a coatofarms bought yesterday or stolen out of edmonton or a pedigree purchased from a peeragemaker has not a right to look down upon any of your paltry foreign nobility  one day the carriageandfour came in state from newcome park with the wellknown chaste liveries of the newcomes and drove up rosebury green towards the parsonage gate when mrs and the miss potters happened to be standing cheapening fish from a donkeyman with whom they were in the habit of dealing the ladies were in their pokiest old headgear and most dingy gowns when they perceived the carriage approaching and considering of course that the visit of the park people was intended for them dashed into the rectory to change their clothes leaving rowkins the costermonger in the very midst of the negotiation about the three mackerel mamma got that new bonnet out of the bandbox lizzy and liddy skipped up to their bedroom and brought out those dresses which they wore at the dejeuner at the newcome athenaeum when lord leveret came down to lecture into which they no sooner had hooked their lovely shoulders than they reflected with terror that mamma had been altering one of papas flannel waistcoats and had left it in the drawingroom when they were called out by the song of rowkins and the appearance of his donkeys ears over the green gate of the rectory to think of the park people coming and the drawingroom in that dreadful state  but when they came downstairs the park people were not in the roomthe woollen garment was still on the table how they plunged it into the chiffonierand the only visitor was rowkins the costermonger grinning at the open french windows with the three mackerel and crying make it sixpence missdont say fippens maam to a pore fellow that has a wife and family so that the young ladies had to cryimpudence get away you vulgar insolent creaturego round sir to the back door how dare you and the like fearing lest lady anne newcome and young ethel and barnes should enter in the midst of this ignoble controversy  they never came at allthose park people how very odd they passed the rectory gate they drove on to madame de floracs lodge they went in they stayed for half an hour the horses driving round and round the gravel road before the house and mrs potter and the girls speedily going to the upper chambers and looking out of the room where the maids slept saw lady anne ethel and barnes walking with madame de florac going into the conservatories issuing thence with macwhirter the gardener bearing huge bunches of grapes and large fasces of flowers they saw barnes talking in the most respectful manner to madame de florac and when they went downstairs and had their work before themliddy her gilt musicbook lizzy her embroidered altarcloth mamma her scarlet cloak for one of the old womenthey had the agony of seeing the barouche over the railings whisk by with the park people inside and barnes driving the four horses  it was on that day when barnes had determined to take up madame de florac when he was bent upon reconciling her to her husband in spite of all mrs potters predictions the county families did come and visit the manufacturers daughter and when madame de florac became madame la princesse de moncontour when it was announced that she was coming to stay at rosebury for christmas i leave you to imagine whether the circumstance was or was not mentioned in the newcome sentinel and the newcome independent and whether rev g potter dd and mrs potter did or did not call on the prince and princess i leave you to imagine whether the lady did or did not inspect all the alterations which vineers people from newcome were making at rosebury housethe chaste yellow satin and gold of the drawingroomthe carved oak for the diningroomthe chintz for the bedroomsthe princesss apartmentthe princes apartmentthe guests apartmentsthe smokingroom gracious goodnessthe stables these were under tom potters superintendence and im finished says he one day if here doesnt come a billiardtable  the house was most comfortably and snugly appointed from top to bottom and thus it will be seen that mr and mrs pendennis were likely to be in very good quarters for christmas of 184  tom potter was so kind as to call on me two days after our arrival and to greet me in the princesss pew at church on the previous day before desiring to be introduced to my wife he requested me to present him to my friend the prince he called him your highness his highness who had behaved with exemplary gravity save once when he shrieked an ah as miss liddy led off the children in the organloft in a hymn and the whole pack went woefully out of tune complimented monsieur tom on the sermon of monsieur his father tom walked with us to rosebury lodgegate will you not come in and make a party of billiard with me says his highness ah pardon i forgot you do not play the billiard the sunday any other day prince i shall be delighted says tom and squeezed his highnesss hand tenderly at parting your comrade of college was he asks florac my dear what men are these comrades of college what men are you english my word of honour there are some of them hereif i were to say to them wax my boots they would take them and wax them didst thou see how the reverend eyed us during the sermon he regarded us over his book my word of honour  madame de florac said simply she wished the prince would go and hear mr jacob at the ebenezer mr potter was not a good preacher certainly  savezvows quelle est furieusement belle la fille du reverend whispered his highness to me i have made eyes at her during the sermon they will be of pretty neighbours these meess and paul looked unutterably roguish and victorious as he spoke to my wife i am bound to say monsieur de moncontour showed a courtesy a respect and kindness that could not be exceeded he admired her he paid her compliments innumerable and gave me i am sure sincere congratulations at possessing such a treasure i do not think he doubted about his power of conquering her or any other of the daughters of women but i was the friend of his misfortuneshis guest and he spared me  i have seen nothing more amusing odd and pleasant than florac at this time of his prosperity we arrived as this veracious chronicle has already asserted on a saturday evening we were conducted to our most comfortable apartments with crackling fires blazing on the hearths and every warmth of welcome florac expanded and beamed with goodnature he shook me many times by the hand he patted me he called me his goodhis brave  he cried to his maitre dhotel frederic remember monsieur is master here run before his orders prostrate thyself to him he was good to me in the days of my misfortune hearest thou frederic see that everything be done for monsieur pendennisfor madame sa charmante ladyfor her angelic infant and the bonne none of thy garrison tricks with that young person frederic vieux scelerat gardetoi de la frederic si non je tenvoie a botani bay je te traduis devant le lord mare  en angleterre je me fais anglais voistu mon ami continued the prince demain cest sunday et tu vas voir i hear the bell dress thyself for the dinnermy friend here there was another squeeze of both hands from the goodnatured fellow it do good to my art to ave you in my ouse heuh he hugged his guest he had tears in his eyes as he performed this droll this kind embrace not less kind in her way though less expensive and embracive was madame de moncontour to my wife as i found on comparing notes with that young woman when the days hospitalities were ended the little princess trotted from bedchamber to nursery to see that everything was made comfortable for her guests she sate and saw the child washed and put to bed she had never beheld such a little angel she brought it a fine toy to play with she and her grim old maid frightened the little creature at first but it was very speedily reconciled to their countenances she was in the nursery almost as early as the childs mother ah sighed the poor little woman how happy you must be to have one in fine my wife was quite overcome by her goodness and welcome  sunday morning arrived in the course of time and then florac appeared as a most wonderful briton indeed he wore topboots and buckskins and after breakfast when we went to church a white greatcoat with a little cape in which garment he felt that his similarity to an english gentleman was perfect in conversation with his grooms and servants he swore freelynot that he was accustomed to employ oaths in his own private talk but he thought the employment of these expletives necessary as an english country gentleman he never dined without a roastbeef and insisted that the piece of meat should be bleeding as you love it you others he got up boxingmatches and kept birds for combats of cock he assumed the sporting language with admirable enthusiasmdrove over to cover with a steppererode across countri like a good onewas splendid in the huntingfield in his velvet cap and napoleon boots and made the hunt welcome at rosebury where his goodnatured little wife was as kind to the gentlemen in scarlet as she used to be of old to the stout dissenting gentlemen in black who sang hymns and spake sermons on her lawn these folks scared at the change which had taken place in the little princesss habits of life lamented her falling away but in the county she and her husband got a great popularity and in newcome town itself they were not less liked for her benefactions were unceasing and pauls affability the theme of all praise the newcome independent and the newcome sentinel both paid him compliments the former journal contrasting his behaviour with that of sir barnes their member floracs pleasure was to drive his princess with four horses into newcome he called his carriage his trappe his drague the streetboys cheered and hurrayed the prince as he passed through the town one haberdasher had a yellow stock called the moncontour displayed in his windows another had a pink one marked the princely and as such recommended it to the young newcome gents  the drague conveyed us once to the neighbouring house of newcome whither my wife accompanied madame de moncontour at that ladys own request to whom laura very properly did not think fit to confide her antipathy for lady clara newcome coming away from a great house how often she and i egotistical philosophers thanked our fates that our own home was a small one how long will great houses last in this world do not their owners now prefer a lodging at brighton or a little entresol on the boulevard to the solitary ancestral palace in a park barred round with snow we were as glad to get out of newcome as out of a prison my wife and our hostess skipped into the carriage and began to talk freely as the lodgegates closed after us would we be lords of such a place under the penalty of living in it we agreed that the little angle of earth called fairoaks was dearer to us than the clumsy newcomepile of tudor masonry the house had been fitted up in the time of george iv and the quasigothic revival we were made to pass through gothic diningrooms where there was now no hospitalitygothic drawingrooms shrouded in brown hollands to one little room at the end of the dusky suite where lady clara sate alone or in the company of the nurses and children the blank gloom of the place had fallen upon the poor lady even when my wife talked about children goodnatured madame de moncontour vaunting ours as a prodigy lady clara did not brighten up her pair of young ones was exhibited and withdrawn a something weighed upon the woman we talked about ethels marriage she said it was fixed for the new year she believed she did not know whether glenlivat had been very handsomely fitted up she had not seen lord farintoshs house in london sir barnes came down oncetwiceof a saturday sometimes for three or four days to hunt to amuse himself as all men do she supposed she did not know when he was coming again she rang languidly when we rose to take leave and sank back on her sofa where lay a heap of french novels she has chosen some pretty books says paul as we drove through the sombre avenues through the grey park mists lying about the melancholy ornamental waters dingy herds of huddled sheep speckling the grass here and there no smoke rising up from the great stacks of chimneys of the building we were leaving behind us save one little feeble thread of white which we knew came from the fire by which the lonely mistress of newcome was seated ouf cries florac playing his whip as the lodgegates closed on us and his team of horses rattled merrily along the road what a blessing it is to be out of that vault of a place there is something fatal in this housein this woman one smells misfortune there  the hotel which our friend florac patronised on occasion of his visits to newcome was the kings arms and it happened one day as we entered that place of entertainment in company that a visitor of the house was issuing through the hall to whom florac seemed as if he would administer one of his customary embraces and to whom the prince called out jack with great warmth and kindness as he ran towards the stranger  jack did not appear to be particularly well pleased on beholding us he rather retreated from before the frenchmans advances  my dear jack my good my brave ighgate i am delighted to see you florac continues regardless of the strangers reception or of the landlords looks towards us who was bowing the prince into his very best room  how do you do monsieur de florac growls the new comer surlily and was for moving on after this brief salutation but having a second thought seemingly turned back and followed florac into the apartment where our host conducted us a la bonne heure florac renewed his cordial greetings to lord highgate i knew not mon bon what fly had stung you says he to my lord the landlord rubbing his hands smirking and bowing was anxious to know whether the prince would take anything after his drive as the princes attendant and friend the lustre of his reception partially illuminated me when the chief was not by i was treated with great attention mingled with a certain degree of familiarity by my landlord  lord highgate waited until mr taplow was out of the room and then said to florac dont call me by my name here please florac i am here incog  plaitil asks florac where is incog he laughed when the word was interpreted to him lord highgate had turned to me there was no rudeness you understand intended mr pendennis but i am down here on some business and dont care to wear the handle to my name fellows work it so dont you understand never leave you at rest in a country townthat sort of thing heard of our friend clive lately  whether you ave andle or no andle jack you are always the bien venu to me what is thy affair old monster i wager  no no no such nonsense says jack rather eagerly i give you my honour ii want toto raise a sum of moneythat is to invest some in a speculation down heredeuced good the speculations down here and by the way if the landlord asks you im mr harrisim a civil engineerim waiting for the arrival of the canada at liverpool from america and very uneasy about my brother who is on board  what does he recount to us there keep these stories for the landlord jack to us tis not the pain to lie my good mr harris why have we not seen you at rosebury the princess will scold me if you do not come and you must bring your dear brother when he arrive too do you hear the last part of this sentence was uttered for mr taplows benefit who had reentered the george bearing a tray of wine and biscuit  the master of rosebury and mr harris went out presently to look at a horse which was waiting the formers inspection in the stableyard of the hotel the landlord took advantage of his business to hear a bell which never was rung and to ask me questions about the guest who had been staying at his house for a week past did i know that party mr pendennis said yes he knew that party  most respectable party i have no doubt continues boniface do you suppose the prince of moncontour knows any but respectable parties asks mr pendennisa query of which the force was so great as to discomfit and silence our landlord who retreated to ask questions concerning mr harris of floracs grooms  what was highgates business here was it mine to know i might have suspicions but should i entertain them or communicate them and had i not best keep them to myself i exchanged not a word on the subject of highgate with florac as we drove home though from the way in which we looked at one another each saw that the other was acquainted with that unhappy gentlemans secret we fell to talking about madame la duchesse divry as we trotted on and then of english manners by way of contrast of intrigues elopements gretna grin etc etc you are a droll nation says florac to make love well you must absolutely have a chaisedeposte and a scandal afterwards if our affairs of this kind made themselves on the grand route what armies of postillions we should need  i held my peace in that vision of jack belsize i saw misery guilt children dishonoured homes desertedruin for all the actors and victims of the wretched conspiracy laura marked my disturbance when we reached home she even divined the cause of it and charged me with it at night when we sate alone by our dressingroom fire and had taken leave of our kind entertainers then under her crossexamination i own that i told what i had seenlord highgate under a feigned name staying at newcome it might be nothing nothing gracious heavens could not this crime and misery be stopped it might be too late lauras husband said sadly bending down his head into the fire  she was silent too for a while i could see she was engaged where pious women ever will betake themselves in moments of doubt of grief of pain of separation of joy even or whatsoever other trial they have but to will and as it were an invisible temple rises round them their hearts can kneel down there and they have an audience of the great the merciful untiring counsellor and consoler she would not have been frightened at death near at hand i have known her to tend the poor round about us or to bear painnot her own merely but even her childrens and mine with a surprising outward constancy and calm but the idea of this crime being enacted close at hand and no help for itquite overcame her i believe she lay awake all that night and rose quite haggard and pale after the bitter thoughts which had deprived her of rest  she embraced her own child with extraordinary tenderness that morning and even wept over it calling it by a thousand fond names of maternal endearment would i leave you my darlingcould i ever ever ever quit you my blessing and treasure the unconscious little thing hugged to his mothers bosom and scared at her tones and tragic face clung frightened and weeping round lauras neck would you ask what the husbands feelings were as he looked at that sweet love that sublime tenderness that pure saint blessing the life of him unworthy of all the gifts of heaven to us below that felicity is the sum and the chief i tremble as i hold it lest i should lose it and be left alone in the blank world without it again i feel humiliated to think that i possess it as hastening home to a warm fireside and a plentiful table i feel ashamed sometimes before the poor outcast beggar shivering in the street  breakfast was scarcely over when laura asked for a pony carriage and said she was bent on a private visit she took her baby and nurse with her she refused our company and would not even say whither she was bound until she had passed the lodgegate i may have suspected what the object was of her journey florac and i did not talk of it we rode out to meet the hounds of a cheery winter morning on another day i might have been amused with my hostthe splendour of his raiment the neatness of his velvet cap the gloss of his huntingboots the cheers shouts salutations to dog and man the oaths and outcries of this nimrod who shouted louder than the whole field and the whole pack toobut on this morningi was thinking of the tragedy yonder enacting and came away early from the huntingfield and found my wife already returned to rosebury  laura had been as i suspected to lady clara she did not know why indeed she scarce knew what she should say when she arrivedhow she could say what she had in her mind i hoped arthur that i should have somethingsomething told me to say whispered laura with her head on my shoulder and as i lay awake last night thinking of her prayedthat is hoped i might find a word of consolation for that poor lady do you know i think she has hardly ever heard a kind word she said so she was very much affected after we had talked together a little  at first she was very indifferent cold and haughty in her manner asked what had caused the pleasure of this visit for i would go in though at the lodge they told me her ladyship was unwell and they thought received no company i said i wanted to show our boy to herthat the children ought to be acquaintedi dont know what i said she seemed more and more surprisedthen all of a suddeni dont know howi said lady clara i have had a dream about you and your children and i was so frightened that i came over to you to speak about it and i had the dream pen it came to me absolutely as i was speaking to her  she looked a little scared and i went on telling her the dream my dear i said i dreamed that i saw you happy with those children  happy says shethe three were playing in the conservatory into which her sittingroom opens  and that a bad spirit came and tore them from you and drove you out into the darkness and i saw you wandering about quite lonely and wretched and looking back into the garden where the children were playing and you asked and implored to see them and the keeper at the gate said no never and thenthen i thought they passed by you and they did not know you  ah said lady clara  and then i thought as we do in dreams you know that it was my child who was separated from me and who would not know me and oh what a pang that was fancy that let us pray god it was only a dream and worse than that when you when i implored to come to the child and the man said no never i thought there came a spiritan angel that fetched the child to heaven and you said let me come too oh let me come too i am so miserable and the angel said no never never  by this time lady clara was looking very pale what do you mean she asked of me laura continued  oh dear lady for the sake of the little ones and him who calls them to him go you with them never never part from them cling to his knees and take shelter there i took her hands and i said more to her in this way arthur that i need not that i ought not to speak again but she was touched at length when i kissed her and she said i was very kind to her and no one had ever been so and that she was quite alone in the world and had no friend to fly to and would i go and stay with her and i said yes and we must go my dear i think you should see that person at newcomesee him and warn him cried laura warming as she spoke and pray god to enlighten and strengthen him and to keep him from this temptation and implore him to leave this poor weak frightened trembling creature if he has the heart of a gentleman and the courage of a man he will i know he will  i think he would my dearest i said if he but heard the petitioner lauras cheeks were blushing her eyes brightened her voice rang with a sweet pathos of love that vibrates through my whole being sometimes it seems to me as if evil must give way and bad thoughts retire before that purest creature  why has she not some of her family with her poor thing my wife continued she perishes in that solitude her husband prevents her i thinkandohi know enough of him to know what his life is i shudder arthur to see you take the hand of that wicked selfish man you must break with him do you hear sir  before or after going to stay at his house my love asks mr pendennis  poor thing she lighted up at the idea of any one coming she ran and showed me the rooms we were to have it will be very stupid and you dont like that but you can write your book and still hunt and shoot with our friends here and lady anne newcome must be made to come back again sir barnes quarrelled with his mother and drove her out of the house on her last visitthink of that the servants here know it martha brought me the whole story from the housekeepers room this sir barnes newcome is a dreadful creature arthur i am so glad i loathed him from the very first moment i saw him  and into this ogres den you propose to put me and my family madam says the husband indeed where wont i go if you order me oh who will pack my portmanteau  florac and the princess were both in desolation when at dinner we announced our resolution to go awayand to our neighbours at newcome that was more extraordinary que diable goest thou to do in this galley asks our host as we sat alone over our wine  but lauras intended visit to lady clara was never to have a fulfilment for on this same evening as we sate at our dessert comes a messenger from newcome with a note for my wife from the lady there   dearest kindest mrs pendennis lady clara wrote with many italics and evidently in much distress of mind your visit is not to be i spoke about it to sir b who arrived this afternoon and who has already begun to treat me in his usual way oh i am so unhappy pray pray do not be angry at this rudenessthough indeed it is only a kindness to keep you from this wretched place i feel as if i cannot bear this much longer but whatever happens i shall always remember your goodness your beautiful goodness and kindness and shall worship you as an angel deserves to be worshipped oh why had i not such a friend earlier but alas i have noneonly this odious family thrust upon me for companions to the wretched lonely c n  pshe does not know of my writing do not be surprised if you get another note from me in the morning written in a ceremonious style and regretting that we cannot have the pleasure of receiving mr and mrs pendennis for the present at newcome  psthe hypocrite   this letter was handed to my wife at dinnertime and she gave it to me as she passed out of the room with the other ladies  i told florac that the newcomes could not receive us and that we would remain if he willed it his guests for a little longer the kind fellow was only too glad to keep us my wife would die without bebi he said she becomes quite dangerous about bebi it was gratifying that the good old lady was not to be parted as yet from the innocent object of her love  my host knew as well as i the terms upon which sir barnes and his wife were living their quarrels were the talk of the whole county one side brought forward his treatment of her and his conduct elsewhere and said that he was so bad that honest people should not know him the other party laid the blame upon her and declared that lady clara was a languid silly weak frivolous creature always crying out of season who had notoriously taken sir barnes for his money and who as certainly had had an attachment elsewhere yes the accusations were true on both sides a bad selfish husband had married a woman for her rank a weak thoughtless girl had been sold to a man for his money and the union which might have ended in a complete indifference had taken an ill turn and resulted in misery cruelty fierce mutual recriminations bitter tears shed in private husbands curses and maledictions and open scenes of wrath and violence for servants to witness and the world to sneer at we arrange such matches every day we sell or buy beauty or rank or wealth we inaugurate the bargain in churches with sacramental services in which the parties engaged call upon heaven to witness their vowswe know them to be lies and we seal them with gods name i barnes promise to take you clara to love and honour till death do us part i clara promise to take you barnes etc etc who has not heard the ancient words and how many of us have uttered them knowing them to be untrue and is there a bishop on the bench that has not amend the humbug in his lawn sleeves and called a blessing over the kneeling perjurers  does mr harris know of newcomes return florac asked when i acquainted him with this intelligence ce scelerat de highgateva  does newcome know that lord highgate is here i thought within myself admiring my wifes faithfulness and simplicity and trying to believe with that pure and guileless creature that it was not yet too late to save the unhappy lady clara  mr harris had best be warned i said to florac will you write him a word and let us send a messenger to newcome  at first florac said parbleu no the affair was none of his he attended himself always to this result of lady claras marriage he had even complimented jack upon it years before at baden when scenes enough tragic enough comical ma foi had taken place apropos of this affair why should he meddle with it now  children dishonoured said i honest families made miserable for heavens sake florac let us stay this catastrophe if we can i spoke with much warmth eagerly desirous to avert this calamity if possible and very strongly moved by the tale which i had heard only just before dinner from that noble and innocent creature whose pure heart had already prompted her to plead the cause of right and truth and to try and rescue an unhappy desperate sister trembling on the verge of ruin  if you will not write to him said i in some heat if your grooms dont like to go out of a night this was one of the objections which florac had raised i will walk we were talking over the affair rather late in the evening the ladies having retreated to their sleeping apartments and some guests having taken leave whom our hospitable host and hostess had entertained that night and before whom i naturally did not care to speak upon a subject so dangerous  parbleu what virtue my friend what a joseph cries florac puffing his cigar one sees well that your wife had made you the sermon my poor pendennis you are henpecked my pauvre bon you become the husband model it is true my mother writes that thy wife is an angel  i do not object to obey such a woman when she bids me do right i said and would indeed at that womans request have gone out upon the errand but that we here found another messenger on days when dinnerparties were held at rosebury certain auxiliary waiters used to attend from newcome whom the landlord of the kings arms was accustomed to supply indeed it was to secure these and make other necessary arrangements respecting fish game etc that the prince de moncontour had ridden over to newcome on the day when we met lord highgate alias mr harris before the bar of the hotel whilst we were engaged in the above conversation a servant enters and says my lord jenkins and the other man is going back to newcome in their cart and is there anything wanted  it is the heaven which sends him says florac turning round to me with a laugh make jenkins to wait five minutes robert i have to write to a gentleman at the kings arms and so saying florac wrote a line which he showed me and having sealed the note directed it to mr harris at the kings arms the cart the note and the assistant waiters departed on their way to newcome florac bade me go to rest with a clear conscience in truth the warning was better given in that way than any other and a word from florac was more likely to be effectual than an expostulation from me i had never thought of making it perhaps except at the expressed desire of a lady whose counsel in all the difficult circumstances of life i own i am disposed to take  mr jenkinss horse no doubt trotted at a very brisk pace as gentlemens horses will of a frosty night after their masters have been regaled with plentiful supplies of wine and ale i remember in my bachelor days that my horses always trotted quicker after i had had a good dinner the champagne used to communicate itself to them somehow and the claret get into their heels before midnight the letter for mr harris was in mr harriss hands in the kings arms  it has been said that in the boscawen room at the arms some of the jolly fellows of newcome had a club of which parrot the auctioneer tom potts the talented reporter now editor of the independent vidler the apothecary and other gentlemen were members  when we first had occasion to mention that society it was at an early stage of this history long before clive newcomes fine moustache had grown if vidler the apothecary was old and infirm then he is near ten years older now he has had various assistants of course and one of them of late years had his become his partner though the firm continues to be known by villers ancient and respectable name a jovial fellow was this partnera capital convivial member of the jolly britons where he used to sit very late so as to be in readiness for any nightwork that might come in  so the britons were all sitting smoking drinking and making merry in the boscawen room when jenkins enters with a note which he straightway delivers to mr vidlers partner from rosebury the princess ill again i suppose says the surgeon not sorry to let the company know that he attends her i wish the old girl would be ill in the daytime confound it says he whats this and he reads out sir newcome est de retour bon voyage mon amif what does this mean  i thought you knew french jack harris says tom potts youre always bothering us with your french songs  of course i know french says the other but whats the meaning of this  screwcome came back by the five oclock train i was in it and his royal highness would scarcely speak to me took browns fly from the station brown wont enrich his family much by the operation says mr potts  but what do i care cries jack harris we dont attend him and we dont lose much by that howell attends him ever since vidler and he had that row  hulloh i say its a mistake cries mr taplow smoking in his chair this letter is for the party in the benbow the gent which the prince spoke to him and called him jack the other day when he was here heres a nice business and the seal broke and all is the benbow party gone to bed john you must carry him in this here note john quite innocent of the note and its contents for he that moment had entered the clubroom with mr pottss supper took the note to the benbow from which he presently returned to his master with a very scared countenance he said the gent in the benbow was a most harbitrary gent he had almost choked john after reading the letter and john wouldnt stand it and when john said he supposed that mr harris in the boscawenthat mr jack harris had opened the letter the other gent cursed and swore awful  potts said taplow who was only too communicative on some occasions after he had imbibed too much of his own brandyandwater its my belief that that partys name is no more harris than mine is i have sent his linen to the wash and there was two white pockethandkerchiefs with h and a coronet  on the next day we drove over to newcome hoping perhaps to find that lord highgate had taken the warning sent to him and quitted the place but we were disappointed he was walking in front of the hotel where a thousand persons might see him as well as ourselves  we entered into his private apartment with him and there expostulated upon his appearance in the public street where barnes newcome or any passerby might recognise him he then told us of the mishap which had befallen floracs letter on the previous night  i cant go away now whatever might have happened previously by this time that villain knows that i am here if i go he will say i was afraid of him and ran away oh how i wish he would come and find me he broke out with a savage laugh  it is best to run away one of us interposed sadly  pendennis he said with a tone of great softness your wife is a good woman god bless her god bless her for all she has said and donewould have done if that villain had let her do you know the poor thing hasnt a single friend in the world not one oneexcept me and that girl they are selling to farintosh and who does not count for much he has driven away all her friends from her one and all turn upon her her relations of course when did they ever fail to hit a poor fellow or a poor girl when she was down the poor angel the mother who sold her comes and preaches at her kews wife turns up her little cursed nose and scorns her rooster forsooth must ride high the horse now he is married and lives at chanticlere and give her warning to avoid my company or his do you know the only friend she ever had was that old woman with the stickold kew the old witch whom they buried four months ago after nobbling her money for the beauty of the family she used to protect herthat old woman heaven bless her for it wherever she is now the old haga good word wont do her any harm ha ha his laughter was cruel to hear  why did i come down he continued in reply to our sad queries why did i come down do you ask because she was wretched and sent for me because if i was at the end of the world and she was to say jack come id come  and if she bade you go asked his friends  i would go and i have gone if she told me to jump into the sea do you think i would not do it but i go and when she is alone with him do you know what he does he strikes her strikes that poor little thing he has owned to it she fled from him and sheltered with the old woman whos dead he may be doing it now why did i ever shake hands with him thats humiliation sufficient isnt it but she wished it and id black his boots curse him if she told me and because he wanted to keep my money in his confounded bank and because he knew he might rely upon my honour and hers poor dear child he chooses to shake hands with meme whom he hates worse than a thousand devilsand quite right too why isnt there a place where we can go and meet like man to man and have it over if i had a ball through my brains i shouldnt mind i tell you ive a mind to do it for myself pendennis you dont understand me viscount  il est vrai said florac with a shrug i comprehend neither the suicide nor the chaisedeposte what will you i am not yet enough english my friend we make marriages of convenance in our country que diable and what follows follows but no scandal afterwards do not adopt our institutions a demi my friend vous ne me comprenez pas non plus men pauvre jack  there is one way still i think said the third of the speakers in this scene let lord highgate come to rosebury in his own name leaving that of mr harris behind him if sir barnes newcome wants you he can seek you there if you will go as go you should and god speed you you can go and in your own name too  parbleu cest ca cries florac he speaks like a bookthe romancier i confess for my part i thought that a good woman might plead with him and touch that manly not disloyal heart now trembling on the awful balance between evil and good  allons let us make to come the drague cries florac jack thou returnest with us my friend madame pendennis an angel my friend a quakre the most charming shall roucoule to thee the sweetest sermons my wife shall tend thee like a mothera grandmother go make thy packet  lord highgate was very much pleased and relieved seemingly he shook our hands he said he should never forget our kindness never in truth the didactic part of our conversation was carried on at much greater length than as here noted down and he would come that evening but not with us thank you he had a particular engagement some letters he must write those done he would not fail us and would be at rosebury by dinnertime     chapter lviii one more unfortunate   the fates did not ordain that the plan should succeed which lord highgates friends had devised for lady claras rescue or respite he was bent upon one more interview with the unfortunate lady and in that meeting the future destiny of their luckless lives was decided on the morning of his return home barnes newcome had information that lord highgate under a feigned name had been staying in the neighbourhood of his house and had repeatedly been seen in the company of lady clara she may have gone out to meet him but for one hour more she had taken no leave of her children on the day when she left her home and far from making preparations for her own departure had been engaged in getting the house ready for the reception of members of the family whose arrival her husband announced as speedily to follow his own ethel and lady anne and some of the children were coming lord farintoshs mother and sisters were to follow it was to be a reunion previous to the marriage which was closer to unite the two families lady clara said yes to her husbands orders rose mechanically to obey his wishes and arrange for the reception of the guests and spoke tremblingly to the housekeeper as her husband gibed at her the little ones had been consigned to bed early and before sir barness arrival he did not think fit to see them in their sleep nor did their mother she did not know as the poor little creatures left her room in charge of their nurses that she looked on them for the last time perhaps had she gone to their bedsides that evening had the wretched panicstricken soul been allowed leisure to pause and to think and to pray the fate of the morrow might have been otherwise and the trembling balance of the scale have inclined to rights side but the pause was not allowed her her husband came and saluted her with his accustomed greetings of scorn and sarcasm and brutal insult on a future day he never dared to call a servant of his household to testify to his treatment of her though many were ready to attend to prove his cruelty and her terror on that very last night lady claras maid a country girl from her fathers house at chanticlere told sir barnes in the midst of a conjugal dispute that her lady might bear his conduct but she could not and that she would no longer live under the roof of such a brute the girls interference was not likely to benefit her mistress much the wretched lady clara passed the last night under the roof of her husband and children unattended save by this poor domestic who was about to leave her in tears and hysterical outcries and then in moaning stupor lady clara put to sleep with laudanum her maid carried down the story of her wrongs to the servants quarters and half a dozen of them took in their resignation to sir barnes as he sat over his breakfast the next morningin his ancestral hallsurrounded by the portraits of his august forefathersin his happy home  their mutiny of course did not add to their masters goodhumour and his letters brought him news which increased barness fury a messenger arrived with a letter from his man of business at newcome upon the receipt of which be started up with such an execration as frightened the servant waiting on him and letter in hand he ran to lady claras sittingroom her ladyship was up sir barnes breakfasted rather late on the first morning after an arrival at newcome he had to look over the bailiffs books and to look about him round the park and grounds to curse the gardeners to damn the stable and kennel grooms to yell at the woodman for clearing not enough or too much to rail at the poor old workpeople brooming away the fallen leaves etc so lady clara was up and dressed when her husband went to her room which lay at the end of the house as we have said the last of a suite of ancestral halls  the mutinous servant heard high voices and curses within then lady claras screams then sir barnes newcome burst out of the room locking the door and taking the key with him and saluting with more curses james the mutineer over whom his master ran  curse your wife and dont curse me sir barnes newcome said james the mutineer and knocked down a hand which the infuriated baronet raised against him with an arm that was twice as strong as barness own this man and maid followed their mistress in the sad journey upon which she was bent they treated her with unalterable respect they never could be got to see that her conduct was wrong when barness counsel subsequently tried to impugn their testimony they dared him and hurt the plaintiffs case very much for the balance had weighed over and it was barnes himself who caused what now ensued and what we learned in a very few hours afterwards from newcome where it was the talk of the whole neighbourhood  florac and i as yet ignorant of all that was occurring met barnes near his own lodgegate riding in the direction of newcome as we were ourselves returning to rosebury the prince de moncontour who was driving affably saluted the baronet who gave us a scowling recognition and rode on his groom behind him the figure of the garcon says florac as our acquaintance passed is not agreeable of pale he has become livid i hope these two men will not meet or evil will come evil to barnes there might be floracs companion thought who knew the previous little affairs between barnes and his uncle and cousin and that lord highgate was quite able to take care of himself  in half an hour after florac spoke that meeting between barnes and highgate actually had taken placein the open square of newcome within four doors of the kings arms inn close to which lives sir barnes newcomes man of business and before which mr harris as he was called was walking and waiting till a carriage which he had ordered came round from the inn yard as sir barnes newcome rode into the place many people touched their hats to him however little they loved him he was bowing and smirking to one of these when he suddenly saw belsize  he started back causing his horse to back with him on to the pavement and it may have been rage and fury or accident and nervousness merely but at this instant barnes newcome looking towards lord highgate shook his whip  you cowardly villain said the other springing forward i was going to your house  how dare you sir cries sir barnes still holding up that unlucky cane how dare you toto  dare you scoundrel said belsize is that the cane you strike your wife with you ruffian belsize seized and tore him out of the saddle flinging him screaming down on the pavement the horse rearing and making way for himself galloped down the clattering street a hundred people were round sir barnes in a moment  the carriage which belsize had ordered came round at this very juncture amidst the crowd shrinking bustling expostulating threatening who pressed about him he shouldered his way mr taplow aghast was one of the hundred spectators of the scene  i am lord highgate said barness adversary if sir barnes newcome wants me tell him i will send him word where he may hear of me and getting into the carriage he told the driver to go to the usual place  imagine the hubbub in the town the conclaves at the inns the talks in the countinghouses the commotion amongst the factory people the paragraphs in the newcome papers the bustle of surgeons and lawyers after this event crowds gathered at the kings arms and waited round mr speers the lawyers house into which sir barnes was carried in vain policemen told them to move on fresh groups gathered after the seceders on the next day when barnes newcome who was not much hurt had a fly to go home a factory man shook his fist in at the carriage window and with a curse said serve you right you villain it was the man whose sweetheart this don juan had seduced and deserted years before whose wrongs were well known amongst his mates a leader in the chorus of hatred which growled round barnes newcome  barness mother and sister ethel had reached newcome shortly before the return of the master of the house the people there were in disturbance lady anne and miss newcome came out with pallid looks to greet him he laughed and reassured them about his accident indeed his hurt had been trifling he had been bled by the surgeon a little jarred by the fall from his horse but there was no sort of danger still their pale and doubtful looks continued what caused them in the open day with a servant attending her lady clara newcome had left her husbands house and a letter was forwarded to him that same evening from my lord highgate informing sir barnes newcome that lady clara pulleyn could bear his tyranny no longer and had left his roof that lord highgate proposed to leave england almost immediately but would remain long enough to afford sir barnes newcome the opportunity for an interview in case he should be disposed to demand one and a friend of lord highgates late regiment was named who would receive letters and act in any way necessary for his lordship  the debates of the house of lords must tell what followed afterwards in the dreary history of lady clara pulleyn the proceedings in the newcome divorce bill filled the usual number of columns in the papersespecially the sunday papers the witnesses were examined by learned peers whose businessnay pleasureit seems to be to enter into such matters and for the ends of justice and morality doubtless the whole story of barnes newcomes household was told to the british public in the previous trial in the court of queens bench how grandly serjeant rowland stood up for the rights of british husbands with what pathos he depicted the conjugal paradise the innocent children prattling round their happy parents the serpent the destroyer entering into that belgravian eden the wretched and deserted husband alone by his desecrated hearth and calling for redress on his country rowland wept freely during his noble harangue at not a shilling under twenty thousand pounds would he estimate the cost of his clients injuries the jury was very much affected the evening papers gave rowlands address in extenso with some pretty sharp raps at the aristocracy in general the day the principal morning journal of that period came out with a leading article the next morning in which every party concerned and every institution was knocked about the disgrace of the peerage the ruin of the monarchy with a retrospective view of the wellknown case of gyges and candaules the monstrosity of the crime and the absurdity of the tribunal and the punishment were all set forth in the terrible leading article of the day  but when on the next day serjeant rowland was requested to call witnesses to prove that connubial happiness which he had depicted so pathetically he had none at hand  oliver qc now had his innings a man a husband and a father mr oliver could not attempt to defend the conduct of his unfortunate client but if there could be any excuse for such conduct that excuse he was free to confess the plaintiff had afforded whose cruelty and neglect twenty witnesses in court were ready to proveneglect so outrageous cruelty so systematic that he wondered the plaintiff had not been better advised than to bring this trial with all its degrading particulars to a public issue on the very day when the illomened marriage took place another victim of cruelty had interposed as vainlyas vainly as serjeant rowland himself interposed in court to prevent this case being made knownand with piteous outcries in the name of outraged neglected woman of castaway children pleading in vain for bread had besought the bride to pause and the bridegroom to look upon the wretched beings who owed him life why had not lady clara pulleyns friends listened to that appeal and so on and so on between rowland and oliver the battle waged fiercely that day many witnesses were mauled and slain out of that combat scarce anybody came well except the two principal champions rowland serjeant and oliver qc the whole country looked on and heard the wretched story not only of barness fault and highgates fault but of the private peccadilloes of their suborned footmen and conspiring housemaids mr justice c sawyer charged the jury at great lengththose men were respectable men and fathers of families themselvesof course they dealt full measure to lord highgate for his delinquencies consoled the injured husband with immense damages and left him free to pursue the further steps for releasing himself altogether from the tie which had been bound with affecting episcopal benediction at st georges hanover square  so lady clara flies from the custody of her tyrant but to what a rescue the very man who loves her and gives her asylum pities and deplores her she scarce dares to look out of the windows of her new home upon the world lest it should know and reproach her all the sisterhood of friendship is cut off from her if she dares to go abroad she feels the sneer of the world as she goes through it and knows that malice and scorn whisper behind her people as criminal but undiscovered make room for her as if her touch were pollution she knows she has darkened the lot and made wretched the home of the man whom she loves best that his friends who see her treat her with but a doubtful respect and the domestics who attend her with a suspicious obedience in the country lanes or the streets of the county town neighbours look aside as the carriage passes in which she sits splendid and lonely rough hunting companions of her husbands come to her table he is driven perforce to the company of flatterers and men of inferior sort his equals at least in his own home will not live with him she would be kind perhaps and charitable to the cottagers round about her but she fears to visit them lest they too should scorn her the clergyman who distributes her charities blushes and looks awkward on passing her in the village if he should be walking with his wife or one of his children shall they go to the continent and set up a grand house at paris or at florence there they can get society but of what a sort our acquaintances of badenmadame schlangenbad and madame de cruchecassee and madame divry and messrs loder and punter and blackball and deuceace will come and dance and flirt and quarrel and gamble and feast round about her but what in common with such wild people has this poor timid shrinking soul even these scorn her the leers and laughter on those painted faces are quite unlike her own sad countenance she has no reply to their wit their infernal gaiety scares her more than the solitude at home no wonder that her husband does not like home except for a short while in the hunting season no wonder that he is away all day how can he like a home which she has made so wretched in the midst of her sorrow and doubt and misery a child comes to her how she clings to it how her whole being and hope and passion centres itself on this feeble infantbut she no more belongs to our story with the new name she has taken the poor lady passes out of the history of the newcomes  if barnes newcomes children meet yonder solitary lady do they know her if her oncehusband thinks upon the unhappy young creature whom his cruelty drove from him does his conscience affect his sleep at night why should sir barnes newcomes conscience be more squeamish than his countrys which has put money in his pocket for having trampled on the poor weak young thing and scorned her and driven her to ruin when the whole of the accounts of that wretched bankruptcy are brought up for final audit which of the unhappy partners shall be shown to be most guilty does the right reverend prelate who did the benedictory business for barnes and clara his wife repent in secret do the parents who pressed the marriage and the fine folks who signed the book and ate the breakfast and applauded the bridegrooms speech feel a little ashamed o hymen hymenaee the bishops beadles clergy pewopeners and other officers of the temple dedicated to heaven under the invocation of st george will officiate in the same place at scores and scores more of such marriages and st george of england may behold virgin after virgin offered up to the devouring monster mammon with many most respectable female dragons looking onmay see virgin after virgin given away just as in the soldan of babylons time but with never a champion to come to the rescue     chapter lix in which achilles loses briseis   although the years of the marquis of farintosh were few he had spent most of them in the habit of command and from his childhood upwards had been obeyed by all persons round about him as an infant he had but to roar and his mother and nurses were as much frightened as though he had been a libyan lion what he willed and ordered was law amongst his clan and family during the period of his london and parisian dissipations his poor mother did not venture to remonstrate with her young prodigal but shut her eyes not daring to open them on his wild courses as for the friends of his person and house many of whom were portly elderly gentlemen their affection for the young marquis was so extreme that there was no company into which their fidelity would not lead them to follow him and you might see him dancing at mabille with veteran aidesdecamp looking on or disporting with operadancers at a trois freres banquet which some old gentleman of his fathers age had taken the pains to order if his lordship count almaviva wants a friend to carry the lanthorn or to hold the ladder do you suppose there are not many most respectable men in society who will act figaro when farintosh thought fit in the fulness of time and the blooming pride of manhood to select a spouse and to elevate a marchioness to his throne no one dared gainsay him when he called upon his mother and sisters and their ladyships hangerson and attendants upon his own particular kinsmen led captains and toadies to bow the knee and do homage to the woman whom he delighted to honour those duteous subjects trembled and obeyed in fact he thought that the position of a marchioness of farintosh was under heaven and before men so splendid that had he elevated a beggarmaid to that sublime rank the inferior world was bound to worship her  so my lords ladymother and my lords sisters and his captains and his players of billiards and the toadies of his august person all performed obeisance to his brideelect and never questioned the will of the young chieftain what were the private comments of the ladies of the family we had no means of knowing but it may naturally be supposed that his lordships gentlemeninwaiting captain henchman jack todhunter and the rest had many misgivings of their own respecting their patrons change in life and could not view without anxiety the advent of a mistress who might reign over him and them who might possibly not like their company and might exert her influence over her husband to oust these honest fellows from places in which they were very comfortable the jovial rogues had the run of my lords kitchen stables cellars and cigarboxes a new marchioness might hate hunting smoking jolly parties and toadeaters in general or might bring into the house favourites of her own i am sure any kindhearted man of the world must feel for the position of these faithful doubtful disconsolate vassals and have a sympathy for their rueful looks and demeanour as they eye the splendid preparations for the ensuing marriage the grand furniture sent to my lords castles and houses the magnificent plate provided for his tablestables at which they may never have a knife and fork castles and houses of which the poor rogues may never be allowed to pass the doors  when then the elopement in high life which has been described in the previous pages burst upon the town in the morning papers i can fancy the agitation which the news occasioned in the faithful bosoms of the generous todhunter and the attached henchman my lord was not in his own house as yet he and his friends still lingered on in the little house in mayfair the dear little bachelors quarters where they had enjoyed such good dinners such good suppers such rare doings such a jolly time i fancy hench coming down to breakfast and reading the morning post i imagine tod dropping in from his bedroom over the way and hench handing the paper over to tod and the conversation which ensued between those worthy men elopement in high lifeexcitement in ncome and flight of lady cl ncome daughter of the late and sister of the present earl of drking with lord hgate personal rencontre between lord hgate and sir bnes ncome extraordinary disclosures i say i can fancy hench and tod over this awful piece of news  pretty news aint it toddy says henchman looking up from a perigordpie which the faithful creature is discussing  always expected it remarks the other anybody who saw them together last season must have known it the chief himself spoke of it to me  itll cut him up awfully when he reads it is it in the morning post he has the post in his bedroom i know he has rung his bell i heard it bowman has his lordship read his paper yet  bowman the valet said i believe you he have read his paper when he read it he jumped out of bed and swore most awful i cut as soon as i could continued mr bowman who was on familiarnay contemptuous terms with the other two gentlemen  enough to make any man swear says toddy to henchman and both were alarmed in their noble souls reflecting that their chieftain was now actually getting up and dressing himself that he would speedily and in course of nature come downstairs and then most probably would begin swearing at them  the most noble mungo malcolm angus was in an awful state of mind when at length he appeared in the breakfastroom why the dash do you make a taproom of this he cries the trembling henchman who has begun to smokeas he has done a hundred times before in this bachelors hallflings his cigar into the fire  there you gonothing like it why dont you fling some more in you can get em at hudsons for five guineas a pound bursts out the youthful peer  i understand why you are out of sorts old boy says henchman stretching out his manly hand a tear of compassion twinkled in his eyelid and coursed down his mottled cheek cut away at old frank farintosha fellow who has been attached to you since before you could speak its not when a fellows down and cut up and rilednaturally riledas you arei know you are marquis its not then that im going to be angry with you pitch into old frank henchmanhit away my young one and frank put himself into an attitude as of one prepared to receive a pugilistic assault he bared his breast as it were and showed his scars and said strike frank henchman was a florid toady my uncle major pendennis has often laughed with me about the fellows pompous flatteries and ebullient fidelity  you have read this confounded paragraph says the marquis we have read it and were deucedly cut up too says henchman for your sake my dear boy  i remembered what you said last year marquis cries todhunter not unadroitly you yourself pointed out in this very room i recollect at this very tablethat night coralie and the little spanish dancer and her mother supped here and there was a talk about highgateyou yourself pointed out what was likely to happen i doubted it for i have dined at the newcomes and seen highgate and her together in society often but though you are a younger bird you have better eyes than i haveand you saw the thing at onceat once dont you remember i and coralie said how glad she was because sir barnes illtreated her friend what was the name of coralies friend hench  how should i know her confounded name henchman briskly answers what do i care for sir barnes newcome and his private affairs he is no friend of mine i never said he was a friend of mine i never said i liked him out of respect for the chief here i held my tongue about him and shall hold my tongue have some of this pate chief no poor old boy i know you havent got an appetite i know this news cuts you up i say nothing and make no pretence of condolence though i feel for youand you know you can count on old frank henchmandont you malcolm and again he turns away to conceal his gallant sensibility and generous emotion  what does it matter to me bursts out the marquis garnishing his conversation with the usual expletives which adorned his eloquence when he was strongly moved what do i care for barnes newcome and his confounded affairs and family i never want to see him again but in the light of a banker when i go to the city where he keeps my account i say i have nothing to do with him or all the newcomes under the sun why one of them is a painter and will paint my dog ratcatcher by jove or my horse or my groom if i give him the order do you think i care for any one of the pack its not the fault of the marchioness of farintosh that her family is not equal to mine besides two others in england and scotland i should like to know what family is i tell you what hench i bet you five to two that before an hour is over my mother will be here and down on her knees to me begging me to break off this engagement  and what will you do farintosh asks henchman slowly will you break it off  no shouts the marquis why shall i break off with the finest girl in englandand the bestplucked one and the cleverest and wittiest and the most beautiful creature by jove that ever stepped for no fault of hers and because her sisterinlaw leaves her brother who i know treated her infernally we have talked this matter over at home before i wouldnt dine with the fellow though he was always asking me nor meet except just out of civility any of his confounded family lady anne is different she is a lady she is she is a good woman and kew is a most respectable man though he is only a peer of george iiis creation and you should hear how he speaks of miss newcome though she refused him i should like to know who is to prevent me marrying lady anne newcomes daughter  by jove you are a goodplucked fellow farintoshgive me your hand old boy says henchman  heh am i you would have said give me your hand old boy whichever way i determined hench i tell you i aint intellectual and that sort of thing but i know my rank and i know my place and when a man of my station gives his word he sticks to it sir and my lady and my sisters may go on their knees all round and by jove i wont flinch  the justice of lord farintoshs views was speedily proved by the appearance of his lordships mother lady glenlivat whose arrival put a stop to a conversation which captain francis henchman has often subsequently narrated she besought to see her son in terms so urgent that the young nobleman could not be denied to his parent and no doubt a long and interesting interview took place in which lord farintoshs mother passionately implored him to break off a match upon which he was as resolutely bent  was it a sense of honour a longing desire to possess this young beauty and call her his own or a fierce and profound dislike to being balked in any object of his wishes which actuated the young lord certainly he had borne very philosophically delay after delay which had taken place in the devised union and being quite sure of his mistress had not cared to press on the marriage but lingered over the dregs of his bachelor cup complacently still we all know in what an affecting farewell he took leave of the associates of his vie de garcon the speeches made in both languages the presents distributed the tears and hysterics of some of the guests assembled the cigarboxes given over to this friend the ecrin of diamonds to that et caetera et caetera et caetera dont we know if we dont it is not henchmans fault who has told the story of farintoshs betrothals a thousand and one times at his clubs at the houses where he is asked to dine on account of his intimacy with the nobility among the young men of fashion or no fashion whom this twobottle mentor and burly admirer of youth has since taken upon himself to form the farewell at greenwich was so affecting that all traversed the cart and took another farewell at richmond where there was crying too but it was eucharis cried because fair calypso wanted to tear her eyes out and where not only telemachus as was natural to his age but mentor likewise quaffed the winecup too freely you are virtuous o reader but there are still cakes and ale ask henchman if there be not you will find him in the park any afternoon he will dine with you if no better man ask him in the interval he will tell you story upon story regarding young lord farintosh and his marriage and what happened before his marriage and afterwards and he will sigh weep almost at some moments as he narrates their subsequent quarrel and farintoshs unworthy conduct and tells you how he formed that young man my uncle and captain henchman disliked each other very much i am sorry to saysorry to add that it was very amusing to hear either one of them speak of the other  lady glenlivat according to the captain then had no success in the interview with her son who unmoved by the maternal tears commands and entreaties swore he would marry miss newcome and that no power on earth should prevent him as if trying to thwart that man could ever prevent his having his way ejaculated his quondam friend  but on the next day after ten thousand men in clubs and coteries had talked the news over after the evening had repeated and improved the delightful theme of our morning contemporaries after calypso and eucharis driving together in the park and reconciled now had kissed their hands to lord farintosh and made him their complimentsafter a night of natural doubt disturbance defiance furyas men whispered to each other at the club where his lordship dined and at the theatre where he took his recreationafter an awful time at breakfast in which messrs bowman valet and todhunter and henchman captains of the farintosh bodyguard all got their share of kicks and growlingbehold lady glenlivat came back to the charge again and this time with such force that poor lord farintosh was shaken indeed  her ladyships ally was no other than miss newcome herself from whom lord farintoshs mother received by that days post a letter which she was commissioned to read to her son   dear madam wrote the young lady in her firmest handwritingmamma is at this moment in a state of such grief and dismay at the cruel misfortune and humiliation which has just befallen our family that she is really not able to write to you as she ought and this task painful as it is must be mine dear lady glenlivat the kindness and confidence which i have ever received from you and yours merit truth and most grateful respect and regard from me and i feel after the late fatal occurrence what i have often and often owned to myself though i did not dare to acknowledge it that i ought to release lord f at once and for ever from an engagement which he could never think of maintaining with a family so unfortunate as ours i thank him with all my heart for his goodness in bearing with my humours so long if i have given him pain as i know i have sometimes i beg his pardon and would do so on my knees i hope and pray he may be happy as i feared he never could be with me he has many good and noble qualities and in bidding him farewell i trust i may retain his friendship and that he will believe in the esteem and gratitude of your most sincere ethel newcome   a copy of this farewell letter was seen by a lady who happened to be a neighbour of miss newcomes when the family misfortune occurred and to whom in her natural dismay and grief the young lady fled for comfort and consolation dearest mrs pendennis wrote miss ethel to my wife i hear you are at rosebury do do come to your affectionate e n the next day it wasdearest lauraif you can pray pray come to newcome this morning i want very much to speak to you about the poor children to consult you about something most important madame de moncontours ponycarriage was constantly trotting between rosebury and newcome in these days of calamity  and my wife as in duty bound gave me full reports of all that happened in that house of mourning on the very day of the flight lady anne her daughter and some others of her family arrived at newcome the deserted little girl barness eldest child ran with tears and cries of joy to her aunt ethel whom she had always loved better than her mother and clung to her and embraced her and in her artless little words told her that mamma had gone away and that ethel should be her mamma now very strongly moved by the misfortune as by the caresses and affection of the poor orphaned creature ethel took the little girl to her heart and promised to be a mother to her and that she would not leave her in which pious resolve i scarcely need say laura strengthened her when at her young friends urgent summons my wife came to her  the household at newcome was in a state of disorganisation after the catastrophe two of lady claras servants it has been stated already went away with her the luckless master of the house was lying wounded in the neighbouring town lady anne newcome his mother was terribly agitated by the news which was abruptly broken to her of the flight of her daughterinlaw and her sons danger now she thought of flying to newcome to nurse him and then feared lest she should be ill received by the invalidindeed ordered by sir barnes to go home and not to bother him so at home lady anne remained where the thoughts of the sufferings she had already undergone in that house of sir barness cruel behaviour to her at her last visit which he had abruptly requested her to shorten of the happy days which she had passed as mistress of that house and wife of the defunct sir brian the sight of that departed angels picture in the diningroom and wheelchair in the gallery the recollection of little barnes as a cherub of a child in that very gallery and pulled out of the fire by a nurse in the second year of his age when he was all that a fond mother could wishthese incidents and reminiscences so agitated lady anne newcome that she for her part went off in a series of hysterical fits and acted as one distraught her second daughter screamed in sympathy with her and miss newcome had to take the command of the whole of this demented household hysterical mamma and sister mutineering servants and shrieking abandoned nursery and bring young people and old to peace and quiet  on the morrow after his little concussion sir barnes newcome came home not much hurt in body but woefully afflicted in temper and venting his wrath upon everybody round about him in that strong language which he employed when displeased and under which his valet his housekeeper his butler his farmbailiff his lawyer his doctor his dishevelled mother herselfwho rose from her couch and her salvolatile to fling herself round her dear boys kneesall had to suffer ethel newcome the baronets sister was the only person in his house to whom sir barnes did not utter oaths or proffer rude speeches he was afraid of offending her or encountering that resolute spirit and lapsed into a surly silence in her presence indistinct maledictions growled about sir barness chair when he beheld my wifes ponycarriage drive up and he asked what brought her here but ethel sternly told her brother that mrs pendennis came at her particular request and asked him whether he supposed anybody could come into that house for pleasure now or for any other motive but kindness upon which sir barnes fairly burst out into tears intermingled with execrations against his enemies and his own fate and assertions that he was the most miserable beggar alive he would not see his children but with more tears he would implore ethel never to leave them and anon would ask what he should do when she married and he was left alone in that infernal house  t potts esq of the newcome independent used to say afterwards that the baronet was in the direst terror of another meeting with lord highgate and kept a policeman at the lodgegate and a second in the kitchen to interpose in event of a collision but mr potts made this statement in after days when the quarrel between his party and paper and sir barnes newcome was flagrant five or six days after the meeting of the two rivals in newcome marketplace sir barnes received a letter from the friend of lord highgate informing him that his lordship having waited for him according to promise had now left england and presumed that the differences between them were to be settled by their respective lawyersinfamous behaviour on a par with the rest of lord highgates villainy the baronet said when the scoundrel knew i could lift my pistol arm barnes said lord highgate fled the countrythus hinting that death and not damages were what he intended to seek from his enemy  after that interview in which ethel communicated to laura her farewell letter to lord farintosh my wife returned to rosebury with an extraordinary brightness and gaiety in her face and her demeanour she pressed madame de moncontours hands with such warmth she blushed and looked so handsome she sang and talked so gaily that our host was struck by her behaviour and paid her husband more compliments regarding her beauty amiability and other good qualities than need be set down here it may be that i like paul de florac so much in spite of certain undeniable faults of character because of his admiration for my wife she was in such a hurry to talk to me that night that pauls game and nicotian amusements were cut short by her visit to the billiardroom and when we were alone by the cosy dressingroom fire she told me what had happened during the day why should ethels refusal of lord farintosh have so much elated my wife  ah cries mrs pendennis she has a generous nature and the world has not had time to spoil it do you know there are many points that she never has thought ofi would say problems that she has to work out for herself only you pen do not like us poor ignorant women to use such a learned word as problems life and experience force things upon her mind which others learn from their parents or those who educate them but for which she has never had any teachers nobody has ever told her arthur that it was wrong to marry without love or pronounce lightly those awful vows which we utter before god at the altar i believe if she knew that her life was futile it is but of late she has thought it could be otherwise and that she might mend it i have read besides that poem of goethe of which you are so fond in books of indian travels of bayaderes dancinggirls brought up by troops round about the temples whose calling is to dance and wear jewels and look beautiful i believe they are quite respected inin pagodaland they perform before the priests in the pagodas and the brahmins and the indian princes marry them can we cry out against these poor creatures or against the custom of their country it seems to me that young women in our world are bred up in a way not very different what they do they scarcely know to be wrong they are educated for the world and taught to display their mothers will give them to the richest suitor as they themselves were given before how can these think seriously arthur of souls to be saved weak hearts to be kept out of temptation prayers to be uttered and a better world to be held always in view when the vanities of this one are all their thought and scheme ethels simple talk made me smile sometimes do you know and her strenuous way of imparting her discoveries i thought of the shepherd boy who made a watch and found on taking it into the town how very many watches there were and how much better than his but the poor child has had to make hers for herself such as it is and indeed is employed now in working on it she told me very artlessly her little history arthur it affected me to hear her simple talk andand i blessed god for our mother my dear and that my early days had had a better guide  you know that for a long time it was settled that she was to marry her cousin lord kew she was bred to that notion from her earliest youth about which she spoke as we all can about our early days they were spent she said in the nursery and schoolroom for the most part she was allowed to come to her mothers dressingroom and sometimes to see more of her during the winter at newcome she describes her mother as always the kindest of the kind but from very early times the daughter must have felt her own superiority i think though she does not speak of it you should see her at home now in their dreadful calamity she seems the only person of the house who keeps her head  she told very nicely and modestly how it was lord kew who parted from her not she who had dismissed him as you know the newcomes used to say i have heard thatohthat man sir barnes say so myself she says humbly that her cousin kew was a great deal too good for her and so is every one almost she adds poor thing  poor every one did you ask about him laura said mr pendennis  no i did not venture she looked at me out of her downright eyes and went on with her little tale i was scarcely more than a child then she continued and though i liked kew very muchwho would not like such a generous honest creature i felt somehow that i was taller than my cousin and as if i ought not to marry him or should make him unhappy if i did when poor papa used to talk we children remarked that mamma hardly listened to him and so we did not respect him as we should and barnes was especially scoffing and odious with him why when he was a boy he used to sneer at papa openly before us younger ones now harriet admires everything that kew says and that makes her a great deal happier at being with him and then added mrs pendennis ethel said i hope you respect your husband laura depend on it you will be happier if you do was not that a fine discovery of ethels mr pen  claras terror of barnes frightened me when i stayed in the house ethel went on i am sure i would not tremble before any man in the world as she did i saw early that she used to deceive him and tell him lies laura i do not mean lies of words alone but lies of looks and actions oh i do not wonder at her flying from him he was dreadful to be with cruel and selfish and cold he was made worse by marrying a woman he did not love as she was by that unfortunate union with him suppose he had found a clever woman who could have controlled him and amused him and whom he and his friends could have admired instead of poor clara who made his home wearisome and trembled when he entered it suppose she could have married that unhappy man to whom she was attached early i was frightened laura to think how ill this worldly marriage had prospered  my poor grandmother whenever i spoke upon such a subject would break out into a thousand gibes and sarcasms and point to many of our friends who had made lovematches and were quarrelling now as fiercely as though they had never loved each other you remember that dreadful case in france duc de  who murdered his duchess that was a lovematch and i can remember the sort of screech with which lady kew used to speak about it and of the journal which the poor duchess kept and in which she noted down all her husbands illbehaviour  hush laura do you remember where we are if the princess were to put down all floracs culpabilities in an album what a ledger it would beas big as dr portmans chrysostom but this was parenthetical and after a smile and a little respite the young woman proceeded in her narration of her friends history  i was willing enough to listen ethel said to grandmamma then for we are glad of an excuse to do what we like and i liked admiration and rank and great wealth laura and lord farintosh offered me these i liked to surpass my companions and i saw them so eager in pursuing him you cannot think laura what meannesses women in the world will commitmothers and daughters too in the pursuit of a person of his great rank those miss burrs you should have seen them at the countryhouses where we visited together and how they followed him how they would meet him in the parks and shrubberies how they liked smoking though i knew it made them ill how they were always finding pretexts for getting near him oh it was odious  i would not willingly interrupt the narrative but let the reporter be allowed here to state that at this point of miss newcomes story which my wife gave with a very pretty imitation of the girls manner we both burst out laughing so loud that little madame de moncontour put her head into the drawingroom and asked what we was alaughing at we did not tell our hostess that poor ethel and her grandmother had been accused of doing the very same thing for which she found fault with the misses burr miss newcome thought herself quite innocent or how should she have cried out at the naughty behaviour of other people  wherever we went however resumed my wifes young penitent it was easy to see i think i may say so without vanity who was the object of lord farintoshs attention he followed us everywhere and we could not go upon any visit in england or scotland but he was in the same house grandmammas whole heart was bent upon that marriage and when he proposed for me i do not disown that i was very pleased and vain  it is in these last months that i have heard about him more and learned to know him betterhim and myself too laura some onesome one you know and whom i shall always love as a brotherreproached me in former days for a worldliness about which you talk too sometimes but it is not worldly to give yourself up for your family is it one cannot help the rank in which one is born and surely it is but natural and proper to marry in it not that lord farintosh thinks me or any one of his rank here miss ethel laughed he is the sultan and we every unmarried girl in society is his humblest slave his majestys opinions upon this subject did not suit me i can assure you i have no notion of such pride  but i do not disguise from you dear laura that after accepting him as i came to know him better and heard him and heard of him and talked with him daily and understood lord farintoshs character i looked forward with more and more doubt to the day when i was to become his wife i have not learned to respect him in these months that i have known him and during which there has been mourning in our families i will not talk to you about him i have no right have ito hear him speak out his heart and tell it to any friend he said he liked me because i did not flatter him poor malcolm they all do what was my acceptance of him laura but flattery yes flattery and servility to rank and a desire to possess it would i have accepted plain malcolm roy i sent away a better than him laura  these things have been brooding in my mind for some months past i must have been but an ill companion for him and indeed he bore with my waywardness much more kindly than i ever thought possible and when four days since we came to this sad house where he was to have joined us and i found only dismay and wretchedness and these poor children deprived of a mother whom i pity god help her for she has been made so miserableand is now and must be to the end of her days as i lay awake thinking of my own future life and that i was going to marry as poor clara had married but for an establishment and a position in life i my own mistress and not obedient by nature or a slave to others as that poor creature wasi thought to myself why shall i do this now clara has left us and is as it were dead to us who made her so unhappy let me be the mother to her orphans i love the little girl and she has always loved me and came crying to me that day when we arrived and put her dear little arms round my neck and said you wont go away will you aunt ethel in her sweet voice and i will stay with her and will try and learn myself that i may teach her and learn to be good toobetter than i have been will praying help me laura i did i am sure i was right and that it is my duty to stay here  laura was greatly moved as she told her friends confession and when the next day at church the clergyman read the opening words of the service i thought a peculiar radiance and happiness beamed from her bright face                                       some subsequent occurrences in the history of this branch of the newcome family i am enabled to report from the testimony of the same informant who has just given us an account of her own feelings and life miss ethel and my wife were now in daily communication and mydearesting each other with that female fervour which cold men of the world as we arenot only chary of warm expressions of friendship but averse to entertaining warm feelings at allwe surely must admire in persons of the inferior sex whose loves grow up and reach the skies in a night who kiss embrace console call each other by christian names in that sweet kindly sisterhood of misfortune and compassion who are always entering into partnership here in life i say the world is full of miss nightingales and we sick and wounded in our private scutaris have countless nursetenders i did not see my wife ministering to the afflicted family at newcome park but i can fancy her there amongst the women and children her prudent counsel her thousand gentle offices her apt pity and cheerfulness the love and truth glowing in her face and inspiring her words movements demeanour  mrs pendenniss husband for his part did not attempt to console sir barnes newcome newcome baronet i never professed to have a halfpennyworth of pity at that gentlemans command florac who owed barnes his principality and his present comforts in life did make some futile efforts at condolence but was received by the baronet with such fierceness and evident illhumour that he did not care to repeat his visits and allowed him to vent his curses and peevishness on his own immediate dependents we used to ask laura on her return to rosebury from her charity visits to newcome about the poor suffering master of the house she faltered and stammered in describing him and what she heard of him she smiled i grieve to say for this unfortunate lady cannot help having a sense of humour and we could not help laughing outright sometimes at the idea of that discomfited wretch that overbearing creature overborne in his turnwhich laughter mrs laura used to chide as very naughty and unfeeling when we went into newcome the landlord of the kings arms looked knowing and quizzical tom potts grinned at me and rubbed his hands this business serves the paper better than mr warringtons articles says mr potts we have sold no end of independents and if you polled the whole borough i bet that five to one would say sir screwcome screwcome was served right by the way whats up about the marquis of farintosh mr pendennis he arrived at the arms last night went over to the park this morning and is gone back to town by the afternoon train  what had happened between the marquis of farintosh and miss newcome i am enabled to know from the report of miss newcomes confidante on the receipt of that letter of conge which has been mentioned in a former chapter his lordship must have been very much excited for he left town straightway by that evenings mail and on the next morning after a few hours of rest at his inn was at newcome lodgegate demanding to see the baronet  on that morning it chanced that sir barnes had left home with mr speer his legal adviser and hereupon the marquis asked to see miss newcome nor could the lodgekeeper venture to exclude so distinguished a person from the park his lordship drove up to the house and his name was taken to miss ethel she turned very pale when she heard it and my wife divined at once who was her visitor lady anne had not left her room as yet laura pendennis remained in command of the little conclave of children with whom the two ladies were sitting when lord farintosh arrived little clara wanted to go with her aunt as she rose to leave the roomthe child could scarcely be got to part from her now  at the end of an hour the carriage was seen driving away and ethel returned looking as pale as before and red about the eyes miss claras muttonchop for dinner coming in at the same time the child was not so presently eager for her aunts company aunt ethel cut up the muttonchop very neatly and then having seen the child comfortably seated at her meal went with her friend into a neighbouring apartment of course with some pretext of showing laura a picture or a piece of china or a new childs frock or with some other hypocritical pretence by which the ingenuous female attendants pretended to be utterly blinded and there i have no doubt before beginning her story dearest laura embraced dearest ethel and vice versa  he is gone at length gasps dearest ethel  pour toujours poor young man sighs dearest laura was he very unhappy ethel  he was more angry ethel answers he had a right to be hurt but not to speak as he did he lost his temper quite at last and broke out in the most frantic reproaches he forgot all respect and even gentlemanlike behaviour do you know he used wordswords such as barnes uses sometimes when he is angry and dared this language to me i was sorry till then very sorry and very much moved but i know more than ever now that i was right in refusing lord farintosh  dearest laura now pressed for an account of all that had happened which may be briefly told as follows feeling very deeply upon the subject which brought him to miss newcome it was no wonder that lord farintosh spoke at first in a way which moved her he said he thought her letter to his mother was very rightly written under the circumstances and thanked her for her generosity in offering to release him from his engagement but the affairthe painful circumstance of highgate and thatwhich had happened in the newcome family was no fault of miss newcomes and lord farintosh could not think of holding her accountable his friends had long urged him to marry and it was by his mothers own wish that the engagement was formed which he was determined to maintain in his course through the world of which he was getting very tired he had never seen a woman a lady who was soyou understand ethelwhom he admired so much who was likely to make so good a wife for him as you are you allude he continued to differences we have hadand we have had thembut many of them i own have been from my fault i have been bred up in a way different to most young men i cannot help it if i have had temptations to which other men are not exposed and have been placed byby providencein a high rank of life i am sure if you share it with me you will adorn it and be in every way worthy of it and make me much better than i have been if you knew what a night of agony i passed after my mother read that letter to mei know youd pity me etheli know you would the idea of losing you makes me wild my mother was dreadfully alarmed when she saw the state i was in so was the doctori assure you he was and i had no rest at all and no peace of mind until i determined to come down to you and say that i adored you and you only and that i would hold to my engagement in spite of everythingand prove to you thatthat no man in the world could love you more sincerely than i do here the young gentleman was so overcome that he paused in his speech and gave way to an emotion for which surely no man who has been in the same condition with lord farintosh will blame him  miss newcome was also much touched by this exhibition of natural feeling and i dare say it was at this time that her eyes showed the first symptoms of that malady of which the traces were visible an hour after  you are very generous and kind to me lord farintosh she said your constancy honours me very much and proves how good and loyal you are butbut do not think hardly of me for saying that the more i have thought of what has happened hereof the wretched consequences of interested marriages the long union growing each day so miserable that at last it becomes intolerable and is burst asunder as in poor claras casethe more i am resolved not to commit that first fatal step of entering into a marriage withoutwithout the degree of affection which people who take that vow ought to feel for one another  affection can you doubt it gracious heavens i adore you isnt my being here a proof that i do cries the young ladys lover  but i answered the girl i have asked my own heart that question before now i have thought to myselfif he comes after allif his affection for me survives this disgrace of our family as it has and every one of us should be thankful to youought i not to show at least gratitude for so much kindness and honour and devote myself to one who makes such sacrifices for me but before all things i owe you the truth lord farintosh i never could make you happy i know i could not nor obey you as you are accustomed to be obeyed nor give you such a devotion as you have a right to expect from your wife i thought i might once i cant now i know that i took you because you were rich and had a great name not because you were honest and attached to me as you show yourself to be i ask your pardon for the deceit i practised on youlook at clara poor child and her misery my pride i know would never have let me fall as far as she has done but oh i am humiliated to think that i could have been made to say i would take the first step in that awful career  what career in gods name cries the astonished suitor humiliated ethel whos going to humiliate you i suppose there is no woman in england who need be humiliated by becoming my wife i should like to see the one that i cant pretend toor to royal blood if i like its not better than mine humiliated indeed that is news ha ha you dont suppose that your pedigree which i know all about and the newcome family with your barbersurgeon to edward the confessor are equal to  to yours no it is not very long that i have learned to disbelieve in that story altogether i fancy it was an odd whim of my poor fathers and that our family were quite poor people  i knew it said lord farintosh do you suppose there was not plenty of women to tell it me  it was not because we were poor that i am ashamed ethel went on that cannot be our fault though some of us seem think it is as they hide the truth so one of my uncles used to tell me that my grandfathers father was a labourer in newcome but i was a child then and liked to believe the prettiest story best  as if it matters cries lord farintosh  as if it matters in your wife nestce pas i never thought that it would i should have told you as it was my duty to tell you all it was not my ancestors you cared for and it is you yourself that your wife must swear before heaven to love  of course its me answers the young man not quite understanding the train of ideas in his companions mind and ive given up everythingeverythingand have broken off with my old habits andand things you knowand intend to lead a regular lifeand will never go to tattersalls again nor bet a shilling nor touch another cigar if you likethat is if you dont like for i love you so etheli do with all my heart i do  you are very generous and kind lord farintosh ethel said it is myself not you i doubt oh i am humiliated to make such a confession  how humiliated ethel withdrew the hand which the young nobleman endeavoured to seize  if she continued if i found it was your birth and your name and your wealth that i coveted and had nearly taken ought i not to feel humiliated and ask pardon of you and of god oh what perjuries poor clara was made to speakand see what has befallen her we stood by and heard her without being shocked we applauded even and to what shame and misery we brought her why did her parents and mine consign her to such ruin she might have lived pure and happy but for us with her example before menot her flight poor childi am not afraid of that happening to mebut her long solitude the misery of her wasted yearsmy brothers own wretchedness and faults aggravated a hundredfold by his unhappy union with heri must pause while it is yet time and recall a promise which i know i should make you unhappy if i fulfilled i ask your pardon that i deceived you lord farintosh and feel ashamed for myself that i could have consented to do so  do you mean cried the young marquis that after my conduct to youafter my loving you so that even thisthis disgrace in your family dont prevent my going onafter my mother has been down on her knees to me to break off and i wouldntno i wouldntafter all whites sneering at me and laughing at me and all my friends friends of my family who would go togo anywhere for me advising me and saying farintosh what a fool you are break off this matchand i wouldnt back out because i loved you so by heaven and because as a man and a gentleman when i give my word i keep itdo you mean that you throw me over its a shameits a shame and again there were tears of rage and anguish in farintoshs eyes  what i did was a shame my lord ethel said humbly and again i ask your pardon for it what i do now is only to tell you the truth and to grieve with all my soul for the falsehoodyes the falsehoodwhich i told you and which has given your kind heart such cruel pain  yes it was a falsehood the poor lad cried out you follow a fellow and you make a fool of him and you make him frantic in love with you and then you fling him over i wonder you can look me in the face after such an infernal treason youve done it to twenty fellows before i know you have everybody said so and warned me you draw them on and get them to be in love and then you fling them away am i to go back to london and be made the laughingstock of the whole towni who might marry any woman in europe and who am at the head of the nobility of england  upon my word if you will believe me after deceiving you once ethel interposed still very humbly i will never say that it was i who withdrew from you and that it was not you who refused me what has happened here fully authorises you let the rupture of the engagement come from you my lord indeed indeed i would spare you all the pain i can i have done you wrong enough already lord farintosh  and now the marquis burst forth with tears and imprecations wild cries of anger love and disappointment so fierce and incoherent that the lady to whom they were addressed did not repeat them to her confidante only she generously charged laura to remember if ever she heard the matter talked of in the world that it was lord farintoshs family which broke off the marriage but that his lordship had acted most kindly and generously throughout the whole affair  he went back to london in such a state of fury and raved so wildly amongst his friends against the whole newcome family that many men knew what the case really was but all women averred that that intriguing worldly ethel newcome the apt pupil of her wicked old grandmother had met with a deserved rebuff that after doing everything in her power to catch the great parti lord farintosh who had long been tired of her flung her over not liking the connexion and that she was living out of the world now at newcome under the pretence of taking care of that unfortunate lady claras children but really because she was pining away for lord farintosh who as we all know married six months afterwards     chapter lx in which we write to the colonel   deeming that her brother barnes had cares enough of his own presently at hand ethel did not think fit to confide to him the particulars of her interview with lord farintosh nor even was poor lady anne informed that she had lost a noble soninlaw the news would come to both of them soon enough ethel thought and indeed before many hours were over it reached sir barnes newcome in a very abrupt and unpleasant way he had dismal occasion now to see his lawyers every day and on the day after lord farintoshs abrupt visit and departure sir barnes going into newcome upon his own unfortunate affairs was told by his attorney mr speers how the marquis of farintosh had slept for a few hours at the kings arms and returned to town the same evening by the train we may add that his lordship had occupied the very room in which lord highgate had previously slept and mr taplow recommends the bed accordingly and shows pride it with to this very day  much disturbed by this intelligence sir barnes was making his way to his cheerless home in the evening when near his own gate he overtook another messenger this was the railway porter who daily brought telegraphic messages from his uncle and the london bank the message of that day wasconsols soandso french rentes so much highgates and farintoshs accounts withdrawn the wretched keeper of the lodge owned with trembling in reply to the curses and queries of his employer that a gentleman calling himself the marquis of farintosh had gone up to the house the day before and come away an hour afterwardsdid not like to speak to sir barnes when he came home sir barnes looked so bad like  now of course there could be no concealment from her brother and ethel and barnes had a conversation in which the latter expressed himself with that freedom of language which characterised the head of the house of newcome madame de moncontours ponychaise was in waiting at the hall door when the owner of the house entered it and my wife was just taking leave of ethel and her little people when sir barnes newcome entered the ladys sittingroom  the livid scowl with which barnes greeted my wife surprised that lady though it did not induce her to prolong her visit to her friend as laura took leave she heard sir barnes screaming to the nurses to take those little beggars away and she rightly conjectured that some more unpleasantries had occurred to disturb this luckless gentlemans temper  on the morrow dearest ethels usual courier one of the boys from the lodge trotted over on his donkey to dearest laura at rosebury with one of those missives which were daily passing between the ladies this letter said   barnes ma fait une scene terrible hier i was obliged to tell him everything about lord f and to use the plainest language at first he forbade you the house he thinks that you have been the cause of fs dismissal and charged me most unjustly with a desire to bring back poor c n i replied as became me and told him fairly i would leave the house if odious insulting charges were made against me if my friends were not received he stormed he cried he employed his usual languagehe was in a dreadful state he relented and asked pardon he goes to town tonight by the mailtrain of course you come as usual dear dear laura i am miserable without you and you know i cannot leave poor mamma clarykin sends a thousand kisses to little arty and i am his mothers always affectionatee n  will the gentlemen like to shoot our pheasants please ask the prince to let warren know when i sent a brace to poor dear old mrs mason and had such a nice letter from her   and who is poor dear mrs mason asks mr pendennis as yet but imperfectly acquainted with the history of the newcomes  and laura told meperhaps i had heard before and forgottenthat mrs mason was an old nurse and pensioner of the colonels and how he had been to see her for the sake of old times and how she was a great favourite with ethel and laura kissed her little son and was exceedingly bright cheerful and hilarious that evening in spite of the affliction under which her dear friends at newcome were labouring  people in countryhouses should be exceedingly careful about their blottingpaper they should bring their own portfolios with them if any kind readers will bear this simple little hint in mind how much mischief may they save themselvesnay enjoy possibly by looking at the pages of the next portfolio in the next friends bedroom in which they sleep from such a book i once cut out in charles slyboots wellknown and perfectly clear handwriting the words miss emily hartington james street backingham gate london and produced as legibly on the blottingpaper as on the envelope which the postman delivered after showing the paper round to the company i enclosed it in a note and sent it to mr slyboots who married miss hartington three months afterwards in such a book at the club i read as plainly as you may read this page a holograph page of the right honourable the earl of bareacres which informed the whole club of a painful and private circumstance and said my dear greeni am truly sorry that i shall not be able to take up the bill for eight hundred and fiftysix pounds which becomes due next tu and upon such a book going to write a note in madame de moncontours drawingroom at rosebury what should i find but proofs that my own wife was engaged in a clandestine correspondence with a gentleman residing abroad  colonel newcome cb montagne de la cour brussels i read in this young womans handwriting and asked turning round upon laura who entered the room just as i discovered her guilt what have you been writing to colonel newcome about miss  i wanted him to get me some lace she said  to lace some nightcaps for me didnt you my dear he is such a fine judge of lace if i had known you had been writing i would have asked you to send him a message i want something from brussels is the letterahemgone in this artful way you see i just hinted that i should like to see letter  the letter isahemgone says laura what do you want from brussels pen  i want some brussels sprouts my lovethey are so fine in their native country  shall i write to him to send the letter back palpitates poor little laura for she thought her husband was offended by using the ironic method  no you dear little woman you need not send for letter the back and you need not tell me what was in it and i will bet you a hundred yards of lace to a cotton nightcapand you know whether i madam am a man a bonnetdecotoni will let you that i know what you have been writing about under pretence of a message about lace to our colonel  he promised to send it me he really did lady rockminster gave me twenty pounds gasps laura  under pretence of lace you have been sending over a lovemessage you want to see whether clive is still of his old mind you think the coast is now clear and that dearest ethel may like him you think mrs mason is growing very old and infirm and the sight of her dear boy would  pen pen did you open my letter cries laura and a laugh which could afford to be goodhumoured followed by yet another expression of the lips ended this colloquy no mr pendennis did not see the letterbut he knew the writerflattered himself that he knew women in general  where did you get your experience of them sir asks mrs laura question answered in the same manner as the previous demand  well my dear and why should not the poor boy be made happy laura continues standing very close up to her husband it is evident to me that ethel is fond of him i would rather see her married to a good young man whom she loves than the mistress of a thousand palaces and coronets supposesuppose you had married miss amory sir what a wretched worldly creature you would have been by this time whereas now  now that i am the humble slave of a good woman there is some chance for me cries this model of husbands and all good women are matchmakers as we know very well and you have had this match in your heart ever since you saw the two young people together now madam since i did not see your letter to the colonelthough i have guessed part of ittell me what have you said in it have you by any chance told the colonel that the farintosh alliance was broken off  laura owned that she had hinted as much  you have not ventured to say that ethel is well inclined to clive  oh nooh dear no but after much crossexamining and a little blushing on lauras part she is brought to confess that she has asked the colonel whether he will not come and see mrs mason who is pining to see him and is growing very old and i find out that she has been to see this mrs mason that she and miss newcome visited the old lady the day before yesterday and laura thought from the manner in which ethel looked at clives picture hanging up in the parlour of his fathers old friend that she really was very much etc etc so the letter being gone mrs pendennis is most eager about the answer to it and day after day examines the bag and is provoked that it brings no letter bearing the brussels postmark  madame de moncontour seems perfectly well to know what mrs laura has been doing and is hoping what no letters again today aint it provoking she cries she is in the conspiracy too and presently florac is one of the initiated these women wish to bacler a marriage between the belle miss and le petit claive florac announces to me he pays the highest compliments to miss newcomes person as he speaks regarding the marriage i continue to adore your anglaises he is pleased to say what of freshness what of beauty what roses and then they are so adorably good go pendennis thou art a happy coquin mr pendennis does not say no he has won the twentythousandpound prize and we know there are worse blanks in that lottery     chapter lxi in which we are introduced to a new newcome   no answer came to mrs pendenniss letter to colonel newcome at brussels for the colonel was absent from that city and at the time when laura wrote was actually in london whither affairs of his own had called him a note from george warrington acquainted me with this circumstance he mentioned that he and the colonel had dined together at bayss on the day previous and that the colonel seemed to be in the highest spirits high spirits about what this news put laura in a sad perplexity should she write and tell him to get his letters from brussels she would in five minutes have found some other pretext for writing to colonel newcome had not her husband sternly cautioned the young woman to leave the matter alone  the more readily perhaps because he had quarrelled with his nephew sir barnes thomas newcome went to visit his brother hobson and his sisterinlaw bent on showing that there was no division between him and this branch of his family and you may suppose that the admirable woman just named had a fine occasion for her virtuous conversational powers in discoursing upon the painful event which had just happened to sir barnes when we fail how our friends cry out for us mrs hobsons homilies must have been awful how that outraged virtue must have groaned and lamented gathered its children about its knees wept over them and washed them gone into sackcloth and ashes and tied up the knocker confabulated with its spiritual adviser uttered commonplaces to its husband and bored the whole house the punishment of worldliness and vanity the evil of marrying out of ones station how these points must have been explained and enlarged on surely the peerage was taken off the drawingroom table and removed to papas study where it could not open as it used naturally once to highgate baron or farintosh marquis of being shut behind wires and closely jammed in on an upper shelf between blackstones commentaries and the farmers magazine the breaking of the engagement with the marquis of farintosh was known in bryanstone square and you may be sure interpreted by mrs hobson in the light the most disadvantageous to ethel newcome a young noblemanwith grief and pain ethels aunt must own the facta young man of notoriously dissipated habits but of great wealth and rank had been pursued by the unhappy lady kewmrs hobson would not say by her niece that were too dreadfulhad been pursued and followed and hunted down in the most notorious manner and finally made to propose let ethels conduct and punishment be a warning to my dearest girls and let them bless heaven they have parents who are not worldly after all the trouble and pains mrs hobson did not say disgrace the marquis takes the very first pretext to break off the match and leaves the unfortunate girl for ever  and now we have to tell of the hardest blow which fell upon poor ethel and this was that her good uncle thomas newcome believed the charges against her he was willing enough to listen now to anything which was said against that branch of the family with such a traitor doubledealer dastard as barnes at its head what could the rest of the race be when the colonel offered to endow ethel and clive with every shilling he had in the world had not barnes the archtraitor temporised and told him falsehoods and hesitated about throwing him off until the marquis had declared himself yes the girl he and poor clive loved so was ruined by her artful relatives was unworthy of his affection and his boys was to be banished like her worthless brother out of his regard for ever and the man she had chosen in preference to his clivea roue a libertine whose extravagances and dissipations were the talk of every club who had no wit nor talents not even constancy for had he not taken the first opportunity to throw her off to recommend himonly a great title and a fortune wherewith to bribe her for shame for shame her engagement to this man was a blot upon herthe rupture only a just punishment and humiliation poor unhappy girl let her take care of her wretched brothers abandoned children give up the world and amend her life  this was the sentence thomas newcome delivered a righteous and tenderhearted man as we know but judging in this case wrongly and bearing much too hardly as we who know her betters must think upon one who had her faults certainly but whose errors were not all of her own making who set her on the path she walked in it was her parents hands which led her and her parents voices which commanded her to accept the temptation set before her what did she know of the character of the man selected to be her husband those who should have known better brought him to her and vouched for him noble unhappy young creature are you the first of your sisterhood who has been bidden to traffic your beauty to crush and slay your honest natural affections to sell your truth and your life for rank and title but the judge who sees not the outward acts merely but their causes and views not the wrong alone but the temptations struggles ignorance of erring creatures we know has a different code to oursto ours who fall upon the fallen who fawn upon the prosperous so who administer our praises and punishments so prematurely who now strike so hard and anon spare so shamelessly  our stay with our hospitable friends at rosebury was perforce coming to a close for indeed weeks after weeks had passed since we had been under their pleasant roof and in spite of dearest ethels remonstrances it was clear that dearest laura must take her farewell in these last days besides the visits which daily took place between one and other the young messenger was put in ceaseless requisition and his donkey must have been worn off his little legs with trotting to and fro between the two houses laura was quite anxious and hurt at not hearing from the colonel it was a shame that he did not have over his letters from belgium and answer that one which she had honoured him by writing by some information received who knows how our host was aware of the intrigue which mrs pendennis was carrying on and his little wife almost as much interested in it as my own she whispered to me in her kind way that she would give a guinea that she would to see a certain couple made happy together that they were born for one another that they were she was for having me go off to fetch clive but who was i to act as hymens messenger or to interpose in such delicate family affairs  all this while sir barnes newcome bart remained absent in london attending to his banking duties there and pursuing the dismal inquiries which ended in the ensuing michaelmas term in the famous suit of newcome v lord highgate ethel pursuing the plan which she had laid down for herself from the first took entire charge of his children and house lady anne returned to her own family never indeed having been of much use in her sons dismal household my wife talked to me of course about her pursuits and amusements at newcome in the ancestral hall which we have mentioned the children played and ate their dinner mine often partook of his infantine mutton in company with little clara and the poor young heir of newcome in the room which had been called my ladys own and in which her husband had locked her forgetting that the conservatories were open through which the hapless woman had fled next to this was the baronial library a side of which was fitted with the gloomy books from clapham which old mrs newcome had amassed rows of tracts and missionary magazines and dingy quarto volumes of worldly travel and history which that lady had admitted into her collection  almost on the last day of our stay at rosebury the two young ladies bethought them of paying a visit to the neighbouring town of newcome to that old mrs mason who has been mentioned in a foregoing page in some yet earlier chapter of our history she was very old now very faithful to the recollections of her own early time and oblivious of yesterday thanks to colonel newcomes bounty she had lived in comfort for many a long year past and he was as much her boy now as in those early days of which we have given but an outline there were clives pictures of himself and his father over her little mantelpiece near which she sat in comfort and warmth by the winter fire which his bounty supplied  mrs mason remembered miss newcome prompted thereto by the hints of her little maid who was much younger and had a more faithful memory than her mistress why sarah mason would have forgotten the pheasants whose very tails decorated the chimneyglass had not keziah the maid reminded her that the young lady was the donor then she recollected her benefactor and asked after her father the baronet and wondered for her part why her boy the colonel was not made baronet and why his brother had the property her father was a very good man though mrs mason had heard he was not much liked in those parts dead and gone was he poor man this came in reply to a hint from keziah the attendant bawled in the old ladys ears who was very deaf well well we must all go and if we were all good like the colonel what was the use of staying i hope his wife will be good i am sure such a good man deserves one added mrs mason  the ladies thought the old woman doting led thereto by the remark of keziah the maid that mrs mason have a lost her memory and she asked who the other bonny lady was and ethel told her that mrs pendennis was a friend of the colonels and clives  oh clives friend well she was a pretty lady and he was a dear pretty boy he drew those pictures and he took off me in my cap with my old cat and allmy poor old cat thats buried this ever so long ago  she has had a letter from the colonel miss cries out keziah havent you had a letter from the colonel mum it came only yesterday and keziah takes out the letter and shows it to the ladies they read as follows   london feb 12 184  my dear old masoni have just heard from a friend of mine who has been staying in your neighbourhood that you are well and happy and that you have been making inquiries after your young scapegrace tom newcome who is well and happy too and who proposes to be happier still before any very long time is over  the letter which was written to me about you was sent to me in belgium at brussels where i have been livinga town near the place where the famous battle of waterloo was fought and as i had run away from waterloo it followed me to england  i cannot come to newcome just now to shake my dear old friend and nurse by the hand i have business in london and there are those of my name living in newcome who would not be very happy to see me and mine  but i promise you a visit before very long and clive will come with me and when we come i shall introduce a new friend to you a very pretty little daughterinlaw whom you must promise to love very much she is a scotch lassie niece of my oldest friend james binnie esquire of the bengal civil service who will give her a pretty bit of siller and her present name is miss rosa mackenzie  we shall send you a wedding cake soon and a new gown for keziah to whom remember me and when i am gone my grandchildren after me will hear what a dear friend you were to your affectionate thomas newcome   keziah must have thought that there was something between clive and my wife for when laura had read the letter she laid it down on the table and sitting down by it and hiding her face in her hands burst into tears  ethel looked steadily at the two pictures of clive and his father then she put her hand on her friends shoulder come my dear she said it is growing late and i must go back to my children and she saluted mrs mason and her maid in a very stately manner and left them leading my wife away who was still exceedingly overcome  we could not stay long at rosebury after that when madame de moncontour heard the news the good lady cried too mrs pendenniss emotion was renewed as we passed the gates of newcome park on our way to the railroad     chapter lxii mr and mrs clive newcome   the friendship between ethel and laura which the last narrated sentimental occurrences had so much increased subsists very little impaired up to the present day a lady with many domestic interests and increasing family etc etc cannot be supposed to cultivate female intimacies out of doors with that ardour and eagerness which young spinsters exhibit in their intercourse but laura whose kind heart first led her to sympathise with her young friend in the latters days of distress and misfortune has professed ever since a growing esteem for ethel newcome and says that the trials and perhaps grief which the young lady now had to undergo have brought out the noblest qualities of her disposition she is a very different person from the giddy and worldly girl who compelled our admiration of late in the days of her triumphant youthful beauty of her wayward generous humour of her frivolities and her flirtations  did ethel shed tears in secret over the marriage which had caused lauras gentle eyes to overflow we might divine the girls grief but we respected it the subject was never mentioned by the ladies between themselves and even in her most intimate communications with her husband that gentleman is bound to say his wife maintained a tender reserve upon the point nor cared to speculate upon a subject which her friend held sacred i could not for my part but acquiesce in this reticence and if ethel felt regret and remorse admire the dignity of her silence and the sweet composure of her now changed and saddened demeanour  the interchange of letters between the two friends was constant and in these the younger lady described at length the duties occupations and pleasures of her new life she had quite broken with the world and devoted herself entirely to the nurture and education of her brothers orphan children she educated herself in order to teach them her letters contain droll yet touching confessions of her own ignorance and her determination to overcome it there was no lack of masters of all kinds in newcome she set herself to work like a schoolgirl the little piano in the room near the conservatory was thumped by aunt ethel until it became quite obedient to her and yielded the sweetest music under her fingers when she came to pay us a visit at fairoaks some two years afterwards she played for our dancing children our third is named ethel our second helen after one still more dear and we were in admiration of her skill there must have been the labour of many lonely nights when her little charges were at rest and she and her sad thoughts sat up together before she overcame the difficulties of the instrument so as to be able to soothe herself and to charm and delight her children  when the divorce was pronounced which came in due form though we know that lady highgate was not much happier than the luckless lady clara newcome had been ethels dread was lest sir barnes should marry again and by introducing a new mistress into his house should deprive her of the care of her children  miss newcome judged her brother rightly in that he would try to marry but a noble young lady to whom he offered himself rejected him to his surprise and indignation for a beggarly clergyman with a small living on which she elected to starve and the wealthy daughter of a neighbouring manufacturer whom he next proposed to honour with his gracious hand fled from him with horror to the arms of her father wondering how such a man as that should ever dare to propose marriage to an honest girl sir barnes newcome was much surprised at this outbreak of anger he thought himself a very illused and unfortunate man a victim of most cruel persecutions which we may be sure did not improve his temper or tend to the happiness of his circle at home peevishness and selfish rage quarrels with servants and governesses and other domestic disquiet ethel had of course to bear from her brother but not actual personal illusage the fiery temper of former days was subdued in her but the haughty resolution remained which was more than a match for her brothers cowardly tyranny besides she was the mistress of sixty thousand pounds and by many wily hints and piteous appeals to his sister sir barnes sought to secure this desirable sum of money for his poor dear unfortunate children  he professed to think that she was ruining herself for her younger brothers whose expenses the young lady was defraying this one at college that in the army and whose maintenance he thought might be amply defrayed out of their own little fortunes and his mothers jointure and by ingeniously proving that a vast number of his household expenses were personal to miss newcome and would never have been incurred but for her residence in his house he subtracted for his own benefit no inconsiderable portion of her income thus the carriagehorses were hers for what need had he a miserable bachelor of anything more than a ridinghorse and a brougham a certain number of the domestics were hers and as he could get no scoundrel of his own to stay with him he took miss newcomes servants he would have had her pay the coals which burned in his grate and the taxes due to our sovereign lady the queen but in truth at the end of the year with her domestic bounties and her charities round about newcome which daily increased as she became acquainted with her indigent neighbours miss ethel the heiress was as poor as many poorer persons  her charities increased daily with her means of knowing the people round about her she gave much time to them and thought visited from house to house without ostentation was awestricken by that spectacle of the poverty which we have with us always of which the sight rebukes our selfish griefs into silence the thought compels us to charity humility and devotion the priests of our various creeds who elsewhere are doing battle together continually lay down their arms in its presence and kneel before it subjugated by that overpowering master death never dying out hunger always crying and children born to it day after dayour young london lady flying from the splendours and follies in which her life had been past found herself in the presence of these threading darkling alleys which swarmed with wretched life sitting by naked beds whither by gods blessing she was sometimes enabled to carry a little comfort and consolation or whence she came heartstricken by the overpowering misery or touched by the patient resignation of the new friends to whom fate had directed her and here she met the priest upon his shrift the homely missionary bearing his words of consolation the quiet curate pacing his round and was known to all these and enabled now and again to help their people in trouble oh what good there is in this woman my wife would say to me as she laid one of miss ethels letters aside who would have thought this was the girl of your glaring london ballroom if she has had grief to bear how it has chastened and improved her  and now i have to confess that all this time whilst ethel newcome has been growing in grace with my wife poor clive has been lapsing sadly out of favour she has no patience with clive she drubs her little foot when his name is mentioned and turns the subject whither are all the tears and pities fled now mrs laura has transferred all her regard to ethel and when that ladys exsuitor writes to his old friend or other news is had of him laura flies out in her usual tirades against the world the horrid wicked selfish world which spoils everybody who comes near it what has clive done in vain his apologist asks that an old friend should be so angry with him  she is not angry with himnot she she only does not care about him she wishes him no manner of harmnot the least only she has lost all interest in him and the colonel too the poor good old colonel was actually in mrs pendennis black books and when he sent her the brussels veil which we have heard of she did not think it was a bargain at allnot particularly pretty in fact rather dear at the money when we met mr and mrs clive newcome in london whither they came a few months after their marriage and where rosey appeared as pretty happy goodhumoured a little blushing bride as eyes need behold mrs pendenniss reception of her was quite a curiosity of decorum i not receive her well cried laura how on earth would you have me receive her i talked to her about everything and she only answered yes or no i showed her the children and she did not seem to care her only conversation was about millinery and brussels balls and about her dress at the drawingroom the drawingroom what business has she with such follies  the fact is that the drawingroom was tom newcomes affair not his sons who was heartily ashamed of the figure he cut in that astounding costume which english private gentlemen are made to sport when they bend the knee before their gracious sovereign  warrington roasted poor clive upon the occasion and complimented him with his usual gravity until the young fellow blushed and his father somewhat testily signified to our friend that his irony was not agreeable i suppose says the colonel with great hauteur that there is nothing ridiculous in an english gentleman entertaining feelings of loyalty and testifying his respect to his queen and i presume that her majesty knows best and has a right to order in what dress her subjects shall appear before her and i dont think its kind of you george i say i dont think its kind of you to quiz my boy for doing his duty to his queen and to his father too sirfor it was at my request that clive went and we went together sirto the levee and then to the drawingroom afterwards with rosey who was presented by the lady of my old friend sir george tufto a lady of rank herself and the wife of as brave an officer as ever drew a sword  warrington stammered an apology for his levity but no explanations were satisfactory and it was clear george had wounded the feelings of our dear simple old friend  after clives marriage which was performed at brussels uncle james and the lady his sister whom we have sometimes flippantly ventured to call the campaigner went off to perform that journey to scotland which james had meditated for ten years past and now little rosey was made happy for life to renew acquaintance with little josey the colonel and his son and daughterinlaw came to london not to the bachelor quarters where we have seen them but to an hotel which they occupied until their new house could be provided for them a sumptuous mansion in the tyburnian district and one which became people of their station  we have been informed already what the colonels income was and have the gratification of knowing that it was very considerable the simple gentleman who would dine off a crust and wear a coat for ten years desired that his children should have the best of everything ordered about upholsterers painters carriagemakers in his splendid indian way presented pretty rosey with brilliant jewels for her introduction at court and was made happy by the sight of the blooming young creature decked in these magnificences and admired by all his little circle the old boys the old generals the old colonels the old quihis from the club came and paid her their homage the directors ladies and the generals ladies called upon her and feasted her at vast banquets served on sumptuous plate newcome purchased plate and gave banquets in return for these hospitalities mrs clive had a neat close carriage for evenings and a splendid barouche to drive in the park it was pleasant to see this equipage at four oclock of an afternoon driving up to bayss with rosey most gorgeously attired reclining within and to behold the stately grace of the old gentleman as he stepped out to welcome his daughterinlaw and the bow he made before he entered her carriage then they would drive round the park round and round and round and the old generals and the old colonels and old fogies and their ladies and daughters would nod and smile out of their carriages as they crossed each other upon this charming career of pleasure  i confess that a dinner at the colonels now he appeared in all his magnificence was awfully slow no peaches could look fresher than roseys cheeksno damask was fairer than her pretty little shoulders no one i am sure could be happier than she but she did not impart her happiness to her friends and replied chiefly by smiles to the conversation of the gentlemen at her side it is true that these were for the most part elderly dignitaries distinguished military officers with blueblack whiskers retired old indian judges and the like occupied with their victuals and generally careless to please but that solemn happiness of the colonel who shall depict itthat look of affection with which he greeted his daughter as she entered flounced to the waist twinkling with innumerable jewels holding a dainty pockethandkerchief with smiling eyes dimpled cheeks and golden ringlets he would take her hand or follow her about from group to group exchanging precious observations about the weather the park the exhibition nay the opera for the old man actually went to the opera with his little girl and solemnly snoozed by her side in a white waistcoat  very likely this was the happiest period of thomas newcomes life no woman save one perhaps fifty years ago had ever seemed so fond of him as that little girl what pride he had in her and what care he took of her if she was a little ailing what anxiety and hurrying for doctors what droll letters came from james binnie and how they laughed over them with what respectful attention he acquainted mrs mack with everything that took place with what enthusiasm that campaigner replied joseys husband called a special blessing upon his head in the church at musselburgh and little jo herself sent a tinful of scotch bun to her darling sister with a request from her husband that he might have a few shares in the famous indian company  the company was in a highly flourishing condition as you may suppose when one of its directors who at the same time was one of the honestest men alive thought it was his duty to live in the splendour in which we now behold him many wealthy city men did homage to him his brother hobson though the colonel had quarrelled with the chief of the firm yet remained on amiable terms with thomas newcome and shared and returned his banquets for a while charles honeyman we may be sure was present at many of them and smirked a blessing over the plenteous meal the colonels influence was such with mr sherrick that he pleaded charless cause with that gentleman and actually brought to a successful termination that little loveaffair in which we have seen miss sherrick and charles engaged mr sherrick was not disposed to part with much money during his lifetimeindeed he proved to colonel newcome that he was not so rich as the world supposed him but by the colonels interest the chaplaincy of boggley wollah was procured for the rev c honeyman who now forms the delight of that flourishing station  all this while we have said little about clive who in truth was somehow in the background in this flourishing newcome group to please the best father in the world the kindest old friend who endowed his niece with the best part of his savings to settle that question about marriage and have an end of itclive newcome had taken a pretty and fond young girl who respected and admired him beyond all men and who heartily desired to make him happy to do as much would not his father have stripped his coat from his backhave put his head under juggernauts chariotwheel have sacrificed any ease comfort or pleasure for the youngsters benefit one great passion he had had and closed the account of it a worldly ambitious girlhow foolishly worshipped and passionately beloved no matterhad played with him for years had flung him away when a dissolute suitor with a great fortune and title had offered himself was he to whine and despair because a jilt had fooled him he had too much pride and courage for any such submission he would accept the lot in life which was offered to him no undesirable one surely he would fulfil the wish of his fathers heart and cheer his kind declining years in this way the marriage was brought about it was but a whisper to rosey in the drawingroom a start and a blush from the little girl as he took the little willing hand a kiss for her from her delighted old fatherinlaw a twinkle in good old jamess eyes and double embrace from the campaigner as she stood over them in a benedictory attitudeexpressing her surprise at an event for which she had been jockeying ever since she set eyes on young newcome and calling upon heaven to bless her children so as a good thing when it is to be done had best be done quickly these worthy folks went off almost straightway to a clergyman and were married out of handto the astonishment of captains hoby and goby when they came to hear of the event well my gallant young painter and friend of my boyhood if my wife chooses to be angry at your marriage shall her husband not wish you happy  suppose we had married our first loves others of us were we the happier now ask mr pendennis who sulked in his tents when his costigan his briseis was ravished from him ask poor george warrington who had his own way heaven help him there was no need why clive should turn monk because number one refused him and that charmer removed why he should not take to his heart number two i am bound to say that when i expressed these opinions to mrs laura she was more angry and provoked than ever  it is in the nature of such a simple soul as thomas newcome to see but one side of a question and having once fixed ethels worldliness in his mind and her brothers treason to allow no argument of advocates of the other side to shake his displeasure hence the one or two appeals which laura ventured to make on behalf of her friend were checked by the good colonel with a stern negation if ethel was not guiltless she could not make him see at least that she was not guilty he dashed away all excuses and palliations exasperated as he was he persisted in regarding the poor girls conduct in its most unfavourable light she was rejected and deservedly rejected by the marquis of farintosh he broke out to me once who was not indeed authorised to tell all i knew regarding the story the whole town knows it all the clubs ring with it i blush sir to think that my brothers child should have brought such a stain upon our name in vain i told him that my wife who knew all the circumstances much better judged miss newcome far more favourably and indeed greatly esteemed and loved her pshaw sir breaks out the indignant colonel your wife is an innocent creature who does not know the world as we men of experience doas i do sir and would have no more of the discussion there is no doubt about it there was a coolness between my old friends father and us  as for barnes newcome we gave up that worthy and the colonel showed him no mercy he recalled words used by warrington which i have recorded in a former page and vowed that he only watched for an opportunity to crush the miserable reptile he hated barnes as a loathsome traitor coward and criminal he made no secret of his opinion and clive with the remembrance of former injuries of dreadful heartpangs the inheritor of his fathers blood his honesty of nature and his impetuous enmity against wrong shared to the full his sires antipathy against his cousin and publicly expressed his scorn and contempt for him about ethel he would not speak perhaps what you say pen is true he said i hope it is pray god it is but his quivering lips and fierce countenance when her name was mentioned or her defence attempted showed that he too had come to think ill of her as for her brother as for that scoundrel he would say clenching his fist if ever i can punish him i will i shouldnt have the soul of a dog if ever i forgot the wrongs that have been done me by that vagabond forgiveness pshaw are you dangling to sermons pen at your wifes leadingstrings are you preaching that cant there are some injuries that no honest man should forgive and i shall be a rogue on the day i shake hands with that villain  clive has adopted the iroquois ethics says george warrington smoking his pipe sententiously rather than those which are at present received among us i am not sure that something is not to be said as against the eastern upon the western or tomahawk or ojibbeway side of the question i should not like he added to be in a vendetta or feud and to have you clive and the old colonel engaged against me  i would rather i said for my part have half a dozen such enemies as clive and the colonel than one like barnes you never know where or when that villain may hit you and before a very short period was over sir barnes newcome bart hit his two hostile kinsmen such a blow as one might expect from such a quarter     chapter lxiii mrs clive at home   clive and his father did not think fit to conceal their opinions regarding their kinsman barnes newcome and uttered them in many public places when sir barness conduct was brought into question we may be sure that their talk came to the baronets ears and did not improve his already angry feeling towards those gentlemen for a while they had the best of the attack the colonel routed barnes out of his accustomed club at bayss where also the gallant sir george tufto expressed himself pretty openly with respect to the poor baronets want of courage the colonel had bullied and browbeaten barnes in the parlour of his own bank and the story was naturally well known in the city where it certainly was not pleasant for sir barnes as he walked to change to meet sometimes the scowls of the angry man of war his uncle striding down to the offices of the bundelcund bank and armed with that terrible bamboo cane  but though his wife had undeniably run away after notorious illtreatment from her husband though he had shown two white feathers in those unpleasant little affairs with his uncle and cousin though sir barnes newcome was certainly neither amiable nor popular in the city of london his reputation as a most intelligent man of business still stood the credit of his house was deservedly high and people banked with him and traded with him in spite of faithless wives and hostile colonels  when the outbreak between colonel newcome and his nephew took place it may be remembered that mr hobson newcome the other partner of the firm of hobson brothers waited upon colonel newcome as one of the principal english directors of the b b c and hoped that although private differences would of course oblige thomas newcome to cease all personal dealings with the bank of hobson the affairs of the company in which he was interested ought not to suffer on this account and that the indian firm should continue dealing with hobsons on the same footing as before mr hobson newcome represented to the colonel in his jolly frank way that whatever happened between the latter and his nephew barnes thomas newcome had still one friend in the house that the transactions between it and the indian company were mutually advantageous finally that the manager of the indian bank might continue to do business with hobsons as before so the b b c sent its consignments to hobson brothers and drew its bills which were duly honoured by that firm  more than one of colonel newcomes city acquaintances among them his agent mr jolly and his ingenuous friend mr sherrick especially hinted to thomas newcome to be very cautious in his dealings with hobson brothers and keep a special care lest that house should play him an evil turn they both told him that barnes newcome had said more than once in answer to reports of the colonels own speeches against barnes i know that hotheaded blundering indian uncle of mine is furious against me on account of an absurd private affair and misunderstanding which he is too obstinate to see in the proper light what is my return for the abuse and rant which he lavishes against me i cannot forget that he is my grandfathers son an old man utterly ignorant both of society and business here and as he is interested in this indian banking company which must be preciously conducted when it appointed him as the guardian and overseer of its affairs in england i do my very best to serve the company and i can tell you its blundering muddleheaded managers black and white owe no little to the assistance which they have had from our house if they dont like us why do they go on dealing with us we dont want them and their bills we were a leading house fifty years before they were born and shall continue to be so long after they come to an end such was barness case as stated by himself it was not a very bad one or very unfairly stated considering the advocate i believe he has always persisted in thinking that he never did his uncle any wrong  mr jolly and mr sherrick then both entreated thomas newcome to use his best endeavours and bring the connexion of the b b c and hobson brothers to a speedy end but jolly was an interested party he and his friends would have had the agency of the b b c and the profits thereof which hobsons had taken from them mr sherrick was an outside practitioner a guerilla amongst regular merchants the opinions of one and the other though submitted by thomas newcome duly to his copartners the managers and london board of directors of the bundelcund banking company were overruled by that assembly  they had their establishment and apartments in the city they had their clerks and messengers their managers room and boardroom their meetings where no doubt great quantities of letters were read vast ledgers produced where tom newcome was voted into the chair and voted out with thanks where speeches were made and the affairs of the b b c properly discussed these subjects are mysterious terrifying unknown to me i cannot pretend to describe them fred bayham i remember used to be great in his knowledge of the affairs of the bundelcund banking company he talked of cotton wool copper opium indigo singapore manilla china calcutta australia with prodigious eloquence and fluency his conversation was about millions the most astounding paragraphs used to appear in the pall mall gazette regarding the annual dinner at blackwall which the directors gave and to which he and george and i as friends of the court were invited what orations were uttered what flowing bumpers emptied in the praise of this great company what quantities of turtle and punch did fred devour at its expense colonel newcome was the kindly old chairman at these banquets the prince his son taking but a modest part in the ceremonies and sitting with us his old cronies  all the gentlemen connected with the board all those with whom the b b c traded in london paid thomas newcome extraordinary respect his character for wealth was deservedly great and of course multiplied by the tongue of rumour f b knew to a few millions of rupees more or less what the colonel possessed and what clive would inherit thomas newcomes distinguished military services his high bearing lofty courtesy simple but touching garrulityfor the honest man talked much more now than he had been accustomed to do in former days and was not insensible to the flattery which his wealth brought himhis reputation as a keen man of business who had made his own fortune by operations equally prudent and spirited and who might make the fortunes of hundreds of other people brought the worthy colonel a number of friends and i promise you that the loudest huzzahs greeted his health when it was proposed at the blackwall dinners at the second annual dinner after clives marriage some friends presented mrs clive newcome with a fine testimonial there was a superb silver cocoanut tree whereof the leaves were dexterously arranged for holding candle and pickles under the cocoanut was an indian prince on a camel giving his hand to a cavalry officer on horsebacka howitzer a plough a loom a bale of cotton on which were the east india companys arms a brahmin britannia and commerce with a cornucopia were grouped round the principal figures and if you would see a noble account of this chaste and elegant specimen of british art you are referred to the pages of the pall mall gazette of that year as well as to fred bayhams noble speech in the course of the evening when it was exhibited the east and its wars and its heroes assaye and seringapatam and lord lake and laswaree too calls out the colonel greatly elated tigerhunting palanquins juggernaut elephants the burning of widowsall passed before us in f bs splendid oration he spoke of the product of the indian forest the palmtree the cocoanut tree the banyantree palms the colonel had already brought back with him the palms of valour won in the field of war cheers cocoanut trees he had never seen though he had heard wonders related regarding the milky contents of their fruit here at any rate was one tree of the kind under the branches of which he humbly trusted often to reposeand if he might be so bold as to carry on the eastern metaphor he would say knowing the excellence of the colonels claret and the splendour of his hospitality that he would prefer a cocoanut day at the colonels to a banyan day anywhere else whilst f bs speech went on i remember j j eyeing the trophy and the queer expression of his shrewd face the health of british artists was drunk a propos of this splendid specimen of their skill and poor j j ridley esq ara had scarce a word to say in return he and clive sat by one another the latter very silent and gloomy when j j and i met in the world we talked about our friend and it was easy for both of us to see that neither was satisfied with clives condition  the fine house in tyburnia was completed by this time as gorgeous as money could make it how different it was from the old fitzroy square mansion with its ramshackle furniture and spoils of brokers shops and tottenham court road odds and ends an oxford street upholsterer had been let loose in the yet virgin chambers and that inventive genius had decorated them with all the wonders his fancy could devise roses and cupids quivered on the ceilings up to which golden arabesques crawled from the walls your face handsome or otherwise was reflected by countless lookingglasses so multiplied and arranged as as it were to carry you into the next street you trod on velvet pausing with respect in the centre of the carpet where roseys cypher was worked in the sweet flowers which bear her name what delightful crooked legs the chairs had what corner cupboards there were filled with dresden gimcracks which it was a part of this little womans business in life to purchase what etageres and bonbonnieres and chiffonnieres what awfully bad pastels there were on the walls what frightful boucher and lancret shepherds and shepherdesses leered over the portieres what velvetbound volumes motherofpearl albums inkstands representing beasts of the field priedieu chairs and wonderful knickknacks i can recollect there was the most magnificent piano though rosey seldom sang any of her six songs now and when she kept her couch at a certain most interesting period the good colonel ever anxious to procure amusement for his darling asked whether she would not like a barrelorgan grinding fifty or sixty favourite pieces which a bearer could turn and he mentioned how windus of their regiment who loved music exceedingly had a very fine instrument of this kind out to barrackpore in the year 1810 and relays of barrels by each ship with all the new tunes from europe the testimonial took its place in the centre of mrs clives table surrounded by satellites of plate the delectable parties were constantly gathered together the grand barouche rolling in the park or stopping at the principal shops little rosey bloomed in millinery and was still the smiling little pet of her fatherinlaw and poor clive in the midst of all these splendours was gaunt and sad and silent listless at most times bitter and savage at others pleased only when he was out of the society which bored him and in the company of george and j j the simple friends of his youth  his careworn look and altered appearance mollified my wife towards himwho had almost taken him again into favour but she did not care for mrs clive and the colonel somehow grew cool towards us and to look askance upon the little band of clives friends it seemed as if there were two parties in the house there was clives setj j the shrewd silent little painter warrington the cynic and the author of the present biography who was i believe supposed to give himself contemptuous airs and to have become very high and mighty since his marriage then there was the great numerous and eminently respectable set whose names were all registered in little roseys little visitingbook and to whose houses she drove round duly delivering the cards of mr and mrs clive newcome and colonel newcomethe generals and colonels the judges and the fogies the only man who kept well with both sides of the house was f bayham esq who having got into clover remained in the enjoyment of that welcome pasture who really loved clive and the colonel too and had a hundred pleasant things and funny stories the droll old creature to tell to the little lady for whom we others could scarcely find a word the old friends of the studentdays were not forgotten but they did not seem to get on in the new house the miss gandishes came to one of mrs clives balls still in blue crape still with ringlets on their wizened old foreheads accompanying papa with his shirtcollars turned downwho gazed in mute wonder on the splendid scene warrington actually asked miss gandish to dance making woeful blunders however in the quadrille while clive with something like one of his old smiles on his face took out miss zoe gandish her sister we made gandish overeat and overdrink himself in the supperroom and clive cheered him by ordering a full length of mrs clive newcome from his distinguished pencil never was seen a grander exhibition of white satin and jewels smee ra was furious at the preference shown to his rival  we had sandy mcollop too at the party who had returned from rome with his red beard and his picture of the murder of the red comyn which made but a dim effect in the octagon room of the royal academy where the bleeding agonies of the dying warrior were veiled in an unkind twilight on sandy and his brethren little rosey looked rather coldly she tossed up her little head in conversation with me and gave me to understand that this party was only an omnium gatherum not one of the select parties from which heaven defend us we are poins and nym and pistol growled out george warrington as he strode away to finish the evening in clives painting and smokingroom now prince hal is married and shares the paternal throne his princess is ashamed of his brigand associates of former days she came and looked at us with a feeble little smile as we sat smoking and let the daylight in on us from the open door and hinted to mr clive that it was time to go to bed  so clive newcome lay in a bed of down and tossed and tumbled there he went to fine dinners and sat silent over them rode fine horses and black care jumped up behind the moody horseman he was cut off in a great measure from the friends of his youth or saw them by a kind of stealth and sufferance was a very lonely poor fellow i am afraid now that people were testimonialising his wife and many an old comrade growling at his haughtiness and prosperity  in former days when his good father recognised the difference which fate and time and temper had set between him and his son we have seen with what a gentle acquiescence the old man submitted to his inevitable fortune and how humbly he bore that stroke of separation which afflicted the boy lightly enough but caused the loving sire so much pain then there was no bitterness between them in spite of the fatal division but now it seemed as if there was anger on thomas newcomes part because though come together again they were not united though with every outward appliance of happiness clive was not happy what young man on earth could look for more a sweet young wife a handsome home of which the only encumbrance was an old father who would give his last drop of blood in his sons behalf and it was to bring about this end that thomas newcome had toiled and had amassed a fortune could not clive with his talents and education go down once or twice a week to the city and take a decent part in the business by which his wealth was secured he appeared at the various boardrooms and city conclaves yawned at the meetings and drew figures on the blottingpaper of the company had no interest in its transactions no heart in its affairs went away and galloped his horse alone or returned to his paintingroom put on his old velvet jacket and worked with his palettes and brushes palettes and brushes could he not give up these toys when he was called to a much higher station in the world could he not go talk with roseydrive with rosey kind little soul whose whole desire was to make him happy such thoughts as these no doubt darkened the colonels mind and deepened the furrows round his old eyes so it is we judge men by our own standards judge our nearest and dearest often wrong  many and many a time did clive try and talk with the little rosey who chirped and prattled so gaily to his father many a time would she come and sit by his easel and try her little powers to charm him bring him little tales about their acquaintances stories about this ball and that concert practise artless smiles upon him gentle little bouderies tears perhaps followed by caresses and reconciliation at the end of which he would return to his cigar and she with a sigh and a heavy heart to the good old man who had bidden her to go and talk with him he used to feel that his father had sent her the thought came across him in their conversations and straightway his heart would shut up and his face grew gloomy they were not made to mate with one another this was the truth the shoe was a very pretty little shoe but clives foot was too big for it  just before the testimonial mr clive was in constant attendance at home and very careful and kind and happy with his wife and the whole family party went very agreeably doctors were in constant attendance at mrs clive newcomes door prodigious care was taken by the good colonel in wrapping her and in putting her little feet on sofas and in leading her to her carriage the campaigner came over in immense flurry from edinburgh where uncle james was now very comfortably lodged in picardy place with the most agreeable society round about him and all this circle was in a word very close and happy and intimate but woe is me thomas newcomes fondest hopes were disappointed this time his little grandson lived but to see the light and leave it and sadly sadly those preparations were put away those poor little robes and caps those delicate muslins and cambrics over which many a care had been forgotten many a fond prayer thought if not uttered poor little rosey she felt the grief very keenly but she rallied from it very soon in a very few months her cheeks were blooming and dimpling with smiles again and she was telling us how her party was an omnium gatherum  the campaigner had ere this returned to the scene of her northern exploits not i believe entirely of the worthy womans own free will assuming the command of the household whilst her daughter kept her sofa mrs mackenzie had set that establishment into uproar and mutiny she had offended the butler outraged the housekeeper wounded the sensibilities of the footmen insulted the doctor and trampled on the inmost corns of the nurse it was surprising what a change appeared in the campaigners conduct and how little in former days colonel newcome had known her what the emperor napoleon the first said respecting our russian enemies might be applied to this lady grattezla and she appeared a tartar clive and his father had a little comfort and conversation in conspiring against her the old man never dared to try but was pleased with the youngers spirit and gallantry in the series of final actions which commencing over poor little roseys prostrate body in the dressingroom were continued in the drawingroom resumed with terrible vigour on the enemys part in the diningroom and ended to the triumph of the whole establishment at the outside of the halldoor  when the routed tartar force had fled back to its native north rosey made a confession which clive told me afterwards bursting with bitter laughter you and papa seem to be very much agitated she said rosey called the colonel papa in the absence of the campaigner i do not mind it a bit except just at first when it made me a little nervous mamma used always to be so she used to scold and scold all day both me and josey in scotland till grandmamma sent her away and then in fitzroy square and then in brussels she used to box my ears and go into such tantrums and i think adds rosey with one of her sweetest smiles she had quarrelled with uncle james before she came to us  she used to box roseys ears roars out poor clive and go into such tantrums in fitzroy square and brussels afterwards and the pair would come down with their arms round each others waists smirking and smiling as if they had done nothing but kiss each other all their mortal lives this is what we know about womenthis is what we get and find years afterwards when we think we have married a smiling artless young creature are you all such hypocrites mrs pendennis and he pulled his mustachios in his wrath  poor clive says laura very kindly you would not have had her tell tales of her mother would you  oh of course not breaks out clive that is what you all say and so you are hypocrites out of sheer virtue  it was the first time laura had called him clive for many a day she was becoming reconciled to him we had our own opinion about the young fellows marriage  and to sum up all upon a casual rencontre with the young gentleman in question whom we saw descending from a hansom at the steps of the flag pall mall i opined that dark thoughts of hoby had entered into clive newcomes mind othellolike he scowled after that unconscious cassio as the other passed into the club in his lacquered boots     chapter lxiv absit omen   at the first of the blackwall festivals hobson newcome was present in spite of the quarrel which had taken place between his elder brother and the chief of the firm of hobson brothers and newcome but it was the individual barnes and the individual thomas who had had a difference together the bundelcund bank was not at variance with its chief house of commission in london no man drank prosperity to the b b c upon occasion of this festival with greater fervour than hobson newcome and the manner in which he just slightly alluded in his own little speech of thanks to the notorious differences between colonel newcome and his nephew praying that these might cease some day and meanwhile that the confidence between the great indian establishment and its london agents might never diminish was appreciated and admired by sixandthirty gentlemen all brimful of claret and enthusiasm and in that happy state of mind in which men appreciate and admire everything  at the second dinner when the testimonial was presented hobson was not present nor did his name figure amongst those engraven on the trunk of mr newcomes allegorical silver cocoanut tree as we travelled homewards in the omnibus fred bayham noticed the circumstance to me i have looked over the list of names says he not merely that on the trunk sir but the printed list it was rolled up and placed in one of the nests on the top of the tree why is hobsons name not thereha it mislikes me pendennis  f b who was now very great about city affairs discoursed about stocks and companies with immense learning and gave me to understand that he had transacted one or two little operations in capel court on his own account with great present and still larger prospective advantages to himself it is a fact that mr ridley was paid and that f bs costume though still eccentric was comfortable cleanly and variegated he occupied the apartments once tenanted by the amiable honeyman he lived in ease and comfort there you dont suppose says he that the wretched stipend i draw from the pall mall gazette enables me to maintain this kind of thing f b sir has a station in the world f b moves among moneyers and city nobs and eats cabobs with wealthy nabobs he may marry sir and settle in life we cordially wished every worldly prosperity to the brave f b  happening to descry him one day in the park i remarked that his countenance wore an ominous and tragic appearance which seemed to deepen as he neared me i thought he had been toying affably with a nurserymaid the moment before who stood with some of her little charges watching the yachts upon the serpentine howbeit espying my approach f b strode away from the maiden and her innocent companions and advanced to greet his old acquaintance enveloping his face with shades of funereal gloom  yon were the children of my good friend colonel huckaback of the bombay marines alas unconscious of their doom the little infants play i was watching them at their sports there is a pleasing young woman in attendance upon the poor children they were sailing their little boats upon the serpentine racing and laughing and making merry and as i looked on master hastings huckabacks boat went down absit omen pendennis i was moved by the circumstance f b hopes that the childs fathers argosy may not meet with shipwreck  you mean the little yellowfaced man whom we met at colonel newcomes says mr pendennis  i do sir growled f b you know that he is a brother director with our colonel in the bundelcund bank  gracious heavens i cried in sincere anxiety nothin has happened i hope to the bundelcund bank  no answers the other nothing has happened the good ship is safe sir as yet but she has narrowly escaped a great danger pendennis cries f b gripping my arm with great energy there was a traitor in her crewshe has weathered the storm noblywho would have sent her on the rocks sir who would have scuttled her at midnight  pray drop your nautical metaphors and tell me what you mean cries f bs companion and bayham continued his narration  were you in the least conversant with city affairs he said or did you deign to visit the spot where merchants mostly congregate you would have heard the story which was over the whole city yesterday and spread dismay from threadneedle street to leadenhall the story is that the firm of hobson brothers and newcome yesterday refused acceptance of thirty thousand pounds worth of bills of the bundelcund banking company of india  the news came like a thunderclap upon the london board of directors who had received no notice of the intentions of hobson brothers and caused a dreadful panic amongst the shareholders of the concern the boardroom was besieged by colonels and captains widows and orphans within an hour after protest of bills were taken up and you will see in the city article of the globe this very evening an announcement that henceforward the house of baines and jolly of job court will meet engagements of the bundelcund banking company of india being provided with ample funds to do honour to every possible liability of that company but the shares fell sir in consequence of the panic i hope they will rally i trust and believe they will rally for our good colonels sake and that of his friends for the sake of the innocent children sporting by the serpentine yonder  i had my suspicions when they gave that testimonial said f b in my experience of life sir i always feel rather shy about testimonials and when a party gets one somehow look out to hear of his smashing the next month absit omen i will say again i like not the going down of yonder little yacht  the globe sure enough contained a paragraph that evening announcing the occurrence which mr bayham had described and the temporary panic which it had occasioned and containing an advertisement stating that messrs baines and jolly would henceforth act as agents of the indian company legal proceedings were presently threatened by the solicitors of the company against the banking firm which had caused so much mischief mr hobson newcome was absent abroad when the circumstance took place and it was known that the protest of the bills was solely attributable to his nephew and partner but after the break between the two firms there was a rupture between hobsons family and colonel newcome the exasperated colonel vowed that his brother and his nephew were traitors alike and would have no further dealings with one or the other even poor innocent sam newcome coming up to london from oxford where he had been plucked and offering a hand to clive was frowned away by our colonel who spoke in terms of great displeasure to his son for taking the least notice of the young traitor  our colonel was changed changed in his heart changed in his whole demeanour towards the world and above all towards his son for whom he had made so many kind sacrifices in his old days we have said how ever since clives marriage a tacit strife had been growing up between father and son the boys evident unhappiness was like a reproach to his father his very silence angered the old man his want of confidence daily chafed and annoyed him at the head of a large fortune which he rightly persisted in spending he felt angry with himself because he could not enjoy it angry with his son who should have helped him in the administration of his new estate and who was but a listless useless member of the little confederacy a living protest against all the schemes of the good mans past life the catastrophe in the city again brought father and son together somewhat and the vindictiveness of both was roused by barness treason time was when the colonel himself would have viewed his kinsman more charitably but fate and circumstance had angered that originally friendly and gentle disposition hate and suspicion had mastered him and if it cannot be said that his new life had changed him at least it had brought out faults for which there had hitherto been no occasion and qualities latent before do we know ourselves or what good or evil circumstance may bring from us did cain know as he and his younger brother played round their mothers knee that the little hand which caressed abel should one day grow larger and seize a brand to slay him thrice fortunate he to whom circumstance is made easy whom fate visits with gentle trial and kindly heaven keeps out of temptation  in the stage which the family feud now reached and which the biographer of the newcomes is bound to describe there is one gentle moralist who gives her sentence decidedly against clives father whilst on the other hand a rough philosopher and friend of mine whose opinions used to have some weight with me stoutly declares that they were right war and justice are good things says george warrington rattling his clenched fist on the table i maintain them and the common sense of the world maintains them against the preaching of all the honeymans that ever puled from the pulpit i have not the least objection in life to a rogue being hung when a scoundrel is whipped i am pleased and say serve him right if any gentleman will horsewhip sir barnes newcome baronet i shall not be shocked but on the contrary go home and order an extra muttonchop for dinner  ah revenge is wrong pen pleads the other counsellor  let alone that the wisest and best of all judges has condemned it it blackens the hearts of men it distorts their views of right it sets them to devise evil it causes them to think unjustly of others it is not the noblest return for injury not even the bravest way of meeting it the greatest courage is to bear persecution not to answer when you are reviled and when wrong has been done you to forgive i am sorry for what you call the colonels triumph and his enemys humiliation let barnes be as odious as you will he ought never to have humiliated ethels brother but he is weak other gentlemen as well are weak mr pen although you are so much cleverer than women i have no patience with the colonel and i beg you to tell him whether he asks you or not that he has lost my good graces and that i for one will not huzzah at what his friends and flatterers call his triumphs and that i dont think in this instance he has acted like the dear colonel and the good colonel and the good christian that i once thought him  we must now tell what the colonel and clive had been doing and what caused two such different opinions respecting their conduct from the two critics just named the refusal of the london banking house to accept the bills of the great indian company of course affected very much the credit of that company in this country sedative announcements were issued by the directors in london brilliant accounts of the companys affairs abroad were published proof incontrovertible was given that the b b c was never in so flourishing a state as at that time when hobson brothers had refused its drafts there could be no question that the company had received a severe wound and was deeply if not vitally injured by the conduct of the london firm  the propensity to sell out became quite epidemic amongst the shareholders everybody was anxious to realise why out of the thirty names inscribed on poor mrs clives cocoanut tree no less than twenty deserters might be mentioned or at least who would desert could they find an opportunity of doing so with arms and baggage wrathfully the good colonel scratched the names of those faithless ones out of his daughters visitingbook haughtily he met them in the street to desert the b b c at the hour of peril was in his idea like applying for leave of absence on the eve of an action he would not see that the question was not one of sentiment at all but of chances and arithmetic he would not hear with patience of men quitting the ship as he called it they may go sir says he but let them never more be officers of mine with scorn and indignation he paid off one or two timid friends who were anxious to fly and purchased their shares out of his own pocket but his purse was not long enough for this kind of amusement what money he had was invested in the company already and his name further pledged for meeting the engagements from which their late london bankers had withdrawn  those gentlemen in the meanwhile spoke of their differences with the indian bank as quite natural and laughed at the absurd charges of personal hostility which poor thomas newcome publicly preferred here is a hotheaded old indian dragoon says sir barnes who knows no more about business than i do about cavalry tactics or hindostanee who gets into a partnership along with other dragoons and indian wiseacres with some uncommonly wily old native practitioners and they pay great dividends and they set up a bank of course we will do these peoples business as long as we are covered but i have always told their manager that we would run no risks whatever and close the account the very moment it did not suit us to keep it and so we parted company six weeks ago since when there has been a panic in the company a panic which has been increased by colonel newcomes absurd swagger and folly he says i am his enemy enemy indeed so i am in private life but what has that to do with business in business begad there are no friends and no enemies at all i leave all my sentiment on the other side of temple bar  so thomas newcome and clive the son of thomas had wrath in their hearts against barnes their kinsman and desired to be revenged upon him and were eager after his undoing and longed for an opportunity when they might meet him and overcome him and put him to shame  when men are in this frame of mind a certain personage is said always to be at hand to help them and give them occasion for indulging in their pretty little passion what is sheer hate seems to the individual entertaining the sentiment so like indignant virtue that he often indulges in the propensity to the full nay lauds himself for the exercise of it i am sure if thomas newcome in his present desire for retaliation against barnes had known the real nature of his sentiments towards that worthy his conduct would have been different and we should have heard of no such active hostilities as ensued    chapter lxv in which mrs clive comes into her fortune   speaking of the affairs of b b c sir barnes newcome always took care to maintain his candid surprise relating to the proceedings of that company he set about evil reports against it he endeavour to do it a wrongabsurd if a friend were to ask him and it was quite curious what a number did manage to ask him whether he thought the company was an advantageous investment of course he would give an answer he could not say conscientiously he thought sonever once had said soin the time of their connexion which had been formed solely with a view of obliging his amiable uncle it was a quarrelsome company a dragoon company a company of gentlemen accustomed to gunpowder and fed on mulligatawny he forsooth be hostile to it there were some companies that required no enemies at all and would be pretty sure to go to the deuce their own way  thus and with this amiable candour spake barnes about a commercial speculation the merits of which he had a right to canvass as well as any other citizen as for uncle hobson his conduct was characterised by a timidity which one would scarcely have expected from a gentleman of his florid jolly countenance active habits and generally manly demeanour he kept away from the cocoanut feast as we have seen he protested privily to the colonel that his private goodwill continued undiminished but he was deeply grieved at the b b c affair which took place while he was on the continentconfound the continent my wife would goand which was entirely without his cognisance the colonel received his brothers excuses first with awful bows and ceremony and finally with laughter my good hobson said he with the most insufferable kindness of course you intended to be friendly of course the affair was done without your knowledge we understand that sort of thing london bankers have no heartsfor these last fifty years past that i have known you and your brother and my amiable nephew the present commanding officer has there been anything in your conduct that has led me to suppose you had and herewith colonel newcome burst out into a laugh it was not a pleasant laugh to hear worthy hobson took his hat and walked away brushing it round and round and looking very confused the colonel strode after him downstairs and made him an awful bow at the hall door never again did hobson newcome set foot in that tyburnian mansion  during the whole of that season of the testimonial the cocoanut figured in an extraordinary number of banquets the colonels hospitalities were more profuse than ever and mrs clives toilettes more brilliant clive in his confidential conversations with his friends was very dismal and gloomy when i asked city news of our wellinformed friend f b i am sorry to say his countenance became funereal the b b c shares which had been at an immense premium twelve months since were now slowly falling falling  i wish said mr sherrick to me the colonel would realise even now like that mr ratray who has just come out of the ship and brought a hundred thousand pounds with him  come out of the ship you little know the colonel mr sherrick if you think he will ever do that  mr ratray though he had returned to europe gave the most cheering accounts of the b b c it was in the most flourishing state shares sure to get up again he had sold out entirely on account of his liver must come homethe doctor said so  some months afterwards another director mr hedges came home both of these gentlemen as we know entertained the fashionable world got seats in parliament purchased places in the country and were greatly respected mr hedges came out but his wealthy partner mr mgaspey entered into the b b c the entry of mr mgaspey into the affairs of the companyt did not seem to produce very great excitement in england the shares slowly fell however there was a prodigious indigo crop the london manager was in perfect goodhumour in spite of this and that of defections of unpleasantries of unfavourable whispers and doubtful friendsthomas newcome kept his head high and his face was always kind and smiling except when certain family enemies were mentioned and he frowned like jove in anger  we have seen how very fond little rosey was of her mamma of her uncle james binnie and now of her papa as she affectionately styled thomas newcome this affection i am sure the two gentlemen returned with all their hearts and but that they were much too generous and simpleminded to entertain such a feeling it may be wondered that the two good old boys were not a little jealous of one another howbeit it does not appear that they entertained such a feeling at least it never interrupted the kindly friendship between them and clive was regarded in the light of a son by both of them and each contented himself with his moiety of the smiling little girls affection  as long as they were with her the truth is little mrs clive was very fond of people very docile obedient easily pleased brisk kind and goodhumoured she charmed her two old friends with little songs little smileslittle kind offices little caresses and having administered thomas newcomes cigar to him in the daintiest prettiest way she would trip off to drive with james binnie or sit at his dinner if he was indisposed and be as gay neathanded watchful and attentive a child as any old gentleman could desire  she did not seem to be very sorry to part with mamma a want of feeling which that lady bitterly deplored in her subsequent conversation with her friends about mrs clive newcome possibly there were reasons why rosey should not be very much vexed at quitting mamma but surely she might have dropped a little tear as she took leave of kind good old james binnie not she the gentlemans voice faltered but hers did not in the least she kissed him on the face all smiles blushes and happiness and tripped into the railway carriage with her husband and fatherinlaw leaving the poor old uncle very sad our women said i know not why that little rosey had no heart at all women are accustomed to give such opinions respecting the wives of their newly married friends i am bound to add and i do so during mr clive newcomes absence from england otherwise i should not like to venture upon the statement that some men concur with the ladies opinion of mrs clive for instance captains goby and hoby declare that her treatment of the latter her encouragement and desertion of him when clive made his proposals were shameful  at this time rosey was in a pupillary state a good obedient little girl her duty was to obey the wishes of her dear mamma how show her sense of virtue and obedience better than by promptly and cheerfully obeying mamma and at the orders of that experienced campaigner giving up bobby hoby and going to england to a fine house to be presented at court to have all sorts of pleasure with a handsome young husband and a kind fatherinlaw by her side no wonder rosey was not in a very active state of grief at parting from uncle james he strove to console himself with these considerations when he had returned to the empty house where she had danced and smiled and warbled and he looked at the chair she sat in and at the great mirror which had so often reflected her fresh pretty facethe great callous mirror which now only framed upon its shining sheet the turban and the ringlets and the plump person and the resolute smile of the old campaigner  after that parting with her uncle at the brussels railway rosey never again beheld him he passed into the campaigners keeping from which alone he was rescued by the summons of pallid death he met that summons like a philosopher rejected rather testily all the mortuary consolations which his nephewinlaw joseys husband thought proper to bring to his bedside and uttered opinions which scandalised that divine but as he left mrs mcraw only 500 pounds thrice that sum to his sister and the remainder of his property to his beloved niece rosa mackenzie now rosa newcome let us trust that mr mcraw hurt and angry at the illfavour shown to his wife his third young wife his bestbeloved josey at the impatience with which the deceased had always received his mr mcraws own sermonslet us hope i say that the reverend gentleman was mistaken in his views respecting the present position of mr james binnies soul and that heaven may have some regions yet accessible to james which mr mcraws intellect has not yet explored look gentlemen does a week pass without the announcement of the discovery of a new comet in the sky a new star in the heaven twinkling dimly out of a yet farther distance and only now becoming visible to human ken though existent for ever and ever so let us hope divine truths may be shining and regions of light and love extant which geneva glasses cannot yet perceive and are beyond the focus of roman telescopes  i think clive and the colonel were more affected by the news of jamess death than rosey concerning whose wonderful strength of mind good thomas newcome discoursed to my laura and me when fancying that my friends wife needed comfort and consolation mrs pendennis went to visit her of course we shall have no more parties this year sighed rosey she looked very pretty in her black dress clive in his hearty way said a hundred kind feeling things about the departed friend thomas newcomes recollections of him and regret were no less tender and sincere see says he how that dear childs sense of duty makes her hide her feelings her grief is most deep but she wears a calm countenance i see her looking sad in private but i no sooner speak than she smiles i think said laura as we came away that colonel newcome performs all the courtship part in the marriage and clive poor clive though he spoke very nobly and generously about mr binnie i am sure it is not his old friends death merely which makes him so unhappy  poor clive by right of his wife was now rich clive the little lady having inherited from her kind relative no inconsiderable sum of money in a very early part of this story mention has been made of a small sum producing one hundred pounds a year which clives father had made over to the lad when he sent him from india this little sum mr clive had settled upon his wife before his marriage being indeed all he had of his own for the famous bank shares which his father presented to him were only made over formally when the young man came to london after his marriage and at the paternal request and order appeared as a most inefficient director of the b b c now mrs newcome of her inheritance possessed not only b b c shares but moneys in bank and shares in east india stock so that clive in the right of his wife had a seat in the assembly of east india shareholders and a voice in the election of directors of that famous company i promise you mrs clive was a personage of no little importance she carried her little head with an aplomb and gravity which amused some of us f b bent his most respectfully down before her she sent him on messages and deigned to ask him to dinner he once more wore a cheerful countenance the clouds which gathered oer the sun of newcome were in the bosom of the ocean buried bayham said by james binnies brilliant behaviour to his niece  clive was a proprietor of east india stock and had a vote in electing the directors of that company and who so fit to be a director of his affairs as thomas newcome esq companion of the bath and so long a distinguished officer in its army to hold this position of director used up to very late days to be the natural ambition of many east indian gentlemen colonel newcome had often thought of offering himself as a candidate and now openly placed himself on the lists and publicly announced his intention his interest was rather powerful through the indian bank of which he was a director and many of the shareholders of which were proprietors of the east india company to have a director of the b b c also a member of the parliament in leadenhall street would naturally be beneficial to the former institution thomas newcomes prospectuses were issued accordingly and his canvass received with tolerable favour  within a very short time another candidate appeared in the fielda retired bombay lawyer of considerable repute and large meansand at the head of this gentlemans committee appeared the names of hobson brothers and newcome very formidable personages at the east india house with which the bank of hobson brothers have had dealings for half a century past and where the old lady who founded or consolidated that family had had three stars before her own venerable name which had descended upon her son sir brian and her grandson sir barnes  war was thus openly declared between thomas newcome and his nephew the canvass on both sides was very hot and eager the number of promises was pretty equal the election was not to come off yet for a while for aspirants to the honourable office of director used to announce their wishes years before they could be fulfilled and returned again and again to the contest before they finally won it howbeit the colonels prospects were very fair and a prodigious indigo crop came in to favour the b b c with the most brilliant report from the board at calcutta the shares still somewhat sluggish rose again the colonels hopes with them and the courage of gentlemen at home who had invested their money in the transaction  we were sitting one day round the colonels dinnertable it was not one of the cocoanuttree days that emblem was locked up in the butlers pantry and only beheld the lamps on occasions of state it was a snug family party in the early part of the year when scarcely anybody was in town only george warrington and f b and mr and mrs pendennis and the ladies having retired we were having such a talk as we used to enjoy in quiet old days before marriages and cares and divisions had separated us  f b led the conversation the colonel received his remarks with great gravity and thought him an instructive personage others considered him rather as amusing than instructive and so his eloquence was generally welcome the canvass for the directorship was talked over the improved affairs of a certain great banking company which shall be nameless but one which f b would take the liberty to state would in his opinion for ever unite the mother country to our great indian possessionsthe prosperity of this great company was enthusiastically drunk by mr bayham in some of the very best claret the conduct of the enemies of that company was characterised in terms of bitter but not undeserved satire f b rather liked to air his oratory and neglected few opportunities for making speeches after dinners  the colonel admired his voice and sentiments not the less perhaps because the latter were highly laudatory of the good man and not from interest at least as far as he himself knewnot from any mean or selfish motives did f b speak he called colonel newcome his friend his benefactor kissed the hem of his garment he wished fervently that he could have been the colonels son he expressed repeatedly a desire that some one would speak ill of the colonel so that he f b might have the opportunity of polishing that individual off in about two seconds he covered the colonel with all his heart nor is any gentleman proof altogether against this constant regard and devotion from another  the colonel used to wag his head wisely and say mr bayhams suggestions were often exceedingly valuable as indeed the fact was though his conduct was no more of a piece with his opinions than those of some other folks occasionally are  what the colonel ought to do sir to help him in the direction says f b is to get into parliament the house of commons would aid him into the court of directors and the court of directors would help him in the house of commons  most wisely said says warrington  the colonel declined i have long had the house of commons in my eye he said but not for me i wanted my boy to go there it would be a proud day for me if i could see him there  i cant speak says clive from his end of the table i dont understand about parties like f b here  i believe i do know a thing or two mr bayham here interposes  and politics do not interest me in the least clive sighs out drawing pictures with his fork on his napkin and not heeding the others interruption  i wish i knew what would interest him his father whispers to me who happened to be at his side he never cares to be out of his paintingroom and he doesnt seem to be very happy even in there i wish to god pen i knew what had come over the boy i thought i knew but what was the use of telling now there was no remedy  a dissolution is expected every day continued f b the papers are full of it ministers cannot go on with this majoritycannot possibly go on sir i have it on the best authority and men who are anxious about their seats are writing to their constituents or are subscribing at missionary meetings or are gone down to lecturing at athenaeums and that sort of thing  here warrington burst out into a laughter much louder than the occasion of the speech of f b seemed to warrant and the colonel turning round with some dignity asked the cause of georges amusement  what do you think your darling sir barnes newcome newcome has been doing during the recess cries warrington i had a letter this morning from my liberal and punctual employer thomas potts esquire of the newcome independent who states in language scarcely respectful that sir barnes newcome newcome is trying to come the religious dodge as mr potts calls it he professes to be stricken down by grief on account of late family circumstances wears black and puts on the most piteous aspect and asks ministers of various denominations to tea with him and the last announcement is the most stupendous of all stop i have it in my greatcoat and ringing the bell george orders a servant to bring him a newspaper from his greatcoat pocket here it is actually in print warrington continues and reads to usnewcome athenaeum 1 for the benefit of the newcome orphan childrens home and 2 for the benefit of the newcome soup association without distinction of denomination sir barnes newcome newcome bart proposes to give two lectures on friday the 23rd and friday the 30th instant no 1 the poetry of childhood doctor watts mrs barbauld jane taylor no 2 the poetry of womanhood and the affections mrs hemans l e l threepence will be charged at the doors which will go to the use of the above two admirable societies potts wants me to go down and hear him he has an eye to business he has had a quarrel with sir barnes and wants me to go down and hear him and smash him he kindly says let us go down clive you shall draw your cousin as you have drawn his villainous little mug a hundred times before and i will do the smashing part and we will have some fun out of the transaction  besides florac will be in the country going to rosebury is a journey worth the taking i can tell you and we have old mrs mason to go and see who sighs after you colonel my wife went to see her remarks mr pendennis and  and miss newcome i know says the colonel  she is away at brighton with her little charges for sea air my wife heard from her today  oh indeed mrs pendennis corresponds with her says our host darkling under his eyebrows and at this moment my neighbour f b is kind enough to scrunch my foot under the table with the weight of his heel as much as to warn me by an appeal to my own corns to avoid treading on so delicate a subject in that house yes said i in spite perhaps in consequence of this interruption my wife does correspond with miss ethel who is a noble creature and whom those who know her know how to love and admire she is very much changed since you knew her colonel newcome since the misfortunes in sir barness family and the differences between you and him very much changed and very much improved ask my wife about her who knows her most intimately and hears from her constantly  very likely very likely cried the colonel hurriedly i hope she is improved with all my heart i am sure there was room for it gentlemen shall we go up to the ladies and have some coffee and herewith the colloquy ended and the party ascended to the drawingroom  the party ascended to the drawingroom where no doubt both the ladies were pleased by the invasion which ended their talk my wife and the colonel talked apart and i saw the latter looking gloomy and the former pleading very eagerly and using a great deal of action as the little hands are wont to do when the mistresss heart is very much moved i was sure she was pleading ethels cause with her uncle  so indeed she was and mr george too knew what her thoughts were look at her he said to me dont you see what she is doing she believes in that girl whom you all said clive took a fancy to before he married his present little placid wife a nice little simple creature who is worth a dozen ethels  simple certainly says mr p with a shrug of the shoulders  a simpleton of twenty is better than a roue of twenty it is better not to have thought at all than to have thought such things as must go through a girls mind whose life is passed in jilting and being jilted whose eyes as soon as they are opened are turned to the main chance and are taught to leer at earl to languish at a marquis and to grow blind before a commoner i dont know much about fashionable life heaven help us you young brummell i see the reproach in your face why sir it absolutely appears to me as if this little hopomythumb of a creature has begun to give herself airs since her marriage and her carriage do you know i rather thought she patronised me are all women spoiled by their contact with the world and their bloom rubbed off in the market i know one who seems to me to remain pure to be sure i only know her and this little person and mrs flanagan our laundress and my sisters at home who dont count but that miss newcome to whom once you introduced me oh the cockatrice only that poison dont affect your wife the other would kill her i hope the colonel will not believe a word which laura says and my wifes teteatete with our host coming to an end about this time mr warrington in high spirits goes up to the ladies recapitulates the news of barness lecture recites how doth the little busy bee and gives a quasisatirical comment upon that wellknown poem which bewilders mrs clive until set on by the laughter of the rest of the audience she laughs very freely at that odd man and calls him you droll satirical creature you and says she never was so much amused in her life were you mrs pendennis  meanwhile clive who has been sitting apart moodily biting his nails not listening to f bs remarks has broken into a laugh once or twice and gone to a writingbook on which whilst george is still disserting clive is drawing  at the end of the others speech f b goes up to the draughtsman looks over his shoulder makes one or two violent efforts as of inward convulsion and finally explodes in an enormous guffaw its capital by jove its capital sir barnes would never dare to face his constituents with that picture of him hung up in newcome  and f b holds up the drawing at which we all laugh except laura as for the colonel he paces up and down the room holding the sketch close to his eyes holding it away from him patting it clapping his son delightedly on the shoulder capital capital well have the picture printed by jove sir show vice its own image and shame the viper in his own nest sir thats what we will  mrs pendennis came away with rather a heavy heart from this party she chose to interest herself about the right or wrong of her friends and her mind was disturbed by the colonels vindictive spirit on the subsequent day we had occasion to visit our friend j j who was completing the sweetest little picture no 263 in the exhibition portrait of a lady and child and we found that clive had been with the painter that morning likewise and that j j was acquainted with his scheme that he did not approve of it we could read in the artists grave countenance nor does clive approve of it either cried ridley with greater eagerness than he usually displayed and more openness than he was accustomed to exhibit in judging unfavourably of his friends  among them they have taken him away from his art ridley said they dont understand him when he talks about it they despise him for pursuing it why should i wonder at that my parents despised it too and my father was not a grand gentleman like the colonel mrs pendennis ah why did the colonel ever grow rich why had not clive to work for his bread as have he would have done something that was worthy of him then now his time must be spent in dancing attendance at balls land operas and yawning at city boardrooms they call that business they think he is idling when he comes here poor fellow as if life was long enough for our art and the best labour we can give good enough for it he went away groaning this morning and quite saddened in spirits the colonel wants to set up himself for parliament or to set clive up but he says he wont i hope he wont do not you mrs pendennis  the painter turned as he spoke and the bright northern light which fell upon the sitters head was intercepted and lighted up his own as he addressed us out of that bright light looked his pale thoughtful face and long locks and eager brown eyes the palette on his arm was a great shield painted of many colours he carried his mallstick and a sheaf of brushes along with the weapons of his glorious but harmless war with these he achieves conquests wherein none are wounded save the envious with that he shelters him against how much idleness ambition temptations occupied over that consoling work idle thoughts cannot gain mastery over him selfish wishes or desires are kept at bay art is truth and truth is religion and its study and practice a daily work of pious duty what are the worlds struggles brawls successes to that calm recluse pursuing his calling see twinkling in the darkness round his chamber numberless beautiful trophies of the graceful victories which he has wonsweet flowers of fancy reared by himkind shapes of beauty which he has devised and moulded the world enters into the artists studio and scornfully bids him a price for his genius or makes dull pretence to admire it what know you of his art you cannot read the alphabet of that sacred book good old thomas newcome what can you tell of its glories joys secrets consolations between his two bestbeloved mistresses poor clives luckless father somehow interposes and with sorrowful even angry protests in place of art the colonel brings him a ledger and in lieu of first love shows him rosey  no wonder that clive hangs his head rebels sometimes desponds always he has positively determined to refuse to stand for newcome ridley says laura is glad of his refusal and begins to think of him once more as of the clive of old days     chapter lxvi in which the colonel and the newcome athenaeum are both lectured   at breakfast with his family on the morning after the little entertainment to which we were bidden in the last chapter colonel newcome was full of the projected invasion of barness territories and delighted to think that there was an opportunity of at last humiliating that rascal  clive does not think he is a rascal at all papa cries rosey from behind her teaurn that is you said you thought papa judged him too harshly you know you did this morning and from her husbands angry glances she flies to his fathers for protection those were even fiercer than clives revenge flashed from beneath thomas newcomes grizzled eyebrows and glanced in the direction where clive sat then the colonels face flushed up and he cast his eyes down towards his teacup which he lifted with a trembling hand the father and son loved each other so that each was afraid of the other a war between two such men is dreadful pretty little pinkfaced rosey in a sweet little morning cap and ribbons her pretty little fingers twinkling with a score of rings sat simpering before her silver teaurn which reflected her pretty little pink baby face little artless creature what did she know of the dreadful wounds which her little words inflicted in the one generous breast and the other  my boys heart is gone from me thinks poor thomas newcome our family is insulted our enterprises ruined by that traitor and my son is not even angry he does not care for the success of our plansfor the honour of our name even i make him a position of which any young man in england might be proud and clive scarcely deigns to accept it  my wife appeals to my father thinks poor clive it is from him she asks counsel and not from me be it about the ribbon in her cap or any other transaction in our lives she takes her colour from his opinion and goes to him for advice and i have to wait till it is given and conform myself to it if i differ from the dear old father i wound him if i yield up my opinion as i do always it is with a bad grace and i wound him still with the best intentions in the world what a slaves life it is that he has made for me  how interested you are in your papers resumes the sprightly nosey what can you find in those horrid politics both gentlemen are looking at their papers with all their might and no doubt cannot see one single word which those brilliant and witty leading articles contain  clive is like you rosey says the colonel laying his paper down and does not care for politics  he only cares for pictures papa says mrs clive he would not drive with me yesterday in the park but spent hours in his room while you were toiling in the city poor papaspent hours painting a horrid beggarman dressed up as a monk and this morning he got up quite early quite early and has been out ever so long and only came in for breakfast just now just before the bell rung  i like a ride before breakfast says clive  a ride i know where you have been sir he goes away morning after morning to that little mr ridleyshis chums papa and he comes back with his hands all over horrid paint he did this morning you know you did clive  i did not keep any one waiting rosa says clive i like to have two or three hours at my painting when i can spare time indeed the poor fellow used so to run away of summer meetings for ridleys instructions and gallop home again so as to be in time for the family meal  yes cries rosey tossing up the cap and ribbons he gets up so early in the morning that at night he falls asleep after dinner very pleasant and polite isnt he papa  i am up betimes too my dear says the colonel many and many a time he must have heard clive as he left the house i have a great many letters to write affairs of the greatest importance to examine and conduct mr betts from the city is often with me for hours before i come down to your breakfasttable a man who has the affairs of such a great bank as ours to look to must be up with the lark we are all early risers in india  you dear kind papa says little rosey with unfeigned admiration and she puts out one of the plump white little jewelled hands and pats the lean brown paw of the colonel which is nearest to her  is ridleys picture getting on well clive asks the colonel trying to interest himself about ridley and his picture  very well it is beautiful he has sold it for a great price they must make him an academician next year replies clive  a most industrious and meritorious young man he deserves every honour that may happen to him says the old soldier rosa my dear it is time that you should ask mr ridley to dinner and mr smee and some of those gentlemen we will drive this afternoon and see your portrait  clive does not go to sleep after dinner when mr ridley comes here cries rosa  no i think it is my turn then says the colonel with a glance of kindness the anger has disappeared from under his brows at that moment the menaced battle is postponed  and yet i know that it must come says poor clive telling me the story as he hangs on my arm and we pace through the park the colonel and i are walking on a mine and that poor little wife of mine is perpetually flinging little shells to fire it i sometimes wish it were blown up and i were done for pen i dont think my widow would break her heart about me no i have no right to say that its a shame to say that she tries her very best to please me poor little dear its the fault of my temper perhaps that she cant but they neither understand me dont you see the colonel cant help thinking i am a degraded being because i am fond of painting still dear old boy he patronises ridley a man of genius whom those sentries ought to salute by jove sir when he passes ridley patronised by an old officer of indian dragoons a little bit of a rosey and a fellow who is not fit to lay his palette for him i want sometimes to ask j js pardon after the colonel has been talking to him in his confounded condescending way uttering some awful bosh about the fine arts rosey follows him and trips round j js studio and pretends to admire and says how soft how sweet recalling some of mammainlaws dreadful expressions which make me shudder when i hear them if my poor old father had a confidant into whose arm he could hook his own and whom he could pester with his family griefs as i do you the dear old boy would have his dreary story to tell too i hate banks bankers bundelcund indigo cotton and the whole business i go to that confounded board and never hear one syllable that the fellows are talking about i sit there because he wishes me to sit there dont you think he sees that my heart is out of the business that i would rather be at home in my paintingroom we dont understand each other but we feel each other as it were by instinct each thinks in his own way but knows what the other is thinking we fight mute battles dont you see and our thoughts though we dont express them are perceptible to one another and come out from our eyes or pass out from us somehow and meet and fight and strike and wound  of course clives confidant saw how sore and unhappy the poor fellow was and commiserated his fatal but natural condition the little ills of life are the hardest to bear as we all very well know what would the possession of a hundred thousand a year or fame and the applause of ones countrymen or the loveliest and bestbeloved womanof any glory and happiness or goodfortune avail to a gentleman for instance who was allowed to enjoy them only with the condition of wearing a shoe with a couple of nails or sharp pebbles inside it all fame and happiness would disappear and plunge down that shoe all life would rankle round those little nails i strove by such philosophic sedatives as confidants are wont to apply on these occasions to soothe my poor friends anger and pain and i dare say the little nails hurt the patient just as much as before  clive pursued his lugubrious talk through the park and continued it as far as the modestfurnished house which we then occupied in the pimlico region it so happened that the colonel and mrs clive also called upon us that day and found this culprit in lauras drawingroom when they entered it descending out of that splendid barouche in which we have already shown mrs clive to the public  he has not been here for months before nor have you rosa nor have you colonel though we have smothered our indignation and been to dine with you and to call ever so many times cries laura  the colonel pleaded his business engagements rosa that little woman of the world had a thousand calls to make and who knows how much to do since she came out she had been to fetch papa at bayss and the porter had told the colonel that mr clive and mr pendennis had just left the club together  clive scarcely ever drives with me says rosa papa almost always does  roseys is such a swell carriage that i feel ashamed says clive  i dont understand you young men i dont see why you need be ashamed to go on the course with your wife in her carriage clive remarks the colonel  the course the course is at calcutta papa cries rosey we drive in the park  we have a park at barrackpore too my dear says papa  and he calls his grooms saices he said he was going to send away a saice for being tipsy and i did not know in the least what he could mean laura  mr newcome you must go and drive on the course with rosa now and the colonel must sit and talk with me whom he has not been to see for such a long time clive presently went off in state by roseys side and then laura showed colonel newcome his beautiful white cashmere shawl round a successor of that little person who had first been wrapped in that web now a stout young gentleman whose noise could be clearly heard in the upper regions  i wish you could come down with us arthur upon our electioneering visit  that of which you were talking last night are you bent upon it  yes i am determined on it  laura heard a childs cry at this moment and left the room with a parting glance at her husband who in fact had talked over the matter with mrs pendennis and agreed with her in opinion  as the colonel had opened the question i ventured to make a respectful remonstrance against the scheme vindictiveness on the part of a man so simple and generous so fair and noble in all his dealings as thomas newcome appeared in my mind unworthy of him surely his kinsman had sorrow and humiliation enough already at home barness further punishment we thought might be left to time to remorse to the judge of right and wrong who better understands than we can do our causes and temptations towards evil actions who reserves the sentence for his own tribunal but when angered the best of us mistake our own motives as we do those of the enemy who inflames us what may be private revenge we take to be indignant virtue and just revolt against wrong the colonel would not hear of counsels of moderation such as i bore him from a sweet christian pleader remorse he cried out with a laugh that villain will never feel it until he is tied up and whipped at the carts tail time change that rogue unless he is wholesomely punished he will grow a greater scoundrel every year i am inclined to think sir says he his honest brows darkling as he looked towards me that you too are spoiled by this wicked world and these heartless fashionable fine people you wish to live well with the enemy and with us too pendennis it cant be he who is not with us is against us i very much fear sir that the women the women you understand have been talking you over do not let us speak any more about this subject for i dont wish that my son and my sons old friend should have a quarrel his face became red his voice quivered with agitation and he looked with glances which i was pained to behold in those kind old eyes not because his wrath and suspicion visited myself but because an impartial witness nay a friend to thomas newcome in that family quarrel i grieved to think that a generous heart was led astray and to see a good man do wrong so with no more thanks for his interference than a man usually gets who meddles in domestic strifes the present luckless advocate ceased pleading  to be sure the colonel and clive had other advisers who did not take the peaceful side george warrington was one of these he was for war a loutrance with barnes newcome for keeping no terms with such a villain he found a pleasure in hunting him and whipping him barnes ought to be punished george said for his poor wifes misfortune it was barness infernal cruelty wickedness selfishness which had driven her into misery and wrong mr warrington went down to newcome and was present at that lecture whereof mention has been made in a previous chapter i am afraid his behaviour was very indecorous he laughed at the pathetic allusions of the respected member for newcome he sneered at the sublime passages he wrote an awful critique in the newcome independent two days after whereof the irony was so subtle that half the readers of the paper mistook his grave scorn for respect and his gibes for praise  clive his father and frederick bayham their faithful aidedecamp were at newcome likewise when sir barness oration was delivered at first it was given out at newcome that the colonel visited the place for the purpose of seeing his dear old friend and pensioner mrs mason who was now not long to enjoy his bounty and so old as scarcely to know her benefactor only after her sleep or when the sun warmed her and the old wine with which he supplied her was the good old woman able to recognise her colonel she mingled father and son together in her mind a lady who now often came in to her thought she was wandering in her talk when the poor old woman spoke of a visit she had had from her boy and then the attendant told miss newcome that such a visit had actually taken place and that but yesterday clive and his father had been in that room and occupied the chair where she sat the young lady was taken quite ill and seemed ready to faint almost mrs masons servant and spokeswoman told colonel newcome when that gentleman arrived shortly after ethels departure to see his old nurse indeed he was very sorry the maid told many stories about miss newcomes goodness and charity how she was constantly visiting the poor now how she was for ever engaged in good works for the young the sick and the aged she had had a dreadful misfortune in love she was going to be married to a young marquis richer even than prince de moncontour down at rosebury but it was all broke off on account of that dreadful affair at the hall  was she very good to the poor did she come often to see her grandfathers old friend it was no more than she ought to do colonel newcome said without however thinking fit to tell his informant that he had himself met his niece ethel five minutes before he had entered mrs masons door  the poor thing was in discourse with mr harris the surgeon and talking as best she might for no doubt the news which she had just heard had agitated her talking about blankets and arrowroot wine and medicaments for her poor when she saw her uncle coming towards her she tottered a step or two forwards to meet him held both her hands out and called his name but he looked her sternly in the face took off his hat and bowed and passed on he did not think fit to mention the meeting even to his son clive but we may be sure mr harris the surgeon spoke of the circumstance that night after the lecture at the club where a crowd of gentlemen were gathered together smoking their cigars and enjoying themselves according to their custom and discussing sir barnes newcomes performance  according to established usage in such cases our esteemed representative was received by the committee of the newcome athenaeum assembled in their committeeroom and thence marshalled by the chairman and vicechairman to his rostrum in the lecturehall round about which the magnates of the institution and the notabilities of the town were rallied on this public occasion the baronet came in some state from his own house arriving at newcome in his carriage with four horses accompanied by my lady his mother and miss ethel his beautiful sister who now was mistress at the hall his little girl was broughtfive years old now she sate on her aunts knee and slept during a greater part of the performance a fine bustle we may be sure was made on the introduction of these personages to their reserved seats on the platform where they sate encompassed by others of the great ladies of newcome to whom they and the lecturer were especially gracious at this season was not parliament about to be dissolved and were not the folks at newcome park particularly civil at that interesting period so barnes newcome mounts his pulpit bows round to the crowded assembly in acknowledgment of their buzz of applause or recognition passes his lilywhite pockethandkerchief across his thin lips and dashes off into his lecture about mrs hemans and the poetry of the affections a public man a commercial man as we well know yet his heart is in his home and his joy in his affections the presence of this immense assembly here this evening of the industrious capitalists of the intelligent middle class of the pride and mainstay of england the operatives of newcome these surrounded by their wives and their children a graceful bow to the bonnets to the right of the platform show that they too have hearts to feel and homes to cherish that they too feel the love of women the innocence of children the love of song our lecturer then makes a distinction between mans poetry and womans poetry charging considerably in favour of the latter we show that to appeal to the affections is after all the true office of the bard to decorate the homely threshold to wreathe flowers round the domestic hearth the delightful duty of the christian singer we glance at mrs hemanss biography and state where she was born and under what circumstances she must have at first etc etc is this a correct account of sir barnes newcomes lecture i was not present and did not read the report very likely the above may be a reminiscence of that mock lecture which warrington delivered in anticipation of the baronets oration  after he had read for about five minutes it was remarked the baronet suddenly stopped and became exceedingly confused over his manuscript betaking himself to his auxiliary glass of water before he resumed his discourse which for a long time was languid low and disturbed in tone this period of disturbance no doubt must have occurred when sir barnes saw before him f bayham and warrington seated in the amphitheatre and by the side of those fierce scornful countenances clive newcomes pale face  clive newcome was not looking at barnes his eyes were fixed upon the lady seated not far from the lecturerupon ethel with her arm round her little nieces shoulder and her thick black ringlets drooping down over a face paler than clives own  of course she knew that clive was present she was aware of him as she entered the hall saw him at the very first moment saw nothing but him i dare say though her eyes were shut and her head was turned now towards her mother and now bent down on the little nieces golden curls and the past and its dear histories and youth and its hopes and passions and tones and looks for ever echoing in the heart and present in the memorythese no doubt poor clive saw and heard as he looked across the great gulf of time and parting and grief and beheld the woman he had loved for many years there she sits the same but changed as gone from him as if she were dead departed indeed into another sphere and entered into a kind of death if there is no love more in yonder heart it is but a corpse unburied strew round it the flowers of youth wash it with tears of passion wrap it and envelop it with fond devotion break heart and fling yourself on the bier and kiss her cold lips and press her hand it falls back dead on the cold breast again the beautiful lips have never a blush or a smile cover them and lay them in the ground and so take thy hatband off good friend and go to thy business do you suppose you are the only man who has had to attend such a funeral you will find some men smiling and at work the day after some come to the grave now and again out of the world and say a brief prayer and a god bless her with some men she gone and her viduous mansion your heart to let her successor the new occupant poking in all the drawers and corners and cupboards of the tenement finds her miniature and some of her dusty old letters hidden away somewhere and sayswas this the face he admired so why allowing even for the painters flattery it is quite ordinary and the eyes certainly do not look straight are these the letters you thought so charming well upon my word i never read anything more commonplace in my life see heres a line half blotted out oh i suppose she was crying thensome of her tears idle tearshark there is barnes newcomes eloquence still plapping on like water from a cisternand our thoughts where have they wandered far away from the lectureas far away as clives almost and now the fountain ceases to trickle the mouth from which issued that cool and limpid flux ceases to smile the figure is seen to bow and retire a buzz a hum a whisper a scuffle a meeting of bonnets and wagging of feathers and rustling of silks ensues thank you delightful i am sure i really was quite overcome excellent so much obliged are rapid phrases heard amongst the polite on the platform while down below yaw quite enough of that mary jane cover your throat up and dont kitch cold and dont push me please sir arry coom along and ave a pint a ale etc are the remarks heard or perhaps not heard by clive newcome as he watches at the private entrance of the athenaeum where sir barness carriage is waiting with its flaming lamps and domestics in state liveries one of them comes out of the building bearing the little girl in his arms and lays her in the carriage then sir barnes and lady anne and the mayor then ethel issues forth and as she passes under the lamps beholds clives face as pale and sad as her own  shall we go visit the lodgegates of newcome park the moon shining on their carving is there any pleasure in walking by miles of grey paling and endless palisades of firs oh you fool what do you hope to see behind that curtain absurd fugitive whither would you run can you burst the tether of fate and is not poor dear little rosey mackenzie sitting yonder waiting for you by the stake go home sir and dont catch cold so mr clive returns to the kings arms and goes up to his bedroom and he hears mr f bayhams deep voice as he passes by the boscawen room where the jolly britons are as usual assembled     chapter lxvii newcome and liberty   we have said that the baronets lecture was discussed in the midnight senate assembled at the kings arms where mr tom potts showed the orator no mercy the senate of the kings arms was hostile to sir barnes newcome many other newcomites besides were savage and inclined to revolt against the representative of their borough as these patriots met over their cups and over the bumper of friendship uttered the sentiments of freedom they had often asked of one another where should a man be found to rid newcome of its dictator generous hearts writhed under the oppression patriotic eyes scowled when barnes newcome went by with fine satire tom potts at brown the hatters shop who made the hats for sir barnes newcomes domestics proposed to take one of the beaversa goldlaced one with a cockade and a cordand set it up in the marketplace and bid all newcome come bow to it as to the hat of gessler dont you think potts says f bayham who of course was admitted into the kings arms club and ornamented that assembly by his presence and discourse dont you think the colonel would make a good william tell to combat against that gessler ha proposal received with acclamationeagerly adopted by charles tucker esq attorneyatlaw who would not have the slightest objection to conduct colonel newcomes or any other gentlemans electioneering business in newcome or elsewhere  like those three gentlemen in the plays and pictures of william tell who conspire under the moon calling upon liberty and resolving to elect tell as their especial championlike arnold melchthal and wernertom potts fred bayham and charles tucker esqs conspired round a punchbowl and determined that thomas newcome should be requested to free his country a deputation from the electors of newcome that is to say these very gentlemen waited on the colonel in his apartment the very next morning and set before him the state of the borough barnes newcomes tyranny under which it groaned and the yearning of all honest men to be free from that usurpation thomas newcome received the deputation with great solemnity and politeness crossed his legs folded his arms smoked his cheroot and listened moat decorously as now potts now tucker expounded to him bayham giving the benefit of his emphatic hear hear to their statements and explaining dubious phrases to the colonel in the most affable manner  whatever the conspirators had to say against barnes colonel newcome was only too ready to believe he had made up his mind that that criminal ought to be punished and exposed the lawyers covert innuendoes who was ready to insinuate any amount of evil against barnes which could safely be uttered were by no means strong enough for thomas newcome sharp practice exceedingly alive to his own interestsreported violence of temper and tenacity of moneysay swindling at once sirsay falsehood and rapacitysay cruelty and avarice cries the colonel i believe upon my honour and conscience that unfortunate young man to be guilty of every one of those crimes  mr bayham remarks to mr potts that our friend the colonel when he does utter an opinion takes care that there shall be no mistake about it  and i took care there should be no mistake before i uttered it at all bayham cries f bs patron as long as i was in any doubt about this young man i gave the criminal the benefit of it as a man who admires our glorious constitution should do and kept my own counsel sir  at least remarks mr tucker enough is proven to show that sir barnes newcome newcome baronet is scarce a fit person to represent this great borough in parliament  represent newcome in parliament it is a disgrace to that noble institution the english house of commons that barnes newcome should sit in it a man whose word you cannot trust a man stained with every private crime what right has he to sit in the assembly of the legislators of the land sir cries the colonel waving his hand as if addressing a chamber of deputies  you are for upholding the house of commons inquires the lawyer  of course sir of course  and for increasing the franchise colonel newcome i should hope continues mr tucker  every man who can read and write ought to have a vote sir that is my opinion cries the colonel  hes a liberal to the backbone says potts to tucker  to the backbone responds tucker to potts the colonel will do for us potts  we want such a man tucker the independent has been crying out for such a man for years past we ought to have a liberal as second representative of this great townnot a sneaking halfandhalf ministerialist like sir barnes a fellow with one leg in the carlton and the other in brookess old mr bunce we cant touch his place is safe he is a good man of business we cant meddle with mr buncei know that who know the feeling of the country pretty well  pretty well better than any man in newcome potts cries mr tucker  but a good man like the colonela good liberal like the colonela man who goes in for household suffrage  certainly gentlemen  and the general great liberal principleswe know of coursesuch a man would assuredly have a chance against sir barnes newcome at the coming election could we find such a man a real friend of the people  i know a friend of the people if ever there was one f bayham interposes  a man of wealth station experience a man who has fought for his country a man who is beloved in this place as you are colonel newcome for your goodness is known siryou are not ashamed of your origin and there is not a newcomite old or young but knows how admirably good you have been to your old friend mrsmrs whatdyoucallem  mrs mason from f b  mrs mason if such a man as you sir would consent to put himself in nomination at the next election every true liberal in this place would rush to support you and crush the oligarchy who rides over the liberties of this borough  something of this sort gentlemen i own to you had crossed my mind thomas newcome remarked when i saw that disgrace to my name and the name of my fathers birthplace representing the borough in parliament i thought for the credit of the town and the family the member for newcome at least might be an honest man i am an old soldier have passed all my life in india and am little conversant with affairs at home cries of you are you are i hoped that my son mr clive newcome might have been found qualified to contest this borough against his unworthy cousin and possibly to sit as your representative in parliament the wealth i have had the good fortune to amass will descend to him naturally and at no very distant period of time for i am nearly seventy years of age gentlemen  the gentlemen are astonished at this statement  but resumed the colonel my son clive as my friend bayham knows and to my own regret and mortification as i dont care to confess to you declares he has no interest or desire in politics or for public distinctionprefers his own pursuitsand even these i fear do not absorb himdeclines the offer which i made him to present himself in opposition to sir barnes newcome it becomes men in a certain station as i think to assert that station and though a few years back i never should have thought of public life at all and proposed to end my days in quiet as a retired dragoon officer sincesince it has pleased heaven to increase very greatly my pecuniary means to place me as a director and manager of an important banking company in a station of great public responsibility i and my brotherdirectors have thought it but right that one of us should sit in parliament if possible and i am not a man to shirk from that or from any other duty  colonel will you attend a meeting of electors which we will call and say as much to them and as well cries mr potts shall i put an announcement in my paper to the effect that you are ready to come forward  i am prepared to do so my good sir  and presently this solemn palaver ended  besides the critical article upon the baronets lecture of which mr warrington was the author there appeared in the leading columns of the ensuing number of mr potts independent some remarks of a very smashing or hostile nature against the member for newcome this gentleman has shown such talent in the lecturing business the independent said that it is a great pity he should not withdraw himself from politics and cultivate what all newcome knows are the arts which he understands best namely poetry and the domestic affections the performance of our talented representative last night was so pathetic as to bring tears into the eyes of several of our fair friends we have heard but never believed until now that sir barnes newcome possessed such a genius for making women cry last week we had the talented miss noakes from slowcome reading milton to us how far superior was the eloquence of sir barnes newcome newcome bart even to that of the celebrated jestress bets were freely offered in the room last night that sir barnes would beat any womanbets which were not taken as we scarcely need say so well do our citizens appreciate the character of our excellent our admirable representativelet the baronet stick to his lectures and let newcome relieve him of his political occupations he is not fit for them he is too sentimental a man for us the men of newcome want a sound practical person the liberals of newcome have a desire to be represented when we elected sir barnes he talked liberally enough and we thought he would do but you see the honourable baronet is so poetical we ought to have known that and not to have believed him let us have a straightforward gentleman if not a man of words at least let us have a practical man if not a man of eloquence one at any rate whose word we can trust and we cant trust sir barnes newcomes we have tried him and we cant really last night when the ladies were crying we could not for the souls of us help laughing we hope we know how to conduct ourselves as gentlemen we trust we did not interrupt the harmony of the evening but sir barnes newcome prating about children and virtue and affection and poetry this is really too strong  the independent faithful to its name and ever actuated by principles of honour has been as our thousands of readers know disposed to give sir barnes newcome newcome bart a fair trial when he came forward after his fathers death we believed in his pledges and promises as a retrencher and reformer and we stuck by him is there any man in newcome except perhaps our twaddling old contemporary the sentinel who believes in sir b n any more we say no and we now give the readers of the independent and the electors of this borough fair notice that when the dissolution of parliament takes place a good man a true man a man of experience no dangerous radical or brawling tap oratormr hickss friends well understand whom we meanbut a gentleman of liberal principles wellwon wealth and deserved station and honour will ask the electors of newcome whether they are or are not discontented with their present unworthy member the independent for one says we know good men of your family we know in it men who would do honour to any name but you sir barnes newcome newcome bart we trust no more  in the electioneering matter which had occasioned my unlucky interference and that subsequent little coolness upon the good colonels part clive newcome had himself shown that the scheme was not to his liking had then submitted as his custom was and doing so with a bad grace as also was to be expected had got little thanks for his obedience thomas newcome was hurt at his sons faintheartedness and of course little rosey was displeased at his hanging back he set off in his fathers train a silent unwilling partisan thomas newcome had the leisure to survey clives glum face opposite to him during the whole of their journey and to chew his mustachios and brood upon his wrath and wrongs his life had been a sacrifice for that boy what darling schemes had he not formed in his behalf and how superciliously did clive meet his projects the colonel could not see the harm of which he had himself been the author had he not done everything in mortals power for his sons happiness and how many young men in england were there with such advantages as this moody discontented spoiled boy as clive backed out of the contest of course his father urged it only the more vehemently clive slunk away from committees and canvassing and lounged about the newcome manufactories whilst his father with anger and bitterness in his heart remained at the post of honour as he called it bent upon overcoming his enemy and carrying his point against barnes newcome if paris will not fight sir the colonel said with a sad look following his son priam must good old priam believed his cause to be a perfectly just one and that duty and his honour called upon him to draw the sword so there was difference between thomas newcome and clive his son i protest it is with pain and reluctance i have to write that the good old man was in errorthat there was a wrongdoer and that atticus was he  atticus be it remembered thought himself compelled by the very best motives thomas newcome the indian banker was at war with barnes the english banker the latter had commenced the hostilities by a sudden and cowardly act of treason there were private wrongs to envenom the contest but it was the mercantile quarrel on which the colonel chose to set his declaration of war barness first dastardly blow had occasioned it and his uncle was determined to carry it through this i have said was also george warringtons judgment who in the ensuing struggle between sir barnes and his uncle acted as a very warm and efficient partisan of the latter kinsmanship says george what has old tom newcome ever had from his kinsman but cowardice and treachery if barnes had held up his finger the young one might have been happy if he could have effected it the colonel and his bank would have been ruined i am for war and for seeing the old boy in parliament he knows no more about politics than i do about dancing the polka but there are five hundred wiseacres in that assembly who know no more than he does and an honest man taking his seat there in place of a confounded little rogue at least makes a change for the better  i dare say thomas newcome esq would by no means have concurred in the above estimate of his political knowledge and thought himself as well informed as another he used to speak with the greatest gravity about our constitution as the pride and envy of the world though he surprised you as much by the latitudinarian reforms which he was eager to press forward as by the most singular old tory opinions which he advocated on other occasions he was for having every man to vote every poor man to labour short time and get high wages every poor curate to be paid double or treble every bishop to be docked of his salary and dismissed from the house of lords but he was a staunch admirer of that assembly and a supporter of the rights of the crown he was for sweeping off taxes from the poor and as money must be raised to carry on government he opined that the rich should pay he uttered all these opinions with the greatest gravity and emphasis before a large assembly of electors and others convened in the newcome town hall amid the roars of applause of the nonelectors and the bewilderment and consternation of mr potts of the independent who had represented the colonel in his paper as a safe and steady reformer of course the sentinel showed him up as a most dangerous radical a sepoy republican and so forth to the wrath and indignation of colonel newcome he a republican he scorned the name he would die as he had bled many a time for his sovereign he an enemy of our beloved church he esteemed and honoured it as he hated and abhorred the superstitions of rome yells from the irish in the crowd he an enemy of the house of lords he held it to be the safeguard of the constitution and the legitimate prize of our most illustrious naval military andandlegal heroes ironical cheers he repelled with scorn the dastard attacks of the journal which had assailed him he asked laying his hands on his heart if as a gentleman an officer bearing her majestys commission he could be guilty of a desire to subvert her empire and to insult the dignity of her crown  after this second speech at the town hall it was asserted by a considerable party in newcome that old tom as the mob familiarly called him was a tory while an equal number averred that he was a radical mr potts tried to reconcile his statements a work in which i should think the talented editor of the independent had no little difficulty he knows nothing about it poor clive said with a sigh his politics are all sentiment and kindness he will have the poor man paid double wages and does not remember that the employer would be ruined you have heard him pen talking in this way at his own table but when he comes out armed capapied and careers against windmills in public dont you see that as don quixotes son i had rather the dear brave old gentleman was at home  so this faineant took but little part in the electioneering doings holding moodily aloof from the meetings and councils and publichouses where his fathers partisans were assembled     chapter lxviii a letter and a reconciliation   miss ethel newcome to mrs pendennis  dearest laurai have not written to you for many weeks past there have been some things too trivial and some too sad to write about some things i know i shall write of if i begin and yet that i know i had best leave for of what good is looking to the past now why vex you or myself by reverting to it does not every day bring its own duty and task and are these not enough to occupy one what a fright you must have had with my little goddaughter thank heaven she is well now and restored to you you and your husband i know do not think it essential but i do most essential and am very grateful that she was taken to church before her illness  is mr pendennis proceeding with his canvass i try and avoid a certain subject but it will come you know who is canvassing against us here my poor uncle has met with very considerable success amongst the lower classes he makes them rambling speeches at which my brother and his friends laugh but which the people applaud i saw him only yesterday on the balcony of the kings arms speaking to a great mob who were cheering vociferously below i had met him before he would not even stop and give his ethel of old days his hand i would have given him i dont know what for one kiss for one kind word but he passed on and would not answer me he thinks mewhat the world thinks me worldly and heartless what i was but at least dear laura you know that i always truly loved him and do now although he is our enemy though he believes and utters the most cruel things against barnes though he says that barnes newcome my fathers son my brother laura is not an honest man hard selfish worldly i own my poor brother to be and pray heaven to amend him but dishonest and to be so maligned by the person one loves best in the world this is a hard trial i pray a proud heart may be bettered by it  and i have seen my cousin once at a lecture which poor barnes gave and who seemed very much disturbed on perceiving clive once afterwards at good old mrs masons whom i have always continued to visit for uncles sake the poor old woman whose wits are very nearly gone held both our hands and asked when we were going to be married and laughed poor old thing i cried out to her that mr clive had a wife at home a young dear wife i said he gave a dreadful sort of laugh and turned away into the window he looks terribly ill pale and oldened  i asked him a great deal about his wife whom i remember a very pretty sweetlooking girl indeed at my aunt hobsons but with a not agreeable mother as i thought then he answered me by monosyllables appeared as though he would speak and then became silent i am pained and yet glad that i saw him i said not very distinctly i dare say that i hoped the difference between barnes and uncle would not extinguish his regard for mamma and me who have always loved him when i said loved him he give one of his bitter laughs again and so he did when i said i hoped his wife was well you never would tell me much about mrs newcome and i fear she does not make my cousin happy and yet this marriage was of my uncles making another of the unfortunate marriages in our family i am glad that i paused in time before the commission of that sin i strive my best and to amend my temper my inexperience my shortcomings and try to be the mother of my poor brothers children but barnes has never forgiven me my refusal of lord farintosh he is of the world still laura nor must we deal too harshly with people of his nature who cannot perhaps comprehend a world beyond i remember in old days when we were travelling on the rhine in the happiest days of my whole life i used to hear clive and his friend mr ridley talk of art and of nature in a way that i could not understand at first but came to comprehend better as my cousin taught me and since then i see pictures landscapes and flowers with quite different eyes and beautiful secrets as it were of which i had no idea before the secret of all secrets the secret of the other life and the better world beyond ours may not this be unrevealed to some i pray for them all dearest laura for those nearest and dearest to me that the truth may lighten their darkness and heavens great mercy defend them in the perils and dangers of their night  my boy at sandhurst has done very well indeed and egbert i am happy to say thinks of taking orders he has been very moderate at college not so alfred but the guards are a sadly dangerous school for a young man i have promised to pay his debts and he is to exchange into the line mamma is coming to us at christmas with alice my sister is very pretty indeed i think and i am rejoiced she is to marry young mr mumford who has a tolerable living and who has been attached to her ever since he was a boy at rugby school  little barnes comes on bravely with his latin and mr whitestock a most excellent and valuable person in this place where there is so much romanism and dissent speaks highly of him little clara is so like her unhappy mother in a thousand ways and actions that i am shocked often and see my brother starting back and turning his head away as if suddenly wounded i have heard the most deplorable accounts of lord and lady highgate oh dearest friend and sistersave you i think i scarce know any one that is happy in the world i trust you may continue soyou who impart your goodness and kindness to all who come near youyou in whose sweet serene happiness i am thankful to be allowed to repose sometimes you are the island in the desert laura and the birds sing there and the fountain flows and we come and repose by you for a little while and tomorrow the march begins again and the toil and the struggle and the desert goodbye fountain whisper kisses to my dearest little ones from their affectionate aunt ethel  a friend of his a mr warrington has spoken against us several times with extraordinary ability as barnes owns do you know mr w he wrote a dreadful article in the independent about the last poor lecture which was indeed sad sentimental commonplace and the critique is terribly comical i could not help laughing remembering some passages in it when barnes mentioned it and my brother became so angry they have put up a dreadful caricature of b in newcome and my brother says he did it but i hope not it is very droll though he used to make them very funnily i am glad he has spirits for it goodbye againe n   he says he did it cries mr pendennis laying the letter down barnes newcome would scarcely caricature himself my dear  he often meansmeans clivei think says mrs pendennis in an offhand manner  oh he means clive does he laura  yesand you mean goose mr pendennis that saucy lady replies  it must have been about the very time when this letter was written that a critical conversation occurred between clive and his father of which the lad did not inform me until much later days as was the casethe reader has been more than once begged to believewith many other portions of this biography  one night the colonel having come home from a round of electioneering visits not half satisfied with himself exceedingly annoyed much more than he cared to own with the impudence of some rude fellows at the publichouses who had interrupted his fine speeches with odious hiccups and familiar jeers was seated brooding over his cheroot by the chimneyfire friend f b of whose companionship his patron was occasionally tired finding much better amusement with the jolly britons in the boscawen room below the colonel as an electioneering business had made his appearance in the club but that ancient roman warrior had frightened those simple britons his manners were too awful for them so were clives who visited them also under mr potts introduction but the two gentlemen each being full of care and personal annoyance at the time acted like wet blankets upon the britonswhereas f b warmed them and cheered them affably partook of their meals with them and graciously shared their cups so the colonel was alone listening to the faroff roar of the britons choruses by an expiring fire as he sate by a glass of cold negus and the ashes of his cigar  i dare say he may have been thinking that his fire was wellnigh outhis cup of the dregs his pipe little more now than dust and asheswhen clive candle in hand came into their sittingroom  as each saw the others face it was so very sad and worn and pale that the young man started back and the elder with quite the tenderness of old days cried god bless me my boy how ill you look come and warm yourselflook the fires out have something clivy  for months past they had not had a really kind word the tender old voice smote upon clive and he burst into sudden tears they rained upon his fathers trembling old brown hand and stooped down and kissed it  you look very ill too father says clive  ill not i cries the father still keeping the boys hand under both his own on the mantelpiece such a battered old fellow as i am has a right to look the worse for wear but you boy why do you look so pale  i have seen a ghost father clive answered thomas however looked alarmed and inquisitive as though the boy was wandering in his mind  the ghost of my youth father the ghost of my happiness and the best days of my life groaned out the young man i saw ethel today i went to see sarah mason and she was there  i had seen her but i did not speak of her said the father i thought it was best not to mention her to you my poor boy and areare you fond of her still clive  still once means always in these things father doesnt it once means today and yesterday and forever and ever  nay my boy you mustnt talk to me so or even to yourself so you have the dearest little wife at home a dear little wife and child  you had a son and have been kind enough to him god knows you had a wife but that doesnt prevent otherother thoughts do you know you never spoke twice in your life about my mother you didnt care for her  ii did my duty by her i denied her nothing i scarcely ever had a word with her and i did my best to make her happy interposed the colonel  i know but your heart was with the other so is mine its fatal it runs in the family father  the boy looked so ineffably wretched that the fathers heart melted still more i did my best clive the colonel gasped out i went to that villain barnes and offered him to settle every shilling i was worth on youi didyou didnt know thatid kill myself for your sake clivy whats an old fellow worth living for i can live upon a crust and a cigar i dont care about a carriage and only go in it to please rosey i wanted to give up all for you but he played me false that scoundrel cheated us both he did and so did ethel  no sir i may have thought so in my rage once but i know better now she was the victim and not the agent did madame de florac play you false when she married her husband it was her fate and she underwent it we all bow to it we are in the track and the car passes over us you know it does father the colonel was a fatalist he had often advanced this oriental creed in his simple discourses with his son and clives friends  besides clive went on ethel does not care for me she received me today quite coldly and held her hand out as if we had only parted last year i suppose she likes that marquis who jilted hergod bless her how shall we know what wins the hearts of women she has mine there was my fate praise be to allah it is over  but theres that villain who injured you his isnt over yet cried the colonel clenching his trembling hand  ah father let us leave him to allah too suppose madame de florac had a brother who insulted you you know you wouldnt have revenged yourself you would have wounded her in striking him  you called out barnes yourself boy cried the father  that was for another cause and not for my quarrel and how do you know i intended to fire by jove i was so miserable then that an ounce of lead would have done me little harm  the father saw the sons mind more clearly than he had ever done hitherto they had scarcely ever talked upon that subject which the colonel found was so deeply fixed in clives heart he thought of his own early days and how he had suffered and beheld his son before him racked with the same cruel pangs of enduring grief and he began to own that he had pressed him too hastily in his marriage and to make an allowance for an unhappiness of which he had in part been the cause  mashallah clive my boy said the old man what is done is done  let us break up our camp before this place and not go to war with barnes father said clive let us have peaceand forgive him if we can  and retreat before this scoundrel clive  what is a victory over such a fellow one gives a chimneysweep the wall father  i say againwhat is done is done i have promised to meet him at the hustings and i will i think it is best and you are right and you act like a highminded gentlemanand my dear old boynot to meddle in the quarrelthough i didnt think soand the difference gave me a great deal of painand so did what pendennis saidand im wrongand thank god i am wrongand god bless you my own boy the colonel cried out in a burst of emotion and the two went to their bedrooms together and were happier as they shook hands at the doors of their adjoining chambers than they had been for many a long day and year     chapter lxix the election   having thus given his challenge reconnoitred the enemy and pledged himself to do battle at the ensuing election our colonel took leave of the town of newcome and returned to his banking affairs in london his departure was as that of a great public personage the gentlemen of the committee followed him obsequiously down to the train quick bawls out mr potts to mr brown the stationmaster quick mr brown a carriage for colonel newcome half a dozen hats are taken off as he enters into the carriage f bayham and his servant after him with portfolios umbrellas shawls despatchboxes clive was not there to act as his fathers aidedecamp after their conversation together the young man had returned to mrs clive and his other duties in life  it has been said that mr pendennis was in the country engaged in a pursuit exactly similar to that which occupied colonel newcome the menaced dissolution of parliament did not take place so soon as we expected the ministry still hung together and by consequence sir barnes newcome kept the seat in the house of commons from which his elder kinsman was eager to oust him away from london and having but few correspondents save on affairs of business i heard little of clive and the colonel save an occasional puff of one of colonel newcomes entertainments in the pall mall gazette to which journal f bayham still condescended to contribute and a satisfactory announcement in a certain part of that paper that on such a day in hyde park gardens mrs clive newcome had presented her husband with a son clive wrote to me presently to inform me of the circumstance stating at the same time with but moderate gratification on his own part that the campaigner mrs newcomes mamma had upon this second occasion made a second lodgment in her daughters house and bedchamber and showed herself affably disposed to forget the little unpleasantries which had clouded over the sunshine of her former visit  laura with a smile of some humour said she thought now would be the time when if clive could be spared from his bank he might pay us that visit at fairoaks which had been due so long and hinted that change of air and a temporary absence from mrs mackenzie might be agreeable to my old friend  it was on the contrary mr pendenniss opinion that his wife artfully chose that period of time when little rosey was perforce kept at home and occupied with her delightful maternal duties to invite clive to see us mrs laura frankly owned that she liked our clive better without his wife than with her and never ceased to regret that pretty rosey had not bestowed her little hand upon captain hoby as she had been very well disposed at one time to do against all marriages of interest this sentimental laura never failed to utter indignant protests and clives had been a marriage of interest a marriage made up by the old people a marriage which the young man had only yielded out of goodnature and obedience she would apostrophise her unconscious young ones and inform those innocent babies that they should never be made to marry except for love neveran announcement which was received with perfect indifference by little arthur on his rockinghorse and little helen smiling and crowing in her mothers lap  so clive came down to us careworn in appearance but very pleased and happy he said to stay for a while with the friends of his youth we showed him our modest rural lions we got him such sport and company as our quiet neighbourhood afforded we gave him fishing in the brawl and laura in her ponychaise drove him to baymouth and to clavering park and town and visit the famous cathedral at chatteris where she was pleased to recount certain incidents of her husbands youth  clive laughed at my wifes stories he pleased himself in our home he played with our children with whom he had became a great favourite he was happier he told me with a sigh than he had been for many a day his gentle hostess echoed the sigh of the poor young fellow she was sure that his pleasure was only transitory and was convinced that many deep cares weighed upon his mind  ere long my old schoolfellow made me sundry confessions which showed that lauras surmises were correct about his domestic affairs he did not treat much the little boy was said to be a very fine little boy the ladies had taken entire possession of him i cant stand mrs mackenzie any longer i own says clive but how resist a wife at such a moment rosa was sure she would die unless her mother came to her and of course we invited mrs mack this time she is all smiles and politeness with the colonel the last quarrel is laid upon me and in so far i am easy as the old folks get on pretty well together to me considering these things it was clear that mr clive newcome was but a very secondary personage indeed in his fathers new fine house which he inhabited and in which the poor colonel had hoped they were to live such a happy family  but it was about clive newcomes pecuniary affairs that i felt the most disquiet when he came to explain these to me the colonels capital and that considerable sum which mrs clive had inherited from her good old uncle were all involved in a common stock of which colonel newcome took the management the governor understands business so well you see says clive is a most remarkable head for accounts he must have inherited that from my grandfather you know who made his own fortune all the newcomes are good at accounts except me a poor useless devil who knows nothing but to paint a picture and who cant even do that he cuts off the head of a thistle as he speaks bites his tawny mustachios plunges his hands into his pockets and his soul into reverie  you dont mean to say asks mr pendennis that your wifes fortune has not been settled upon herself  of course it has been settled upon herself that is it is entirely her ownyou know the colonel has managed all the business he understands it better than we do  do you say that your wifes money is not vested in the hands of trustees and for her benefit  my father is one of the trustees i tell you he manages the whole thing what is his property is mine and ever has been and i might draw upon him as much as i liked and you know its five times as great as my wifes what is his is ours and what is ours is his of course for instance the india stock which poor uncle james left that now stands in the colonels name he wants to be a director he will be at the next electionhe must have a certain quantity of india stock dont you see  my dear fellow is there then no settlement made upon your wife at all  you neednt look so frightened says clive i made a settlement on her with all my worldly goods i did her endow three thousand three hundred and thirtythree pounds six and eightpence which my father sent over from india to my uncle years ago when i came home  i might well indeed be aghast at this news and had yet further intelligence from clive which by no means contributed to lessen my anxiety this worthy old colonel who fancied himself to be so clever a man of business chose to conduct it in utter ignorance and defiance of law if anything happened to the bundelcund bank it was clear that not only every shilling of his own property but every farthing bequeathed to rosa mackenzie would be lost only his retiring pension which was luckily considerable and the hundred pounds a year which clive had settled on his wife would be saved out of the ruin  and now clive confided to me his own serious doubts and misgivings regarding the prosperity of the bank itself he did not know why but he could not help fancying that things were going wrong those partners who had come home having sold out of the bank and living in england so splendidly why had they quitted it the colonel said it was a proof of the prosperity of the company that so many gentlemen were enriched who had taken shares in it but when i asked my father clive continued why he did not himself withdraw the dear old colonels countenance fell he told me such things were not to be done every day and ended as usual by saying that i do not understand anything about business no more i do that is the truth i hate the whole concern pen i hate that great tawdry house in which we live and those fearfully stupid partiesoh how i wish we were back in fitzroy square but who can recall bygones arthur or wrong steps in life we must make the best of today and tomorrow must take care of itself poor little child i could not help thinking as i took it crying in my arms the other day what has life in store for you my poor weeping baby my motherinlaw cried out that i should drop the baby and that only the colonel knew how to hold it my wife called from her bed the nurse dashed up and scolded me and they drove me out of the room amongst them by jove pen i laugh when some of my friends congratulate me on my good fortune i am not quite the father of my own child nor the husband of my own wife nor even the master of my own easel i am managed for dont you see boarded lodged and done for and here is the man they call happy happy oh why had i not your strength of mind and why did i ever leave my art my mistress  and herewith the poor lad fell to chopping thistles again and quitted fairoaks shortly leaving his friends there very much disquieted about his prospects actual and future  the expected dissolution of parliament came at length all the country papers in england teemed with electioneering addresses and the country was in a flutter with particoloured ribbons colonel thomas newcome pursuant to his promise offered himself to the independent electors of newcome in the liberal journal of the family town whilst sir barnes newcome bart addressed himself to his old and tried friends and called upon the friends of the constitution to rally round him in the conservative print the addresses of our friend were sent to us at fairoaks by the colonels indefatigable aidedecamp mr frederick bayham during the period which had elapsed since the colonels last canvassing visit and the issuing of the writs now daily expected for the new parliament many things of great importance had occurred in thomas newcomes familyevents which were kept secret from his biographer who was at this period also pretty entirely occupied with his own affairs these however are not the present subject of this history which has newcome for its business and the parties engaged in the family quarrel there  there were four candidates in the field for the representation of that borough that old and tried member of parliament mr bunce was considered to be secure and the baronets seat was thought to be pretty safe on account of his influence in the place nevertheless thomas newcomes supporters were confident for their champion and that when the parties came to the poll the extreme liberals of the borough would divide their votes between him and the fourth candidate the uncompromising radical mr barker  in due time the colonel and his staff arrived at newcome and resumed the active canvass which they had commenced some months previously clive was not in his fathers suite this time nor mr warrington whose engagements took him elsewhere the lawyer the editor of the independent and f b were the colonels chief men his headquarters which f b liked very well were at the hotel where we last saw him and whence issuing with his aidedecamp at his heels the colonel went round to canvass personally according to his promise every free and independent elector of the borough barnes too was canvassing eagerly on his side and was most affable and active the two parties would often meet nose to nose in the same street and their retainers exchange looks of defiance with mr potts of the independent a big man on his left with mr frederick a still bigger man on his right his own trusty bamboo cane in his hand before which poor barnes had shrunk abashed ere now colonel newcome had commonly the best of these street encounters and frowned his nephew barnes and barness staff off the pavement with the nonelectors the colonel was a decided favourite the boys invariably hurrayed him whereas they jeered and uttered ironical cries after poor barnes asking who beat his wife who drove his children to the workhouse and other unkind personal questions the man upon whom the libertine barnes had inflicted so cruel an injury in his early days was now the baronets bitterest enemy he assailed him with curses and threats when they met and leagued his brotherworkmen against him the wretched sir barnes owned with contrition that the sins of his youth pursued him his enemy scoffed at the idea of barness repentance he was not moved at the grief the punishment in his own family the humiliation and remorse which the repentant prodigal piteously pleaded no man was louder in his cries of mea culpa than barnes no man professed a more edifying repentance he was hat in hand to every blackcoat established or dissenting repentance was to his interest to be sure but yet let us hope it was sincere there is some hypocrisy of which one does not like even to entertain the thought especially that awful falsehood which trades with divine truth and takes the name of heaven in vain  the roebuck inn at newcome stands in the marketplace directly facing the kings arms where as we know colonel newcome and uncompromising toleration held their headquarters immense banners of blue and yellow floated from every window of the kings arms and decorated the balcony from which the colonel and the assistants were in the habit of addressing the multitude fiddlers and trumpeters arrayed in his colours paraded the town and enlivened it with their melodious strains other trumpeters and fiddlers bearing the trueblue cockades and colours of sir barnes newcome bart would encounter the colonels musicians on which occasions of meeting it is to be feared small harmony was produced they banged each other with their brazen instruments the warlike drummers thumped each others heads in lieu of the professional sheepskin the townboys and streetblackguards rejoiced in these combats and exhibited their valour on one side or the other the colonel had to pay a long bill for broken brass when he settled the little accounts of the election  in after times f b was pleased to describe the circumstances of a contest in which he bore a most distinguished part it was f bs opinion that his private eloquence brought over many waverers to the colonels side and converted numbers of the benighted followers of sir barnes newcome bayhams voice was indeed magnificent and could be heard from the kings arms balcony above the shout and roar of the multitude the gongs and bugles of the opposition bands he was untiring in his oratoryundaunted in the presence of the crowds below he was immensely popular f b whether he laid his hand upon his broad chest took off his hat and waved it or pressed his blue and yellow ribbons to his bosom the crowd shouted hurra silence bravo bayham for ever they would have carried me in triumph said f b if i had but the necessary qualification i might be member for newcome this day or any other i chose  i am afraid in this conduct of the colonels election mr bayham resorted to acts of which his principal certainly would disapprove and engaged auxiliaries whose alliance was scarcely creditable whose was the hand which flung the potato which struck sir barnes newcome bart on the nose as he was haranguing the people from the roebuck how came it that whenever sir barnes and his friends essayed to speak such an awful yelling and groaning took place in the crowd below that the words of those feeble orators were inaudible who smashed all the front windows of the roebuck colonel newcome had not words to express his indignation at proceedings so unfair when sir barnes and staff were hustled in the marketplace and most outrageously shoved jeered and jolted the colonel from the kings arms organised a rapid sally which he himself headed with his bamboo cane cut out sir barnes and his followers from the hands of the mob and addressed those ruffians in a noble speech of which bamboocaneenglishmanshamefairplay were the most emphatic expressions the mob cheered old tom as they called himthey made way for sir barnes who shrunk pale and shuddering back into his hotel againwho always persisted in saying that that old villain of a dragoon had planned both the assault and the rescue  when the dregs of the peoplethe scum of the rabble sir banded together by the myrmidons of sir barnes newcome attacked us at the kings arms and smashed ninetysix pounds worth of glass at one volley besides knocking off the gold unicorn head and the tail of the british lion it was fine sir f b said to see how the colonel came forward and the coolness of the old boy in the midst of the action he stood there in front sir with his old hat off never so much as once bobbing his old head and i think he spoke rather better under fire than he did when there was no danger between ourselves he aint much of a speaker the old colonel he hems and haws and repeats himself a good deal he hasnt the gift of natural eloquence which some men have pendennis you should have heard my speech sir on the thursday in the town hallthat was something like a speech potts was jealous of it and always reported me most shamefully  in spite of his respectful behaviour to the gentlemen in black coats his souptickets and his flanneltickets his own pathetic lectures and his sedulous attendance at other folks sermons poor barnes could not keep up his credit with the serious interest at newcome and the meetinghouses and their respective pastors and frequenters turned their backs upon him the case against him was too flagrant his enemy the factoryman worked it with an extraordinary skill malice and pertinacity not a single man woman or child in newcome but was made acquainted with sir barness early peccadillo ribald ballads were howled through the streets describing his sin and his deserved punishment for very shame the reverend dissenting gentlemen were obliged to refrain from voting for him such as ventured believing in the sincerity of his repentance to give him their voices were yelled away from the pollingplaces a very great number who would have been his friends were compelled to bow to decency and public opinion and supported the colonel  hooted away from the hustings and the public places whence the rival candidates addressed the free and independent electors this wretched and persecuted sir barnes invited his friends and supporters to meet him at the athenaeum roomscene of his previous eloquent performances but though this apartment was defended by tickets the people burst into it and nemesis in the shape of the persevering factoryman appeared before the scared sir barnes and his puzzled committee the man stood up and bearded the pale baronet he had a good cause and was in truth a far better master of debate than our banking friend being a great speaker amongst his brotheroperatives by whom political questions are discussed and the conduct of political men examined with a ceaseless interest and with an ardour and eloquence which are often unknown in what is called superior society this man and his friends round about him fiercely silenced the clamour of turn him out with which his first appearance was assailed by sir barness hangerson he said in the name of justice he would speak up if they were fathers of families and loved their wives and daughters he dared them to refuse him a hearing did they love their wives and their children it was a shame that they should take such a man as that yonder for their representative in parliament but the greatest sensation he made was when in the middle of his speech after inveighing against barness cruelty and parental ingratitude he asked where were barness children and actually thrust forward two to the amazement of the committee and the ghastly astonishment of the guilty baronet himself  look at them says the man they are almost in rags they have to put up with scanty and hard food contrast them with his other children whom you see lording in gilt carriages robed in purple and fine linen and scattering mud from their wheels over us humble people as we walk the streets ignorance and starvation is good enough for these for those others nothing can be too fine or too dear what can a factorygirl expect from such a fine highbred whitehanded aristocratic gentleman as sir barnes newcome baronet but to be cajoled and seduced and deserted and left to starve when she has served my lords pleasure her natural fate is to be turned into the street let her go and rot there and her children beg in the gutter  this is the most shameful imposture gasps out sir barnes these children are notare not  the man interrupted him with a bitter laugh no he says they are not his thats true enough friends its tom martins girl and boy a precious pair of lazy little scamps but at least he thought they were his children see how much he knows about them he hasnt seen his children for years he would have left them and their mother to starve and did but for shame and fear the old man his father pensioned them and he hasnt the heart to stop their wages now men of newcome will you have this man to represent you in parliament and the crowd roared no and barnes and his shamefaced committee slunk out of the place and no wonder the dissenting clerical gentlemen were shy of voting for him  a brilliant and picturesque diversion in colonel newcomes favour was due to the inventive genius of his faithful aidedecamp f b on the pollingday as the carriages full of voters came up to the marketplace there appeared nigh to the booths an open barouche covered all over with ribbon and containing frederick bayham esq profusely decorated with the colonels colours and a very old woman and her female attendant who were similarly ornamented it was good old mrs mason who was pleased with the drive and the sunshine though she scarcely understood the meaning of the turmoil with her maid by her side delighted to wear such ribbons and sit in such a post of honour rising up in the carriage f b took off his hat bade his men of brass be silent who were accustomed to bray see the conquering hero come whenever the colonel or mr bayham his brilliant aidedecamp made their appearancebidding we say the musicians and the universe to be silent f b rose and made the citizens of newcome a splendid speech good old unconscious mrs mason was the theme of it and the colonels virtues and faithful gratitude in tending her she was his fathers old friend she was sir barnes newcomes grandfathers old friend she had lived for more than forty years at sir barnes newcomes door and how often had he been to see her did he go every week no every month no every year no never in the whole course of his life had he set his foot into her doors loud yells and cries of shame never had he done her one single act of kindness whereas for years and years past when he was away in india heroically fighting the battles of his country when he was distinguishing himself at assaye andandmulligatawny and seringapatam in the hottest of the fight and the fiercest of the danger in the most terrible moment of the conflict and the crowning glory of the victory the good the brave the kind old colonelwhy should he say colonel why should he not say old tom at once immense roars of applause always remembered his dear old nurse and friend look at that shawl boys which she has got on my belief is that colonel newcome took that shawl in single combat and on horseback from the prime minister of tippoo sahib immense cheers and cries of bravo bayham look at that brooch the dear old thing wears he kissed her hand whilst so apostrophising her tom newcome never brags about his military achievements he is the most modest as well as the bravest man in the world what if i were to tell you that he cut that brooch from the throat of an indian rajah hes man enough to do it he is he is from all parts of the crowd what you want to take the horses out do you to the crowd who were removing those quadrupeds i aint agoing to prevent you i expected as much of you men of newcome i expected as much of you for i know you sit still old lady dont be frightened maam they are only going to pull you to the kings arms and show you to the colonel  this indeed was the direction in which the mob whether inflamed by spontaneous enthusiasm or excited by cunning agents placed amongst the populace by f b i cannot say now took the barouche and its three occupants with a myriad roar and shout the carriage was dragged up in front of the kings arms from the balconies of which a most satisfactory account of the polling was already placarded the extra noise and shouting brought out the colonel who looked at first with curiosity at the advancing procession and then as he caught sight of sarah mason with a blush and a bow of his kind old head  look at him boys cried the enraptured f b pointing up to the old man look at him the dear old boy isnt he an old trump which will you have for your member barnes newcome or old tom  and as might be supposed an immense shout of old tom arose from the multitude in the midst of which blushing and bowing still the colonel went back to his committeeroom and the bands played see the conquering hero louder than ever and poor barnes in the course of his duty having to come out upon his balcony at the roebuck opposite was saluted with a yell as vociferous as the cheer for the colonel had been and old mrs mason asked what the noise was about and after making several vain efforts in dumb show to the crowd barnes slunk back into his hole again as pale as the turnip which was flung at his head and the horses were brought and mrs mason driven home and the day of election came to an end  reasons of personal gratitude as we have stated already prevented his highness the prince de moncontour from taking a part in this family contest his brethren of the house of higg however very much to floracs gratification gave their second votes to colonel newcome carrying with them a very great number of electors we know that in the present parliament mr higg and mr bunce sit for the borough of newcome having had monetary transactions with sir barnes newcome and entered largely into railway speculations with him the messrs higg had found reason to quarrel with the baronet accuse him of sharp practices to the present day and have long stories to tell which do not concern us about sir barness stratagems grasping and extortion they their following deserting sir barnes whom they had supported in previous elections voted for the colonel although some of the opinions of that gentleman were rather too extreme for such sober persons  not exactly knowing what his politics were when he commenced the canvass i cant say to what opinions the poor colonel did not find himself committed by the time when the election was over the worthy gentleman felt himself not a little humiliated by what he had to say and to unsay by having to answer questions and submit to familiarities to shake hands which to say truth he did not care for grasping at all his habits were aristocratic his education had been military the kindest and simplest soul alive he yet disliked all familiarity and expected from common people the sort of deference which he had received from his men in the regiment the contest saddened and mortified him he felt that he was using wrong means to obtain an end that perhaps was not right for so his secret conscience must have told him he was derogating from his own honour in tampering with political opinions submitting to familiarities condescending to stand by whilst his agents solicited vulgar suffrages or uttered claptraps about retrenchment and reform i felt i was wrong he said to me in after days though i was too proud to own my error in those times and you and your good wife and my boy were right in protesting against that mad election indeed though we little knew what events were speedily to happen laura and i felt very little satisfaction when the result of the newcome election was made known to us and we found sir barnes newcome third and col thomas newcome second upon the poll  ethel was absent with her children at brighton she was glad she wrote not to have been at home during the election mr and mrs c were at brighton too ethel had seen mrs c and her child once or twice it was a very fine child my brother came down to us she wrote after all was over he is furious against m de moncontour who he says persuaded the whigs to vote against him and turned the election     chapter lxx chiltern hundreds   we shall say no more regarding thomas newcomes political doings his speeches against barnes and the baronets replies the nephew was beaten by his stout old uncle  in due time the gazette announced that thomas newcome esq was returned as one of the members of parliament for the borough of newcome and after triumphant dinners speeches and rejoicings the member came back to his family in london and to his affairs in that city  the good colonel appeared to be by no means elated by his victory he would not allow that he was wrong in engaging in that family war of which we have just seen the issue though it may be that his secret remorse on this account in part occasioned his disquiet but there were other reasons which his family not long afterwards came to understand for the gloom and low spirits which now oppressed the head of their home  it was observed that is if simple little rosey took the trouble to observe that the entertainments at the colonels mansion were more frequent and splendid even than before the silver cocoanut tree was constantly in requisition and around it were assembled many new guests who had not formerly been used to sit under those branches mr sherrick and his wife appeared at those parties at which the proprietor of lady whittleseas chapel made himself perfectly familiar sherrick cut jokes with the master of the house which the latter received with a very grave acquiescence he ordered the servants about addressing the butler as old corkscrew and bidding the footman whom he loved to call by his christian name to look alive he called the colonel newcome sometimes and facetiously speculated upon the degree of relationship subsisting between them now that his daughter was married to clives uncle the colonels brotherinlaw though i dare say clive did not much relish receiving news of his aunt sherrick was sure to bring such intelligence when it reached him and announced in due time the birth of a little cousin at boggley wollah whom the fond parents designed to name thomas newcome honeyman  a dreadful panic and ghastly terror seized poor clive on occasion which he described to me afterwards going out from home one day with his father he beheld a winemerchants cart from which hampers were carried down the area gate into the lower regions of colonel newcomes house sherrick and co wine merchants walpole street was painted upon the vehicle  good heavens sir do you get your wine from him clive cried out to his father remembering honeymans provisions in early times the colonel looking very gloomy and turning red said yes he bought wine from sherrick who had been very goodnatured and serviceable and whoand who you know is our connexion now when informed of the circumstance by clive i too as i confess thought the incident alarming  then clive with a laugh told me of a grand battle which had taken place in consequence of mrs mackenzies behaviour to the winemerchants wife the campaigner had treated this very kind and harmless but vulgar woman with extreme hauteurhad talked loud during her singingthe beauty of which to say truth time had considerably impairedhad made contemptuous observations regarding her upon more than one occasion at length the colonel broke out in great wrath against mrs mackenziebade her to respect that lady as one of his guestsand if she did not like the company which assembled at his house hinted to her that there were many thousand other houses in london where she could find a lodging for the sake of her grandchild and her adored child the campaigner took no notice of this hint and declined to remove from the quarter which she had occupied ever since she had become a grandmamma  i myself dined once or twice with my old friends under the shadow of the picklebearing cocoanut tree and could not but remark a change of personages in the society assembled the manager of the city branch of the b b c was always presentan ominouslooking man whose whispers and compliments seemed to make poor clive at his end of the table very melancholy with the city manager came the city managers friends whose jokes passed gaily round and who kept the conversation to themselves once i had the happiness to meet mr ratray who had returned filled with rupees from the indian bank who told us many anecdotes of the splendour of rummun loll at calcutta who complimented the colonel on his fine house and grand dinners with sinister goodhumour those compliments did not seem to please our poor friend that familiarity choked him a brisk little chattering attorney very intimate with sherrick with a wife of dubious gentility was another constant guest he enlivened the table by his jokes and recounted choice stories about the aristocracy with certain members of whom the little man seemed very familiar he knew to a shilling how much this lord owedand how much the creditors allowed to that marquis he had been concerned with such and such a nobleman who was now in the queens bench he spoke of their lordships affably and without their titlescalling upon louisa my dear his wife to testify to the day when viscount tagrag dined with them and earl bareacres sent them the pheasants f b as sombre and downcast as his hosts now seemed to be informed me demurely that the attorney was a member of one of the most eminent firms in the citythat he had been engaged in procuring the colonels parliamentary title for himand in various important matters appertaining to the b b c but my knowledge of the world and the law was sufficient to make me aware that this gentleman belonged to a wellknown firm of moneylending solicitors and i trembled to see such a person in the home of our good colonel where were the generals and the judges where were the fogies and their respectable ladies stupid they were and dull their company but better a stalled ox in their society than mr campions jokes over mr sherricks wines  after the little rebuke administered by colonel newcome mrs mackenzie abstained from overt hostilities against any guests of her daughters fatherinlaw and contented herself by assuming grand and princesslike airs in the company of the new ladies they flattered her and poor little rosa intensely the latter liked their company no doubt to a man of the world looking on who has seen the men and morals of many cities it was curious almost pathetic to watch that poor little innocent creature fresh and smiling attired in bright colours and a thousand gewgaws simpering in the midst of these darkling peoplepractising her little arts and coquetries with such a court round about her an unconscious little maid with rich and rare gems sparkling on all her fingers and bright gold rings as many as belonged to the late old woman of banbury crossstill she smiled and prattled innocently before these bandittii thought of zerlina and the brigands in fra diavolo  walking away with f b from one of these parties of the colonels and seriously alarmed at what i had observed there i demanded of bayham whether my conjectures were not correct that some misfortune overhung our old friends house at first bayham denied stoutly or pretended ignorance but at length having reached the haunt together which i had not visited since i was a married man we entered that place of entertainment and were greeted by its old landlady and waitress and accommodated with a quiet parlour and here f b after groaning and sighingafter solacing himself with a prodigious quantity of bitter beerfairly burst out and with tears in his eyes made a full and sad confession respecting this unlucky bundelcund banking company the shares had been going lower and lower so that there was no sale now for them at all to meet the liabilities the directors must have undergone the greatest sacrifices he did knowhe did not like to think what the colonels personal losses were the respectable solicitors of the company had retired long since after having secured payment of a most respectable bill and had given place to the firm of dubious lawagents of whom i had that evening seen a partner how the retiring partners from india had been allowed to withdraw and to bring fortunes along with them was a mystery to mr frederick bayham the great indian millionnaire was in his f bs eyes a confounded mahoganycoloured heathen humbug these fine parties which the colonel was giving and that fine carriage which was always flaunting about the park with poor mrs clive and the campaigner and the nurse and the baby were in f bs opinion all decoys and shams he did not mean to say that the meals were not paid and that the colonel had to plunder for his horses corn but he knew that sherrick and the attorney and the manager insisted upon the necessity of giving these parties and keeping up this state and grandeur and opined that it was at the special instance of these advisers that the colonel had contested the borough for which he was now returned do you know how much that contest cost asks f b the sum sir was awful and we have ever so much of it to pay i came up twice myself from newcome to campion and sherrick about it i betray no secretsf b sir would die a thousand deaths before he would tell the secrets of his benefactorbut pendennis you understand a thing or two you know what oclock it is and so does yours truly f b who drinks your health i know the taste of sherricks wine well enough f b sir fears the greeks and all the gifts they bring confound his amontillado i had rather drink this honest malt and hops all my life than ever see a drop of his abominable sherry golden f b believes it is goldenand a precious deal dearer than gold tooand herewith ringing the bell my friend asked for a second pint of the justnamed and cheaper fluid  i have of late had to recount portions of my dear old friends history which must needs be told and over which the writer does not like to dwell if thomas newcomes opulence was unpleasant to describe and to contrast with the bright goodness and simplicity i remembered in former days how much more painful is that part of his story to which we are now come perforce and which the acute reader of novels has no doubt long foreseen yes sir or madam you are quite right in the opinion which you have held all along regarding that bundelcund banking company in which our colonel has invested every rupee he possesses solvuntur rupees etc i disdain for the most part the tricks and surprises of the novelists art knowing from the very beginning of our story what was the issue of this bundelcund banking concern i have scarce had patience to keep my counsel about it and whenever i have had occasion to mention the company have scarcely been able to refrain from breaking out into fierce diatribes against that complicated enormous outrageous swindle it was one of many similar cheats which have been successfully practised upon the simple folks civilian and military who toil and strugglewho fight with sun and enemywho pass years of long exile and gallant endurance in the service of our empire in india agency houses after agency houses have been established and have flourished in splendour and magnificence and have paid fabulous dividendsand have enormously enriched two or three wary speculatorsand then have burst in bankruptcy involving widows orphans and countless simple people who trusted their all to the keeping of these unworthy treasurers  the failure of the bundelcund bank which we now have to record was one only of many similar schemes ending in ruin about the time when thomas newcome was chaired as member of parliament for the borough of which he bore the name the great indian merchant who was at the head of the bundelcund banking companys affairs at calcutta suddenly died of cholera at his palace at barackpore he had been giving of late a series of the most splendid banquets with which indian prince ever entertained a calcutta society the greatest and proudest personages of that aristocratic city had attended his feasts the fairest calcutta beauties had danced in his halls did not poor f b transfer from the columns of the bengal hurkaru to the pall mall gazette the most astounding descriptions of those asiatic nights entertainments of which the very grandest was to come off on the night when cholera seized rummun loll in its grip there was to have been a masquerade outvying all european masquerades in splendour the two rival queens of the calcutta society were to have appeared each with her court around her young civilians at the college and young ensigns fresh landed had gone into awful expenses and borrowed money at interest from the b b c and other banking companies in order to appear with befitting splendour as knights and noblemen of henrietta marias court henrietta maria wife of hastings hicks esq sudder dewanee adawlut or as princes and warriors surrounding the palanquin of lalla rookh the lovely wife of hon cornwallis bobus member of council all these splendours were there as carriage after carriage drove up from calcutta they were met at rummun lolls gate by ghastly weeping servants who announced their masters demise  on the next day the bank at calcutta was closed and the day after when heavy bills were presented which must be paid although by this time rummun loll was not only dead but buried and his widows howling over his grave it was announced throughout calcutta that but 800 rupees were left in the treasury of the b b c to meet engagements to the amount of four lakhs then immediately due and sixty days afterwards the shutters were closed at no 175 lothbury the london offices of the b b c of india and 35000 pounds worth of their bills refused by their agents messrs baines jolly and co of fog court  when the accounts of that ghastly bankruptcy arrived from calcutta it was found of course that the merchantprince rummun loll owed the b b c twentyfive lakhs of rupees the value of which was scarcely even represented by his respectable signature it was found that one of the auditors of the bank the generally esteemed charley conder a capital fellow famous for his good dinners and for playing lowcomedy characters at the chowringhee theatre was indebted to the bank in 90000 pounds and also it was discovered that the revered baptist bellman chief registrar of the calcutta tape and sealingwax office a most valuable and powerful amateur preacher who had converted two natives and whose serious soirees were thronged at calcutta had helped himself to 73000 pounds more for which he settled in the bankruptcy court before he resumed his duties in his own in justice to mr bellman it must be said that he could have had no idea of the catastrophe impending over the b b c for only three weeks before that great bank closed its doors mr bellman as guardian of the children of his widowed sister mrs green had sold the whole of the late colonels property out of companys paper and invested it in the bank which gave a high interest and with bills of which drawn upon their london correspondents he had accommodated mrs colonel green when she took her departure for europe with her numerous little family on board the burrumpooter  and now you have the explanation of the title of this chapter and know wherefore thomas newcome never sat in parliament where are our dear old friends now where are roseys chariots and horses where her jewels and gewgaws bills are up in the fine new house swarms of hebrew gentlemen with their hats on are walking about the drawingrooms peering into the bedrooms weighing and poising the poor old silver cocoanut tree eyeing the plate and crystal thumbing the damask of the curtains and inspecting ottomans mirrors and a hundred articles of splendid trumpery there is roseys boudoir which her fatherinlaw loved to ornamentthere is clives studio with a hundred sketchesthere is the colonels bare room at the top of the house with his little iron bedstead and ships drawers and a camel trunk or two which have accompanied him on many an indian march and his old regulation sword and that one which the native officers of his regiment gave him when he bade them farewell i can fancy the brokers faces as they look over this camp wardrobe and that the uniforms will not fetch much in holywell street there is the old one still and that new one which he ordered and wore when poor little rosey was presented at court i had not the heart to examine their plunder and go amongst those wreckers f b used to attend the sale regularly and report its proceedings to us with eyes full of tears a fellow laughed at me says f b because when i came into the dear old drawingroom i took my hat off i told him that if he dared say another word i would knock him down i think f b may be pardoned in this instance for emulating the office of auctioneer where are you pretty rosey and poor little helpless baby where are you dear clivegallant young friend of my youth ah it is a sad storya melancholy page to pen let us pass it over quicklyi love not to think of my friend in pain     chapter lxxi in which mrs clive newcomes carriage is ordered   all the friends of the newcome family of course knew the disaster which had befallen the good colonel and i was aware for my own part that not only his own but almost the whole of rosa newcomes property was involved in the common ruin some proposals of temporary relief were made to our friends from more quarters than one but were thankfully rejectedand we were led to hope that the colonel having still his pension secured to him which the law could not touch might live comfortably enough the retirement to which of course he would betake himself when the melancholy proceedings consequent on the bankruptcy were brought to an end it was shown that he had been egregiously duped in the transactionthat his credulity had cost him and his family a large fortunethat he had given up every penny which belonged to himthat there could not be any sort of stain upon his honest reputation the judge before whom he appeared spoke with feeling and regard of the unhappy gentlemanthe lawyer who examined him respected the grief and fall of that simple old man thomas newcome took a little room near the court where his affairs and the affairs of the company were adjudgedlived with a frugality which never was difficult to himand once when perchance i met him in the city avoided me with a bow and courtesy that was quite humble though proud and somehow inexpressibly touching to me fred bayham was the only person whom he admitted fred always faithfully insisted upon attending him in and out of court j j came to me immediately after he heard of the disaster eager to place all his savings at the service of his friends laura and i came to london and were urgent with similar offers our good friend declined to see any of us f b again with tears trickling on his rough cheeks and a break in his voice told me he feared that affairs must be very bad indeed for the colonel absolutely denied himself a cheroot to smoke laura drove to his lodgings and took him a box which was held up to him as he came to open the door to my wifes knock by our smiling little boy he patted the child on his golden head and kissed him my wife wished he would have done as much for herbut he would notthough she owned she kissed his hand he drew it across his eyes and thanked her in a very calm and stately mannerbut he did not invite her within the threshold of his door saying simply that such a room was not a fit place to receive a lady as you ought to know very well mrs smith he said to the landlady who had accompanied my wife up the stairs he will eat scarcely anything the woman told us his meals come down untouched his candles are burning all night almost as he sits poring over his papers  he was benthe who used to walk so uprightly laura said he seemed to have grown many years older and was indeed quite a decrepit old man  i am glad they have left clive out of the bankruptcy the colonel said to bayham it was almost the only time when his voice exhibited any emotion it was very kind of them to leave out clive poor boy and i have thanked the lawyers in court those gentlemen and the judge himself were very much moved at this act of gratitude the judge made a very feeling speech to the colonel when he came up for his certificate he passed very different comments on the conduct of the manager of the bank when that person appeared for examination he wished that the law had power to deal with those gentlemen who had come home with large fortunes from india realised but a few years before the bankruptcy those gentlemen had known how to take care of themselves very well and as for the manager is not his wife giving elegant balls at her elegant house at cheltenham at this very day  what weighed most upon the colonels mind f b imagined was the thought that he had been the means of inducing many poor friends to embark their money in this luckless speculation take j js money after he had persuaded old ridley to place 200 pounds in indian shares good god he and his family should rather perish than he would touch a farthing of it many fierce words were uttered to him by mrs mackenzie for instanceby her angry daughter at musselburghjoseys husband by mr smee ra and two or three indian officers friends of his own who had entered into the speculation on his recommendation these rebukes thomas newcome bore with an affecting meekness as his faithful f b described to me striving with many oaths and much loudness to carry off bis own emotion but what moved the colonel most of all was a letter which came at this time from honeyman in india saying that he was doing wellthat of course he knew of his benefactors misfortune and that he sent a remittance which d v should be annual in payment of his debt to the colonel and his good sister at brighton on receipt of this letter said f b the old man was fairly beatenthe letter with the bill in it dropped out of his hands he clasped them together shaking in every limb and his head dropped down on his breast as he said i thank my god almighty for this and he sent the cheque off to mrs honeyman by the post that night sir every shilling of it and he passed his old arm under mineand we went out to toms coffeehouse and he ate some dinner the first time for ever so long and drank a couple of glasses of port wine and f b stood it sir and would stand his hearts blood that dear old boy  it was on a monday morning that those melancholy shutters were seen over the offices of the bundelcund bank in lothbury which were not to come down until the rooms were handed over to some other and let us trust more fortunate speculators the indian bills had arrived and been protested in the city on the previous saturday the campaigner and mrs rosey had arranged a little party to the theatre that evening and the gallant captain goby had agreed to quit the delights of the flag club in order to accompany the ladies neither of them knew what was happening in the city or could account otherwise than by the common domestic causes for clives gloomy despondency and his fathers sad reserve clive had not been in the city on this day he had spent it as usual in his studio boude by his wife and not disturbed by the messroom raillery of the campaigner they had dined early in order to be in time for the theatre goby entertained them with the latest jokes from the smokingroom at the flag and was in his turn amused by the brilliant plans for the season which rosey and her mamma sketched out the entertainments which mrs clive proposed to give the ballshe was dying for a masked ball just such a one as that was described in the pall mall gazette of last week out of that paper with the droll title the bengal hurkaru which the merchantprince the head of the bank you know in india had given at calcutta we must have a ball too says mrs mackenzie society demands it of you of course it does echoes captain goby and he bethought him of a brilliant circle of young fellows from the flag whom he would bring in splendid uniform to dance with the pretty mrs clive newcome  after the dinnerthey little knew it was to be their last in that fine housethe ladies retired to give their parting kiss to babya parting look to the toilettes with which they proposed to fascinate the inhabitants of the pit and the public boxes at the olympic goby made vigorous play with the claretbottle during the brief interval of potation allowed to him he too little deeming that he should never drink bumper there again clive looking on with the melancholy and silent acquiescence which had of late been his part in the household the carriage was announcedthe ladies came downpretty capotes on the lovely campaigner goby vowed looking as young and as handsome as her daughter by jove and the ball door was opened to admit the two gentlemen and ladies to their carriage when as they were about to step in a hansom cab drove up rapidly in which was perceived thomas newcomes anxious face he got out of the vehiclehis own carriage making way for himthe ladies still on the steps oh the play i forgot said the colonel  of course we are going to the play papa cries little rosey with a gay little tap of her hand  i think you had better not colonel newcome said gravely  indeed my darling child has set her heart upon it and i would not have her disappointed for the world in her situation cries the campaigner tossing up her head  the colonel for reply bade his coachman drive to the stables and come for further orders and turning to his daughters guest expressed to captain goby his regret that the proposed party could not take place on that evening as he had matter of very great importance to communicate to his family on hearing these news and understanding that his further company was not desirable the captain a man of great presence of mind arrested the hansom cabman who was about to take his departure and who blithely knowing the club and its inmates full well carried off the jolly captain to finish his evening at the flag  has it come father said clive with a sure prescience looking in his fathers face  the father took and grasped the hand which his son held out let us go back into the diningroom he said they entered it and he filled himself a glass of wine out of the bottle still standing amidst the dessert he bade the butler retire who was lingering about the room and sideboard and only wanted to know whether his master would have dinner that was all and this gentleman having withdrawn colonel newcome finished his glass of sherry and broke a biscuit the campaigner assuming an attitude of surprise and indignation whilst rosey had leisure to remark that papa looked very ill and that something must have happened  the colonel took both her hands and drew her towards him and kissed her whilst roseys mamma flouncing down on a chair beat a tattoo upon the tablecloth with her fan something has happened my love the colonel said very sadly you must show all your strength of mind for a great misfortune has befallen us  good heavens colonel what is it dont frighten my beloved child cries the campaigner rushing towards her darling and enveloping her in her robust arms what can have happened dont agitate this darling child sir and she looked indignantly towards the poor colonel  we have received the very worst news from calcutta a confirmation of the news by the last mail clivey my boy  it is no news to me i have always been expecting it father says clive holding down his head  expecting what what have you been keeping back from us in what have you been deceiving us colonel newcome shrieks the campaigner and rosa crying out oh mamma mamma begins to whimper  the chief of the bank in india is dead the colonel went on he has left its affairs in worse than disorder we are i fear ruined mrs mackenzie and the colonel went on to tell how the bank could not open on monday morning and its bills to a great amount had already been protested in the city that day  rosey did not understand half these news or comprehend the calamity which was to follow but mrs mackenzie rustling in great wrath made a speech of which the anger gathered as he proceeded in which she vowed and protested that her money which the colonel she did not know from what motives had induced her to subscribe should not be sacrificed and that have it she would the bank shut or not the next monday morningthat her daughter had a fortune of her own which her poor dear brother james should have divided and would have divided much more fairly had he not been wrongly influencedshe would not say by whom and she commanded colonel newcome upon that instant if he was as he always pretended to be an honourable man to give an account of her blessed darlings property and to pay back her own every sixpence of it she would not lend it for an hour longer and to see that that dear blessed child now sleeping unconsciously upstairs and his dear brothers and sisters who might follow for rosey was a young woman a poor innocent creature too young to be married and never would have been married had she listened to her mammas advice she demanded that the baby and all succeeding babies should have their rights and should be looked to by their grandmother if their fathers father was so unkind and so wicked and so unnatural as to give their money to rogues and deprive them of their just bread  rosey began to cry more loudly than ever during the utterance of mammas sermon so loudly that clive peevishly cried out hold your tongue on which the campaigner clutching her daughter to her breast again turned on her soninlaw and abused him as she had abused his father before him calling out that they were both in a conspiracy to defraud her child and the little darling upstairs of its bread and she would speak yes she would and no power should prevent her and her money she would have on monday as sure as her poor dear husband captain mackenzie was dead and she never would have been cheated so yes cheated if he had been alive  at the word cheated clive broke out with an execrationthe poor colonel with a groan of despairthe widows storm continued and above that howling tempest of words rose mrs clives piping scream who went off into downright hysterics at last in which she was encouraged by her mother and in which she gasped out frantic ejaculations regarding baby dear darling ruined baby and so forth  the sorrowstricken colonel had to quell the womens tongues and shrill anger and his sons wrathful replies who could not bear the weight of mrs mackenzie upon him and it was not until these three were allayed that thomas newcome was able to continue his sad story to explain what had happened and what the actual state of the case was and to oblige the terrorstricken women at length to hear something like reason  he then had to tell them to their dismay that he would inevitably be declared a bankrupt in the ensuing week that the whole of his property in that house as elsewhere would be seized and sold for the creditors benefit and that his daughter had best immediately leave a home where she would be certainly subject to humiliation and annoyance i would have clive my boy take you out of the country andand return to me when i have need of him and shall send for him the father said fondly in reply to a rebellious look on his sons face i would have you quit this house as soon as possible why not tonight the law bloodhound may be upon us ere an hour is overat this moment for what i know  at that moment the doorbell was heard to ring and the women gave a scream apiece as if the bailiffs were actually coming to take possession rosey went off in quite a series of screams peevishly repressed by her husband and always encouraged by mamma who called her soninlaw an unfeeling wretch it must be confessed that mrs clive newcome did not exhibit much strength of mind or comfort her husband much at a moment when he needed consolation  from angry rebellion and fierce remonstrance this pair of women now passed to an extreme terror and desire for instantaneous flight they would go that momentthey would wrap the blessed child up in its shawlsand nurse should take it anywhereanywhere poor neglected thing my trunks cries mrs mackenzie you know are ready packedi am sure it is not the treatment which i have receivedit is nothing but my duty and my religionand the protection which i owe to this blessed unprotectedyes unprotected and robbed and cheated darling childwhich have made me stay a single day in this house i never thought i should have been robbed in it or my darlings with their fine fortunes flung naked on the world if my mac was here you never had dared to have done this colonel newcomeno never he had his faultsmackenzie hadbut he would never have robbed his own children come away rosey my blessed love come let us pack your things and let us go and hide our heads in sorrow somewhere ah didnt i tell you to beware of all painters and that clarence was a true gentleman and loved you with all his heart and would never have cheated you out of your money for which i will have justice as sure as there is justice in england  during this outburst the colonel sat utterly scared and silent supporting his poor head between his hands when the harem had departed he turned sadly to his son clive did not believe that his father was a cheat and a rogue no thank god the two men embraced with tender cordiality and almost happy emotion on the one side and the other never for one moment could clive think his dear old father meant wrongthough the speculations were unfortunate in which he had engagedthough clive had not liked them it was a relief to his mind that they were now come to an end they should all be happier now thank god those clouds of distrust being removed clive felt not one moments doubt but that they should be able to meet fortune with a brave face and that happier much happier days were in store for him than ever they had known since the period of this confounded prosperity  heres a good end to it says clive with flashing eyes and a flushed face and heres a good health till tomorrow father and he filled into two glasses the wine still remaining in the flask goodbye to our fortune and bad luck go with heri puff the prostitute awaysi celeres quatit pennas you remember what we used to say at grey friarsresign quae dedit et mea virtute me involve probamque pauperiem sine dote quaero and he pledged his father who drank his wine his hand shaking as he raised the glass to his lips and his kind voice trembling as he uttered the wellknown old school words with an emotion that was as sacred as a prayer once more and with hearts full of love the two men embraced clives voice would tremble now if he told the story as it did when he spoke it to me in happier times one calm summer evening when we sat together and talked of dear old days  thomas newcome explained to his son the plan which to his mind as he came away from the city after the days misfortunes he thought it was best to pursue the women and the child were clearly best out of the way and you too my boy must be on duty with them until i send for you which i will do if your presence can be of the least service to me or is called for bybyour honour said the old man with a drop in his voice you must obey me in this dear clive as you have done in everything and been a good and dear and obedient son to me god pardon me for having trusted to my own simple old brains too much and not to you who know so much better you will obey me this once more my boyyou will promise me this and the old man as he spoke took clives hand in both his and fondly caressed it  then with a shaking hand he took out of his pocket his old purse with the steel rings which he had worn for many and many a long year clive remembered it and his fathers face how it would beam with delight when he used to take that very purse out in clives boyish days and tip him just after he left school here are some notes and some gold he said it is roseys honestly clive dear her halfyears dividend for which you will give an order please to sherrick he has been very kind and good sherrick all the servants were providentially paid last weekthere are only the outstanding weeks bills outwe shall manage to meet those i dare say and you will see that rosey only takes away such clothes for herself and her baby as are actually necessary wont you dear the plain things you knownone of the fineriesthey may be packed in a petara or two and you will take them with youbut the pomps and vanities you know we will leave behindthe pearls and bracelets and the plate and all that rubbishand i will make an inventory of them tomorrow when you are gone and give them up every rupees worth sir every anna by jove to the creditors  the darkness had fallen by this time and the obsequious butler entered to light the diningroom lamps you have been a very good and kind servant to us martin says the colonel making him a low bow i should like to shake you by the hand we must part company now and i have no doubt you and your fellow servants will find good places all of you as you merit martinas you merit great losses have fallen upon our familywe are ruined sirwe are ruined the great bundelcund banking company has stopped payment in india and our branch here must stop on monday thank my friends downstairs for their kindness to me and my family martin bowed in silence with great respect he and his comrades in the servantshall had been expecting this catastrophe quite as long as the colonel himself who thought he had kept his affairs so profoundly secret  clive went up into his womens apartments looking with but little regret i dare say round those cheerless nuptial chambers with all their gaudy fittings the fine lookingglasses in which poor roseys little person had been reflected the silken curtains under which he had lain by the poor childs side wakeful and lonely here he found his childs nurse and his wife and wifes mother busily engaged with a multiplicity of boxes with flounces feathers fallals and finery which they were stowing away in this trunk and that while the baby lay on its little pink pillow breathing softly a little pearly fist placed close to its mouth the aspect of the tawdry vanities scattered here and there chafed and annoyed the young man he kicked the robes over with his foot when mrs mackenzie interposed with loud ejaculations he sternly bade her to be silent and not wake the child his words were not to be questioned when he spoke in that manner you will take nothing with you rosey but what is strictly necessaryonly two or three of your plainest dresses and what is required for the boy what is in this trunk mrs mackenzie stepped forward and declared and the nurse vowed upon her honour and the ladysmaid asserted really now upon honour too that there was nothing but what was most strictly necessary in that trunk to which affidavits when clive applied to his wife she gave a rather timid assent  where are the keys of that trunk upon mrs mackenzies exclamation of what nonsense clive putting his foot upon the flimsy oilcovered box vowed he would kick the lid off unless it was instantly opened obeying this grim summons the fluttering women produced the keys and the black box was opened before him  the box was found to contain a number of objects which clive pronounced to be by no means necessary to his wifes and childs existence trinketboxes and favourite little gimcracks chains rings and pearl necklaces the tiara poor rosey had worn at courtthe feathers and the gorgeous train which had decorated the little personall these were found packed away in this one receptacle and in another box i am sorry to say were the silver forks and spoons the butler wisely judging that the rich and splendid electrotype ware might as well be left behindall the silver forks spoons and ladles and our poor old friend the cocoanut tree which these female robbers would have carried out of the premises  mr clive newcome burst out into fierce laughter when he saw the cocoanut tree he laughed so loud that baby woke and his motherinlaw called him a brute and the nurse ran to give its accustomed quietus to the little screaming infant roseys eyes poured forth a torrent of little protests and she would have cried yet more loudly than the other baby had not her husband again fiercely checking her sworn with a dreadful oath that unless she told him the whole truth by heavens she should leave the house with nothing but what covered her even the campaigner could not make head against clives stern resolution and the incipient insurrection of the maids and the mistresses was quelled by his spirit the ladysmaid a flighty creature received her wages and took her leave but the nurse could not find it in her heart to quit her little nursling so suddenly and accompanied clives household in the journey upon which those poor folks were bound what stolen goods were finally discovered when the family reached foreign parts were found in mrs mackenzies trunks not in her daughters a silver filigree basket a few teaspoons babys gold coral and a costly crimson velvetbound copy of the hon miss grimstones church service to which articles having thus appropriated them mrs mackenzie henceforward laid claim as her own  so when the packing was done a cab was called to receive the modest trunks of this fugitive familythe coachman was bidden to put his horses to again and for the last time poor rosey newcome sate in her own carriage to which the colonel conducted her with his courtly old bow kissing the baby as it slept once more unconscious in its nurses embrace and bestowing a very grave and polite parting salute upon the campaigner  then clive and his father entered a cab on which the trunks were borne and they drove to the tower stairs where the ship lay which was to convey them out of england and during that journey no doubt they talked over their altered prospects and i am sure clives father blessed his son fondly and committed him and his family to a good gods gracious keeping and thought of him with sacred love when they had parted and thomas newcome had returned to his lonely house to watch and to think of his ruined fortunes and to pray that he might have courage under them that he might bear his own fate honourably and that a gentle one might be dealt to those beloved beings for whom his life had been sacrificed in vain     chapter lxxii belisarius   when the sale of colonel newcomes effects took place a friend of the family bought in for a few shillings those two swords which had hung as we have said in the good mans chamber and for which no single broker present had the heart to bid the head of clives father painted by himself which had always kept its place in the young mans studio together with a lot of his oilsketchings easels and painting apparatus were purchased by the faithful j j who kept them until his friend should return to london and reclaim them and who showed the most generous solicitude in clives behalf j j was elected of the royal academy this year and clive it was evident was working hard at the profession which he had always loved for he sent over three pictures to the academy and i never knew man more mortified than the affectionate j j when two of these unlucky pieces were rejected by the committee for the year one pretty little piece called the stranded boat got a fair place on the exhibition walls and you may be sure was loudly praised by a certain critic in the pall mall gazette the picture was sold on the first day of the exhibition at the price of twentyfive pounds which the artist demanded and when the kind j j wrote to inform his friend of this satisfactory circumstance and to say that he held the money at clives disposal the latter replied with many expressions of sincere gratitude at the same time begging him directly to forward the money with our old friend thomas newcomes love to mrs sarah mason at newcome but j j never informed his friend that he himself was the purchaser of the picture nor was clive made acquainted with the fact until some time afterwards when he found it hanging in ridleys studio  i have said that we none of us were aware at this time what was the real state of colonel newcomes finances and hoped that after giving up every shilling of his property which was confiscated to the creditors of the bank he had still from his retiring pension and military allowances at least enough reputably to maintain him on one occasion having business in the city i there met mr sherrick affairs had been going ill with that gentlemanhe had been let in terribly he informed me by lord levants insolvencyhaving had large money transactions with his lordship theres none of them so good as old newcome mr sherrick said with a sigh that was a good onethat was an honest man if ever i saw onewith no more guile and no more idea of business than a baby why didnt he take my advice poor old covehe might be comfortable now why did he sell away that annuity pendennis i got it done for him when nobody else perhaps could have got it done for himfor the security aint worth twopence if newcome wasnt an honest manbut i know he is and would rather starve and eat the nails off his fingers than not keep his word the old trump and when he came to me a good two months before the smash of the bank which i knew it sir and saw that it must comewhen he came and raised three thousand pounds to meet them dd electioneering bills having to pay lawyers commission premium lifeinsuranceyou know the whole game mr pi as good as went down on my knees to himi didat the north and south american coffeehouse where he was to meet the party about the money and said colonel dont raise iti tell you let it stand overlet it go in along with the bankruptcy thats acomingbut he wouldnthe went on like an old bengal tiger roaring about his honour he paid the bills every shillinginfernal long bills they were and its my belief that at this minute he aint got fifty pounds a year of his own to spend i would send him back my commissioni would by joveonly times is so bad and that rascal levant let me in it went to my heart to take the old cocks moneybut its gonethat and ever so much moreand lady whittleseas chapel too mr p hang that young levant  squeezing my hand after this speech sherrick ran across the street after some other capitalist who was entering the diddlesex insurance office and left me very much grieved and dismayed at finding that my worst fears in regard to thomas newcome were confirmed should we confer with his wealthy family respecting the colonels impoverished condition was his brother hobson newcome aware of it as for sir barnes the quarrel between him and his uncle had been too fierce to admit of hopes of relief from that quarter barnes had been put to very heavy expenses in the first contested election had come forward again immediately on his uncles resignation but again had been beaten by a more liberal candidate his quondam former friend mr higgwho formally declared against sir barnes and who drove him finally out of the representation of newcome from this gentleman it was vain of course for colonel newcomes friends to expect relief  how to aid him he was proudpast worknearly seventy years old oh why did those cruel academicians refuse clives pictures cries laura i have no patience with themhad the pictures been exhibited i know who might have bought thembut that is vain now he would suspect at once and send her money away oh pen why why didnt he come when i wrote that letter to brussels  from persons so poorly endowed with money as ourselves any help but of the merest temporary nature was out of the question we knew our friends too well not to know that they would disdain to receive it it was agreed between me and laura that at any rate i should go and see clive our friends indeed were at a very short distance from us and having exiled themselves from england could yet see its coasts from their windows upon any clear day boulogne was their present abidingplacerefuge of how many thousands of other unfortunate britonsand to this friendly port i betook myself speedily having the address of colonel newcome his quarters were in a quiet grassgrown old street of the old town none of the family were at home when i called there was indeed no servant to answer the bell but the goodnatured french domestic of a neighbouring lodger told me that the young monsieur went out every day to make his designs and that i should probably find the elder gentleman upon the rampart where he was in the custom of going every day i strolled along by those pretty old walks and bastions under the pleasant trees which shadow them and the grey old gabled houses from which you look down upon the gay new city and the busy port and the piers stretching into the shining sea dotted with a hundred white sails or black smoking steamers and bounded by the friendly lines of the bright english shore there are few prospects more charming than the familiar view from those old french wallsfew places where young children may play and ruminating old age repose more pleasantly than on those peaceful rampart gardens  i found our dear old friend seated on one of the benches a newspaper on his knees and by his side a redcheeked little french lass upon whose lap thomas newcome the younger lay sleeping the colonels face flushed up when he saw me as he advanced a step or two towards me i could see that he trembled in his walk his hair had grown almost quite white he looked now to be more than his agehe whose carriage last year had been so erect whose figure had been so straight and manly i was very much moved at meeting him and at seeing the sad traces which pain and grief had left in the countenance of the dear old man  so you are come to see me my good young friend cried the colonel with a trembling voice it is very very kind of you is not this a pretty drawingroom to receive our friends in we have not many of them now boy and i come and sit here for hours every day hasnt he grown a fine boy he can say several words now sir and can walk surprisingly well soon he will be able to walk with his grandfather and then marie will not have the trouble to wait upon either of us he repeated this sentiment in his pretty old french and turning with a bow to marie the girl said monsieur knew very well that she did not desire better than to come out with baby that it was better than staying at home pardieu and the clock striking at this moment she rose up with her child crying out that it was time to return or madame would scold  mrs mackenzie has rather a short temper the colonel said with a gentle smile poor thing she has had a great deal to bear in consequence pen of my imprudence i am glad you never took shares in our bank i should not be so glad to see you as i am now if i had brought losses upon you as i have upon so many of my friends i for my part trembled to hear the good old man was under the domination of the campaigner  bayham sends me the paper regularly he is a very kind faithful creature how glad i am that he has got a snug berth in the city his company really prospers i am happy to think unlike some companies you know of pen i have read your two speeches sir and clive and i liked them very much the poor boy works all day at his pictures you know he has sold one at the exhibition which has given us a great deal of heartand he has completed two or three moreand i am sitting to him now forwhat do you think sir for belisarius will you give belisarius and the obolus kind word  my dear dear old friend i said in great emotion if you will do me the kindness to take my obolus or to use my services in any way you will give me more pleasure than ever i had from your generous bounties in old days look sir i wear the watch which you gave me when you went to india did you not tell me then to look over clive and serve him if i could cant i serve him now and i went on further in this strain asseverating with great warmth and truth that my wifes affection and my own were most sincere for both of them and that our pride would be to be able to help such dear friends  the colonel said i had a good heart and my wife had thoughthoughhe did not finish this sentence but i could interpret it without need of its completion my wife and the two ladies of colonel newcomes family never could be friends however much my poor laura tried to be intimate with these women her very efforts at intimacy caused a frigidity and hauteur which laura could not overcome little rosey and her mother set us down as two aristocratic personages nor for our parts were we very much disturbed at this opinion of the campaigner and little rosa  i talked with the colonel for half an hour or more about his affairs which indeed were very gloomy and clives prospects of which he strove to present as cheering a view as possible he was obliged to confirm the news which sherrick had given me and to own in fact that all his pension was swallowed up by a payment of interest and life insurance for sums which he had been compelled to borrow how could he do otherwise than meet his engagements thank god he had clives full approval for what he had donehad communicated the circumstance to his son almost immediately after it took place and that was a comfort to himan immense comfort for the women are very angry said the poor colonel you see they do not understand the laws of honour at least as we understand them and perhaps i was wrong in hiding the truth as i certainly did from mrs mackenzie but i acted for the besti hoped against hope that some chance might turn in our favour god knows i had a hard task enough in wearing a cheerful face for months and in following my little rosa about to her parties and balls but poor mrs mackenzie has a right to be angry only i wish my little girl did not side with her mother so entirely for the loss of her affection gives me great pain  so it was as i suspected the campaigner ruled over this family and added to all their distresses by her intolerable presence and tyranny why sir i ventured to ask if as i gather from youand i remember i added with a laugh certain battlesroyal which clive described to me in old daysif you and the campaimrs mackenzie do not agree why should she continue to live with you when you would all be so much happier apart  she has a right to live in the house says the colonel it is i who have no right in it i am a poor old pensioner dont you see subsisting on roseys bounty we live on the hundred a year secured to her at her marriage and mrs mackenzie has her forty pounds of pension which she adds to the common stock it is i who have made away with every shilling of roseys 17000 pounds god help me and with 1500 pounds of her mothers they put their little means together and they keep usme and clive what can we do for a living great god what can we do why i am so useless that even when my poor boy earned 25 pounds for his picture i felt we were bound to send it to sarah mason and you may fancy when this came to mrs mackenzies ears what a life my boy and i led i have never spoken of these things to any mortal souli even dont speak of them with clivebut seeing your kind and honest face has made me talkyou must pardon my garrulityi am growing old arthur this poverty and these quarrels have beaten my spirit downthere i shall talk on this subject no more i wish sir i could ask you to dine with us butand here he smiledwe must get the leave of the higher powers  i was determined in spite of prohibitions and campaigners to see my old friend clive and insisted on walking back with the colonel to his lodgings at the door of which we met mrs mackenzie and her daughter rosa blushed up a littlelooked at her mammaand then greeted me with a hand and a curtsey the campaigner also saluted me in a majestic but amicable manner made no objection even to my entering her apartments and seeing the condition to which they were reduced this phrase was uttered with particular emphasis and a significant look towards the colonel who bowed his meek head and preceded me into the lodgings which were in truth very homely pretty and comfortable the campaigner was an excellent managerrestless bothering brushing perpetually such fugitive gimcracks as they had brought away with them decorated the little salon mrs mackenzie who took the entire command even pressed me to dine and partake if so fashionable a gentleman would condescend to partake of a humble exiles fare no fare was perhaps very pleasant to me in company with that woman but i wanted to see my dear old clive and gladly accepted his voluble motherinlaws not disinterested hospitality she beckoned the colonel aside whispered to him putting something into his hand on which he took his hat and went away then rosey was dismissed upon some other pretext and i had the felicity to be left alone with mrs captain mackenzie  she instantly improved the occasion and with great eagerness and volubility entered into her statement of the present affairs and position of this unfortunate family she described darling roseys delicate state poor thingnursed with tenderness and in the lap of luxurybrought up with every delicacy and the fondest mothernever knowing in the least how to take care of herself and likely to fall down and perish unless the kind campaigner were by to prop and protect her she was in delicate healthvery delicateordered codliver oil by the doctor heaven knows how he could be paid for those expensive medicines out of the pittance to which the imprudencethe most culpable and designing imprudence and extravagance and folly of colonel newcome had reduced them looking out from the window as she spoke i sawwe both sawthe dear old gentleman sadly advancing towards the house a parcel in his hand seeing his near approach and that our interview was likely to come to an end mrs mackenzie rapidly whispered to me that she knew i had a good heartthat i had been blessed by providence with a fine fortune which i knew how to keep better than some folksand that if as no doubt was my intentionfor with what other but a charitable view could i have come to see themand most generous and noble was it of you to come and i always thought it of you mr pendennis whatever other people said to the contrary if i proposed to give them relief which was most needfuland for which a mothers blessings would follow melet it be to her the campaigner that my loan should be confidedfor as for the colonel he is not fit to be trusted with a shilling and has already flung away immense sums upon some old woman he keeps in the country leaving his darling rosey without the actual necessaries of life  the womans greed and rapacitythe flattery with which she chose to belabour me at dinner so choked and disgusted me that i could hardly swallow the meal though my poor old friend had been sent out to purchase a pate from the pastrycooks for my especial refection clive was not at the dinner he seldom returned till late at night on sketching days neither his wife nor his motherinlaw seemed much to miss him and seeing that the campaigner engrossed the entire share of the conversation and proposed not to leave me for five minutes alone with the colonel i took leave rather speedily of my entertainers leaving a message for clive and a prayer that he would come and see me at my hotel     chapter lxxiii in which belisarius returns from exile   i was sitting in the dusk in my room at hotel des bains when the visitor for whom i hoped made his appearance in the person of clive with his broad shoulders and broad hat and a shaggy beard which he had thought fit in his quality of painter to assume our greeting it need not be said was warm and our talk which extended far into the night very friendly and confidential if i make my readers confidants in mr clives private affairs i ask my friends pardon for narrating his history in their behoof the world had gone very ill with my poor clive and i do not think that the pecuniary losses which had visited him and his father afflicted him near so sorely as the state of his home in a pique with the woman he loved and from that generous weakness which formed part of his character and which led him to acquiesce in most wishes of his good father the young man had gratified the darling desire of the colonels heart and taken the wife whom his two old friends brought to him rosey who was also as we have shown of a very obedient and ductile nature had acquiesced gladly enough in her mammas opinion that she was in love with the rich and handsome young clive and accepted him for better or worse so undoubtedly would this good child have accepted captain hoby her previous adorer have smilingly promised fidelity to the captain at church and have made a very good happy and sufficient little wife for that officerhad not mamma commanded her to jilt him what wonder that these elders should wish to see their two dear young ones united they began with suitable age money good temper and parents blessings it is not the first time that with all these excellent helps to prosperity and happiness a marriage has turned out unfortunatelya pretty tight ship gone to wreck that set forth on its voyage with cheers from the shore and every prospect of fair wind and fine weather  we have before quoted poor clives simile of the shoes with which his good old father provided himas pretty a little pair of shoes as need beonly they did not fit the wearer if they pinched him at first how they blistered and tortured him now if clive was gloomy and discontented even when the honeymoon had scarce waned and he and his family sat at home in state and splendour under the boughs of the famous silver cocoanut tree what was the young mans condition now in poverty when they had no love along with a scant dinner of herbs when his motherinlaw grudged each morsel which his poor old father atewhen a vulgar coarseminded woman pursued with brutal sarcasm and deadly rancour one of the tenderest and noblest gentlemen in the worldwhen an ailing wife always under some ones domination received him with helpless hysterical cries and reproacheswhen a coarse female tyrant stupid obstinate utterly unable to comprehend the sons kindly genius or the fathers gentle spirit bullied over both using the intolerable undeniable advantage which her actual wrongs gave her to tyrannise over these two wretched men he had never heard the last of that money which they had sent to mrs mason clive said when the knowledge of the fact came to the campaigners ears she raised such a storm as almost killed the poor colonel and drove his son half mad she seized the howling infant vowing that its unnatural father and grandfather were bent upon starving itshe consoled and sent rosey into hystericsshe took the outlawed parson to whose church they went and the choice society of bankrupt captains captains ladies fugitive stockbrokers wives and dingy frequenters of billiardrooms and refugees from the bench into her councils and in her daily visits amongst these personages and her walks on the pier whither she trudged with poor rosey in her train mrs mackenzie made known her own wrongs and her daughtersshowed how the colonel having robbed and cheated them previously was now living upon them insomuch that mrs bolter the levanting auctioneers wife would not make the poor old man a bow when she met himthat mrs captain kitely whose husband had lain for seven years past in boulogne gaol ordered her son to cut clive and when the child being sick the poor old colonel went for arrowroot to the chemists young snooks the apothecarys assistant refused to allow him to take the powder away without previously depositing the money  he had no money thomas newcome he gave up every farthing after having impoverished all around him he had no right he said to touch a sixpence of the wretched pittance remaining to themhe had even given up his cigar the poor old man the companion and comforter of forty years he was not fit to be trusted with money mrs mackenzie said and the good man owned as he ate his scanty crust and bowed his noble old head in silence under that cowardly persecution  and this at the end of threescore and seven or eight years was to be the close of a life which had been spent in freedom and splendour and kindness and honour this the reward of the noblest heart that ever beatthe tomb and prison of a gallant warrior who had ridden in twenty battleswhose course through life had been a bounty wherever it had passedwhose name had been followed by blessings and whose career was to end hereherein a mean room in a mean alley of a foreign towna low furious woman standing over him and stabbing the kind defenceless heart with killing insult and daily outrage  as we sat together in the dark clive told me this wretched story which was wrung from him with a passionate emotion that i could not but keenly share he wondered the old man lived clive said some of the womens taunts and gibes as he could see struck his father so that he gasped and started back as if some one had lashed him with a whip he would make away with himself said poor clive but he deems this is his punishment and that he must bear it as long as it pleases god he does not care for his own losses as far as they concern himself but these reproaches of mrs mackenzie and some things which were said to him in the bankruptcy court by one or two widows of old friends who were induced through his representations to take shares in that infernal bank have affected him dreadfully i hear him lying awake and groaning at night god bless him great god what can i dowhat can i do burst out the young man in a dreadful paroxysm of grief i have tried to get lessonsi went to london on the deck of a steamer and took a lot of drawings with metried picturedealerspawnbrokersjewsmoss whom you may remember at gandishs and who gave me for fortytwo drawings eighteen pounds i brought the money back to boulogne it was enough to pay the doctor and bury our last poor little dead baby tenez pen you must give me some supper i have had nothing all day but a pain de deux sous i cant stand it at home my hearts almost brokenyou must give me some money pen old boy i know you will i thought of writing to you but i wanted to support myself you see when i went to london with the drawings i tried georges chambers but he was in the country i saw crackthorpe on the street in oxford street but i could not face him and bolted down hanway yard i tried and i could not ask him and i got the eighteen pounds from moss that day and came home with it  give him money of course i would give him moneymy dear old friend and as an alterative and a wholesome shock to check that burst of passion and grief in which the poor fellow indulged i thought fit to break into a very fierce and angry invective on my own part which served to disguise the extreme feeling of pain and pity that i did not somehow choose to exhibit i rated clive soundly and taxed him with unfriendliness and ingratitude for not having sooner applied to friends who would think shame of themselves whilst he was in need whatever he wanted was his as much as mine i could not understand how the necessity of the family should in truth be so extreme as he described it for after all many a poor family lived upon very much less but i uttered none of these objections checking them with the thought that clive on his first arrival at boulogne entirely ignorant of the practice of economy might have imprudently engaged in expenses which had reduced him to this present destitution i did not know at the time that mrs mackenzie had taken entire superintendence of the family treasuryand that this exemplary woman was putting away as she had done previously sundry little sums to meet rainy days  i took the liberty of asking about debts and of these clive gave me to understand there were noneat least none of his or his fathers contracting if we were too proud to borrow and i think we were wrong pen my dear old boyi think we were wrong nowat least we were too proud to owe my colourman takes his bill out in drawings and i think owes me a trifle he got me some lessons at fifty sous a ticketa pound the tenfrom an economical swell who has taken a chateau here and has two flunkeys in livery he has four daughters who take advantage of the lessons and screws ten per cent upon the poor colourmans pencils and drawingpaper its pleasant work to give the lessons to the children and to be patronised by the swell and not expensive to him is it pen but i dont mind that if i could but get lessons enough for you see besides our expenses here we must have some more money and the dear old governor would die outright if poor old sarah mason did not get her fifty pounds a year  and now there arrived a plentiful supper and a bottle of good wine of which the giver was not sorry to partake after the meagre dinner at three oclock to which i had been invited by the campaigner and it was midnight when i walked back with my friend to his house in the upper town and all the stars of heaven were shining cheerily and my dear clives face wore an expression of happiness such as i remembered in old days as we shook hands and parted with a god bless you  to clives friend revolving these things in his mind as he lay in one of those most snug and comfortable beds at the excellent hotel des bains it appeared that this town of boulogne was a very bad market for the artists talents and that he had to bring them to london where a score of old friends would assuredly be ready to help him and if the colonel too could be got away from the domination of the campaigner i felt certain that the dear old gentleman could but profit by his leave of absence my wife and i at this time inhabited a spacious old house in queens square westminster where there was plenty of room for father and son i knew that laura would be delighted to welcome these guestsmay the wife of every worthy gentleman who reads these pages be as ready to receive her husbands friends it was the state of rosas health and the campaigners authority and permission about which i was in doubt and whether this ladys two slaves would be allowed to go away  these cogitations kept the present biographer long awake and he did not breakfast next day until an hour before noon i had the coffeeroom to myself by chance and my meal was not yet ended when the waiter announced a lady to visit mr pendennis and mrs mackenzie made her appearance no signs of care or poverty were visible in the attire or countenance of the buxom widow a handsome bonnet decorated within with a profusion of poppies bluebells and ears of corn a jewel on her forehead not costly but splendid in appearance and glittering artfully over that central spot from which her wavy chestnut hair parted to cluster in ringlets round her ample cheeks a handsome india shawl smart gloves a rich silk dress a neat parasol of blue with pale yellow lining a multiplicity of glittering rinks and a very splendid gold watch and chain which i remembered in former days as hanging round poor roseys white neckall these adornments set off the widows person so that you might have thought her a wealthy capitalists lady and never could have supposed that she was a poor cheated ruined robbed unfortunate campaigner  nothing could be more gracious than the accueil of this lady she paid me many handsome compliments about my literary workasked most affectionately for dear mrs pendennis and the dear childrenand then as i expected coming to business contrasted the happiness and genteel position of my wife and family with the misery and wrongs of her own blessed child and grandson she never could call that child by the odious name which he received at his baptism i knew what bitter reasons she had to dislike the name of thomas newcome  she again rapidly enumerated the wrongs she had received at the hands of that gentleman mentioned the vast sums of money out of which she and her souls darling had been tricked by that poor muddleheaded creature to say no worse of him and described finally their present pressing need the doctors the burial roseys delicate condition the cost of sweetbreads calfsfoot jelly and codliver oil were again passed in a rapid calculation before me and she ended her speech by expressing her gratification that i had attended to her advice of the previous day and not given clive newcome a direct loan that the family wanted it the campaigner called upon heaven to witness that clive and his absurd poor father would fling guineas out of the window was a fact equally certain the rest of the argument was obvious namely that mr pendennis should administer a donation to herself  i had brought but a small sum of money in my pocketbook though mrs mackenzie intimate with bankers and having thank heaven in spite of all her misfortunes the utmost confidence of all her tradesmen hinted a perfect willingness on her part to accept an order upon her friends hobson brothers of london  this direct thrust i gently and smilingly parried by asking mrs mackenzie whether she supposed a gentleman who had just paid an electioneering bill and had at the best of times but a very small income might sometimes not be in a condition to draw satisfactorily upon messrs hobson or any other bankers her countenance fell at this remark nor was her cheerfulness much improved by the tender of one of the two banknotes which then happened to be in my possession i said that i had a use for the remaining note and that it would not be more than sufficient to pay my hotel bill and the expenses of my party back to london  my party i had here to divulge with some little trepidation the plan which i had been making overnight to explain how i thought that clives great talents were wasted at boulogne and could only find a proper market in london how i was pretty certain through my connection with booksellers to find some advantageous employment for him and would have done so months ago had i known the state of the case but i had believed until within a very few days since that the colonel in spite of his bankruptcy was still in the enjoyment of considerable military pensions  this statement of course elicited from the widow a number of remarks not complimentary to my dear old colonel he might have kept his pensions had he not been a foolhe was a baby about money mattersmisled himself and everybodywas a log in the house etc etc etc  i suggested that his annuities might possibly be put into some more satisfactory shapethat i had trustworthy lawyers with whom i would put him in communicationthat he had best come to london to see to these mattersand that my wife had a large house where she would most gladly entertain the two gentlemen  this i said with some reasonable dreadfearing in the first place her refusal in the second her acceptance of the invitation with a proposal as our house was large to come herself and inhabit it for a while had i not seen that campaigner arrive for a month at poor james binnies house in fitzroy square and stay there for many years was i not aware that when she once set her foot in a gentlemans establishment terrific battles must ensue before she could be dislodged had she not once been routed by clive and was she not now in command and possession do i not finally know something of the world and have i not a weak easy temper i protest it was with terror that i awaited the widows possible answer to my proposal  to my great relief she expressed the utmost approval of both my plans i was uncommonly kind she was sure to interest myself about the two gentlemen and for her blessed rosas sake a fond mother thanked me it was most advisable that he should earn some money by that horrid profession which he had chosen to adopta trade she called it she was clearly anxious get rid both of father and son and agreed that the sooner they went the better  we walked back arminarm to the colonels quarters in the old town mrs mackenzie in the course of our walk doing me the honour to introduce me by name to several dingy acquaintances whom we met sauntering up the street and imparting to me as each moved away the pecuniary cause of his temporary residence in boulogne spite of roseys delicate state of health mrs mackenzie did not hesitate to break the news to her of the gentlemens probable departure abruptly and eagerly as if the intelligence was likely to please herand it did rather than otherwise the young woman being in the habit of letting mamma judge for her continued it in this instance and whether her husband stayed or went seemed to be equally content or apathetic and is it not most kind and generous of dear mr and mrs pendennis to propose to receive mr newcome and the colonel this opportunity for gratitude being pointed out to rosey she acquiesced in it straightwayit was very kind of me rosey was sure and dont you ask after dear mrs pendennis and the dear childrenyou poor dear suffering darling child rosey who had neglected this inquiry immediately hoped mrs pendennis and the children were well the overpowering mother had taken utter possession of this poor little thing roseys eyes followed the campaigner about and appealed to her at all moments she sat under mrs mackenzie as a bird before a boaconstrictor doomedflutteringfascinatedscared and fawning as a whipt spaniel before a keeper  the colonel was on his accustomed bench on the rampart at this sunny hour i repaired thither and found the old gentleman seated by his grandson who lay as yesterday on the little bonnes lap one of his little purple hands closed round the grandfathers finger hush says the good man lifting up his other finger to his moustache as i approached boys asleep il est bien joli quand il dortle boy nestce pas marie the maid believed monsieur wellthe boy was a little angel this maid is a most trustworthy valuable person pendennis the colonel said with much gravity  the boaconstrictor had fascinated him toothe lash of that woman at home had cowed that helpless gentle noble spirit as i looked at the head so upright and manly now so beautiful and resignedthe year of his past life seemed to pass before me somehow in a flash of thought i could fancy the accursed tyrannythe dumb acquiescencethe brutal jeerthe helpless remorsethe sleepless nights of pain and recollectionthe gentle heart lacerated with deadly stabsand the impotent hope i own i burst into a sob at the sight and thought of the noble suffering creature and hid my face and turned away  he sprang up releasing his hand from the childs and placing it the kind shaking hand on my shoulder what is it arthurmy dear boy he said looking wistfully in my face no bad news from home my dear laura and the children well  the emotion was mastered in a moment i put his arm under mine and as we slowly sauntered up and down the sunny walk of the old rampart i told him how i had come with special commands from laura to bring him for a while to stay with us and to settle his business which i was sure had been wofully mismanaged and to see whether we could not find the means of getting some little out of the wreck of the property for the boy yonder  at first colonel newcome would not hear of quitting boulogne where rosey would miss himhe was sure she would want himbut before the ladies of his family to whom we presently returned thomas newcomes resolution was quickly recalled he agreed to go and clive coming in at this time was put in possession of our plan and gladly acquiesced in it on that very evening i came with a carriage to conduct my two friends to the steamboat their little packets were made and ready there was no pretence of grief at parting on the womens side but marie the little maid with boy in her arms cried sadly and clive heartily embraced the child and the colonel going back to give it one more kiss drew out of his neckcloth a little gold brooch which he wore and which trembling he put into maries hand bidding her take good care of boy till his return  she is a good girla most faithful attached girl arthur do you see the kind old gentleman said and i had no money to give herno not one single rupee     chapter lxxiv in which clive begins the world   we are ending our history and yet poor clive is but beginning the world he has to earn the bread which he eats henceforth and as i saw his labours his trials and his disappointments i could not but compare his calling with my own  the drawbacks and penalties attendant upon our profession are taken into full account as we well know by literary men and their friends our poverty hardships and disappointments are set forth with great emphasis and often with too great truth by those who speak of us but there are advantages belonging to our trade which are passed over i think by some of those who exercise it and describe it and for which in striking the balance of our accounts we are not always duly thankful we have no patron so to speakwe sit in antechambers no more waiting the present of a few guineas from my lord in return for a fulsome dedication we sell our wares to the bookpurveyor between whom and us there is no greater obligation than between him and his papermaker or printer in the great towns in our country immense stores of books are provided for us with librarians to class them kind attendants to wait upon us and comfortable appliances for study we require scarce any capital wherewith to exercise our trade what other socalled learned profession is equally fortunate a doctor for example after carefully and expensively educating himself must invest in house and furniture horses carriage and menservants before the public patient will think of calling him in i am told that such gentlemen have to coax and wheedle dowagers to humour hypochondriacs to practise a score of little subsidiary arts in order to make that of healing profitable how many many hundreds of pounds has a barrister to sink upon his stockintrade before his returns are available there are the costly charges of university educationthe costly chambers in the inn of courtthe clerk and his maintenancethe inevitable travels on circuitcertain expenses all to be defrayed before the possible client makes his appearance and the chance of fame or competency arrives the prizes are great to be sure in the law but what a prodigious sum the lotteryticket costs if a man of letters cannot win neither does he risk so much let us speak of our trade as we find it and not be too eager in calling out for public compassion  the artists for the most part do not cry out their woes as loudly as some gentlemen of the literary fraternity and yet i think the life of many of them is harder their chances even more precarious and the conditions of their profession less independent and agreeable than ours i have watched smee esq ra flattering and fawning and at the same time boasting and swaggering poor fellow in order to secure a sitter i have listened to a manchester magnate talking about fine arts before one of j js pictures assuming the airs of a painter and laying down the most absurd laws respecting the art i have seen poor tomkins bowing a rich amateur through a private view and noted the eager smiles on tomkins face at the amateurs slightest joke the sickly twinkle of hope in his eyes as amateur stopped before his own picture i have been ushered by chipstones black servant through hall after hall peopled with plaster gods and heroes into chipstones own magnificent studio where he sat longing vainly for an order and justly dreading his landlords call for the rent and seeing how severely these gentlemen were taxed in their profession i have been grateful for my own more fortunate one which necessitates cringing to no patron which calls for no keeping up of appearances and which requires no stockintrade save the workmans industry his best ability and a dozen sheets of paper  having to turn with all his might to his new profession clive newcome one of the proudest men alive chose to revolt and to be restive at almost every stage of his training he had a natural genius for his art and had acquired in his desultory way a very considerable skill his drawing was better than his painting an opinion which were my friend present he of course would utterly contradict his designs and sketches were far superior to his finished compositions his friends presuming to judge of this artists qualifications ventured to counsel him accordingly and were thanked for their pains in the usual manner we had in the first place to bully and browbeat clive most fiercely before he would take fitting lodgings for the execution of those designs which we had in view for him why should i take expensive lodgings says clive slapping his fist on the table i am a pauper and can scarcely afford to live in a garret why should you pay me for drawing your portrait and lauras and the children what the deuce does warrington want with the effigy of his old mug you dont want them a bityou only want to give me moneyit would be much more honest of me to take the money at once and own that i am a beggar and i tell you what pen the only money which i feel i come honestly by is that which is paid me by a little printseller in long acre who buys my drawings one with another at fourteen shillings apiece and out of whom i can earn pretty nearly two hundred a year i am doing coaches for him sir and charges of cavalry the public like the mail coaches beston a dark paperthe horses and miles picked out whiteyellow dustcobalt distance and the guard and coachman of course in vermilion thats what a gentleman can get his bread byportraits pooh its disguised beggary crackthorpe and a halfdozen men of his regiment came like good fellows as they are and sent me five pounds apiece for their heads but i tell you i am ashamed to take the money such used to be the tenor of clive newcomes conversation as he strode up and down our room after dinner pulling his moustache and dashing his long yellow hair off his gaunt face  when clive was inducted into the new lodgings at which his friends counselled him to hang up his ensign the dear old colonel accompanied his son parting with a sincere regret from our little ones at home to whom he became greatly endeared during his visit to us and who always hailed him when he came to see us with smiles and caresses and sweet infantile welcome on that day when he went away laura went up and kissed him with tears in her eyes you know how long i have been wanting to do it this lady said to her husband indeed i cannot describe the behaviour of the old man during his stay with us his gentle gratitude his sweet simplicity and kindness his thoughtful courtesy there was not a servant in our little household but was eager to wait upon him lauras maid was as tenderhearted at his departure as her mistress he was ailing for a short time when our cook performed prodigies of puddings and jellies to suit his palate the youth who held the offices of butler and valet in our establishmenta lazy and greedy youth whom martha scolded in vainwould jump up and leave his supper to carry a message to our colonel my heart is full as i remember the kind words which he said to me at parting and as i think that we were the means of giving a little comfort to that stricken and gentle soul  whilst the colonel and his son stayed with us letters of course passed between clive and his family at boulogne but my wife remarked that the receipt of those letters appeared to give our friend but little pleasure they were read in a minute and he would toss them over to his father or thrust them into his pocket with a gloomy face dont you see groans out clive to me one evening that rosa scarcely writes the letters or if she does that her mother is standing over her that woman is the nemesis of our life pen how can i pay her off great god how can i pay her off and so having spoken his head fell between his hands and as i watched him i saw a ghastly domestic picture before me of helpless pain humiliating discord stupid tyranny  what i say again are the socalled great ills of life compared to these small ones  the colonel accompanied clive to the lodgings which we had found for the young artist in a quarter not far removed from the old house in fitzroy square where some happy years of his youth had been spent when sitters came to cliveas at first they did in some numbers many of his early friends being anxious to do him a servicethe old gentleman was extraordinarily cheered and comforted we could see by his face that affairs were going on well at the studio he showed us the rooms which rosey and the boy were to occupy he prattled to our children and their mother who was never tired of hearing him about his grandson he filled up the future nursery with a hundred little knickknacks of his own contriving and with wonderful cheap bargains which he bought in his walks about tottenham court road he pasted a most elaborate book of prints and sketches for boy it was astonishing what notice boy already took of pictures he would have all the genius of his father would he had had a better grandfather than the foolish old man who had ruined all belonging to him  however much they like each other men in the london world see their friends but seldom the place is so vast that even next door is distant the calls of business society pleasure so multifarious that mere friendship can get or give but an occasional shake of the hand in the hurried moments of passage men must live their lives and are perforce selfish but not unfriendly at a great need you know where to look for your friend and he that he is secure of you so i went very little to howland street where clive now lived very seldom to lamb court where my dear old friend warrington still sate in his old chambers though our meetings were none the less cordial when they occurred and our trust in one another always the same some folks say the world is heartless he who says so either prates commonplaces the most likely and charitable suggestion or is heartless himself or is most singular and unfortunate in having made no friends many such a reasonable mortal cannot have our nature i think not sufficing for that sort of polygamy how many persons would you have to deplore your death or whose death would you wish to deplore could our hearts let in such a harem of dear friendships the mere changes and recurrences of grief and mourning would be intolerable and tax our lives beyond their value in a word we carry our own burthen in the world push and struggle along on our own affairs are pinched by our own shoesthough heaven forbid we should not stop and forget ourselves sometimes when a friend cries out in his distress or we can help a poor stricken wanderer in his way as for good womenthese my worthy reader are different from usthe nature of these is to love and to do kind offices and devise untiring charitiesso i would have you to know that though mr pendennis was parcus suorum cultor et infrequens mrs laura found plenty of time to go from westminster to bloomsbury and to pay visits to her colonel and her clive both of whom she had got to love with all her heart again now misfortune was on them and both of whom returned her kindness with an affection blessing the bestower and the receiver and making the husband proud and thankful whose wife had earned such a noble regard what is the dearest praise of all to a man his ownor that you should love those whom he loves i see laura pendennis ever constant and tender and pure ever ministering in her sacred office of kindnessbestowing love and followed by blessings which would i have think you that priceless crown hymeneal or the glory of a tenth edition  clive and his father had found not only a model friend in the lady above mentioned but a perfect prize landlady in their happy lodgings in her house besides those apartments which mr newcome had originally engaged were rooms just sufficient to accommodate his wife child and servant when they should come to him with a very snug little upper chamber for the colonel close by boys nursery where he liked best to be and if there is not room for the campaigner as you call her says mrs laura with a shrug of her shoulders why i am very sorry but clive must try and bear her absence as well as possible after all my dear pen you know he is married to rosa and not to her mamma and so and so i think it will be quite best that they shall have their menage as before  the cheapness of the lodgings which the prize landlady let the quantity of neat new furniture which she put in the consultations which she had with my wife regarding these supplies were quite singular to me have you pawned your diamonds you reckless little person in order to supply all this upholstery no sir i have not pawned my diamonds mrs laura answers and i was left to think if i thought on the matter at all that the landladys own benevolence had provided these good things for clive for the wife of lauras husband was perforce poor and she asked me for no more money at this time than at any other  at first in spite of his grumbling clives affairs looked so prosperous and so many sitters came to him from amongst his old friends that i was half inclined to believe with the colonel and my wife that he was a prodigious genius and that his good fortune would go on increasing laura was for having rosey return to her husband every wife ought to be with her husband j j shook his head about the prosperity let us see whether the academy will have his pictures this year and what a place they will give him said ridley to do him justice clive thought far more humbly of his compositions than ridley did not a little touching was it to us who had known the young men in former days to see them in their changed positions it was ridley whose genius and industry had put him in the rank of a patronridley the good industrious apprentice who had won the prize of his artand not one of his many admirers saluted his talent and success with such a hearty recognition as clive whose generous soul knew no envy and who always fired and kindled at the success of his friends  when mr clive used to go over to boulogne from time to time to pay his dutiful visits to his wife the colonel did not accompany his son but during the latters absence would dine with mrs pendennis  though the preparations were complete in howland street and clive dutifully went over to boulogne mrs pendennis remarked that he seemed still to hesitate about bringing his wife to london  upon this mr pendennis observed that some gentlemen were not particularly anxious about the society of their wives and that this pair were perhaps better apart upon which mrs pendennis drubbing on the ground with a little foot said nonsense for shame arthur how can you speak so flippantly did he not swear before heaven to love and cherish her never to leave her sir is not his duty his duty sir a most emphatic stamp of the foot is she not his for better or for worse  including the campaigner my dear says mr p  dont laugh sir she must come to him there is no room in howland street for mrs mackenzie  you artful scheming creature we have some spare rooms suppose we ask mrs mackenzie to come and live with us my dear and we could then have the benefit of the garrison anecdotes and mess jocularities of your favourite captain goby  i could never bear the horrid man cried mrs pendennis and how can i tell why she disliked him  everything being now ready for the reception of clives little family we counselled our friend to go over to boulogne and bring back his wife and child and then to make some final stipulation with the campaigner he saw as well as we that the presence and tyranny of that fatal woman destroyed his fathers health and spiritsthat the old man knew no peace or comfort in her neighbourhood and was actually hastening to his grave under that dreadful and unremitting persecution mrs mackenzie made clive scarcely less wretched than his fathershe governed his householdtook away his weak wifes allegiance and affection from himand caused the wretchedness of every single person round about her they ought to live apart if she was too poor to subsist upon her widows pension which in truth was but a very small pittance let clive give up to her say the half of his wifes income of one hundred pounds a year his prospects and present means of earning money were such that he might afford to do without that portion of his income at any rate he and his father would be cheaply ransomed at that price from their imprisonment to this intolerable person go clive said his counsellors and bring back your wife and child and let us all be happy together for you see those advisers opined that if we had written over to mrs newcomecomeshe would have come with the campaigner in her suite  vowing that he would behave like a man of courageand we knew that clive had shown himself to be such in two or three previous battlesclive crossed the water to bring back his little rosey our good colonel agreed to dine at our house during the days of his sons absence i have said how beloved he was by young and old thereand he was kind enough to say afterwards that no woman had made him so happy as laura we did not tell himi know not from what reticencethat we had advised clive to offer a bribe of fifty pounds a year to mrs mackenzie until about a fortnight after clives absence and a week after his return when news came that poor old mrs mason was dead at newcome whereupon we informed the colonel that he had another pensioner now in the campaigner  colonel newcome was thankful that his dear old friend had gone out of the world in comfort and without pain she had made a will long since leaving all her goods and chattels to thomas newcomebut having no money to give the colonel handed over these to the old ladys faithful attendant keziah  although many of the colonels old friends had parted from him or quarrelled with him in consequence of the ill success of the b b c there were two old ladies who yet remained faithful to himmiss cann namely and honest little miss honeyman of brighton who when she heard of the return to london of her nephew and brotherinlaw made a railway journey to the metropolis being the first time she ever engaged in that kind of travelling rustled into clives apartments in howland street in her neatest silks and looking not a day older than on that when we last beheld her and after briskly scolding the young man for permitting his father to enter into money affairsof which the poor dear colonel was as ignorant as a babyshe gave them both to understand that she had a little sum at her bankers at their disposaland besought the colonel to remember that her house was his and that she should be proud and happy to receive him as soon and as often and for as long a time as he would honour her with his company is not my house full of your presentscried the stout little old ladyhave i not reason to be grateful to all the newcomesyes to all the newcomesfor miss ethel and her family have come to me every year for months and i dont quarrel with them and i wont although you do sir is not this shawlare not these jewels that i wear she continued pointing to those wellknown ornaments my dear colonels gift did you not relieve my brother charles in this country and procure for him his place in india yes my dear friendand though you have been imprudent in money matters my obligations towards you and my gratitude and my affection are always the same thus miss honeyman spoke with somewhat of a quivering voice at the end of her little oration but with exceeding state and dignityfor she believed that her investment of two hundred pounds in that unlucky b b c which failed for half a million was a sum of considerable importance and gave her a right to express her opinion to the managers  clive came back from boulogne in a week as we have saidbut he came back without his wife much to our alarm and looked so exceedingly fierce and glum when we demanded the reason of his return without his family that we saw wars and battles had taken place and thought that in this last continental campaign the campaigner had been too much for her friend  the colonel to whom clive communicated though with us the poor lad held his tongue told my wife what had happenednot all the battles which no doubt raged at breakfast dinner supper during the week of clives visit to boulognebut the upshot of these engagements rosey not unwilling in her first private talk with her husband to come to england with him and the boy showed herself irresolute on the second day at breakfast when the fire was opened on both sides cried at dinner when fierce assaults took place in which clive had the advantage slept soundly but besought him to be very firm and met the enemy at breakfast with a quaking heart cried all that day during which pretty well without cease the engagement lasted and when clive might have conquered and brought her off but the weather was windy and the sea was rough and he was pronounced a brute to venture on it with a wife in roseys situation  behind that situation the widow shielded herself she clung to her adored child and from that bulwark discharged abuse and satire at clive and his father he could not rout her out of her position having had the advantage on the first two or three days on the four last he was beaten and lost ground in each action rosey found that in her situation she could not part from her darling mamma the campaigner for her part averred that she might be reduced to beggary that she might be robbed of her last farthing and swindled and cheated that she might see her daughters fortune flung away by unprincipled adventurers and her blessed child left without even the comforts of life but desert her in such a situation she never wouldno never was not dear rosas health already impaired by the various shocks which she had undergone did she not require every comfort every attendance monster ask the doctor she would stay with her darling child in spite of insult and rudeness and vulgarity roseys father was a kings officer not a companys officer thank god she would stay as long at least as roseys situation continued at boulogne if not in london but with her child they might refuse to send her money having robbed her of all her own but she would pawn her gown off her back for her child whimpers from roseycries of mamma mamma compose yourselfconvulsive sobsclenched knucklesflashing eyesembraces rapidly clutchedlaughsstampssnortsfrom the dishevelled campaigner grinding teethlivid fury and repeated breakages of the third commandment by clivei can fancy the whole scene he returned to london without his wife and when she came she brought mrs mackenzie with her     chapter lxxv founders day at the grey friars   rosey came bringing discord and wretchedness with her to her husband and the sentence of death or exile to his dear old father all of which we foresawall of which clives friends would have longed to preventall of which were inevitable under the circumstances clives domestic affairs were often talked over by our little set warrington and f b knew of his unhappiness we three had strongly opined that the women being together at boulogne should stay there and live there clive sending them over pecuniary aid as his means permitted they must hate each other pretty well by this time growls george warrington why on earth should they not part what a woman that mrs mackenzie is cries f b what an infernal tartar and catamaran she who was so uncommonly smiling and softspoken and such a fine woman by jingo what puzzles all women are f b sighed and drowned further reflection in beer  on the other side and most strongly advocating roseys return to clive was mrs laura pendennis with certain arguments for which she had chapter and verse and against which we of the separatist party had no appeal did he marry her only for the days of her prosperity asked laura is it right is it manly that he should leave her now she is unhappypoor little creatureno woman had ever more need of protection and who should be her natural guardian save her husband surely arthur you forgethave you forgotten them yourself sirthe solemn vows which clive made at the altar is he not bound to his wife to keep only unto her so long as they both shall live to love and comfort her honour her and keep her in sickness and health  to keep her yesbut not to keep the campaigner cries mr pendennis it is a moral bigamy laura which you advocate you wicked immoral young woman  but laura though she smiled at this notion would not be put off from her first proposition turning to clive who was with us talking over his doleful family circumstances she took his hand and pleaded the cause of right and religion with sweet artless fervour she agreed with us that it was a hard lot for clive to bear so much the nobler the task and the fulfilment of duty in enduring it a few months too would put an end to his trials when his child was born mrs mackenzie would take her departure it would even be clives duty to separate from her then as it now was to humour his wife in her delicate condition and to soothe the poor soul who had had a great deal of illhealth of misfortune of domestic calamity to wear and shatter her clive acquiesced with a groan butwith a touching and generous resignation as we both thought she is right pen he said i think your wife is always right i will try laura and bear my part god help me i will do my duty and strive my best to soothe and gratify my poor dear little woman they will be making caps and things and will not interrupt me in my studio of nights i can go to clipstone street and work at the life theres nothing like the life pen so you see i shant be much at home except at mealtimes when by nature i shall have my mouth full and no opportunity of quarrelling with poor mrs mac so he went home followed and cheered by the love and pity of my dear wife and determined stoutly to bear this heavy yoke which fate had put on him  to do mrs mackenzie justice that lady backed up with all her might the statement which my wife had put forward with a view of soothing poor clive viz that the residence of his motherinlaw in his house was only to be temporary temporary cries mrs mac who was kind enough to make a call on mrs pendennis and treat that lady to a piece of her mind do you suppose madam that it could be otherwise do you suppose that worlds would induce me to stay in a house where i have received such treatment where after i and my daughter had been robbed of every shilling of our fortune where we are daily insulted by colonel newcome and his son do you suppose maam that i do not know that clives friends hate me and give themselves airs and look down upon my darling child and try and make differences between my sweet rosa and merosa who might have been dead or might have been starving but that her dear mother came to her rescue no i would never stay i loathe every day that i remain in the housei would rather beg my breadi would rather sweep the streets and starvethough thank god i have my pension as the widow of an officer in her majestys service and i can live upon thatand of that colonel newcome cannot rob me and when my darling love needs a mothers care no longer i will leave her i will shake the dust off my feet and leave that house i willand mr newcomes friends may then sneer at me and abuse me and blacken my darling childs heart towards me if they choose and i thank you mrs pendennis for all your kindness towards my daughters family and for the furniture which you have sent into the house and for the trouble you have taken about our family arrangements it was for this i took the liberty of calling upon you and i wish you a very good morning so speaking the campaigner left my wife and mrs pendennis enacted the pleasing scene with great spirit to her husband afterwards concluding the whole with a splendid curtsey and toss of the head such as mrs mackenzie performed as her parting salute  our dear colonel had fled before he had acquiesced humbly with the decree of fate and lonely old and beaten marched honestly on the path of duty it was a great blessing he wrote to us to him to think that in happier days and during many years he had been enabled to benefit his kind and excellent relative miss honeyman he could thankfully receive her hospitality now and claim the kindness and shelter which this old friend gave him no one could be more anxious to make him comfortable the air of brighton did him the greatest good he had found some old friends some old bengalees there with whom he enjoyed himself greatly etc how much did we who knew his noble spirit believe of this story to us heaven had awarded health happiness competence loving children united hearts and modest prosperity to yonder good man whose long life shone with benefactions and whose career was but kindness and honour fate decreed poverty disappointment separation a lonely old age we bowed our heads humiliated at the contrast of his lot and ours and prayed heaven to enable us to bear our present good fortune meekly and our evil days if they should come with such a resignation as this good christian showed  i forgot to say that our attempts to better thomas newcomes money affairs were quite in vain the colonel insisting upon paying over every shilling of his military allowances and retiring pension to the parties from whom he had borrowed money previous to his bankruptcy ah what a good man that is says mr sherrick with tears in his eyes what a noble fellow sir he would die rather than not pay every farthing over hed starve sir that he would the money aint mine sir or if it was do you think id take it from the poor old boy no sir by jove i honour and reverence him more now he aint got a shilling in his pocket than ever i did when we thought he was arolling in money  my wife made one or two efforts at samaritan visits in howland street but was received by mrs clive with such a faint welcome and by the campaigner with so grim a countenance so many sneers innuendoes insults almost that lauras charity was beaten back and she ceased to press good offices thus thanklessly received if clive came to visit us as he very rarely did after an official question or two regarding the health of his wife and child no further mention was made of his family affairs his painting he said was getting on tolerably well he had work scantily paid it is true but work sufficient he was reserved uncommunicative unlike the frank clive of former times and oppressed by his circumstances as it was easy to see i did not press the confidence which he was unwilling to offer and thought best to respect his silence i had a thousand affairs of my own who has not in london if you die tomorrow your dearest friend will feel for you a hearty pang of sorrow and go to his business as usual i could divine but would not care to describe the life which my poor clive was now leading the vulgar misery the sordid home the cheerless toil and lack of friendly companionship which darkened his kind soul i was glad clives father was away the colonel wrote to us twice or thrice could it be three months agobless me how time flies he was happy he wrote with miss honeyman who took the best care of him  mention has been made once or twice in the course of this history of the grey friars schoolwhere the colonel and clive and i had been brought upan ancient foundation of the time of james i still subsisting in the heart of london city the deathday of the founder of the place is still kept solemnly by cistercians in their chapel where assemble the boys of the school and the fourscore old men of the hospital the founders tomb stands a huge edifice emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy carved allegories there is an old hall a beautiful specimen of the architecture of jamess time an old hall many old halls old staircases passages old chambers decorated with old portraits walking in the midst of which we walk as it were in the early seventeenth century to others than cistercians grey friars is a dreary place possibly nevertheless the pupils educated there love to revisit it and the oldest of us grow young again for an hour or two as we come back into those scenes of childhood  the custom of the school is that on the 12th of december the founders day the head gownboy shall recite a latin oration in praise of fundatoris nostri and upon other subjects and a goodly company of old cistercians is generally brought together to attend this oration after which we go to chapel and hear a sermon after which we adjourn to a great dinner where old condisciples meet old toasts are given and speeches are made before marching from the orationhall to chapel the stewards of the days dinner according to oldfashioned rite have wands put into their hands walk to church at the head of the procession and sit there in places of honour the boys are already in their seats with smug fresh faces and shining white collars the old blackgowned pensioners are on their benches the chapel is lighted and founders tomb with its grotesque carvings monsters heraldries darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights there he lies fundator noster in his ruff and gown awaiting the great examination day we oldsters be we ever so old become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb and think how the seats are altered since we were here and how the doctornot the present doctor the doctor of our timeused to sit yonder and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys on whom it lighted and how the boy next us would kick our shins during service time and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked yonder sit forty cherrycheeked boys thinking about home and holidays tomorrow yonder sit some threescore old gentlemen pensioners of the hospital listening to the prayers and the psalms you hear them coughing feebly in the twilightthe old reverend blackgowns is codd ajax alive you wonderthe cistercian lads called these old gentlemen codds i know not whereforei know not whereforebut is old codd ajax alive i wonder or codd soldier or kind old codd gentleman or has the grave closed over them a plenty of candles lights up this chapel and this scene of age and youth and early memories and pompous death how solemn the wellremembered prayers are here uttered again in the place wherein childhood we used to hear them how beautiful and decorous the rite how noble the ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters and to which generations of fresh children and troops of bygone seniors have cried amen under those arches the service for founders day is a special one one of the psalms selected being the thirtyseventh and we hear  23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way  24 though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand  25 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  as we came to this verse i chanced to look up from my book towards the swarm of blackcoated pensioners and amongst themamongst themsate thomas newcome  his dear old head was bent down over his prayerbookthere was no mistaking him he wore the black gown of the pensioners of the hospital of grey friars his order of the bath was on his breast he stood there amongst the poor brethren uttering the responses to the psalm the steps of this good man had been ordered him hither by heavens decree to this almshouse here it was ordained that a life all love and kindness and honour should end i heard no more of prayers and psalms and sermon after that how dared i to be in a place of mark and he he yonder among the poor oh pardon you noble soul i ask forgiveness of you for being of a world that has so treated youyou my better you the honest and gentle and good i thought the service would never end or the organists voluntaries or the preachers homily  the organ played us out of chapel at length and i waited in the antechapel until the pensioners took their turn to quit it my dear dear old friend i ran to him with a warmth and eagerness of recognition which no doubt showed themselves in my face and accents as my heart was moved at the sight of him his own face flushed up when he saw me and his hand shook in mine i have found a home arthur said he dont you remember before i went to india when we came to see the old grey friars and visited captain scarsdale in his rooma poor brother like mean old peninsular man scarsdale is gone now sir and is where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest and i thought then when we saw himhere would be a place for an old fellow when his career was over to hang his sword up to humble his soul and to wait thankfully for the end arthur my good friend lord h who is a cistercian like ourselves and has just been appointed a governor gave me his first nomination dont be agitated arthur my boy i am very happy i have good quarters good food good light and fire and good friends blessed be god my dear kind young friendmy boys friend you have always been so sir and i take it uncommonly kind of you and i thank god for you sir why sir i am as happy as the day is long he uttered words to this effect as he walked through the courts of the building towards his room which in truth i found neat and comfortable with a brisk fire crackling on the hearth a little teatable laid out a bible and spectacles by the side of it and over the mantelpiece a drawing of his grandson by clive  you may come and see me here sir whenever you like and so may your dear wife and little ones tell laura with my lovebut you must not stay now you must go back to your dinner in vain i pleaded that i had no stomach for it he gave me a look which seemed to say he desired to be alone and i had to respect that order and leave him  of course i came to him on the very next day though not with my wife and children who were in truth absent in the country at rosebury where they were to pass the christmas holidays and where this schooldinner over i was to join them on my second visit to grey friars my good friend entered more at length into the reasons why he had assumed the poor brothers gown and i cannot say but that i acquiesced in his reasons and admired that noble humility and contentedness of which he gave me an example  that which had caused him most grief and pain he said in the issue of that unfortunate bank was the thought that poor friends of his had been induced by his representations to invest their little capital in that speculation good miss honeyman for instance meaning no harm and in all respects a most honest and kindlydisposed old lady had nevertheless alluded more than once to the fact that her money had been thrown away and these allusions sir made her hospitality somewhat hard to bear said the colonel at homeat poor cliveys i meanit was even worse he continued mrs mackenzie for months past by her complaints andand her conduct has made my son and me so miserablethat flight before her and into any refuge was the best course she too does not mean ill pen do not waste any of your oaths upon that poor woman he added holding up his finger and smiling sadly she thinks i deceived her though heaven knows it was myself i deceived she has great influence over rosa very few persons can resist that violent and headstrong woman sir i could not bear her reproaches or my poor sick daughter whom her mother leads almost entirely now and it was with all this grief on my mind that as i was walking one day upon brighton cliff i met my schoolfellow my lord h who has ever been a good friend of mineand who told me how he had just been appointed a governor of grey friars he asked me to dine with him on the next day and would take no refusal he knew of my pecuniary misfortunes of courseand showed himself most noble and liberal in his offers of help i was very much touched by his goodness penand made a clean breast of it to his lordship who at first would not hear of my coming to this placeand offered me out of the purse of an old brotherschoolfellow and an old brother soldier as muchas much as should last me my time wasnt it noble of him arthur god bless him there are good men in the world sir there are true friends as i have found in these later days do you know sirhere the old mans eyes twinkledthat fred bayham fixed up that bookcase yonderand brought me my little boys picture to hang up boy and clive will come and see me soon  do you mean they do not come i cried  they dont know i am here sir said the colonel with a sweet kind smile they think i am visiting his lordship in scotland ah they are good people when we had had a talk downstairs over our bottle of claretwhere my old commanderinchief would not hear of my planwe went upstairs to her ladyship who saw that her husband was disturbed and asked the reason i dare say it was the good claret that made me speak sir for i told her that i and her husband had had a dispute and that i would take her ladyship for umpire and then i told her the story over that i had paid away every rupee to the creditors and mortgaged my pensions and retiring allowances for the same end that i was a burden upon clivey who had enough poor boy to keep his own family and his wifes mother whom my imprudence had impoverishedthat here was an honourable asylum which my friend could procure for me and was not that better than to drain his purse she was very much moved sirshe is a very kind lady though she passed for being very proud and haughty in indiaso wrongly are people judged and lord h said in his rough way that by jove if tom newcome took a thing into his obstinate old head no one could drive it out and so said the colonel with his sad smile i had my own way lady h was good enough to come and see me the very next dayand do you know pen she invited me to go and live with them for the rest of my lifemade me the most generous the most delicate offers but i knew i was right and held my own i am too old to work arthur and better here whilst i am to stay than elsewhere look all this furniture came from h houseand that wardrobe is full of linen which she sent me she has been twice to see me and every officer in this hospital is as courteous to me as if i had my fine house  i thought of the psalm we had heard on the previous evening and turned to it in the opened bible and pointed to the verse though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him thomas newcome seeing my occupation laid a kind trembling hand on my shoulder and then putting on his glasses with a smile bent over the volume and who that saw him then and knew him and loved him as i didwho would not have humbled his own heart and breathed his inward prayer confessing and adoring the divine will which ordains these trials these triumphs these humiliations these blest griefs this crowning love  i had the happiness of bringing clive and his little boy to thomas newcome that evening and heard the childs cry of recognition and surprise and the old man calling the boys name as i closed the door upon that meeting and by the nights mail i went down to newcome to the friends with whom my own family was already staying  of course my consciencekeeper at rosebury was anxious to know about the schooldinner and all the speeches made and the guests assembled there but she soot ceased to inquire about these when i came to give her the news of the discovery of our dear old friend in the habit of a poor brother of grey friars she was very glad to hear that clive and his little son had been reunited to the colonel and appeared to imagine at first that there was some wonderful merit upon my part in bringing the three together  wellno great merit pen as you will put it says the confessor but it was kindly thought sirand i like my husband when he is kind best and dont wonder at your having made a stupid speech at the dinner as you say you did when you had this other subject to think of that is a beautiful psalm pen and those verses which you were reading when you saw him especially beautiful  but in the presence of eighty old gentlemen who have all come to decay and have all had to beg their bread in a manner dont you think the clergyman might choose some other psalm asks mr pendennis  they were not forsaken utterly arthur says mrs laura gravely but rather declines to argue the point raised by me namely that the selection of that especial thirtyseventh psalm was not complimentary to those decayed old gentlemen  all the psalms are good sir she says and this one of course is included and thus the discussion closed  i then fell to a description of howland street and poor clive whom i had found there over his work a dubious maid scanned my appearance rather eagerly when i asked to see him i found a picturedealer chaffering with him over a bundle of sketches and his little boy already pencil in hand lying in one corner of the room the sun playing about his yellow hair the child looked languid and pale the father worn and ill when the dealer at length took his bargains away i gradually broke my errand to clive and told him from whence i had just come  he had thought his father in scotland with lord h and was immensely moved with the news which i brought  i havent written to him for a month its not pleasant the letters i have to write pen and i cant make them pleasant up tommykin and put on your cap tommykin jumps up put on your cap and tell them to take off your pinafore tell grandmamma  at that name tommykin begins to cry  look at that says clive commencing to speak in the french language which the child interrupts by calling out in that tongue i speak also french papa  well my child you will like to come out with papa and betsy can dress you he flings off his own paintstained shootingjacket as he talks takes a frockcoat out of a carved wardrobe and a hat from a helmet on the shelf he is no longer the handsome splendid boy of old times can that be clive with that haggard face and slouched handkerchief i am not the dandy i was pen he says bitterly  a little voice is heard crying overheadand giving a kind of gasp the wretched father stops in some indifferent speech he was trying to make i cant help myself he groans out my wife is so ill she cant attend to the child mrs mackenzie manages the house for meandhere tommy tommy papa is coming tommy has been crying again and flinging open the studio door clive calls out and dashes upstairs  i hear scuffling stamping loud voices poor tommys scared little pipeclives fierce objurgations and the campaigners voice barking outdo sir do with my child suffering in the next room behave like a brute to me do he shall not go he shall not have the hathe shallahah a scream is heard it is clive tearing a childs hat out of the campaigners hands with which and a flushed face he presently rushes downstairs bearing little tommy on his shoulder  you see what i am come to pen he says with a heartbroken voice trying with hands all of a tremble to tie the hat on the boys head he laughs bitterly at the ill success of his endeavours oh you silly papa laughs tommy too  the door is flung open and the redfaced campaigner appears her face is mottled with wrath her bandeaux of hair are disarranged upon her forehead the ornaments of her cap cheap and dirty and numerous only give her a wilder appearance she is in a large and dingy wrapper very different from the lady who had presented herself a few months back to my wifehow different from the smiling mrs mackenzie of old days  he shall not go out of a winter day sir she breaks out i have his mothers orders whom you are killing mr pendennis she starts perceiving me for the first time and her breast heaves and she prepares for combat and looks at me over her shoulder  you and his father are the best judges upon this point maam said mr pendennis with a bow  the child is delicate sir cries mrs mackenzie and this winter  enough of this says clive with a stamp and passes through her guard with tommy and we descend the stairs and at length are in the free street was it not best not to describe at full length this portion of poor clives history     chapter lxxvi christmas at rosebury   we have known our friend florac under two aristocratic names and might now salute him by a third to which he was entitled although neither he nor his wife ever chose to assume it his father was lately dead and m paul de florac might sign himself duc divry if he chose but he was indifferent as to the matter and his wifes friends indignant at the idea that their kinswoman after having been a princess should descend to the rank of a mere duchess so prince and princess these good folks remained being exceptions to that order inasmuch as their friends could certainly put their trust in them  on his fathers death florac went to paris to settle the affairs of the paternal succession and having been for some time absent in his native country returned to rosebury for the winter to resume that sport of which he was a distinguished amateur he hunted in black during the ensuing season and indeed henceforth laid aside his splendid attire and his allurements as a young man his waist expanded or was no longer confined by the cestus which had given it a shape when he laid aside his black his whiskers too went into a sort of halfmourning and appeared in grey i make myself old my friend he said pathetically i have no more neither twenty years nor forty he went to rosebury church no more but with great order and sobriety drove every sunday to the neighbouring catholic chapel at c castle we had an ecclesiastic or two to dine with us at rosebury one of whom i inclined to think was floracs director  a reason perhaps for pauls altered demeanour was the presence of his mother at rosebury no politeness or respect could be greater than pauls towards the countess had she been a sovereign princess madame de florac could not have been treated with more profound courtesy than she now received from her son i think the humbleminded lady could have dispensed with some of his attentions but paul was a personage who demonstrated all his sentiments and performed his various parts in life with the greatest vigour as a man of pleasure for instance what more active roue than he as a jeune homme who could be younger and for a longer time as a country gentleman or an lhomme daffaires he insisted upon dressing each character with the most rigid accuracy and an exactitude that reminded one somewhat of bouffe or ferville at the play i wonder whether when is he quite old he will think proper to wear a pigtail like his old father at any rate that was a good part which the kind fellow was now acting of reverence towards his widowed mother and affectionate respect for her declining days he not only felt these amiable sentiments but he imparted them to his friends most freely as his wont was he used to weep freelyquite unrestrained by the presence of the domestics as english sentiment would beand when madame de florac quitted the room after dinner would squeeze my hand and tell me with streaming eyes that his mother was an angel her life has been but a long trial my friend he would say shall not i who have caused her to shed so many tears endeavour to dry some of course the friends who liked him best encouraged him in an intention so pious  the reader has already been made acquainted with this lady by the letters of hers which came into my possession some time after the events which i am at present narrating my wife through our kind friend colonel newcome had also had the honour of an introduction to madame de florac at paris and on coming to rosebury for the christmas holidays i found laura and the children greatly in favour with the good countess she treated her sons wife with a perfect though distant courtesy she was thankful to madame de moncontour for the latters great goodness to her son familiar with but very few persons she could scarcely be intimate with her homely daughterinlaw madame de moncontour stood in the greatest awe of her and to do that good lady justice admired and reverenced pauls mother with all her simple heart in truth i think almost every one had a certain awe of madame de florac except children who came to her trustingly and as it were by instinct the habitual melancholy of her eyes vanished as they lighted upon young faces and infantile smiles a sweet love beamed out of her countenance an angelic smile shone over her face as she bent towards them and caressed them her demeanour then nay her looks and ways at other timesa certain gracious sadness a sympathy with all grief and pity for all pain a gentle heart yearning towards all children and for her own especially feeling a love that was almost an anguish in the affairs of the common world only a dignified acquiescence as if her place was not in it and her thoughts were in her home elsewherethese qualities which we had seen exemplified in another life laura and her husband watched in madame de florac and we loved her because she was like our mother i see in such women the good and pure the patient and faithful the tried and meek the followers of him whose earthly life was divinely sad and tender  but good as she was to us and to all ethel newcome was the french ladys greatest favourite a bond of extreme tenderness and affection united these two the elder friend made constant visits to the younger at newcome and when miss newcome as she frequently did came to rosebury we used to see that they preferred to be alone divining and respecting the sympathy which brought those two faithful hearts together i can imagine now the two tall forms slowly pacing the garden walks or turning as they lighted on the young ones in their play what was their talk i never asked it perhaps ethel never said what was in her heart though be sure the other knew it though the grief of those they love is untold women hear it as they soothe it with unspoken consolations to see the elder lady embrace her friend as they parted was something holya sort of saintlike salutation  consulting the person from whom i had no secrets we had thought best at first not to mention to our friends the place and position in which we had found our dear colonel at least to wait for a fitting opportunity on which we might break the news to those who held him in such affection i told how clive was hard at work and hoped the best for him goodnatured madame de moncontour was easily satisfied with my replies to her questions concerning our friend ethel only asked if he and her uncle were well and once or twice made inquiries respecting rosa and her child and now it was that my wife told me what i need no longer keep secret of ethels extreme anxiety to serve her distressed relatives and how she laura had already acted as miss newcomes almoner in furnishing and hiring those apartments which ethel believed were occupied by clive and his father and wife and child and my wife further informed me with what deep grief ethel had heard of her uncles misfortune and how but that she feared to offend his pride she longed to give him assistance she had even ventured to offer to send him pecuniary help but the colonel who never mentioned the circumstance to me any other of his friends in a kind but very cold letter had declined to be beholden to his niece for help  so i may have remained some days at rosebury and the real position of the two newcomes was unknown to our friends there christmas eve was come and according to a longstanding promise ethel newcome and her two children had arrived from the park which dreary mansion since his double defeat sir barnes scarcely ever visited christmas was come and rosebury hall was decorated with holly florac did his best to welcome his friends and strove to make the meeting gay though in truth it was rather melancholy the children however were happy and they had pleasure enough in the school festival in the distribution of cloaks and blankets to the poor and in madame de moncontours gardens delightful and beautiful though the winter was there  it was only a family meeting madame de floracs widowhood not permitting her presence in large companies paul sate at his table between his mother and mrs pendennis mr pendennis opposite to him with ethel and madame de moncontour on each side the four children were placed between these personages on whom madame de florac looked with her tender glances and to whose little wants the kindest of hosts ministered with uncommon goodnature and affection he was very softhearted about children pourquoi nen avonsnous pas jeanne he quoi nen avonsnous pas he said addressing his wife by her christian name the poor little lady looked kindly at her husband and then gave a sigh and turned and heaped cake upon the plate of the child next to her no mamma or aunt ethel could interpose it was a very light wholesome cake brown made it on purpose for the children the little darlings cries the princess  the children were very happy at being allowed to sit up so late to dinner at all the kindly amusements of the day at the holly and mistletoe clustering round the lampsthe mistletoe under which the gallant florac skilled in all british usages vowed he would have his privilege but the mistletoe was clustered round the lamp the lamp was over the centre of the great round tablethe innocent gratification which he proposed to himself was denied to m paul  in the greatest excitement and goodhumour our host at the dessert made us des speech he carried a toast to the charming ethel another to the charming mistriss laura another to his good fren his brave frren his appy fren pendennisappy as possessor of such a wife appy as writer of works destined to the immortality etc etc the little children round about clapped their happy little hands and laughed and crowed in chorus and now the nursery and its guardians were about to retreat when florac said he had yet a speech yet a toastand he bade the butler pour wine into every ones glassyet a toastand he carried it to the health of our dear friends of clive and his fatherthe good the brave colonel we who are happy says he shall we not think of those who are good we who love each other shall we not remember those whom we all love he spoke with very great tenderness and feeling ma bonne mere thou too shalt drink this toast he said taking his mothers hand and kissing it she returned his caress gently and tasted the wine with her pale lips ethels head bent in silence over her glass and as for laura need i say what happened to her when the ladies went away my heart was opened to my friend florac and i told him where and how i had left my dear clives father  the frenchmans emotion on hearing this tale was such that i have loved him ever since clive in want why had he not sent to his friend grands dieux clive who had helped him in his greatest distress clives father ce preux chevalier ce parfait gentilhomme in a hundred rapid exclamations florac exhibited his sympathy asking of fate why such men as he and i were sitting surrounded by splendoursbefore golden vases crowned with flowerswith valets to kiss our feetthose were merely figures of speech in which paul expressed his prosperitywhilst our friend the colonel so much better than we spent his last days in poverty and alone  i liked florac none the less i own because that one of the conditions of the colonels present life which appeared the hardest to most people affected florac but little to be a pensioner of an ancient institution why not might not a man retire without shame to the invalides at the close of his campaigns and had not fortune conquered our old friend and age and disaster overcome him it never once entered thomas newcomes head nor clives nor floracs nor his mothers that the colonel demeaned himself at all by accepting that bounty and i recollect warrington sharing our sentiment and trowling out those noble lines of the old poet      his golden locks time hath to silver turned        o time too swift o swiftness never ceasing      his youth gainst time and age hath ever spurned        but spurned in vain youth waneth by encreasing      beauty strength youth are flowers but fading seen      duty faith love are roots and ever green       his helmet now shall make a hive for bees        and lovers songs be turned to holy psalms      a man at arms must now serve on his knees        and feed on prayers which are old ages alms   these i say respected our friend whatever was the coat he wore whereas among the colonels own kinsfolk dire was the dismay and indignation even which they expressed when they came to hear of this what they were pleased to call degradation to their family clives dear motherinlaw made outcries over the good old man as over a pauper and inquired of heaven what she had done that her blessed child should have a mendicant for a father and mrs hobson in subsequent confidential communication with the writer of these memoirs improved the occasion religiously as her wont was referred the matter to heaven too and thought fit to assume that the celestial powers had decreed this humiliation this dreadful trial for the newcome family as a warning to them all that they should not be too much puffed up with prosperity nor set their affections too much upon things of this earth had they not already received one chastisement in barness punishment and lady claras awful falling away they had taught her a lesson which the colonels lamentable errors had confirmedthe vanity of trusting in all earthly grandeurs thus it was this worthy woman plumed herself as it were on her relatives misfortunes and was pleased to think the latter were designed for the special warning and advantage of her private family but mrs hobsons philosophy is only mentioned by the way our story which is drawing to its close has to busy itself with other members of the house of the newcomes  my talk with florac lasted for some time at its close when we went to join the ladies in the drawingroom we found ethel cloaked and shawled and prepared for her departure with her young ones who were already asleep the little festival was over and had ended in melancholyeven in weeping our hostess sate in her accustomed seat by her lamp and her worktable but neglecting her needle she was having perpetual recourse to her pockethandkerchief and uttering ejaculations of pity between the intervals of her gushes of tears madame de florac was in her usual place her head cast downwards and her hands folded my wife was at her side a grave commiseration showing itself in lauras countenance whilst i read a yet deeper sadness in ethels pale face miss newcomes carriage had been announced the attendants had already carried the young ones asleep to the vehicle and she was in the act of taking leave we looked round at this disturbed party guessing very likely what the subject of their talk had been to which however miss ethel did not allude but announcing that she had intended to depart without disturbing the two gentlemen she bade us farewell and good night i wish i could say a merry christmas she added gravely but none of us i fear can hope for that it was evident that laura had told the last chapter of the colonels story  madame de floras rose up and embraced miss newcome and that farewell over she sank back on the sofa exhausted and with such an expression of affliction in her countenance that my wife ran eagerly towards her it is nothing my dear she said giving a cold hand to the younger lady and sate silent for a few moments during which we heard floracs voice without crying adieu and the wheels of miss newcomes carriage when it drove away  our host entered a moment afterwards and remarking as laura had done his mothers pallor and look of anguish went up and spoke to her with the utmost tenderness and anxiety  she gave her hand to her son and a faint blush rose up out of the past as it were and trembled upon her wan cheek he was the first friend i ever had in the world paul she said the first and the best he shall not want shall he my son  no signs of that emotion in which her daughterinlaw had been indulging were as yet visible in madame de floracs eyes but as she spoke holding her sons hand in hers the tears at length overflowed and with a sob her head fell forwards the impetuous frenchman flung himself on his knees before his mother uttered a hundred words of love and respect for her and with tears and sobs of his own called god to witness that their friend should never want and so this mother and son embraced each other and clung together in a sacred union of love before which we who had been admitted as spectators of that scene stood hushed and respectful  that night laura told me how when the ladies left us the talk had been entirely about the colonel and clive madame de florac had spoken especially and much more freely than was her wont she had told many reminiscences of thomas newcome and his early days how her father taught him mathematics when they were quite poor and living in their dear little cottage at blackheath how handsome he was then with bright eyes and long black hair flowing over his shoulders how military glory was his boyish passion and he was for ever talking of india and the famous deeds of clive and lawrence his favourite book was a history of indiathe history of orme he read it and i read it also my daughter the french lady said turning to ethel ah i may say so after so many years  ethel remembered the book as belonging to her grandmother and now in the library at newcome doubtless the same sympathy which caused me to speak about thomas newcome that evening impelled my wife likewise she told her friends as i had told florac all the colonels story and it was while these good women were under the impression of the melancholy history that florac and his guest found them  retired to our rooms laura and i talked on the same subject until the clock tolled christmas and the neighbouring church bells rang out a jubilation and looking out into the quiet night where the stars were keenly shining we committed ourselves to rest with humbled hearts praying for all those we loved a blessing of peace and goodwill     chapter lxxvii the shortest and happiest in the whole history   in the ensuing christmas morning i chanced to rise betimes and entering my dressingroom opened the windows and looked out on the soft landscape over which mists were still lying whilst the serene sky above and the lawns and leafless woods in the foreground near were still pink with sunrise the grey had not even left the west yet and i could see a star or two twinkling there to vanish with that twilight  as i looked out i saw the not very distant lodgegate open after a brief parley and a lady on horseback followed by a servant rode rapidly up to the house this early visitor was no other than miss ethel newcome the young lady espied me immediately come down come down to me this moment mr pendennis she cried out i hastened down to her supposing rightly that news of importance had brought her to rosebury so early  the news were of importance indeed look here she said read this and she took a paper from the pocket of her habit when i went home last night after madame de florac had been talking to us about ormes india i took the volumes from the bookcase and found this paper it is in my grandmothersmrs newcomeshandwriting i know it quite well it is dated on the very day of her death she had been writing and reading in her study on that very night i have often heard papa speak of the circumstance look and read you are a lawyer mr pendennis tell me about this paper  i seized it eagerly and cast my eyes over it but having read it my countenance fell  my dear miss newcome it is not worth a penny i was obliged to own  yes it is sir to honest people she cried out my brother and uncle will respect it as mrs newcomes dying wish they must respect it  the paper in question was a letter in ink that had grown yellow from time and was addressed by the late mrs newcome to my dear mr luce  that was her solicitor my solicitor still interposes miss ethel   the hermitage march 14 182  my dear mr luce the defunct lady wrotemy late husbands grandson has been staying with me lately and is a most pleasing handsome and engaging little boy he bears a strong likeness to his grandfather i think and though he has no claims upon me and i know is sufficiently provided for by his father lieutenantcolonel newcome cb of the east india companys service i am sure my late dear husband will be pleased that i should leave his grandson clive newcome a token of peace and goodwill and i can do so with the more readiness as it has pleased heaven greatly to increase my means since my husband was called away hence  i desire to bequeath a sum equal to that which mr newcome willed to my eldest son brian newcome esq to mr newcomes grandson clive newcome and furthermore that a token of my esteem and affection a ring or a piece of plate of the value of one hundred pounds be given to lieutenantcolonel thomas newcome my stepson whose excellent conduct for many years and whose repeated acts of gallantry in the service of his sovereign have long obliterated the just feelings of displeasure with which i could not but view his early disobedience and misbehaviour before he quitted england against my will and entered the military service  i beg you to prepare immediately a codicil to my will providing for the above bequests and desire that the amount of these legacies should be taken from the property bequeathed to my eldest son you will be so good as to prepare the necessary document and bring it with you when you come on saturday to yours very truly  sophia alethea newcome  tuesday night   i gave back the paper with a sigh to the finder it is but a wish of mrs newcome my dear miss ethel i said pardon me if i say i think i know your elder brother too well to supposes that he will fulfil it  he will fulfil it sir i am sure he will miss newcome said in a haughty manner he would do as much without being asked i am certain he would did he know the depth of my dear uncles misfortune barnes is in london now and  and you will write to him i know what the answer will be  i will go to him this very day mr pendennis i will go to my dear dear uncle i cannot bear to think of him in that place cried the young lady the tears starting into her honest eyes it was the will of heaven oh god be thanked for it had we found my grandmammas letter earlier barnes would have paid the legacy immediately and the money would have gone in that dreadful bankruptcy i will go to barnes today will you come with me wont you come to your old friends we may be at hisat clives house this evening and oh praise be to god there need be no more want in his family  my dear friend i will go with you round the world on such an errand i said kissing her hand how beautiful she looked the generous colour rose in her face her voice thrilled with happiness the music of christmas church bells leaped up at this moment with joyful gratulations the face of the old house before which we stood talking shone out in the morning sun  you will come i thank you i must run and tell madame de florac cried the happy young lady and we entered the house together how came you to be kissing ethels hand sir and what is the meaning of this early visit asks mrs laura as soon as i had returned to my own apartments  martha get me a carpetbag i am going to london in an hour cries mr pendennis if i had kissed ethels hand jus now delighted at the news which she brought to me was not one a thousand times dearer to me as happy as her friend i know who prayed with a thankful heart that day as we sped in the almost solitary train towards london     chapter lxxviii in which the author goes on a pleasant errand   before i parted with miss newcome at the station she made me promise to see her on the morrow at an early hour at her brothers house and having bidden her farewell and repaired to my own solitary residence which presented but a dreary aspect on that festive day i thought i would pay howland street a visit and if invited eat my christmas dinner with clive  i found my friend at home and at work still in spite of the day he had promised a pair of pictures to a dealer for the morrow he pays me pretty well and i want all the money he will give me pen the painter said rubbing on at his canvas i am pretty easy in my mind since i have become acquainted with a virtuous dealer i sell myself to him body and soul for some halfdozen pounds a week i know i can get my money and he is regularly supplied with his pictures but for roseys illness we might carry on well enough  roseys illness i was sorry to hear of that and poor clive entering into particulars told me how he had spent upon doctors rather more than a fourth of his years earnings there is a solemn fellow to whom the women have taken a fancy who lives but a few doors off in gower street and who for his last sixteen visits has taken sixteen pounds sixteen shillings out of my pocket and as if guineas grew there with the most admirable gravity he talks the fashions to my motherinlaw my poor wife hangs on every word he says look there is his carriage coming up now and there is his fee confound him says clive casting a rueful look towards a little packet lying upon the mantelpiece by the side of that skinned figure in plaster of paris which we have seen in most studios  i looked out of window and saw a certain fashionable doctor tripping out of his chariot that ladies delight who has subsequently migrated from bloomsbury to belgravia and who has his polite foot now in a thousand nurseries and boudoirs what confessors were in old times quackenboss and his like are in our protestant country what secrets they know into what mystic chambers do they not enter i suppose the campaigner made a special toilette to receive her fashionable friend for that lady attired in considerable splendour and with the precious jewel on her head which i remembered at boulogne came into the studio two minutes after the doctors visit was announced and made him a low curtsey i cannot describe the overpowering civilities of that woman  clive was very gracious and humble to her he adopted a lively air in addressing hermust work you know christmas day and allfor the owner of the pictures will call for them in the morning bring me a good report about rosey mrs mackenzie pleaseand if you will have the kindness to look by the ecorche there you will see that little packet which i have left for you mrs mack advancing took the money i thought that plaster of paris figure was not the only ecorche in the room  i want you to stay to dinner you must stay pen please cried clive and be civil to her will you my dear old father is coming to dine here they fancy that he has lodgings at the other end of the town and that his brothers do something for him not a word about grey friars it might agitate rosa you know ah isnt he noble the dear old boy and isnt it fine to see him in that place clive worked on as he talked using up the last remnant of the light of christmas day and was cleaning his palette and brushes when mrs mackenzie returned to us  darling rosey was very delicate but doctor quackenboss was going to give her the very same medicine which had done the charming young duchess of clackmannanshire so much good and he was not in the least disquiet  on this i cut into the conversation with anecdotes concerning the family of the duchess of clackmannanshire remembering early days when it used to be my sport to entertain the campaigner with anecdotes of the aristocracy about whose proceedings she still maintained a laudable curiosity indeed one of few the books escaped out of the wreck of tyburn gardens was a peerage now a wellworn volume much read by rosa and her mother  the anecdotes were very politely receivedperhaps it was the season which made mrs mack and her soninlaw on more than ordinarily good terms when turning to the campaigner clive said he wished that she could persuade me to stay to dinner she acquiesced graciously and at once in that proposal and vowed that her daughter would be delighted if i could condescend to eat their humble fare it is not such a dinner as you have seen at her house with six sidedishes two flanks that splendid epergne and the silver dishes top and bottom but such as my rosa has she offers with a willing heart cries the campaigner  and tom may sit to dinner maynt he grandmamma asks clive in a humble voice  oh if you wish it sir  his grandfather will like to sit by him said clive i will go out and meet him he comes through guildford street and russell square says clive will you walk pen  oh pray dont let us detain you says mrs mackenzie with a toss of her head and when she retreated clive whispered that she would not want me for she looked to the roasting of the beef and the making of the pudding and the mincepie  i thought she might have a finger in it i said and we set forth to meet the dear old father who presently came walking very slowly along the line by which we expected him his stick trembled as it fell on the pavement so did his voice as he called out clives name so did his hand as he stretched it to me his body was bent and feeble twenty years had not weakened him so much as the last score of months i walked by the side of my two friends as they went onwards linked lovingly together how i longed for the morrow and hoped they might be united once more thomas newcomes voice once so grave went up to a treble and became almost childish as he asked after boy his white hair hung over his collar i could see it by the gas under which we walkedand clives great back and arm as his father leaned on it and his brave face turned towards the old man oh barnes newcome barnes newcome be an honest man for once and help your kinsfolk thought i  the christmas meal went off in a friendly manner enough the campaigners eyes were everywhere it was evident that the little maid who served the dinner and had cooked a portion of it under their keen supervision cowered under them as well as other folks mrs mack did not make more than ten allusions to former splendours during the entertainment or half as many apologies to me for sitting down to a table very different from that to which i was accustomed good faithful f bayham was the only other guest he complimented the mincepies so that mrs mackenzie owned she had made them the colonel was very silent but he tried to feed boy and was only once or twice sternly corrected by the campaigner boy in the best little words he could muster asked why grandpapa wore a black cloak clive nudged my foot under the table the secret of the poor brothership was very nearly out the colonel blushed and with great presence of mind said he wore a cloak to keep him warm in winter  rosey did not say much she had grown lean and languid the light of her eyes had gone out all her pretty freshness had faded she ate scarce anything though her mother pressed her eagerly and whispered loudly that a woman in her situation ought to strengthen herself poor rosey was always in a situation  when the cloth was withdrawn the colonel bending his head said thank god for what we have received so reverently and with an accent so touching that fred bayhams big eyes as he turned towards the old man filled up with tears when his mother and grandmother rose to go away poor little boy cried to stay longer and the colonel would have meekly interposed but the domineering campaigner cried nonsense let him go to bed and flounced him out of the room and nobody appealed against that sentence then we three remained and strove to talk as cheerfully as we might speaking now of old times and presently of new without the slightest affectation thomas newcome told us that his life was comfortable and that he was happy in it he wished that many others of the old gentlemen he said were as contented as himself but some of them grumbled sadly he owned and quarrelled with their breadandbutter he for his part had everything he could desire all the officers of the establishment were most kind to him an excellent physician came to him when wanted a most attentive woman waited on him and if i wear a black gown said he is not that uniform as good as another and if we have to go to church every day at which some of the poor brothers grumble i think an old fellow cant do better and i can say my prayers with a thankful heart clivey my boy and should be quite happy but for myfor my past imprudence god forgive me think of bayham here coming to our chapel todayhe often comesthat was very right sirvery right  clive filling a glass of wine looked at f b with eyes that said god bless you f b gulped down another bumper it is almost a merry christmas said i and oh i hope it will be a happy new year  shortly after nine oclock the colonel rose to depart saying he must be in barracks by ten and clive and f b went a part of the way with him i would have followed them but he whispered me to stay and talk to mrs mack for heavens sake and that he would be back ere long so i went and took tea with the two ladies and as we drank it mrs mackenzie took occasion to tell me she did not know what amount of income the colonel had from his wealthy brother but that they never received any benefit from it and again she computed to me all the sums principal and interest which ought at that moment to belong to her darling rosey rosey now and again made a feeble remark she did not seem pleased or sorry when her husband came in and presently dropping me a little curtsey went to bed under charge of the campaigner so bayham and i and clive retired to the studio where smoking was allowed and where we brought that christmas day to an end  at the appointed time on the next forenoon i called upon miss newcome at her brothers house sir barnes newcome was quitting his own door as i entered it and he eyed me with such a severe countenance as made me augur but ill of the business upon which i came the expression of ethels face was scarcely more cheering she was standing at the window sternly looking at sir barnes who yet lingered at his own threshold having some altercation with his cabboy ere he mounted his vehicle to drive into the city  miss newcome was very pale when she advanced and gave me her hand i looked with some alarm into her face and inquired what news  it is as you expected mr pendennis she saidnot as i did my brother is averse to making restitution he just now parted from me in some anger but it does not matter the restitution must be made if not by barnes by one of our familymust it not  god bless you for a noble creature my dear dear miss newcome was all i could say  for doing what is right ought i not to do it i am the eldest of our family after barnes i am the richest after him our father left all his younger children the very sum of money which mrs newcome here devises to clive and you know besides i have all my grandmothers lady kews property why i dont think i could sleep if this act of justice were not done will you come with me to my lawyers he and my brother barnes are trustees of my property and i have been thinking dear mr pendennisand you are very good to be so kind and to express so kind an opinion of me and you and laura have always always been the best friends to meshe says this taking one of my hands and placing her other hand over iti have been thinking you know that this transfer had better be made through mr luce you understand and as coming from the family and then i need not appear in it at all you see andand my dear good uncles pride need not be wounded she fairly gave way to tears as she spokeand for me i longed to kiss the hem of her robe or anything else she would let me embrace i was so happy and so touched by the simple demeanour and affection of the noble young lady  dear ethel i said did i not say i would go to the end of the world with youand wont i go to lincolns inn  a cab was straightway sent for and in another halfhour we were in the presence of the courtly little old mr luce in his chambers in lincolns inn fields  he knew the late mrs newcomes handwriting at once he remembered having seen the little boy at the hermitage had talked with mr newcome regarding his son in india and had even encouraged mrs newcome in her idea of leaving some token of goodwill to the latter i was to have dined with your grandmamma on the saturday with my poor wife why bless my soul i remember the circumstance perfectly well my dear young lady there cant be a doubt about the letter but of course the bequest is no bequest at all and colonel newcome has behaved so ill to your brother that i suppose sir barnes will not go out of his way to benefit the colonel  what would you do mr luce asks the young lady  hm and pray why should i tell you what i should do under the circumstances replied the little lawyer upon my word miss newcome i think i should leave matters as they stand sir barnes and i you are aware are not the very best of friendsas your fathers your grandmothers old friend and adviser your own too my dear young lady i and sir barnes newcome remain on civil terms but neither is over much pleased with the other to say the truth and at any rate i cannot be accusednor can any one else that i know ofof being a very warm partisan of your brothers but candidly were his case minehad i a relation who had called me unpleasant names and threatened me i dont know with what with sword and pistolwho had put me to five or six thousand pounds expense in contesting an election which i had losti should give him i think no more than the law obliged me to give him and that my dear miss newcome is not one farthing  i am very glad you say so said miss newcome rather to my astonishment  of course my dear young lady and so you need not be alarmed at showing your brother this document is not that the point about which you came to consult me you wished that i should prepare him for the awful disclosure did you not you know perhaps that he does not like to part with his money and thought the appearance of this note might agitate him it has been a long time coming to its address but nothing can be done dont you see and be sure sir barnes newcome will not be the least agitated when i tell him its contents  i mean i am very glad you think my brother is not called upon to obey mrs newcomes wishes because i need not think so hardly of him as i was disposed to do miss newcome said i showed him the paper this morning and he repelled it with scorn and not kind words passed between us mr luce and unkind thoughts remained in my mind but if he you think is justified it is i who have been in the wrong for saying that he was selffor upbraiding him as i own i did  you called him selfishyou had words with him such things have happened before my dear miss newcome in the bestregulated families  but if he is not wrong sir holding his opinions surely i should be wrong sir with mine not to do as my conscience tells me and having found this paper only yesterday at newcome in the library there in one of my grandmothers books i consulted with this gentleman the husband of my dearest friend mrs pendennisthe most intimate friend of my uncle and cousin clive and i wish and i desire and insist that my share of what my poor father left us girls should be given to my cousin mr clive newcome in accordance with my grandmothers dying wishes  my dear you gave away your portion to your brothers and sisters ever so long ago cried the lawyer  i desire sir that six thousand pounds may be given to my cousin miss newcome said blushing deeply my dear uncle the best man in the world whom i love with all my heart sir is in the most dreadful poverty do you know where he is sir my dear kind generous uncleand kindling as she spoke and with eyes beaming a bright kindness and flushing cheeks and a voice that thrilled to the heart of those two who heard her miss newcome went on to tell of her uncles and cousins misfortunes and of her wish under god to relieve them i see before me now the figure of the noble girl as she speaks the pleased little old lawyer bobbing his white head looking up at her with his twinkling eyespatting his knees patting his snuffboxas he sits before his tapes and his deeds surrounded by a great background of tin boxes  and i understand you want this money paid as coming from the family and not from miss newcome says mr luce  coming from the familyexactly answers miss newcome  mr luce rose up from his old chairhis wornout old horsehair chairwhere he had sat for half a century and listened to many a speaker very different from this one mr pendennis he said i envy you your journey along with this young lady i envy you the good news you are going to carry to your friendsand miss newcome as i am an oldold gentleman who have known your family these sixty years and saw your father in his longclothes may i tell you how heartily and sincerely ii love and respect you my dear when should you wish mr clive newcome to have his legacy  i think i should like mr pendennis to have it this instant mr luce please said the young ladyand her veil dropped over her face as she bent her head down and clasped her hands together for a moment as if she was praying  mr luce laughed at her impetuosity but said that if she was bent upon having the money it was at her instant service and before we left the room mr luce prepared a letter addressed to clive newcome esquire in which he stated that amongst the books of the late mrs newcome a paper had only just been found of which a copy was enclosed and that the family of the late sir brian newcome desirous to do honour to the wishes of the late mrs newcome had placed the sum of 6000 pounds at the bank of messrs h w at the disposal of mr clive newcome of whom mr luce had the honour to sign himself the most obedient servant etc and the letter approved and copied mr luce said mr pendennis might be the postman thereof if miss newcome so willed it and with this document in my pocket i quitted the lawyers chambers with my good and beautiful young companion  our cab had been waiting several hours in lincolns inn fields and i asked miss ethel whither i now should conduct her  where is grey friars she said maynt i go to see my uncle     chapter lxxix in which old friends come together   we made the descent of snowhill we passed by the miry pens of smithfield we travel through the street of st john and presently reach the ancient gateway in cistercian square where lies the old hospital of grey friars i passed through the gate my fair young companion on my arm and made my way to the rooms occupied by brother newcome  as we traversed the court the poor brothers were coming from dinner a couple of score or more of old gentlemen in black gowns issued from the door of their refectory and separated over the court betaking themselves to their chambers ethels arm trembled under mine as she looked at one and another expecting to behold her dear uncles familiar features but he was not among the brethren we went to his chamber of which the door was open a female attendant was arranging the room she told us colonel newcome was out for the day and thus our journey had been made in vain  ethel went round the apartment and surveyed its simple decorations she looked at the pictures of clive and his boy the two sabres crossed over the mantelpiece the bible laid on the table by the old latticed window she walked slowly up to the humble bed and sat down on a chair near it no doubt her heart prayed for him who slept there she turned round where his black pensioners cloak was hanging on the wall and lifted up the homely garment and kissed it the servant looked on admiring i should think her melancholy and her gracious beauty i whispered to the woman that the young lady was the colonels niece he has a son who comes here and is very handsome too said the attendant  the two women spoke together for a while oh miss cried the elder and humbler evidently astonished at some gratuity which miss newcome bestowed upon her i didnt want this to be good to him everybody here loves him for himself and i would sit up for him for weeksthat i would  my companion took a pencil from her bag and wrote ethel on a piece of paper and laid the paper on the bible darkness had again fallen by this time feeble lights were twinkling in the chamber windows of the poor brethren as we issued into the courtsfeeble lights illumining a dim grey melancholy old scene many a career once bright was flickering out here in the darkness many a night was closing in we went away silently from that quiet place and in another minute were in the flare and din and tumult of london  the colonel is most likely gone to clives i said would not miss newcome follow him thither we consulted whether she should go she took heart and said yes drive cabman to howland street the horse was no doubt tired for the journey seemed extraordinarily long i think neither of us spoke a word on the way  i ran upstairs to prepare our friends for the visit clive his wife his father and his motherinlaw were seated by a dim light in mrs clives sittingroom rosey on the sofa as usual the little boy on his grandfathers knees  i hardly made a bow to the ladies so eager was i to communicate with colonel newcome i have just been to your quarters at grey friars sir said i that is  you have been to the hospital sir you need not be ashamed to mention it as colonel newcome is not ashamed to go there cried out the campaigner pray speak in your own language clive unless there is something not fit for ladies to hear clive was growling out to me in german that there had just been a terrible scene his father having a quarter of an hour previously let slip the secret about grey friars  say at once clive the campaigner cried rising in her might and extending a great strong arm over her helpless child that colonel newcome owns that he has gone to live as a pauper in a hospital he who has squandered his own money he who has squandered my money he who has squandered the money of that darling helpless childcompose yourself rosey my lovehas completed the disgrace of the family by his present mean and unworthyyes i say mean and unworthy and degraded conduct oh my child my blessed child to think that your husbands father should have come to a workhouse whilst this maternal agony bursts over her rosa on the sofa bleats and whimpers amongst the faded chintz cushions  i took clives hand which was cast up to his head striking his forehead with mad impotent rage whilst this fiend of a woman lashed his good father the veins of his great fist were swollen his whole body was throbbing and trembling with the helpless pain under which he writhed colonel newcomes friends maam i said think very differently from you and that he is a better judge than you or any one else of his own honour we all who loved him in his prosperity love and respect him more than ever for the manner in which he bears his misfortune do you suppose that his noble friend the earl of h would have counselled him to a step unworthy of a gentleman that the prince de moncontour would applaud his conduct as he does if he did not think it admirable i can hardly say with what scorn i used this argument or what depth of contempt i felt for the woman whom i knew it would influence and at this minute i added i have come from visiting the gray friars with one of the colonels relatives whose love and respect for him is boundless who longs to be reconciled to him and who is waiting below eager to shake his hand and embrace clives wife  who is that says the colonel looking gently up as he pats boys head  who is it pen says clive i said in a low voice ethel and starting up and crying ethel ethel he ran from the room  little mrs rosa started up too on her sofa clutching hold of the tablecover with her lean hand and the two red spots on her cheeks burning more fiercely than ever i could see what passion was beating in that poor little heart heaven help us what a restingplace had friends and parents prepared for it for shame  miss newcome is it my darling rosa get on your shawl cried the campaigner a grim smile lighting her face  it is ethel ethel is my niece i used to love her when she was quite a little girl says the colonel patting boy on the head and she is a very good beautiful little childa very good child the torture had been too much for that kind old heart there were times when thomas newcome passed beyond it what still maddened clive excited his father no more the pain yonder woman inflicted only felled and stupefied him  as the door opened the little whiteheaded child trotted forward towards the visitor and ethel entered on clives arm who was as haggard and pale as death little boy looking up at the stately lady still followed beside her as she approached her uncle who remained sitting his head bent to the ground his thoughts were elsewhere indeed he was following the child and about to caress it again  here is a friend father says clive laying a hand on the old mans shoulder it is i ethel uncle the young lady said taking his hand and kneeling down between his knees she flung her arms round him and kissed him and wept on his shoulder  his consciousness had quite returned ere an instant was over he embraced her with the warmth of his old affection uttering many brief words of love kindness and tenderness such as men speak when strongly moved  the little boy had come wondering up to the chair whilst this embrace took place and clives tall figure bent over the three rosas eyes were not good to look at as she stared at the group with a ghastly smile mrs mackenzie surveyed the scene in haughty state from behind the sofa cushions she tried to take one of rosas lean hot hands the poor child tore it away leaving her rings behind her lifted her hands to her face and cried cried as if her little heart would break ah me what a story was there what an outburst of pentup feeling what a passion of pain the ring had fallen to the ground the little boy crept towards it and picked it up and came towards his mother fixing on her his large wondering eyes mamma crying mammas ring he said holding up the circle of gold with more feeling than i had ever seen her exhibit she clasped the boy in her wasted arms great heaven what passion jealousy grief despair were tearing and trying all these hearts that but for fate might have been happy  clive went round and with the utmost sweetness and tenderness hanging round his child and wife soothed her with words of consolation that in truth i scarce heard being ashamed almost of being present at this sudden scene no one however took notice of the witnesses and even mrs mackenzies voice was silent for the moment i dare say clives words were incoherent but women have more presence of mind and now ethel with a noble grace which i cannot attempt to describe going up to rosa seated herself by her spoke of her long grief at the differences between her dearest uncle and herself of her early days when he had been as a father to her of her wish her hope that rosa should love her as a sister and of her belief that better days and happiness were in store for them all and she spoke to the mother about her boy so beautiful and intelligent and told her how she had brought up her brothers children and hoped that this one too would call her aunt ethel she would not stay now might she come again would rosa come to her with her little boy would he kiss her he did so with a very good grace but when ethel at parting embraced the childs mother rosas face wore a smile ghastly to look at and the lips that touched ethels cheeks were quite white  i shall come and see you again tomorrow uncle may i not i saw your room today sir and your housekeeper such a nice old lady and your black gown and you shall put it on tomorrow and walk with me and show me the beautiful old buildings of that old hospital and i shall come and make tea for you the housekeeper says i may will you come down with me to my carriage no mr pendennis must come and she quitted the room beckoning me after her you will speak to clive now wont you she said and come to me this evening and tell me all before you go to bed i went back anxious in truth to the messenger of good tidings to my dear old friends  brief as my absence had been mrs mackenzie had taken advantage of that moment again to outrage clive and his father and to announce that rosa might go to see this miss newcome whom people respected because she was rich but whom she would never visit no never an insolent proud impertinent thing does she take me for a housemaid mrs mackenzie had inquired  am i dust to be trampled beneath her feet am i a dog that she cant throw me a word her arms were stretched out and she was making this inquiry as to her own canine qualities as i reentered the room and remembered that ethel had never once addressed a single word to mrs mackenzie in the course of her visit  i affected not to perceive the incident and presently said that i wanted to speak to clive in his studio knowing that i had brought my friend one or two commissions for drawings mrs mackenzie was civil to me and did not object to our colloquies  will you come too and smoke a pipe father says clive  of course your father intends to stay to dinner says the campaigner with a scornful toss of her head clive groaned out as we were on the stair that he could not bear this much longer by heavens he could not  give the colonel his pipe clive said i now sir down with you in the sitters chair and smoke the sweetest cheroot you ever smoked in your life my dear dear old clive you need not bear with the campaigner any longer you may go to bed without this nightmare tonight if you like you may have your father back under your roof again  my dear arthur i must be back at ten sir back at ten military time drum beats nobell tolls at ten and gates close and he laughed and shook his old head besides i am to see a young lady sir and she is coming to make tea for me and i must speak to mrs jones to have all things readyall things ready and again the old man laughed as he spoke  his son looked at him and then at me with eyes full of sad meaning how do you mean arthur clive said that he can come and stay with me and that that woman can go  then feeling in my pocket for mr luces letter i grasped my dear clive by the hand and bade him prepare for good news i told him how providentially two days since ethel in the library at newcome looking into ormes history of india a book which old mrs newcome had been reading on the night of her death had discovered a paper of which the accompanying letter enclosed a copy and i gave my friend the letter  he opened it and read it through i cannot say that i saw any particular expression of wonder in his countenance for somehow all the while clive perused this document i was looking at the colonels sweet kind face itit is ethels doing said clive in a hurried voice there was no such letter  upon my honour i answered there was we came up to london with it last night a few hours after she had found it we showed it to sir barnes newcome whowho could not disown it we took it to mr luce who recognised it at once who was old mrs newcomes man of business and continues to be the family lawyer and the family recognises the legacy and has paid it and you may draw for it tomorrow as you see what a piece of good luck it is that it did not come before the b b c time that confounded bundelcund bank would have swallowed up this like all the rest  father father do you remember ormes history of india cries clive  ormes history of course i do i could repeat whole pages of it when i was a boy says the old man and began forthwith the two battalions advanced against each other cannonading until the french coming to a hollow way imagined that the english would not venture to pass it but major lawrence ordered the sepoys and artillerythe sepoys and artillery to halt and defend the convoy against the morattoesmorattoes orme calls em ho ho i could repeat whole pages sir  it is the best book that ever was written calls out clive the colonel said he had not read it but he was informed mr mills was a very learned history he intended to read it eh there is plenty of time now said the good colonel i have all day long at grey friarsafter chapel you know do you know sir when i was a boy i used what they call to tib out and run down to a publichouse in cistercian lanethe red cowl sirand buy rum there i was a terrible wild boy clivy you werent so sir thank heaven a terrible wild boy and my poor father flogged me though i think it was very hard on me it wasnt the pain you know it wasnt the pain but here tears came into his eyes and he dropped his head on his hand and the cigar from it fell on to the floor burnt almost out and scattering white ashes  clive looked sadly at me he was often so at boulogne arthur he whispered after a scene with thatthat woman yonder his head would go he never replied to her taunts he bore her infernal cruelty without an unkind wordoh i pay her back thank god i can pay her but who shall pay her he said trembling in every limb for what she has made that good man suffer  he turned to his father who still sate lost in his meditations you need never go back to grey friars father he cried out  not go back clivy must go back boy to say adsum when my name is called newcome adsum hey that is what we used to saywe used to say  you need not go back except to pack your things and return and live with me and boy clive continued and he told colonel newcome rapidly the story of the legacy the old man seemed hardly to comprehend it when he did the news scarcely elated him when clive said they could now pay mrs mackenzie the colonel replied quite right quite right and added up the sum principal and interest in which they were indebted to herhe knew it well enough the good old man of course we shall pay her clivy when we can but in spite of what clive had said he did not appear to understand the fact that the debt to mrs mackenzie was now actually to be paid  as we were talking a knock came to the studio door and that summons was followed by the entrance of the maid who said to clive if you please sir mrs mackenzie says how long are you agoing to keep the dinner waiting  come father come to dinner cries clive and pen you will come too wont you he added it may be the last time you dine in such pleasant company come along he whispered hurriedly i should like you to be there it will keep her tongue quiet as we proceeded to the diningroom i gave the colonel my arm and the good man prattled to me something about mrs mackenzie having taken shares in the bundelcund banking company and about her not being a woman of business and fancying we had spent her money and i have always felt a wish that clivy should pay her and he will pay her i know he will says the colonel and then we shall lead a quiet life arthur for between ourselves some women are the deuce when they are angry sir and again he laughed as he told me this sly news and he bowed meekly his gentle old head as we entered the diningroom  that apartment was occupied by little boy already seated in his high chair and by the campaigner only who stood at the mantelpiece in a majestic attitude on parting with her before we adjourned to clives studio i had made my bow and taken my leave in form not supposing that i was about to enjoy her hospitality yet once again my return did not seem to please her does mr pendennis favour us with his company to dinner again clive she said turning to her soninlaw clive curtly said yes he had asked mr pendennis to stay  you might at least have been so kind as to give me notice says the campaigner still majestic but ironical you will have but a poor meal mr pendennis and one such as im not accustomed to give my guests  cold beef what the deuce does it matter says clive beginning to carve the joint which hot had served our yesterdays christmas table  it does matter sir i am not accustomed to treat my guests in this way maria who had been cutting that beef three pounds of that beef have been cut away since one oclock today and with flashing eyes and a finger twinkling all over with rings she pointed towards the guilty joint  whether maria had been dispensing secret charities or kept company with an occult policeman partial to roastbeef i do not know but she looked very much alarmed and said indeed and indeed mum she had not touched a morsel of itnot she  confound the beef says clive carving on  she has been cutting it cries the campaigner bringing her fist down with a thump upon the table mr pendennis you saw the beef yesterday eighteen pounds it weighed and this is what comes up of it as if there was not already ruin enough in the house  dn the beef cries out clive  no no thank god for our good dinner benedicti benedicamus clivy my boy says the colonel in a tremulous voice  swear on sir let the child hear your oaths let my blessed child who is too ill to sit at table and picks her bite sweetbread on her sofawhich her poor mother prepares for her mr pendenniswhich i cooked it and gave it to her with these handslet her hear your curses and blasphemies clive newcome they are loud enough  do let us have a quiet life groans out clive and for me i must confess i kept my eyes steadily down upon my plate nor dared to lift them until my portion of cold beef had vanished  no further outbreak took place until the appearance of the second course which consisted as the ingenious reader may suppose of the plumpudding now in a grilled state and the remanent of mincepies from yesterdays meal maria i thought looked particularly guilty as these delicacies were placed on the table she set them down hastily and was for operating an instant retreat  but the campaigner shrieked after her who has eaten that pudding i insist upon knowing who has eaten it i saw it at two oclock when i went down to the kitchen and fried a bit for my darling child and theres pounds of it gone since then there were five mincepies mr pendennis you saw yourself there were five that went away from table yesterdaywheres the other two maria you leave the house this night you thieving wicked wretchand ill thank you to come back to me afterwards for a character thirteen servants have we had in nine months mr pendennis and this girl is the worst of them all and the greatest liar and the greatest thief  at this charge the outraged maria stood up in arms and as the phrase is gave the campaigner as good as she got go wouldnt she go pay her her wages and let her go out of that ell upon hearth was marias prayer it isnt you sir she said turning to clive you are good enough and works hard enough to git the guineas which you give out to pay that doctor and she dont pay himand i see five of them in her purse wrapped up in paper myself i did and she abuses you to himand i heard her and jane black who was here before told me she heard her go wont i just go i dispises your puddens and pies and with a laugh of scorn this rude maria snapped her black fingers in the immediate vicinity of the campaigners nose  i will pay her her wages and she shall go this instant says mrs mackenzie taking her purse out  pay me with them suvverings that you have got in it wrapped up in paper see if she havent mr newcome the refractory waitingwoman cried out and again she laughed a strident laugh  mrs mackenzie briskly shut her portemonnaie and rose up from table quivering with indignant virtue go she exclaimed go and pack your trunks this instant you quit the house this night and a policeman shall see to your boxes before you leave it  whilst uttering this sentence against the guilty maria the campaigner had intended no doubt to replace her purse in her pocketa handsome filagree gimcrack of poor rosss one of the relics of former splendoursbut agitated by marias insolence the trembling hand missed the mark and the purse fell to the ground  maria dashed at the purse in a moment with a scream of laughter shook its contents upon the table and sure enough five little packets wrapped in paper rolled out upon the cloth besides banknotes and silver and golden coin im to go am i im a thief am i screamed the girl clapping her hands i sor em yesterday when i was alacing of her and thought of that pore young man working night and day to get the moneyme a thief indeedi despise you and i give you warning  do you wish to see me any longer insulted by this woman clive mr pendennis i am shocked that you should witness such horrible vulgarity cries the campaigner turning to her guest does the wretched creature suppose that i i who have given thousands i who have denied myself everything i who have spent my all in support of this house and colonel newcome knows whether i have given thousands or not and who has spent them and who has been robbed i say and  here you maria go about your business shouted out clive newcome starting up go and pack your trunks if you like and pack this womans trunks too mrs mackenzie i can bear you no more go in peace and if you wish to see your daughter she shall come to you but i will never so help me god sleep under the same roof with you or break the same crust with you or bear your infernal cruelty or sit to hear my father insulted or listen to your wicked pride and folly more there has not been a day since you thrust your cursed foot into our wretched house but you have tortured one and all of us look here at the best gentleman and the kindest heart in all the world you fiend and see to what a condition you have brought him dearest father she is going do you hear she leaves us and you will come back to me wont you great god woman he gasped out do you know what you have made me sufferwhat you have done to this good man pardon father pardonand he sank down by his fathers side sobbing with passionate emotion the old man even now did not seem to comprehend the scene when he heard that womans voice in anger a sort of stupor came over him  i am a fiend am i cries the lady you hear mr pendennis this is the language to which i am accustomed i am a widow and i trusted my child and my all to that old man he robbed me and my darling of almost every farthing we had and what has been my return for such baseness i have lived in this house and toiled like a slave i have acted as servant to my blessed child night after night i have sat with her and month after month when her husband has been away i have nursed that poor innocent and the father having robbed me the son turns me out of doors  a sad thing it was to witness and a painful proof how frequent were these battles that as this one raged the poor little boy sat almost careless whilst his bewildered grandfather stroked his golden head it is quite clear to me madam i said turning to mrs mackenzie that you and your soninlaw are better apart and i came to tell him today of a most fortunate legacy which has been left to him and which will enable him to pay you tomorrow morning every shilling every shilling which he does not owe you  i will not leave this house until i am paid every shilling of which i have been robbed hissed out mrs mackenzie and she sat down folding her arms across her chest  i am sorry groaned out clive wiping the sweat off his brow i used a harsh word i will never sleep under the same roof with you tomorrow i will pay you what you claim and the best chance i have of forgiving you the evil which you have done me is that we never should meet again will you give me a bed at your house arthur father will you come out and walk good night mrs mackenzie pendennis will settle with you in the morning you will not be here if you please when i return and so god forgive you and farewell  mrs mackenzie in a tragic manner dashed aside the hand which poor clive held out to her and disappeared from the scene of this dismal dinner boy presently fell acrying in spite of all the battle and fury there was sleep in his eyes  maria is too busy i suppose to put him to bed said clive with a sad smile shall we do it father come tommy my son and he folded his arms round the child and walked with him to the upper regions the old mans eyes lighted up his seared thoughts returned to him he followed his two children up the stairs and saw his grandson in his little bed and as we walked home with him he told me how sweetly boy said our father and prayed god bless all those who loved him as they laid him to rest  so these three generations had joined in that supplication the strong man humbled by trial and grief whose loyal heart was yet full of lovethe child of the sweet age of those little ones whom the blessed speaker of the prayer first bade to come unto himand the old man whose heart was wellnigh as tender and as innocent and whose day was approaching when he should be drawn to the bosom of the eternal pity     chapter lxxx in which the colonel says adsum when his name is called   the vow which clive had uttered never to share bread with his motherinlaw or sleep under the same roof with her was broken on the very next day a stronger will than the young mans intervened and he had to confess the impotence of his wrath before that superior power in the forenoon of the day following that unlucky dinner i went with my friend to the bankinghouse whither mr luces letter directed us and carried away with me the principal sum in which the campaigner said colonel newcome was indebted to her with the interest accurately computed and reimbursed clive went off with a pocketful of money to the dear old poor brother of grey friars and he promised to return with his father and dine with my wife in queen square i had received a letter from laura by the mornings post announcing her return by the express train from newcome and desiring that a spare bedroom should be got ready for a friend who accompanied her  on reaching howland street clives door was opened rather to my surprise by the rebellious maidservant who had received her dismissal on the previous night and the doctors carriage drove up as she was still speaking to me the polite practitioner sped upstairs to mrs newcomes apartment mrs mackenzie in a robedechambre and cap very different from yesterdays came out eagerly to meet the physician on the landing ere they had been a quarter of an hour together arrived a cab which discharged an elderly person with her bandbox and bundles i had no difficulty in recognising a professional nurse in the newcomer she too disappeared into the sickroom and left me sitting in the neighbouring chamber the scene of the last nights quarrel  hither presently came to me maria the maid she said she had not the heart to go away now she was wanted that they had passed a sad night and that no one had been to bed master tommy was below and the landlady taking care of him the landlord had gone out for the nurse mrs clive had been taken bad after mr clive went away the night before mrs mackenzie had gone to the poor young thing and there she went on crying and screaming and stamping as she used to do in her tantrums which was most cruel of her and made mrs clive so ill and presently the young lady began my informant told me she came screaming into the sittingroom her hair over her shoulders calling out she was deserted deserted and would like to die she was like a mad woman for some time she had fit after fit of hysterics and there was her mother kneeling and crying and calling out to her darling child to calm herselfwhich it was all her own doing and she had much better have held her own tongue remarked the resolute maria i understood only too well from the girls account what had happened and that clive if resolved to part with his motherinlaw should not have left her even for twelve hours in possession of his house the wretched woman whose self was always predominant and who though she loved her daughter after her own fashion never forgot her own vanity or passion had improved the occasion of clives absence worked upon her childs weakness jealousy illhealth and driven her no doubt into the fever which yonder physician was called to quell  the doctor presently enters to write a prescription followed by clives motherinlaw who had cast rosas fine cashmere shawl over her shoulders to hide her disarray you here still mr pendennis she exclaims she knew i was there had not she changed her dress in order to receive me  i have to speak to you for two minutes on important business and then i shall go i replied gravely  oh sir to what a scene you have come to what a state has clives conduct last night driven my darling child  as the odious woman spoke so the doctors keen eyes looking up from the prescription caught mine i declare before heaven madam i said hotly i believe you yourself are the cause of your daughters present illness as you have been of the misery of my friends  is this sir she was breaking out is this language to be used to  madam will you be silent i said i am come to bid you farewell on the part of those whom your temper has driven into infernal torture i am come to pay you every halfpenny of the sum which my friends do not owe you but which they restore here is the account and here is the money to settle it and i take this gentleman to witness to whom no doubt you have imparted what you call your wrongs the doctor smiled and shrugged his shoulders that now you are paid  a widowa poor lonely insulted widow cries the campaigner with trembling hands taking possession of the notes  and i wish to know i continued when my friends house will be free to him and he can return in peace  here rosas voice was heard from the inner apartment screaming mamma mamma  i go to my child sir she said if captain mackenzie had been alive you would not have dared to insult me so and carrying off her money she left us  cannot she be got out of the house i said to the doctor my friend will never return until she leaves it it is my belief she is the cause of her daughters present illness  not altogether my dear sir mrs newcome was in a very very delicate state of health her mother is a lady of impetuous temper who expresses herself very stronglytoo strongly i own in consequence of unpleasant family discussions which no physician can prevent mrs newcome has been wrought up to a state ofof agitation her fever is in fact at present very high you know her condition i am apprehensive of ulterior consequences i have recommended an excellent and experienced nurse to her mr smith the medical man at the corner is a most able practitioner i shall myself call again in a few hours and i trust that after the event which i apprehend everything will go well  cannot mrs mackenzie leave the house sir i asked  her daughter cries out for her at every moment mrs mackenzie is certainly not a judicious nurse but in mrs newcomes present state i cannot take upon myself to separate them mr newcome may return and i do think and believe that his presence may tend to impose silence and restore tranquillity  i had to go back to clive with these gloomy tidings the poor fellow must put up a bed in his studio and there await the issue of his wifes illness i saw thomas newcome could not sleep under his sons roof that night that dear meeting which both so desired was delayed who could say for how long  the colonel may come to us i thought our old house is big enough i guessed who was the friend coming in my wifes company and pleased myself by thinking that two friends so dear should meet in our home bent upon these plans i repaired to grey friars and to thomas newcomes chamber there  bayham opened the door when i knocked and came towards me with a finger on his lip and a sad sad countenance he closed the door gently behind him and led me into the court clive is with him and miss newcome he is very ill he does not know them said bayham with a sob he calls out for both of them they are sitting there and he does not know them  in a brief narrative broken by more honest tears fred bayham as we paced up and down the court told me what had happened the old man must have passed a sleepless night for on going to his chamber in the morning his attendant found him dressed in his chair and his bed undisturbed he must have sat all through the bitter night without a fire but his hands were burning hot and he rambled in his talk he spoke of some one coming to drink tea with him pointed to the fire and asked why it was not made he would not go to bed though the nurse pressed him the bell began to ring for morning chapel he got up and went towards his gown groping towards it as though he could hardly see and put it over his shoulders and would go out but he would have fallen in the court if the good nurse had not given him her arm and the physician of the hospital passing fortunately at this moment who had always been a great friend of colonel newcomes insisted upon leading him back to his room again and got him to bed when the bell stopped he wanted to rise once more he fancied he was a boy at school again said the nurse and that he was going in to dr raine who was schoolmaster here ever so many years ago so it was that when happier days seemed to be dawning for the good man that reprieve came too late grief and years and humiliation and care and cruelty had been too strong for him and thomas newcome was stricken down  bayhams story told i entered the room over which the twilight was falling and saw the figures of clive and ethel seated at each end of the bed the poor old man within it was calling incoherent sentences i had to call clive from the present grief before him with intelligence of further sickness awaiting him at home our poor patient did not heed what i said to his son you must go home to rosa ethel said she will be sure to ask for her husband and forgiveness is best dear clive i will stay with uncle i will never leave him please god he will be better in the morning when you come back so clives duty called him to his own sad home and the bearer of dismal tidings i returned to mine the fires were lit there and the table spread and kind hearts were waiting to welcome the friend who never more was to enter my door  it may be imagined that the intelligence which i brought alarmed and afflicted my wife and madame de florac our guest laura immediately went away to rosas house to offer her services if needed the accounts which she brought thence were very bad clive came to her for a minute or two but mr mackenzie could not see her should she not bring the little boy home to her children laura asked and clive thankfully accepted that offer the little man slept in our nursery that night and was at play with our young ones on the morrowhappy and unconscious of the fate impending over his home                                       yet two more days passed and i had to take two advertisements to the times newspaper on the part of poor clive among the announcements of births was printed on the 28th in howland street mrs clive newcome of a son stillborn and a little lower in the third division of the same column appeared the words on the 29th in howland street aged 26 rosa wife of clive newcome esq so one day shall the names of all of us be written there to be deplored by how manyto be remembered how longto occasion what tears praises sympathy censureyet for a day or two while the busy world has time to recollect us who have passed beyond it so this poor little flower had bloomed for its little day and pined and withered and perished there was only one friend by clives side following the humble procession which laid poor rosa and her child out of sight of a world that had been but unkind to her not many tears were there to water her lonely little grave a grief that was akin to shame and remorse humbled him as he knelt over her poor little harmless lady no more childish triumphs and vanities no more hidden griefs are you to enjoy or suffer and earth closes over your simple pleasures and tears the snow was falling and whitening the coffin as they lowered it into the ground it was at the same cemetery in which lady kew was buried i dare say the same clergyman read the same service over the two graves as he will read it for you or any of us tomorrow and until his own turn comes come away from the place poor clive come sit with your orphan little boy and bear him on your knee and hug him to your heart he seems yours now and all a fathers love may pour out upon him until this hour fate uncontrollable and homely tyranny had separated him from you  it was touching to see the eagerness and tenderness with which the great strong man now assumed the guardianship of the child and endowed him with his entire wealth of affection the little boy now ran to clive whenever he came in and sat for hours prattling to him he would take the boy out to walk and from our windows we could see clives black figure striding over the snow in st jamess park the little man trotting beside him or perched on his fathers shoulder my wife and i looked at them one morning as they were making their way towards the city  he has inherited that loving heart from his father laura said and he is paying over the whole property to his son  clive and the boy sometimes with him used to go daily to grey friars where the colonel still lay ill after some days the fever which had attacked him left him but left him so weak and enfeebled that he could only go from his bed to the chair by his fireside the season was exceedingly bitter the chamber which he inhabited was warm and spacious it was considered unadvisable to move him until he had attained greater strength and till warmer weather the medical men of the house hoped he might rally in spring my friend dr goodenough came to him he hoped too but not with a hopeful face a chamber luckily vacant hard by the colonels was assigned to his friends where we sate when we were too many for him besides his customary attendant he had two dear and watchful nurses who were almost always with himethel and madame de florac who had passed many a faithful year by an old mans bedside who would have come as to a work of religion to any sick couch much more to this one where he lay for whose life she would once gladly have given her own  but our colonel we all were obliged to acknowledge was no more our friend of old days he knew us again and was good to every one round him as his wont was especially when boy came his old eyes lighted up with simple happiness and with eager trembling hands he would seek under his bedclothes or the pockets of his dressinggown for toys or cakes which he had caused to be purchased for his grandson there was a little laughing redcheeked whiteheaded gownboy of the school to whom the old man had taken a great fancy one of the symptoms of his returning consciousness and recovery as we hoped was his calling for this child who pleased our friend by his archness and merry ways and who to the old gentlemans unfailing delight used to call him codd colonel tell little f that codd colonel wants to see him and the little gownboy was brought to him and the colonel would listen to him for hours and hear all about his lessons and his play and prattle almost as childishly about dr raine and his own early schooldays the boys of the school it must be said had heard the noble old gentlemans touching history and had all got to know and love him they came every day to hear news of him sent him in books and papers to amuse him and some benevolent young soulsgods blessing on all honest boys say ipainted theatrical characters and sent them in to codd colonels grandson the little fellow was made free of gownboys and once came thence to his grandfather in a little gown which delighted the old man hugely boy said he would like to be a little gownboy and i make no doubt when he is old enough his father will get him that post and put him under the tuition of my friend dr senior  so weeks passed away during which our dear old friend still remained with us his mind was gone at intervals but would rally feebly and with his consciousness returned his love his simplicity his sweetness he would talk french with madame de florac at which time his memory appeared to awaken with surprising vividness his cheek flushed and he was a youth againa youth all love and hopea stricken old man with a beard as white as snow covering the noble careworn face at such times he called her by her christian name of leonore he addressed courtly old words of regard and kindness to the aged lady anon he wandered in his talk and spoke to her as if they still were young now as in those early days his heart was pure no anger remained in it no guile tainted it only peace and goodwill dwelt in it  rosas death had seemed to shock him for a while when the unconscious little boy spoke of it before that circumstance clive had even forbore to wear mourning lest the news should agitate his father the colonel remained silent and was very much disturbed all that day but he never appeared to comprehend the fact quite and once or twice afterwards asked why she did not come to see him she was prevented he supposedshe was prevented he said with a look of terror he never once otherwise alluded to that unlucky tyrant of his household who had made his last years so unhappy  the circumstance of clives legacy he never understood but more than once spoke of barnes to ethel and sent his compliments to him and said he should like to shake him by the hand barnes newcome never once offered to touch that honoured hand though his sister bore her uncles message to him they came often from bryanstone square mrs hobson even offered to sit with the colonel and read to him and brought him books for his improvement but her presence disturbed him he cared not for her books the two nurses whom he loved faithfully watched him and my wife and i were admitted to him sometimes both of whom he honoured with regard and recognition as for f b in order to be near his colonel did not that good fellow take up his lodging in cistercian lane at the red cow he is one whose errors let us hope shall be pardoned quia multum amavit i am sure he felt ten times more joy at hearing of clives legacy than if thousands had been bequeathed to himself may good health and good fortune speed him  the days went on and our hopes raised sometimes began to flicker and fail one evening the colonel left his chair for his bed in pretty good spirits but passed a disturbed night and the next morning was too weak to rise then he remained in his bed and his friends visited him there one afternoon he asked for his little gownboy and the child was brought to him and sate by the bed with a very awestricken face and then gathered courage and tried to amuse him by telling him how it was a halfholiday and they were having a cricketmatch with the st peters boys in the green and grey friars was in and winning the colonel quite understood about it he would like to see the game he had played many a game on that green when he was a boy he grew excited clive dismissed his fathers little friend and put a sovereign into his hand and away he ran to say that codd colonel had come into a fortune and to buy tarts and to see the match out i curre little whitehaired gownboy heaven speed you little friend  after the child had gone thomas newcome began to wander more and more he talked louder he gave the word of command spoke hindustanee as if to his men then he spoke words in french rapidly seizing a hand that was near him and crying toujours toujours but it was ethels hand which he took  ethel and clive and the nurse were in the room with him the latter came to us who were sitting in the adjoining apartment madame de florac was there with my wife and bayham  at the look in the womans countenance madame de florac started up he is very bad he wanders a great deal the nurse whispered the french lady fell instantly on her knees and remained rigid in prayer  some time afterwards ethel came in with a scared face to our pale group he is calling for you again dear lady she said going up to madame de florac who was still kneeling and just now he said he wanted pendennis to take care of his boy he will not know you she hid her tears as she spoke  she went into the room where clive was at the beds foot the old man within it talked on rapidly for a while then again he would sigh and be still once more i heard him say hurriedly take care of him while im in india and then with a heartrending voice he called out leonore leonore she was kneeling by his side now the patients voice sank into faint murmurs only a moan now and then announced that he was not asleep  at the usual evening hour the chapel bell began to toll and thomas newcomes hands outside the bed feebly beat a time and just as the last bell struck a peculiar sweet smile shone over his face and he lifted up his head a little and quickly said adsum and fell back it was the word we used at school when names were called and lo he whose heart was as that of a little child had answered to his name and stood in the presence of the master                                       two years ago walking with my children in some pleasant fields near to berne in switzerland i strayed from them into a little wood and coming out of it presently told them how the story had been revealed to me somehow which for threeandtwenty months the reader has been pleased to follow as i write the last line with a rather sad heart pendennis and laura and ethel and clive fade away into fableland i hardly know whether they are not true whether they do not live near us somewhere they were alive and i heard their voices but five minutes since was touched by their grief and have we parted with them here on a sudden and without so much as a shake of the hand is yonder line  which i drew with my own pen a barrier between me and hades as it were across which i can see those figures retreating and only dimly glimmering before taking leave of mr arthur pendennis might he not have told us whether miss ethel married anybody finally it was provoking that he should retire to the shades without answering that sentimental question  but though he has disappeared as irrevocably as eurydice these minor questions may settle the major one above mentioned how could pendennis have got all that information about ethels goingson at baden and with lord kew unless she had told somebodyher husband for instance who having made pendennis an early confidant in his amour gave him the whole story clive pendennis writes expressly is travelling abroad with his wife who is that wife by a most monstrous blunder mr pendennis killed lord farintoshs mother at one page and brought her to life again at another but rosey who is so lately consigned to kensal green it is not surely with her that clive is travelling for then mrs mackenzie would probably be with them to a live certainty and the tour would be by no means pleasant how could pendennis have got all those private letters etc but that the colonel kept them in a teak box which clive inherited and made over to his friend my belief then is that in fableland somewhere ethel and clive are living most comfortably together that she is immensely fond of his little boy and a great deal happier now than they would have been had they married at first when they took a liking to each other as young people that picture of j js of mrs clive newcome in the crystal palace exhibition in fableland is certainly not in the least like rosey who we read was fair but it represents a tall handsome dark lady who must be mrs ethel  again why did pendennis introduce j j with such a flourish giving us as it were an overture and no piece to follow it j js history let me confidentially state has been revealed to me too and may be told some of these fine summer months or christmas evenings when the kind reader has leisure to hear  what about sir barnes newcome ultimately my impression is that he is married again and it is my fervent hope that his present wife bullies him mrs mackenzie cannot have the face to keep that money which clive paid over to her beyond her lifetime and will certainly leave it and her savings to little tommy i should not be surprised if madame de moncontour left a smart legacy to the pendennis children and lord kew stood godfather in casein case mr and mrs clive wanted such an article but have they any children i for my part should like her best without and entirely devoted to little tommy but for you dear friend it is as you like you may settle your fableland in your own fashion anything you like happens in fableland wicked folks die a propos for instance that death of lady kew was most artful for if she had not died dont you see that ethel would have married lord farintosh the next weekannoying folks are got out of the way the poor are rewardedthe upstarts are set down in fablelandthe frog bursts with wicked rage the fox is caught in his trap the lamb is rescued from the wolf and so forth just in the nick of time and the poet of fableland rewards and punishes absolutely he splendidly deals out bags of sovereigns which wont buy anything belabours wicked backs with awful blows which do not hurt endows heroines with preternatural beauty and creates heroes who if ugly sometimes yet possess a thousand good qualities and usually end by being immensely rich makes the hero and heroine happy at last and happy ever after ah happy harmless fableland where these things are friendly reader may you and the author meet there on some future day he hopes so as he yet keeps a lingering hold of your hand and bids you farewell with a kind heart  paris 28th june 1855  the end
