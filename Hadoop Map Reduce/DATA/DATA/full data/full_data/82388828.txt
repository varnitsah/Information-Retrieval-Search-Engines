dodd mead  company published september 1908     the love of ulrich nebendahl  perhaps of all it troubled most the herr pfarrer was he not the father of the village and as such did it not fall to him to see his children marry well and suitably marry in any case it was the duty of every worthy citizen to keep alive throughout the ages the sacred hearth fire to rear up sturdy lads and honest lassies that would serve god and the fatherland a true son of saxon soil was the herr pastor winckelmannkindly simple sentimental  why at your age ulrichat your age repeated the herr pastor setting down his beer and wiping with the back of his hand his large uneven lips i was the father of a familytwo boys and a girl you never saw her ulrich so sweet so good we called her maria the herr pfarrer sighed and hid his broad red face behind the raised cover of his pewter pot  they must be good fun in a house the little ones commented ulrich gazing upward with his dreamy eyes at the wreath of smoke ascending from his longstemmed pipe the little ones always my heart goes out to them  take to yourself a wife urged the herr pfarrer it is your duty the good god has given to you ample means it is not right that you should lead this lonely life bachelors make old maids things of no use  that is so ulrich agreed i have often said the same unto myself it would be pleasant to feel one was not working merely for oneself  elsa now went on the herr pfarrer she is a good child pious and economical the price of such is above rubies  ulrichs face lightened with a pleasant smile aye elsa is a good girl he answered her little handshave you ever noticed them herr pastorso soft and dimpled  the pfarrer pushed aside his empty pot and leaned his elbows on the table  i thinki do not thinkshe would say no her mother i have reason to believelet me sound themdiscreetly the old pastors red face glowed redder yet with pleasurable anticipation he was a born matchmaker  but ulrich the wheelwright shuffled in his chair uneasily  a little longer he pleaded let me think it over a man should not marry without first being sure he loves things might happen it would not be fair to the maiden  the herr pfarrer stretched his hand across the table and laid it upon ulrichs arm  it is hedwig twice you walked home with her last week  it is a lonesome way for a timid maiden and there is the stream to cross explained the wheelwright  for a moment the herr pastors face had clouded but now it cleared again  well well why not elsa would have been better in some respects but hedwigah yes she too is a good girl a little wild perhapsit will wear off have you spoken with her  not yet  but you will  again there fell that troubled look into those dreamy eyes this time it was ulrich who laying aside his pipe rested his great arms upon the wooden table  now how does a man know when he is in love asked ulrich of the pastor who having been married twice should surely be experienced upon the point how should he be sure that it is this woman and no other to whom his heart has gone out  a commonplacelooking man was the herr pastor short and fat and bald but there had been other days and these had left to him a voice that still was young and the evening twilight screening the seared face ulrich heard but the pastors voice which was the voice of a boy  she will be dearer to you than yourself thinking of her all else will be as nothing for her you would lay down your life  they sat in silence for a while for the fat little herr pfarrer was dreaming of the past and long lanky ulrich nebendahl the wheelwright of the future  that evening as chance would have it ulrich returning to his homesteada rambling mill beside the river where he dwelt alone with ancient annamet elsa of the dimpled hands upon the bridge that spans the murmuring muhlde and talked a while with her and said goodnight  how sweet it had been to watch her oxlike eyes shyly seeking his to press her dimpled hand and feel his own great strength surely he loved her better than he did himself there could be no doubt of it he pictured her in trouble in danger from the savage soldiery that came and went like evil shadows through these pleasant saxon valleys leaving death and misery behind them burnt homesteads wildeyed women hiding their faces from the light would he not for her sake give his life  so it was made clear to him that little elsa was his love  until next morning when raising his eyes from the whirling saw there stood before him margot laughing margot mischiefloving wayward that would ever be to him the baby he had played with nursed and comforted margot weary had he not a thousand times carried her sleeping in his arms margot in danger at the mere thought his face flushed an angry scarlet  all that afternoon ulrich communed with himself tried to understand himself and could not for elsa and margot and hedwig were not the only ones by a long way what girl in the village did he not love if it came to that liesel who worked so hard and lived so poorly bullied by her crossgrained granddam susanna plain and a little crotchety who had never had a sweetheart to coax the thin lips into smiles the little onesfor so they seemed to long lanky ulrich with their pleasant waysulrich smiled as he thought of themhow should a man love one more than another  the herr pfarrer shook his head and sighed  that is not love gott in himmel think what it would lead to the good god never would have arranged things so you love one she is the only woman in the world for you  but you yourself herr pastor you have twice been married suggested the puzzled wheelwright  but one at a time ulrichone at a time that is a very different thing  why should it not come to him alone among men surely it was a beautiful thing this love a thing worthy of a man without which a man was but a useless devourer of food cumbering the earth  so ulrich pondered pausing from his work one drowsy summers afternoon listening to the low song of the waters how well he knew the winding muhldes merry voice he had worked beside it played beside it all his life often he would sit and talk to it as to an old friend reading answers in its changing tones  trudchen seeing him idle pushed her cold nose into his hand trudchen just now was feeling clever and important was she not the mother of the five most wonderful puppies in all saxony they swarmed about his legs pressing him with their little foolish heads ulrich stooped and picked up one in each big hand but this causing jealousy and heartburning laughing he lay down upon a log then the whole five stormed over him biting his hair trampling with their clumsy paws upon his face till suddenly they raced off in a body to attack a floating feather ulrich sat up and watched them the little rogues the little foolish helpless things that called for so much care a mother thrush twittered above his head ulrich rose and creeping on tiptoe peeped into the nest but the mother bird casting one glance towards him went on with her work whoever was afraid of ulrich the wheelwright the tiny murmuring insects buzzed to and fro about his feet an old man passing to his evening rest gave him goodday a zephyr whispered something to the leaves at which they laughed then passed upon his way here and there a shadow crept out from its hidingplace  if only i could marry the whole village laughed ulrich to himself  but that of course is nonsense  the spring that followed let loose the dogs of war again upon the bloodstained land for now all germany taught late by common suffering forgetfulness of local rivalries was rushing together in a mighty wave that would sweep french feet for ever from their hold on german soil ulrich for whom the love of woman seemed not would at least be the lover of his country he too would march among those brave stern hearts that stealing like a thousand rivulets from every german valley were flowing north and west to join the prussian eagles  but even love of country seemed denied to ulrich of the dreamy eyes his wheelwrights business had called him to a town far off he had been walking all the day towards evening passing the outskirts of a wood a feeble cry for help sounding from the shadows fell upon his ear ulrich paused and again from the sombre wood crept that weary cry of pain ulrich ran and came at last to where among the wild flowers and the grass lay prone five human figures two of them were of the german landwehr the other three frenchmen in the hated uniform of napoleons famous scouts it had been some unimportant affair of outposts one of those common incidents of warfare that are never recordednever remembered save here and there by some sad face unnoticed in the crowd four of the men were dead one a frenchman was still alive though bleeding copiously from a deep wound in the chest that with a handful of dank grass he was trying to staunch  ulrich raised him in his arms the man spoke no german and ulrich knew but his mother tongue but when the man turning towards the neighbouring village with a look of terror in his halfglazed eyes pleaded with his hands ulrich understood and lifting him gently carried him further into the wood  he found a small deserted shelter that had been made by charcoalburners and there on a bed of grass and leaves ulrich laid him and there for a week all but a day ulrich tended him and nursed him back to life coming and going stealthily like a thief in the darkness then ulrich who had thought his one desire in life to be to kill all frenchmen put food and drink into the frenchmans knapsack and guided him half through the night and took his hand and so they parted  ulrich did not return to alt waldnitz that lies hidden in the forest beside the murmuring muhlde they would think he had gone to the war he would let them think so he was too great a coward to go back to them and tell them that he no longer wanted to fight that the sound of the drum brought to him only the thought of trampled grass where dead men lay with curses in their eyes  so with head bowed down in shame to and fro about the moaning land ulrich of the dreamy eyes came and went guiding his solitary footsteps by the sounds of sorrow driving away the things of evil where they crawled among the wounded making his way swiftly to the side of pain heedless of the uniform  thus one day he found himself by chance near again to forestgirdled waldnitz he would push his way across the hills wander through its quiet ways in the moonlight while the good folks all lay sleeping his footsteps quickened as he drew nearer where the trees broke he would be able to look down upon it see every roof he knew so wellthe church the mill the winding muhldethe green worn grey with dancing feet where when the hateful war was over would be heard again the saxon folksongs  another was there where the forest halts on the brow of the hilla figure kneeling on the ground with his face towards the village ulrich stole closer it was the herr pfarrer praying volubly but inaudibly he scrambled to his feet as ulrich touched him and his first astonishment over poured forth his tale of woe  there had been trouble since ulrichs departure a french corps of observation had been camped upon the hill and twice within the month had a french soldier been found murdered in the woods heavy had been the penalties exacted from the village and terrible had been the colonels threats of vengeance now for a third time a soldier stabbed in the back had been borne into camp by his raging comrades and this very afternoon the colonel had sworn that if the murderer were not handed over to him within an hour from dawn when the camp was to break up he would before marching burn the village to the ground the herr pfarrer was on his way back from the camp where he had been to plead for mercy but it had been in vain  such are foul deeds said ulrich  the people are mad with hatred of the french answered the herr pastor it may be one it may be a dozen who have taken vengeance into their own hands may god forgive them  they will not come forwardnot to save the village  can you expect it of them there is no hope for us the village will burn as a hundred others have burned  aye that was true ulrich had seen their blackened ruins the old sitting with white faces among the wreckage of their homes the little children wailing round their knees the tiny broods burned in their nests he had picked their corpses from beneath the charred trunks of the dead elms  the herr pfarrer had gone forward on his melancholy mission to prepare the people for their doom  ulrich stood alone looking down upon alt waldnitz bathed in moonlight and there came to him the words of the old pastor she will be dearer to you than yourself for her you would lay down your life and ulrich knew that his love was the village of alt waldnitz where dwelt his people the old and wrinkled the laughing little ones where dwelt the helpless dumb things with their deep pathetic eyes where the bees hummed drowsily and the thousand tiny creatures of the day  they hanged him high upon a withered elm with his face towards alt waldnitz that all the village old and young might see and then to the beat of drum and scream of fife they marched away and foresthidden waldnitz gathered up once more its many threads of quiet life and wove them into homely pattern  they talked and argued many a time and some there were who praised and some who blamed but the herr pfarrer could not understand  until years later a dying man unburdened his soul so that the truth became known  then they raised ulrichs coffin reverently and the young men carried it into the village and laid it in the churchyard that it might always be among them they reared above him what in their eyes was a grand monument and carved upon it  greater love hath no man than this
