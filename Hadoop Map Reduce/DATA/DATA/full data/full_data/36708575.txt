36708575	the rise of silas lapham   by  william dean howells   jtable 5 27 1    i   when bartley hubbard went to interview silas lapham for the solid men of boston series which he undertook to finish up in the events after he replaced their original projector on that newspaper lapham received him in his private office by previous appointment  walk right in he called out to the journalist whom he caught sight of through the door of the countingroom  he did not rise from the desk at which he was writing but he gave bartley his left hand for welcome and he rolled his large head in the direction of a vacant chair  sit down ill be with you in just half a minute  take your time said bartley with the ease he instantly felt  im in no hurry he took a notebook from his pocket laid it on his knee and began to sharpen a pencil  there lapham pounded with his great hairy fist on the envelope he had been addressing  william he called out and he handed the letter to a boy who came to get it  i want that to go right away  well sir he continued wheeling round in his leathercushioned swivelchair and facing bartley seated so near that their knees almost touched so you want my life death and christian sufferings do you young man  thats what im after said bartley  your money or your life  i guess you wouldnt want my life without the money said lapham as if he were willing to prolong these moments of preparation  take em both bartley suggested  dont want your money without your life if you come to that  but youre just one million times more interesting to the public than if you hadnt a dollar and you know that as well as i do mr lapham  theres no use beating about the bush  no said lapham somewhat absently  he put out his huge foot and pushed the groundglass door shut between his little den and the bookkeepers in their larger den outside  in personal appearance wrote bartley in the sketch for which he now studied his subject while he waited patiently for him to continue silas lapham is a fine type of the successful american  he has a square bold chin only partially concealed by the short reddishgrey beard growing to the edges of his firmly closing lips  his nose is short and straight his forehead good but broad rather than high his eyes blue and with a light in them that is kindly or sharp according to his mood  he is of medium height and fills an average armchair with a solid bulk which on the day of our interview was unpretentiously clad in a business suit of blue serge  his head droops somewhat from a short neck which does not trouble itself to rise far from a pair of massive shoulders  i dont know as i know just where you want me to begin said lapham  might begin with your birth thats where most of us begin replied bartley  a gleam of humorous appreciation shot into laphams blue eyes  i didnt know whether you wanted me to go quite so far back as that he said  but theres no disgrace in having been born and i was born in the state of vermont pretty well up under the canada lineso well up in fact that i came very near being an adoptive citizen for i was bound to be an american of some sort from the word go that was aboutwell let me seepretty near sixty years ago this is 75 and that was 20 well say im fiftyfive years old and ive lived em too not an hour of waste time about me anywheres i was born on a farm and  worked in the fields summers and went to school winters regulation thing bartley cut in  regulation thing said lapham accepting this irreverent version of his history somewhat dryly  parents poor of course suggested the journalist  any barefoot business early deprivations of any kind that would encourage the youthful reader to go and do likewise orphan myself you know said bartley with a smile of cynical goodcomradery  lapham looked at him silently and then said with quiet selfrespect i guess if you see these things as a joke my life wont interest you  oh yes it will returned bartley unabashed  youll see itll come out all right and in fact it did so in the interview which bartley printed  mr lapham he wrote passed rapidly over the story of his early life its poverty and its hardships sweetened however by the recollections of a devoted mother and a father who if somewhat her inferior in education was no less ambitious for the advancement of his children  they were quiet unpretentious people religious after the fashion of that time and of sterling morality and they taught their children the simple virtues of the old testament and poor richards almanac  bartley could not deny himself this gibe but he trusted to laphams unliterary habit of mind for his security in making it and most other people would consider it sincere reporters rhetoric  you know he explained to lapham that we have to look at all these facts as material and we get the habit of classifying them  sometimes a leading question will draw out a whole line of facts that a man himself would never think of he went on to put several queries and it was from laphams answers that he generalised the history of his childhood  mr lapham although he did not dwell on his boyish trials and struggles spoke of them with deep feeling and an abiding sense of their reality this was what he added in the interview and by the time he had got lapham past the period where risen americans are all pathetically alike in their narrow circumstances their sufferings and their aspirations he had beguiled him into forgetfulness of the check he had received and had him talking again in perfect enjoyment of his autobiography  yes sir said lapham in a strain which bartley was careful not to interrupt again a man never sees all that his mother has been to him till its too late to let her know that he sees it  why my mother he stopped  it gives me a lump in the throat he said apologetically with an attempt at a laugh  then he went on she was a little frail thing not bigger than a goodsized intermediate schoolgirl but she did the whole work of a family of boys and boarded the hired men besides  she cooked swept washed ironed made and mended from daylight till darkand from dark till daylight i was going to say for i dont know how she got any time for sleep  but i suppose she did  she got time to go to church and to teach us to read the bible and to misunderstand it in the old way  she was good  but it aint her on her knees in church that comes back to me so much like the sight of an angel as her on her knees before me at night washing my poor dirty little feet that id run bare in all day and making me decent for bed  there were six of us boys it seems to me we were all of a size and she was just so careful with all of us  i can feel her hands on my feet yet bartley looked at laphams no 10 boots and softly whistled through his teeth  we were patched all over but we want ragged  i dont know how she got through it  she didnt seem to think it was anything and i guess it was no more than my father expected of her  he worked like a horse in doors and outup at daylight feeding the stock and groaning round all day with his rheumatism but not stopping  bartley hid a yawn over his notebook and probably if he could have spoken his mind he would have suggested to lapham that he was not there for the purpose of interviewing his ancestry  but bartley had learned to practise a patience with his victims which he did not always feel and to feign an interest in their digressions till he could bring them up with a round turn  i tell you said lapham jabbing the point of his penknife into the writingpad on the desk before him when i hear women complaining nowadays that their lives are stunted and empty i want to tell em about my mothers life  i could paint it out for em  bartley saw his opportunity at the word paint and cut in  and you say mr lapham that you discovered this mineral paint on the old farm yourself  lapham acquiesced in the return to business  i didnt discover it he said scrupulously  my father found it one day in a hole made by a tree blowing down  there it was lying loose in the pit and sticking to the roots that had pulled up a big cake of dirt with em i dont know what give him the idea that there was money in it but he did think so from the start  i guess if theyd had the word in those days theyd considered him pretty much of a crank about it  he was trying as long as he lived to get that paint introduced but he couldnt make it go  the country was so poor they couldnt paint their houses with anything and father hadnt any facilities  it got to be a kind of joke with us and i guess that paintmine did as much as any one thing to make us boys clear out as soon as we got old enough  all my brothers went west and took up land but i hung on to new england and i hung on to the old farm not because the paintmine was on it but because the old house wasand the graves  well said lapham as if unwilling to give himself too much credit there wouldnt been any market for it anyway  you can go through that part of the state and buy more farms than you can shake a stick at for less money than it cost to build the barns on em of course its turned out a good thing  i keep the old house up in good shape and we spend a month or so there every summer  m wife kind of likes it and the girls pretty place sightly all round it  ive got a force of men at work there the whole time and ive got a man and his wife in the house had a family meeting there last year the whole connection from out west  there lapham rose from his seat and took down a large warped unframed photograph from the top of his desk passing his hand over it and then blowing vigorously upon it to clear it of the dust  there we are all of us  i dont need to look twice at you said bartley putting his finger on one of the heads  well thats bill said lapham with a gratified laugh  hes about as brainy as any of us i guess  hes one of their leading lawyers out dubuque way been judge of the common pleas once or twice  thats his sonjust graduated at yalealongside of my youngest girl goodlooking chap aint he  shes a goodlooking chap said bartley with prompt irreverence  he hastened to add at the frown which gathered between laphams eyes what a beautiful creature she is what a lovely refined sensitive face and she looks good too  she is good said the father relenting  and after all thats about the best thing in a woman said the potential reprobate  if my wife wasnt good enough to keep both of us straight i dont know what would become of me my other daughter said lapham indicating a girl with eyes that showed large and a face of singular gravity  mis lapham he continued touching his wifes effigy with his little finger  my brother willard and his familyfarm at kankakee  hazard lapham and his wifebaptist preacher in kansas  jim and his three girlsmilling business at minneapolis ben and his familypractising medicine in fort wayne  the figures were clustered in an irregular group in front of an old farmhouse whose original ugliness had been smartened up with a coat of laphams own paint and heightened with an incongruous piazza  the photographer had not been able to conceal the fact that they were all decent honestlooking sensible people with a very fair share of beauty among the young girls some of these were extremely pretty in fact  he had put them into awkward and constrained attitudes of course and they all looked as if they had the instrument of torture which photographers call a headrest under their occiputs  here and there an elderly ladys face was a mere blur and some of the younger children had twitched themselves into wavering shadows and might have passed for spiritphotographs of their own little ghosts  it was the standard familygroup photograph in which most americans have figured at some time or other and lapham exhibited a just satisfaction in it i presume he mused aloud as he put it back on top of his desk that we shant soon get together again all of us  and you say suggested bartley that you stayed right along on the old place when the rest cleared out west  no ooo said lapham with a long loud drawl i cleared out west too first off  went to texas  texas was all the cry in those days but i got enough of the lone star in about three months and i come back with the idea that vermont was good enough for me  fatted calf business queried bartley with his pencil poised above his notebook  i presume they were glad to see me said lapham with dignity mother he added gently died that winter and i stayed on with father  i buried him in the spring and then i came down to a little place called lumberville and picked up what jobs i could get  i worked round at the sawmills and i was ostler a while at the hoteli always did like a good horse  well i want exactly a college graduate and i went to school odd times  i got to driving the stage after while and by and by i bought the stage and run the business myself  then i hired the tavernstand andwell to make a long story short then i got married  yes said lapham with pride i married the schoolteacher we did pretty well with the hotel and my wife she was always at me to paint up  well i put it off and put it off as a man will till one day i give in and says i well lets paint up why pertmwifes names persisive got a whole paintmine out on the farm  lets go out and look at it so we drove out  id let the place for seventyfive dollars a year to a shifless kind of a kanuck that had come down that way and id hated to see the house with him in it but we drove out one saturday afternoon and we brought back about a bushel of the stuff in the buggyseat and i tried it crude and i tried it burnt and i liked it  mwife she liked it too  there want any painter by trade in the village and i mixed it myself well sir that taverns got that coat of paint on it yet and it haint ever had any other and i dont knows it ever will  well you know i felt as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment all the while and i presume i shouldnt have tried it but i kind of liked to do it because fatherd always set so much store by his paintmine and when id got the first coat onlapham called it cuti presume i must have set as much as half an hour looking at it and thinking how he would have enjoyed it  ive had my share of luck in this world and i aint agoing to complain on my own account but ive noticed that most things get along too late for most people  it made me feel bad and it took all the pride out my success with the paint thinking of father  seemed to me i might a taken more interest in it when he was by to see but weve got to live and learn  well i called my wife outid tried it on the back of the house you knowand she left her dishesi can remember she came out with her sleeves rolled up and set down alongside of me on the trestleand says i what do you think persis and says she well you haint got a paintmine silas lapham youve got a goldmine she always was just so enthusiastic about things  well it was just after two or three boats had burnt up out west and a lot of lives lost and there was a great cry about noninflammable paint and i guess that was what was in her mind well i guess it aint any goldmine persis says i but i guess it is a paintmine im going to have it analysed and if it turns out what i think it is im going to work it  and if father hadnt had such a long name i should call it the nehemiah lapham mineral paint but any rate every barrel of it and every keg and every bottle and every package big or little has got to have the initials and figures nlf 1835 slt 1855 on it  father found it in 1835 and i tried it in 1855  st1860x business said bartley  yes said lapham but i hadnt heard of plantation bitters then and i hadnt seen any of the fellows labels  i set to work and i got a man down from boston and i carried him out to the farm and he analysed itmade a regular job of it  well sir we built a kiln and we kept a lot of that paintore redhot for fortyeight hours kept the kanuck and his family up firing  the presence of iron in the ore showed with the magnet from the start and when he came to test it he found out that it contained about seventyfive per cent of the peroxide of iron  lapham pronounced the scientific phrases with a sort of reverent satisfaction as if awed through his pride by a little lingering uncertainty as to what peroxide was  he accented it as if it were purroxeyed and bartley had to get him to spell it  well and what then he asked when he had made a note of the percentage  what then echoed lapham  well then the fellow set down and told me youve got a paint here says he thats going to drive every other mineral paint out of the market  why says he itll drive em right into the back bay of course i didnt know what the back bay was then but i begun to open my eyes thought id had em open before but i guess i hadnt says he that paint has got hydraulic cement in it and it can stand fire and water and acids he named over a lot of things  says he itll mix easily with linseed oil whether you want to use it boiled or raw and it aint agoing to crack nor fade any and it aint agoing to scale  when youve got your arrangements for burning it properly youre going to have a paint that will stand like the everlasting hills in every climate under the sun then he went into a lot of particulars and i begun to think he was drawing a longbow and meant to make his bill accordingly  so i kept pretty cool but the fellows bill didnt amount to anything hardlysaid i might pay him after i got going young chap and pretty easy but every word he said was gospel  well i aint agoing to brag up my paint i dont suppose you came here to hear me blow  oh yes i did said bartley  thats what i want  tell all there is to tell and i can boil it down afterward  a man cant make a greater mistake with a reporter than to hold back anything out of modesty  it may be the very thing we want to know  what we want is the whole truth and more weve got so much modesty of our own that we can temper almost any statement  lapham looked as if he did not quite like this tone and he resumed a little more quietly  oh there isnt really very much more to say about the paint itself  but you can use it for almost anything where a paint is wanted inside or out  itll prevent decay and itll stop it after its begun in tin or iron  you can paint the inside of a cistern or a bathtub with it and water wont hurt it and you can paint a steamboiler with it and heat wont  you can cover a brick wall with it or a railroad car or the deck of a steamboat and you cant do a better thing for either  never tried it on the human conscience i suppose suggested bartley  no sir replied lapham gravely  i guess you want to keep that as free from paint as you can if you want much use of it  i never cared to try any of it on mine lapham suddenly lifted his bulk up out of his swivelchair and led the way out into the wareroom beyond the office partitions where rows and ranks of casks barrels and kegs stretched dimly back to the rear of the building and diffused an honest clean wholesome smell of oil and paint  they were labelled and branded as containing each so many pounds of laphams mineral paint and each bore the mystic devices nlf 1835slt 1855 there said lapham kicking one of the largest casks with the toe of his boot thats about our biggest package and here he added laying his hand affectionately on the head of a very small keg as if it were the head of a child which it resembled in size this is the smallest  we used to put the paint on the market dry but now we grind every ounce of it in oilvery best quality of linseed oiland warrant it  we find it gives more satisfaction  now come back to the office and ill show you our fancy brands  it was very cool and pleasant in that dim wareroom with the rafters showing overhead in a cloudy perspective and darkening away into the perpetual twilight at the rear of the building and bartley had found an agreeable seat on the head of a halfbarrel of the paint which he was reluctant to leave  but he rose and followed the vigorous lead of lapham back to the office where the sun of a long summer afternoon was just beginning to glare in at the window  on shelves opposite laphams desk were tin cans of various sizes arranged in tapering cylinders and showing in a pattern diminishing toward the top the same label borne by the casks and barrels in the wareroom  lapham merely waved his hand toward these but when bartley after a comprehensive glance at them gave his whole attention to a row of clean smooth jars where different tints of the paint showed through flawless glass lapham smiled and waited in pleased expectation  hello said bartley  thats pretty  yes assented lapham it is rather nice  its our latest thing and we find it takes with customers firstrate look here he said taking down one of the jars and pointing to the first line of the label  bartley read the persis brand and then he looked at lapham and smiled  after her of course said lapham  got it up and put the first of it on the market her last birthday  she was pleased  i should think she might have been said bartley while he made a note of the appearance of the jars  i dont know about your mentioning it in your interview said lapham dubiously  thats going into the interview mr lapham if nothing else does got a wife myself and i know just how you feel it was in the dawn of bartleys prosperity on the boston events before his troubles with marcia had seriously begun  is that so said lapham recognising with a smile another of the vast majority of married americans a few underrate their wives but the rest think them supernal in intelligence and capability  well he added we must see about that  whered you say you lived  we dont live we board  mrs nash 13 canary place  well weve all got to commence that way suggested lapham consolingly  yes but weve about got to the end of our string  i expect to be under a roof of my own on clover street before long  i suppose said bartley returning to business that you didnt let the grass grow under your feet much after you found out what was in your paintmine  no sir answered lapham withdrawing his eyes from a long stare at bartley in which he had been seeing himself a young man again in the first days of his married life  i went right back to lumberville and sold out everything and put all i could rake and scrape together into paint  and mis lapham was with me every time  no hang back about her  i tell you she was a woman  bartley laughed  thats the sort most of us marry  no we dont said lapham  most of us marry silly little girls grown up to look like women  well i guess thats about so assented bartley as if upon second thought  if it hadnt been for her resumed lapham the paint wouldnt have come to anything  i used to tell her it want the seventyfive per cent of purroxeyed of iron in the ore that made that paint go it was the seventyfive per cent of purroxeyed of iron in her  good cried bartley  ill tell marcia that  in lessn six months there want a boardfence nor a bridgegirder nor a dead wall nor a barn nor a face of rock in that whole region that didnt have laphams mineral paintspecimen on it in the three colours we begun by making bartley had taken his seat on the windowsill and lapham standing before him now put up his huge foot close to bartleys thigh neither of them minded that  ive heard a good deal of talk about that st1860x man and the stoveblacking man and the kidneycure man because they advertised in that way and ive read articles about it in the papers but i dont see where the joke comes in exactly  so long as the people that own the barns and fences dont object i dont see what the public has got to do with it  and i never saw anything so very sacred about a big rock along a river or in a pasture that it wouldnt do to put mineral paint on it in three colours  i wish some of the people that talk about the landscape and write about it had to bust one of them rocks out of the landscape with powder or dig a hole to bury it in as we used to have to do up on the farm i guess theyd sing a little different tune about the profanation of scenery  there aint any man enjoys a sightly bit of naturea smooth piece of interval with half a dozen goodsized wineglass elms in itmore than i do  but i aint agoing to stand up for every big ugly rock i come across as if we were all a set of dumn druids  i say the landscape was made for man and not man for the landscape  yes said bartley carelessly it was made for the stovepolish man and the kidneycure man  it was made for any man that knows how to use it lapham returned insensible to bartleys irony  let em go and live with nature in the winter up there along the canada line and i guess theyll get enough of her for one while  wellwhere was i  decorating the landscape said bartley  yes sir i started right there at lumberville and it give the place a start too  you wont find it on the map now and you wont find it in the gazetteer  i give a pretty good lump of money to build a townhall about five years back and the first meeting they held in it they voted to change the namelumberville want a nameand its lapham now  isnt it somewhere up in that region that they get the old brandon red asked bartley  were about ninety miles from brandon  the brandons a good paint said lapham conscientiously  like to show you round up at our place some odd time if you get off  thanks  i should like it firstrate  works there  yes works there  well sir just about the time i got started the war broke out and it knocked my paint higher than a kite  the thing dropped perfectly dead  i presume that if id had any sort of influence i might have got it into government hands for guncarriages and army wagons and may be on board government vessels  but i hadnt and we had to face the music  i was about brokenhearted but mwife she looked at it another way  i guess its a providence says she silas i guess youve got a country thats worth fighting for  any rate you better go out and give it a chance well sir i went  i knew she meant business  it might kill her to have me go but it would kill her sure if i stayed  she was one of that kind  i went  her last words was ill look after the paint si we hadnt but just one little girl thenboyd diedand mis laphams mother was livin with us and i knew if times did anyways come up again mwifed know just what to do  so i went  i got through and you can call me colonel if you want to  feel there lapham took bartleys thumb and forefinger and put them on a bunch in his leg just above the knee anything hard  ball  lapham nodded  gettysburg thats my thermometer  if it want for that i shouldnt know enough to come in when it rains  bartley laughed at a joke which betrayed some evidences of wear  and when you came back you took hold of the paint and rushed it  i took hold of the paint and rushed itall i could said lapham with less satisfaction than he had hitherto shown in his autobiography but i found that i had got back to another world  the day of small things was past and i dont suppose it will ever come again in this country  my wife was at me all the time to take a partnersomebody with capital but i couldnt seem to bear the idea  that paint was like my own blood to me  to have anybody else concerned in it was likewell i dont know what  i saw it was the thing to do but i tried to fight it off and i tried to joke it off  i used to say why didnt you take a partner yourself persis while i was away and shed say well if you hadnt come back i should si always did like a joke about as well as any woman i ever saw  well i had to come to it  i took a partner lapham dropped the bold blue eyes with which he had been till now staring into bartleys face and the reporter knew that here was a place for asterisks in his interview if interviews were faithful  he had money enough continued lapham with a suppressed sigh but he didnt know anything about paint  we hung on together for a year or two  and then we quit  and he had the experience suggested bartley with companionable ease  i had some of the experience too said lapham with a scowl and bartley divined through the freemasonry of all who have sore places in their memories that this was a point which he must not touch again  and since that i suppose youve played it alone  ive played it alone  you must ship some of this paint of yours to foreign countries colonel suggested bartley putting on a professional air  we ship it to all parts of the world  it goes to south america lots of it  it goes to australia and it goes to india and it goes to china and it goes to the cape of good hope  itll stand any climate of course we dont export these fancy brands much  theyre for home use  but were introducing them elsewhere  here lapham pulled open a drawer and showed bartley a lot of labels in different languagesspanish french german and italian  we expect to do a good business in all those countries  weve got our agencies in cadiz now and in paris and in hamburg and in leghorn  its a thing thats bound to make its way  yes sir  wherever a man has got a ship or a bridge or a lock or a house or a car or a fence or a pigpen anywhere in gods universe to paint thats the paint for him and hes bound to find it out sooner or later  you pass a ton of that paint dry through a blastfurnace and youll get a quarter of a ton of pigiron i believe in my paint  i believe its a blessing to the world  when folks come in and kind of smell round and ask me what i mix it with i always say well in the first place i mix it with faith and after that i grind it up with the best quality of boiled linseed oil that money will buy  lapham took out his watch and looked at it and bartley perceived that his audience was drawing to a close  f you ever want to run down and take a look at our works pass you over the roadhe called it rudand it shant cost you a cent well may be i shall sometime said bartley  good afternoon colonel  good afternoon  orhold on my horse down there yet william he called to the young man in the countingroom who had taken his letter at the beginning of the interview  oh all right he added in response to something the young man said  cant i set you down somewhere mr hubbard ive got my horse at the door and i can drop you on my way home  im going to take mis lapham to look at a house im driving piles for down on the new land  dont care if i do said bartley  lapham put on a straw hat gathered up some papers lying on his desk pulled down its rolling cover turned the key in it and gave the papers to an extremely handsome young woman at one of the desks in the outer office  she was stylishly dressed as bartley saw and her smooth yellow hair was sculpturesquely waved over a low white forehead  here said lapham with the same prompt gruff kindness that he had used in addressing the young man i want you should put these in shape and give me a typewriter copy tomorrow  what an uncommonly pretty girl said bartley as they descended the rough stairway and found their way out to the street past the dangling rope of a block and tackle wandering up into the cavernous darkness overhead  she does her work said lapham shortly  bartley mounted to the left side of the open buggy standing at the curbstone and lapham gathering up the hitchingweight slid it under the buggyseat and mounted beside him  no chance to speed a horse here of course said lapham while the horse with a spirited gentleness picked her way with a high long action over the pavement of the street  the streets were all narrow and most of them crooked in that quarter of the town but at the end of one the spars of a vessel pencilled themselves delicately against the cool blue of the afternoon sky  the air was full of a smell pleasantly compounded of oakum of leather and of oil  it was not the busy season and they met only two or three trucks heavily straggling toward the wharf with their long string teams but the cobblestones of the pavement were worn with the dint of ponderous wheels and discoloured with ironrust from them here and there in wandering streaks over its surface was the grey stain of the salt water with which the street had been sprinkled  after an interval of some minutes which both men spent in looking round the dashboard from opposite sides to watch the stride of the horse bartley said with a light sigh i had a colt once down in maine that stepped just like that mare  well said lapham sympathetically recognising the bond that this fact created between them  well now i tell you what you do  you let me come for you most any afternoon now and take you out over the milldam and speed this mare a little  id like to show you what this mare can do  yes i would  all right answered bartley ill let you know my first day off  good cried lapham  kentucky queried bartley  no sir  i dont ride behind anything but vermont never did  touch of morgan of course but you cant have much morgan in a horse if you want speed  hambletonian mostly  whered you say you wanted to get out  i guess you may put me down at the events office just round the corner here  ive got to write up this interview while its fresh  all right said lapham impersonally assenting to bartleys use of him as material  he had not much to complain of in bartleys treatment unless it was the strain of extravagant compliment which it involved  but the flattery was mainly for the paint whose virtues lapham did not believe could be overstated and himself and his history had been treated with as much respect as bartley was capable of showing any one  he made a very picturesque thing of the discovery of the paintmine deep in the heart of the virgin forests of vermont far up toward the line of the canadian snows on a desolate mountainside where an autumnal storm had done its wild work and the great trees strewn hither and thither bore witness to its violence nehemiah lapham discovered just forty years ago the mineral which the alchemy of his sons enterprise and energy has transmuted into solid ingots of the most precious of metals the colossal fortune of colonel silas lapham lay at the bottom of a hole which an uprooted tree had dug for him and which for many years remained a paintmine of no more appreciable value than a soapmine  here bartley had not been able to forego another grin but he compensated for it by the high reverence with which he spoke of colonel laphams record during the war of the rebellion and of the motives which impelled him to turn aside from an enterprise in which his whole heart was engaged and take part in the struggle  the colonel bears embedded in the muscle of his right leg a little memento of the period in the shape of a minieball which he jocularly referred to as his thermometer and which relieves him from the necessity of reading the probabilities in his morning paper  this saves him just so much time and for a man who as he said has not a moment of waste time on him anywhere five minutes a day are something in the course of a year simple clear bold and straightforward in mind and action colonel silas lapham with a prompt comprehensiveness and a neverfailing business sagacity is in the best sense of that muchabused term one of natures noblemen to the last inch of his five eleven and a half his life affords an example of singleminded application and unwavering perseverance which our young business men would do well to emulate there is nothing showy or meretricious about the man  he believes in mineral paint and he puts his heart and soul into it  he makes it a religion though we would not imply that it is his religion  colonel lapham is a regular attendant at the rev dr langworthys church  he subscribes liberally to the associated charities and no good object or worthy public enterprise fails to receive his support  he is not now actively in politics and his paint is not partisan but it is an open secret that he is and always has been a staunch republican  without violating the sanctities of private life we cannot speak fully of various details which came out in the free and unembarrassed interview which colonel lapham accorded our representative  but we may say that the success of which he is justly proud he is also proud to attribute in great measure to the sympathy and energy of his wifeone of those women who in whatever walk of life seem born to honour the name of american woman and to redeem it from the national reproach of daisy millerism  of colonel laphams family we will simply add that it consists of two young lady daughters  the subject of this very inadequate sketch is building a house on the water side of beacon street after designs by one of our leading architectural firms which when complete will be one of the finest ornaments of that exclusive avenue  it will we believe be ready for the occupancy of the family sometime in the spring  when bartley had finished his article which he did with a good deal of inward derision he went home to marcia still smiling over the thought of lapham whose burly simplicity had peculiarly amused him  he regularly turned himself inside out to me he said as he sat describing his interview to marcia  then i know you could make something nice out of it said his wife and that will please mr witherby  oh yes ive done pretty well but i couldnt let myself loose on him the way i wanted to  confound the limitations of decency anyway i should like to have told just what colonel lapham thought of landscape advertising in colonel laphams own words  ill tell you one thing marsh he had a girl there at one of the desks that you wouldnt let me have within gunshot of my office  pretty it aint any name for it marcias eyes began to blaze and bartley broke out into a laugh in which he arrested himself at sight of a formidable parcel in the corner of the room  hello whats that  why i dont know what it is replied marcia tremulously  a man brought it just before you came in and i didnt like to open it  think it was some kind of infernal machine asked bartley getting down on his knees to examine the package  mrs b hubbard heigh he cut the heavy hemp string with his penknife  we must look into this thing  i should like to know whos sending packages to mrs hubbard in my absence he unfolded the wrappings of paper growing softer and finer inward and presently pulled out a handsome square glass jar through which a crimson mass showed richly  the persis brand he yelled  i knew it  oh what is it bartley quavered marcia  then courageously drawing a little nearer is it some kind of jam she implored  jam no roared bartley  its paint its mineral paintlaphams paint  paint echoed marcia as she stood over him while he stripped their wrappings from the jars which showed the dark blue dark green light brown dark brown and black with the dark crimson forming the gamut of colour of the lapham paint  dont tell me its paint that i can use bartley  well i shouldnt advise you to use much of itall at once replied her husband  but its paint that you can use in moderation  marcia cast her arms round his neck and kissed him  o bartley i think im the happiest girl in the world  i was just wondering what i should do  there are places in that clover street house that need touching up so dreadfully  i shall be very careful  you neednt be afraid i shall overdo  but this just saves my life  did you buy it bartley you know we couldnt afford it and you oughtnt to have done it and what does the persis brand mean  buy it cried bartley  no the old fools sent it to you as a present  youd better wait for the facts before you pitch into me for extravagance marcia  persis is the name of his wife and he named it after her because its his finest brand  youll see it in my interview  put it on the market her last birthday for a surprise to her  what old fool faltered marcia  why laphamthe mineral paint man  oh what a good man sighed marcia from the bottom of her soul bartley you wont make fun of him as you do of some of those people will you  nothing that hell ever find out said bartley getting up and brushing off the carpetlint from his knees    ii   after dropping bartley hubbard at the events building lapham drove on down washington street to nankeen square at the south end where he had lived ever since the mistaken movement of society in that direction ceased  he had not built but had bought very cheap of a terrified gentleman of good extraction who discovered too late that the south end was not the thing and who in the eagerness of his flight to the back bay threw in his carpets and shades for almost nothing  mrs lapham was even better satisfied with their bargain than the colonel himself and they had lived in nankeen square for twelve years  they had seen the saplings planted in the pretty oval round which the houses were built flourish up into sturdy young trees and their two little girls in the same period had grown into young ladies the colonels tough frame had expanded into the bulk which bartleys interview indicated and mrs lapham while keeping a more youthful outline showed the sharp print of the crowsfoot at the corners of her motherly eyes and certain slight creases in her wholesome cheeks  the fact that they lived in an unfashionable neighbourhood was something that they had never been made to feel to their personal disadvantage and they had hardly known it till the summer before this story opens when mrs lapham and her daughter irene had met some other bostonians far from boston who made it memorable  they were people whom chance had brought for the time under a singular obligation to the lapham ladies and they were gratefully recognisant of it  they had ventureda mother and two daughtersas far as a rather wild little canadian wateringplace on the st lawrence below quebec and had arrived some days before their son and brother was expected to join them  two of their trunks had gone astray and on the night of their arrival the mother was taken violently ill  mrs lapham came to their help with her skill as nurse and with the abundance of her own and her daughters wardrobe and a profuse singlehearted kindness  when a doctor could be got at he said that but for mrs laphams timely care the lady would hardly have lived  he was a very effusive little frenchman and fancied he was saying something very pleasant to everybody  a certain intimacy inevitably followed and when the son came he was even more grateful than the others  mrs lapham could not quite understand why he should be as attentive to her as to irene but she compared him with other young men about the place and thought him nicer than any of them  she had not the means of a wider comparison for in boston with all her husbands prosperity they had not had a social life  their first years there were given to careful getting on laphams part and careful saving on his wifes  suddenly the money began to come so abundantly that she need not save and then they did not know what to do with it  a certain amount could be spent on horses and lapham spent it his wife spent on rich and rather ugly clothes and a luxury of household appointments  lapham had not yet reached the picturebuying stage of the rich mans development but they decorated their house with the costliest and most abominable frescoes they went upon journeys and lavished upon cars and hotels they gave with both hands to their church and to all the charities it brought them acquainted with but they did not know how to spend on society  up to a certain period mrs lapham had the ladies of her neighbourhood in to tea as her mother had done in the country in her younger days  laphams idea of hospitality was still to bring a heavybuying customer home to potluck neither of them imagined dinners  their two girls had gone to the public schools where they had not got on as fast as some of the other girls so that they were a year behind in graduating from the grammarschool where lapham thought that they had got education enough  his wife was of a different mind she would have liked them to go to some private school for their finishing  but irene did not care for study she preferred housekeeping and both the sisters were afraid of being snubbed by the other girls who were of a different sort from the girls of the grammarschool these were mostly from the parks and squares like themselves  it ended in their going part of a year  but the elder had an odd taste of her own for reading and she took some private lessons and read books out of the circulating library the whole family were amazed at the number she read and rather proud of it  they were not girls who embroidered or abandoned themselves to needlework irene spent her abundant leisure in shopping for herself and her mother of whom both daughters made a kind of idol buying her caps and laces out of their pinmoney and getting her dresses far beyond her capacity to wear  irene dressed herself very stylishly and spent hours on her toilet every day  her sister had a simpler taste and if she had done altogether as she liked might even have slighted dress  they all three took long naps every day and sat hours together minutely discussing what they saw out of the window  in her selfguided search for selfimprovement the elder sister went to many church lectures on a vast variety of secular subjects and usually came home with a comic account of them and that made more matter of talk for the whole family  she could make fun of nearly everything irene complained that she scared away the young men whom they got acquainted with at the dancingschool sociables  they were perhaps not the wisest young men  the girls had learned to dance at papantis but they had not belonged to the private classes  they did not even know of them and a great gulf divided them from those who did  their father did not like company except such as came informally in their way and their mother had remained too rustic to know how to attract it in the sophisticated city fashion  none of them had grasped the idea of european travel but they had gone about to mountain and seaside resorts the mother and the two girls where they witnessed the spectacle which such resorts present throughout new england of multitudes of girls lovely accomplished exquisitely dressed humbly glad of the presence of any sort of young man but the laphams had no skill or courage to make themselves noticed far less courted by the solitary invalid or clergyman or artist  they lurked helplessly about in the hotel parlours looking on and not knowing how to put themselves forward perhaps they did not care a great deal to do so  they had not a conceit of themselves but a sort of content in their own ways that one may notice in certain families  the very strength of their mutual affection was a barrier to worldly knowledge they dressed for one another they equipped their house for their own satisfaction they lived richly to themselves not because they were selfish but because they did not know how to do otherwise  the elder daughter did not care for society apparently  the younger who was but three years younger was not yet quite old enough to be ambitious of it  with all her wonderful beauty she had an innocence almost vegetable  when her beauty which in its immaturity was crude and harsh suddenly ripened she bloomed and glowed with the unconsciousness of a flower she not merely did not feel herself admired but hardly knew herself discovered  if she dressed well perhaps too well it was because she had the instinct of dress but till she met this young man who was so nice to her at baie st paul she had scarcely lived a detached individual life so wholly had she depended on her mother and her sister for her opinions almost her sensations  she took account of everything he did and said pondering it and trying to make out exactly what he meant to the inflection of a syllable the slightest movement or gesture  in this way she began for the first time to form ideas which she had not derived from her family and they were none the less her own because they were often mistaken  some of the things that he partly said partly looked she reported to her mother and they talked them over as they did everything relating to these new acquaintances and wrought them into the novel point of view which they were acquiring  when mrs lapham returned home she submitted all the accumulated facts of the case and all her own conjectures to her husband and canvassed them anew  at first he was disposed to regard the whole affair as of small importance and she had to insist a little beyond her own convictions in order to counteract his indifference  well i can tell you she said that if you think they were not the nicest people you ever saw youre mightily mistaken  they had about the best manners and they had been everywhere and knew everything  i declare it made me feel as if we had always lived in the backwoods  i dont know but the mother and the daughters would have let you feel so a little if theyd showed out all they thought but they never did and the sonwell i cant express it silas but that young man had about perfect ways  seem struck up on irene asked the colonel  how can i tell he seemed just about as much struck up on me  anyway he paid me as much attention as he did her  perhaps its more the way now to notice the mother than it used to be  lapham ventured no conjecture but asked as he had asked already who the people were  mrs lapham repeated their name  lapham nodded his head  do you know them what business is he in  i guess he aint in anything said lapham  they were very nice said mrs lapham impartially  well theyd ought to be returned the colonel  never done anything else  they didnt seem stuck up urged his wife  theyd no need towith you  i could buy him and sell him twice over  this answer satisfied mrs lapham rather with the fact than with her husband  well i guess i wouldnt brag silas she said  in the winter the ladies of this family who returned to town very late came to call on mrs lapham  they were again very polite  but the mother let drop in apology for their calling almost at nightfall that the coachman had not known the way exactly  nearly all our friends are on the new land or on the hill  there was a barb in this that rankled after the ladies had gone and on comparing notes with her daughter mrs lapham found that a barb had been left to rankle in her mind also  they said they had never been in this part of the town before  upon a strict search of her memory irene could not report that the fact had been stated with anything like insinuation but it was that which gave it a more penetrating effect  oh well of course said lapham to whom these facts were referred those sort of people havent got much business up our way and they dont come  its a fair thing all round  we dont trouble the hill or the new land much  we know where they are suggested his wife thoughtfully  yes assented the colonel  i know where they are  ive got a lot of land over on the back bay  you have eagerly demanded his wife  want me to build on it he asked in reply with a quizzical smile  i guess we can get along here for a while  this was at night  in the morning mrs lapham said  i suppose we ought to do the best we can for the children in every way  i supposed we always had replied her husband  yes we have according to our light  have you got some new light  i dont know as its light  but if the girls are going to keep on living in boston and marry here i presume we ought to try to get them into society some way or ought to do something  well whos ever done more for their children than we have demanded lapham with a pang at the thought that he could possibly have been outdone dont they have everything they want dont they dress just as you say dont you go everywhere with em is there ever anything going on thats worth while that they dont see it or hear it i dont know what you mean  why dont you get them into society theres money enough  theres got to be something besides money i guess said mrs lapham with a hopeless sigh  i presume we didnt go to work just the right way about their schooling  we ought to have got them into some school where theyd have got acquainted with city girlsgirls who could help them along  nearly everybody at miss smillies was from some where else  well its pretty late to think about that now grumbled lapham  and weve always gone our own way and not looked out for the future we ought to have gone out more and had people come to the house nobody comes  well is that my fault i guess nobody ever makes people welcomer  we ought to have invited company more  why dont you do it now if its for the girls i dont care if you have the house full all the while  mrs lapham was forced to a confession full of humiliation  i dont know who to ask  well you cant expect me to tell you  no were both country people and weve kept our country ways and we dont either of us know what to do  youve had to work so hard and your luck was so long coming and then it came with such a rush that we havent had any chance to learn what to do with it  its just the same with irenes looks i didnt expect she was ever going to have any she was such a plain child and all at once shes blazed out this way  as long as it was pen that didnt seem to care for society i didnt give much mind to it  but i can see its going to be different with irene  i dont believe but what were in the wrong neighbourhood  well said the colonel there aint a prettier lot on the back bay than mine  its on the water side of beacon and its twentyeight feet wide and a hundred and fifty deep  lets build on it  mrs lapham was silent a while  no she said finally weve always got along well enough here and i guess we better stay  at breakfast she said casually girls how would you like to have your father build on the new land  the girls said they did not know  it was more convenient to the horsecars where they were  mrs lapham stole a look of relief at her husband and nothing more was said of the matter  the mother of the family who had called upon mrs lapham brought her husbands cards and when mrs lapham returned the visit she was in some trouble about the proper form of acknowledging the civility  the colonel had no card but a business card which advertised the principal depot and the several agencies of the mineral paint and mrs lapham doubted till she wished to goodness that she had never seen nor heard of those people whether to ignore her husband in the transaction altogether or to write his name on her own card  she decided finally upon this measure and she had the relief of not finding the family at home  as far as she could judge irene seemed to suffer a little disappointment from the fact  for several months there was no communication between the families then there came to nankeen square a lithographed circular from the people on the hill signed in ink by the mother and affording mrs lapham an opportunity to subscribe for a charity of undeniable merit and acceptability  she submitted it to her husband who promptly drew a cheque for five hundred dollars  she tore it in two  i will take a cheque for a hundred silas she said  why he asked looking up guiltily at her  because a hundred is enough and i dont want to show off before them  oh i thought may be you did  well pert he added having satisfied human nature by the preliminary thrust i guess youre about right when do you want i should begin to build on beacon street he handed her the new cheque where she stood over him and then leaned back in his chair and looked up at her  i dont want you should begin at all  what do you mean silas she rested against the side of his desk  well i dont know as i mean anything  but shouldnt you like to build everybody builds at least once in a lifetime  where is your lot they say its unhealthy over there  up to a certain point in their prosperity mrs lapham had kept strict account of all her husbands affairs but as they expanded and ceased to be of the retail nature with which women successfully grapple the intimate knowledge of them made her nervous  there was a period in which she felt that they were being ruined but the crash had not come and since his great success she had abandoned herself to a blind confidence in her husbands judgment which she had hitherto felt needed her revision  he came and went day by day unquestioned  he bought and sold and got gain  she knew that he would tell her if ever things went wrong and he knew that she would ask him whenever she was anxious  it aint unhealthy where ive bought said lapham rather enjoying her insinuation  i looked after that when i was trading and i guess its about as healthy on the back bay as it is here anyway  i got that lot for you pert i thought youd want to build on the back bay some day  pshaw said mrs lapham deeply pleased inwardly but not going to show it as she would have said  i guess you want to build there yourself she insensibly got a little nearer to her husband  they liked to talk to each other in that blunt way it is the new england way of expressing perfect confidence and tenderness  well i guess i do said lapham not insisting upon the unselfish view of the matter  i always did like the water side of beacon there aint a sightlier place in the world for a house  and some day theres bound to be a driveway all along behind them houses between them and the water and then a lot there is going to be worth the gold that will cover itcoin  ive had offers for that lot pert twice over what i give for it  yes i have  dont you want to ride over there some afternoon with me and see it im satisfied where we be si said mrs lapham recurring to the parlance of her youth in her pathos at her husbands kindness  she sighed anxiously for she felt the trouble a woman knows in view of any great change  they had often talked of altering over the house in which they lived but they had never come to it and they had often talked of building but it had always been a house in the country that they had thought of  i wish you had sold that lot  i haint said the colonel briefly  i dont know as i feel much like changing our way of living  guess we could live there pretty much as we live here  theres all kinds of people on beacon street you mustnt think theyre all bigbugs i know one party that lives in a house he built to sell and his wife dont keep any girl  you can have just as much style there as you want or just as little  i guess we live as well as most of em now and set as good a table  and if you come to style i dont know as anybody has got more of a right to put it on than what we have  well i dont want to build on beacon street si said mrs lapham gently  just as you please persis  i aint in any hurry to leave  mrs lapham stood flapping the cheque which she held in her right hand against the edge of her left  the colonel still sat looking up at her face and watching the effect of the poison of ambition which he had artfully instilled into her mind  she sighed againa yielding sigh  what are you going to do this afternoon  im going to take a turn on the brighton road said the colonel  i dont believe but what i should like to go along said his wife  all right  you haint ever rode behind that mare yet pert and i want you should see me let her out once  they say the snows all packed down already and the going is a 1  at four oclock in the afternoon with a cold red winter sunset before them the colonel and his wife were driving slowly down beacon street in the light highseated cutter where as he said they were a pretty tight fit  he was holding the mare in till the time came to speed her and the mare was springily jolting over the snow looking intelligently from side to side and cocking this ear and that while from her nostrils her head tossing easily she blew quick irregular whiffs of steam  gay aint she proudly suggested the colonel  she is gay assented his wife  they met swiftly dashing sleighs and let them pass on either hand down the beautiful avenue narrowing with an admirably even skyline in the perspective  they were not in a hurry  the mare jounced easily along and they talked of the different houses on either side of the way  they had a crude taste in architecture and they admired the worst  there were womens faces at many of the handsome windows and once in a while a young man on the pavement caught his hat suddenly from his head and bowed in response to some salutation from within  i dont think our girls would look very bad behind one of those big panes said the colonel  no said his wife dreamily  wheres the young man did he come with them  no he was to spend the winter with a friend of his that has a ranch in texas  i guess hes got to do something  yes gentlemaning as a profession has got to play out in a generation or two  neither of them spoke of the lot though lapham knew perfectly well what his wife had come with him for and she was aware that he knew it the time came when he brought the mare down to a walk and then slowed up almost to a stop while they both turned their heads to the right and looked at the vacant lot through which showed the frozen stretch of the back bay a section of the long bridge and the roofs and smokestacks of charlestown  yes its sightly said mrs lapham lifting her hand from the reins on which she had unconsciously laid it  lapham said nothing but he let the mare out a little  the sleighs and cutters were thickening round them  on the milldam it became difficult to restrict the mare to the long slow trot into which he let her break  the beautiful landscape widened to right and left of them with the sunset redder and redder over the low irregular hills before them  they crossed the milldam into longwood and here from the crest of the first upland stretched two endless lines in which thousands of cutters went and came  some of the drivers were already speeding their horses and these shot to and fro on inner lines between the slowly moving vehicles on either side of the road  here and there a burly mounted policeman bulging over the pommel of his mclellan saddle jolted by silently gesturing and directing the course and keeping it all under the eye of the law  it was what bartley hubbard called a carnival of fashion and gaiety on the brighton road in his account of it  but most of the people in those elegant sleighs and cutters had so little the air of the great world that one knowing it at all must have wondered where they and their money came from and the gaiety of the men at least was expressed like that of colonel lapham in a grim almost fierce alertness the women wore an air of courageous apprehension  at a certain point the colonel said im going to let her out pert and he lifted and then dropped the reins lightly on the mares back  she understood the signal and as an admirer said she laid down to her work nothing in the immutable iron of laphams face betrayed his sense of triumph as the mare left everything behind her on the road mrs lapham if she felt fear was too busy holding her flying wraps about her and shielding her face from the scud of ice flung from the mares heels to betray it except for the rush of her feet the mare was as silent as the people behind her the muscles of her back and thighs worked more and more swiftly like some mechanism responding to an alien force and she shot to the end of the course grazing a hundred encountered and rival sledges in her passage but unmolested by the policemen who probably saw that the mare and the colonel knew what they were about and at any rate were not the sort of men to interfere with trotting like that  at the end of the heat lapham drew her in and turned off on a side street into brookline  tell you what pert he said as if they had been quietly jogging along with time for uninterrupted thought since he last spoke ive about made up my mind to build on that lot  all right silas said mrs lapham i suppose you know what youre about  dont build on it for me thats all  when she stood in the hall at home taking off her things she said to the girls who were helping her some day your father will get killed with that mare  did he speed her asked penelope the elder  she was named after her grandmother who had in her turn inherited from another ancestress the name of the homeric matron whose peculiar merits won her a place even among the puritan faiths hopes temperances and prudences  penelope was the girl whose odd serious face had struck bartley hubbard in the photograph of the family group lapham showed him on the day of the interview  her large eyes like her hair were brown they had the peculiar look of nearsighted eyes which is called mooning her complexion was of a dark pallor  her mother did not reply to a question which might be considered already answered  he says hes going to build on that lot of his she next remarked unwinding the long veil which she had tied round her neck to hold her bonnet on  she put her hat and cloak on the hall table to be carried upstairs later and they all went in to tea creamed oysters birds hot biscuit two kinds of cake and dishes of stewed and canned fruit and honey  the women dined alone at one and the colonel at the same hour downtown but he liked a good hot meal when he got home in the evening  the house flared with gas and the colonel before he sat down went about shutting the registers through which a welding heat came voluming up from the furnace  ill be the death of that darkey yet he said if he dont stop making on such a fire  the only way to get any comfort out of your furnace is to take care of it yourself  well answered his wife from behind the teapot as he sat down at table with this threat theres nothing to prevent you si  and you can shovel the snow too if you want totill you get over to beacon street anyway  i guess i can keep my own sidewalk on beacon street clean if i take the notion  i should like to see you at it retorted his wife  well you keep a sharp lookout and may be you will  their taunts were really expressions of affectionate pride in each other  they liked to have it give and take that way as they would have said right along  a man can be a man on beacon street as well as anywhere i guess  well ill do the wash as i used to in lumberville said mrs lapham  i presume youll let me have set tubs si  you know i aint so young any more she passed irene a cup of oolong teanone of them had a sufficiently cultivated palate for souchongand the girl handed it to her father  papa she asked you dont really mean that youre going to build over there  dont i you wait and see said the colonel stirring his tea  i dont believe you do pursued the girl  is that so i presume youd hate to have me  your mother does he said doos of course  penelope took the word  i go in for it  i dont see any use in not enjoying money if youve got it to enjoy  thats what its for i suppose though you mightnt always think so she had a slow quaint way of talking that seemed a pleasant personal modification of some ancestral yankee drawl and her voice was low and cozy and so far from being nasal that it was a little hoarse  i guess the ayes has it pen said her father  how would it do to let irene and your mother stick in the old place here and us go into the new house at times the colonels grammar failed him  the matter dropped and the laphams lived on as before with joking recurrences to the house on the water side of beacon  the colonel seemed less in earnest than any of them about it but that was his way his girls said you never could tell when he really meant a thing    iii   toward the end of the winter there came a newspaper addressed to miss irene lapham it proved to be a texas newspaper with a complimentary account of the ranch of the hon loring g stanton which the representative of the journal had visited  it must be his friend said mrs lapham to whom her daughter brought the paper the one hes staying with  the girl did not say anything but she carried the paper to her room where she scanned every line of it for another name  she did not find it but she cut the notice out and stuck it into the side of her mirror where she could read it every morning when she brushed her hair and the last thing at night when she looked at herself in the glass just before turning off the gas  her sister often read it aloud standing behind her and rendering it with elocutionary effects  the first time i ever heard of a loveletter in the form of a puff to a cattleranch but perhaps thats the style on the hill  mrs lapham told her husband of the arrival of the paper treating the fact with an importance that he refused to see in it  how do you know the fellow sent it anyway he demanded  oh i know he did  i dont see why he couldnt write to rene if he really meant anything  well i guess that wouldnt be their way said mrs lapham she did not at all know what their way would be  when the spring opened colonel lapham showed that he had been in earnest about building on the new land  his idea of a house was a brownstone front four stories high and a french roof with an airchamber above  inside there was to be a receptionroom on the street and a diningroom back  the parlours were to be on the second floor and finished in black walnut or partycoloured paint  the chambers were to be on the three floors above front and rear with siderooms over the front door  black walnut was to be used everywhere except in the attic which was to be painted and grained to look like black walnut  the whole was to be very highstudded and there were to be handsome cornices and elaborate centrepieces throughout except again in the attic  these ideas he had formed from the inspection of many new buildings which he had seen going up and which he had a passion for looking into  he was confirmed in his ideas by a master builder who had put up a great many houses on the back bay as a speculation and who told him that if he wanted to have a house in the style that was the way to have it  the beginnings of the process by which lapham escaped from the master builder and ended in the hands of an architect are so obscure that it would be almost impossible to trace them  but it all happened and lapham promptly developed his ideas of black walnut finish high studding and cornices  the architect was able to conceal the shudder which they must have sent through him  he was skilful as nearly all architects are in playing upon that simple instrument man  he began to touch colonel laphams stops  oh certainly have the parlours highstudded but youve seen some of those pretty oldfashioned countryhouses havent you where the entrancestory is very lowstudded yes lapham assented  well dont you think something of that kind would have a very nice effect have the entrancestory lowstudded and your parlours on the next floor as high as you please  put your little receptionroom here beside the door and get the whole width of your house frontage for a square hall and an easy lowtread staircase running up three sides of it  im sure mrs lapham would find it much pleasanter the architect caught toward him a scrap of paper lying on the table at which they were sitting and sketched his idea  then have your diningroom behind the hall looking on the water  he glanced at mrs lapham who said of course and the architect went on  that gets you rid of one of those long straight ugly staircasesuntil that moment lapham had thought a long straight staircase the chief ornament of a houseand gives you an effect of amplitude and space  thats so said mrs lapham  her husband merely made a noise in his throat  then were you thinking of having your parlours together connected by folding doors asked the architect deferentially  yes of course said lapham  theyre always so aint they  well nearly said the architect  i was wondering how would it do to make one large square room at the front taking the whole breadth of the house and with this hallspace between have a musicroom back for the young ladies  lapham looked helplessly at his wife whose quicker apprehension had followed the architects pencil with instant sympathy  firstrate she cried  the colonel gave way  i guess that would do  itll be kind of odd wont it  well i dont know said the architect  not so odd i hope as the other thing will be a few years from now he went on to plan the rest of the house and he showed himself such a master in regard to all the practical details that mrs lapham began to feel a motherly affection for the young man and her husband could not deny in his heart that the fellow seemed to understand his business  he stopped walking about the room as he had begun to do when the architect and mrs lapham entered into the particulars of closets drainage kitchen arrangements and all that and came back to the table  i presume he said youll have the drawingroom finished in black walnut  well yes replied the architect if you like  but some less expensive wood can be made just as effective with paint  of course you can paint black walnut too  paint it gasped the colonel  yes said the architect quietly  white or a little off white  lapham dropped the plan he had picked up from the table  his wife made a little move toward him of consolation or support  of course resumed the architect i know there has been a great craze for black walnut  but its an ugly wood and for a drawingroom there is really nothing like white paint  we should want to introduce a little gold here and there  perhaps we might run a painted frieze round under the cornicegarlands of roses on a gold ground it would tell wonderfully in a white room  the colonel returned less courageously to the charge  i presume youll want eastlake mantelshelves and tiles he meant this for a sarcastic thrust at a prevailing foible of the profession  well no gently answered the architect  i was thinking perhaps a white marble chimneypiece treated in the refined empire style would be the thing for that room  white marble exclaimed the colonel  i thought that had gone out long ago  really beautiful things cant go out  they may disappear for a little while but they must come back  its only the ugly things that stay out after theyve had their day  lapham could only venture very modestly hardwood floors  in the musicroom of course consented the architect  and in the drawingroom  carpet some sort of moquette i should say  but i should prefer to consult mrs laphams taste in that matter  and in the other rooms  oh carpets of course  and what about the stairs  carpet and i should have the rail and banisters whitebanisters turned or twisted  the colonel said under his breath well im dumned but he gave no utterance to his astonishment in the architects presence  when he went at lastthe session did not end till eleven oclocklapham said well pert i guess that fellows fifty years behind or ten years ahead  i wonder what the ongpeer style is  i dont know  i hated to ask  but he seemed to understand what he was talking about  i declare he knows what a woman wants in a house better than she does herself  and a mans simply nowhere in comparison said lapham  but he respected a fellow who could beat him at every point and have a reason ready as this architect had and when he recovered from the daze into which the complete upheaval of all his preconceived notions had left him he was in a fit state to swear by the architect  it seemed to him that he had discovered the fellow as he always called him and owned him now and the fellow did nothing to disturb this impression  he entered into that brief but intense intimacy with the laphams which the sympathetic architect holds with his clients  he was privy to all their differences of opinion and all their disputes about the house he knew just where to insist upon his own ideas and where to yield he was really building several other houses but he gave the laphams the impression that he was doing none but theirs  the work was not begun till the frost was thoroughly out of the ground which that year was not before the end of april  even then it did not proceed very rapidly  lapham said they might as well take their time to it if they got the walls up and the thing closed in before the snow flew they could be working at it all winter  it was found necessary to dig for the kitchen at that point the original saltmarsh lay near the surface and before they began to put in the piles for the foundation they had to pump  the neighbourhood smelt like the hold of a ship after a three years voyage  people who had cast their fortunes with the new land went by professing not to notice it people who still hung on to the hill put their handkerchiefs to their noses and told each other the old terrible stories of the material used in filling up the back bay  nothing gave lapham so much satisfaction in the whole construction of his house as the piledriving when this began early in the summer he took mrs lapham every day in his buggy and drove round to look at it stopping the mare in front of the lot and watching the operation with even keener interest than the little loafing irish boys who superintended it in force  it pleased him to hear the portable engine chuckle out a hundred thin whiffs of steam in carrying the big iron weight to the top of the framework above the pile then seem to hesitate and cough once or twice in pressing the weight against the detaching apparatus  there was a moment in which the weight had the effect of poising before it fell then it dropped with a mighty whack on the ironbound head of the pile and drove it a foot into the earth  by gracious he would say there aint anything like that in this world for business persis  mrs lapham suffered him to enjoy the sight twenty or thirty times before she said well now drive on si  by the time the foundation was in and the brick walls had begun to go up there were so few people left in the neighbourhood that she might indulge with impunity her husbands passion for having her clamber over the floortimbers and the skeleton staircases with him  many of the householders had boarded up their front doors before the buds had begun to swell and the assessor to appear in early may others had followed soon and mrs lapham was as safe from remark as if she had been in the depth of the country  ordinarily she and her girls left town early in july going to one of the hotels at nantasket where it was convenient for the colonel to get to and from his business by the boat  but this summer they were all lingering a few weeks later under the novel fascination of the new house as they called it as if there were no other in the world  lapham drove there with his wife after he had set bartley hubbard down at the events office but on this day something happened that interfered with the solid pleasure they usually took in going over the house  as the colonel turned from casting anchor at the mares head with the hitchingweight after helping his wife to alight he encountered a man to whom he could not help speaking though the man seemed to share his hesitation if not his reluctance at the necessity he was a tallish thin man with a dustcoloured face and a dead clerical air which somehow suggested at once feebleness and tenacity  mrs lapham held out her hand to him  why mr rogers she exclaimed and then turning toward her husband seemed to refer the two men to each other  they shook hands but lapham did not speak  i didnt know you were in boston pursued mrs lapham  is mrs rogers with you  no said mr rogers with a voice which had the flat succinct sound of two pieces of wood clapped together  mrs rogers is still in chicago  a little silence followed and then mrs lapham said  i presume you are quite settled out there  no we have left chicago  mrs rogers has merely remained to finish up a little packing  oh indeed are you coming back to boston  i cannot say as yet  we sometimes think of so doing  lapham turned away and looked up at the building  his wife pulled a little at her glove as if embarrassed or even pained  she tried to make a diversion  we are building a house she said with a meaningless laugh  oh indeed said mr rogers looking up at it  then no one spoke again and she said helplessly  if you come to boston i hope i shall see mrs rogers  she will be happy to have you call said mr rogers  he touched his hatbrim and made a bow forward rather than in mrs laphams direction  she mounted the planking that led into the shelter of the bare brick walls and her husband slowly followed  when she turned her face toward him her cheeks were burning and tears that looked hot stood in her eyes  you left it all to me she cried  why couldnt you speak a word  i hadnt anything to say to him replied lapham sullenly  they stood a while without looking at the work which they had come to enjoy and without speaking to each other  i suppose we might as well go on said mrs lapham at last as they returned to the buggy  the colonel drove recklessly toward the milldam  his wife kept her veil down and her face turned from him after a time she put her handkerchief up under her veil and wiped her eyes and he set his teeth and squared his jaw  i dont see how he always manages to appear just at the moment when he seems to have gone fairly out of our lives and blight everything she whimpered  i supposed he was dead said lapham  oh dont say such a thing it sounds as if you wished it  why do you mind it what do you let him blight everything for  i cant help it and i dont believe i ever shall  i dont know as his being dead would help it any  i cant ever see him without feeling just as i did at first  i tell you said lapham it was a perfectly square thing  and i wish once for all you would quit bothering about it  my conscience is easy as far as he is concerned and it always was  and i cant look at him without feeling as if youd ruined him silas  dont look at him then said her husband with a scowl  i want you should recollect in the first place persis that i never wanted a partner  if he hadnt put his money in when he did youd a broken down  well he got his money out again and more too said the colonel with a sulky weariness  he didnt want to take it out  i gave him his choice buy out or go out  you know he couldnt buy out then  it was no choice at all  it was a business chance  no you had better face the truth silas  it was no chance at all you crowded him out  a man that had saved you no you had got greedy silas  you had made your paint your god and you couldnt bear to let anybody else share in its blessings  i tell you he was a drag and a brake on me from the word go  you say he saved me  well if i hadnt got him out hed a ruined me sooner or later  so its an even thing as far forth as that goes  no it aint an even thing and you know it silas  oh if i could only get you once to acknowledge that you did wrong about it then i should have some hope  i dont say you meant wrong exactly but you took an advantage  yes you took an advantage you had him where he couldnt help himself and then you wouldnt show him any mercy  im sick of this said lapham  if youll tend to the house ill manage my business without your help  you were very glad of my help once  well im tired of it now  dont meddle  i will meddle  when i see you hardening yourself in a wrong thing its time for me to meddle as you call it and i will  i cant ever get you to own up the least bit about rogers and i feel as if it was hurting you all the while  what do you want i should own up about a thing for when i dont feel wrong i tell you rogers haint got anything to complain of and thats what i told you from the start  its a thing thats done every day  i was loaded up with a partner that didnt know anything and couldnt do anything and i unloaded thats all  you unloaded just at the time when you knew that your paint was going to be worth about twice what it ever had been and you wanted all the advantage for yourself  i had a right to it  i made the success  yes you made it with rogerss money and when youd made it you took his share of it  i guess you thought of that when you saw him and thats why you couldnt look him in the face  at these words lapham lost his temper  i guess you dont want to ride with me any more today he said turning the mare abruptly round  im as ready to go back as what you are replied his wife  and dont you ask me to go to that house with you any more  you can sell it for all me  i shant live in it  theres blood on it    iv   the silken texture of the marriage tie bears a daily strain of wrong and insult to which no other human relation can be subjected without lesion and sometimes the strength that knits society together might appear to the eye of faltering faith the curse of those immediately bound by it  two people by no means reckless of each others rights and feelings but even tender of them for the most part may tear at each others heartstrings in this sacred bond with perfect impunity though if they were any other two they would not speak or look at each other again after the outrages they exchange  it is certainly a curious spectacle and doubtless it ought to convince an observer of the divinity of the institution  if the husband and wife are blunt outspoken people like the laphams they do not weigh their words if they are more refined they weigh them very carefully and know accurately just how far they will carry and in what most sensitive spot they may be planted with most effect  lapham was proud of his wife and when he married her it had been a rise in life for him  for a while he stood in awe of his good fortune but this could not last and he simply remained supremely satisfied with it  the girl who had taught school with a clear head and a strong hand was not afraid of work she encouraged and helped him from the first and bore her full share of the common burden  she had health and she did not worry his life out with peevish complaints and vagaries she had sense and principle and in their simple lot she did what was wise and right  their marriage was hallowed by an early sorrow they lost their boy and it was years before they could look each other in the face and speak of him  no one gave up more than they when they gave up each other and lapham went to the war  when he came back and began to work her zeal and courage formed the spring of his enterprise  in that affair of the partnership she had tried to be his conscience but perhaps she would have defended him if he had accused himself it was one of those things in this life which seem destined to await justice or at least judgment in the next  as he said lapham had dealt fairly by his partner in money he had let rogers take more money out of the business than he put into it he had as he said simply forced out of it a timid and inefficient participant in advantages which he had created  but lapham had not created them all he had been dependent at one time on his partners capital  it was a moment of terrible trial  happy is the man for ever after who can choose the ideal the unselfish part in such an exigency lapham could not rise to it  he did what he could maintain to be perfectly fair the wrong if any seemed to be condoned to him except when from time to time his wife brought it up  then all the question stung and burned anew and had to be reasoned out and put away once more  it seemed to have an inextinguishable vitality  it slept but it did not die  his course did not shake mrs laphams faith in him  it astonished her at first and it always grieved her that he could not see that he was acting solely in his own interest  but she found excuses for him which at times she made reproaches  she vaguely perceived that his paint was something more than business to him it was a sentiment almost a passion  he could not share its management and its profit with another without a measure of selfsacrifice far beyond that which he must make with something less personal to him  it was the poetry of that nature otherwise so intensely prosaic and she understood this and for the most part forbore  she knew him good and true and blameless in all his life except for this wrong if it were a wrong and it was only when her nerves tingled intolerably with some chance renewal of the pain she had suffered that she shared her anguish with him in true wifely fashion  with those two there was never anything like an explicit reconciliation  they simply ignored a quarrel and mrs lapham had only to say a few days after at breakfast i guess the girls would like to go round with you this afternoon and look at the new house in order to make her husband grumble out as he looked down into his coffeecup i guess we better all go hadnt we  well ill see she said  there was not really a great deal to look at when lapham arrived on the ground in his fourseated beachwagon  but the walls were up and the studding had already given skeleton shape to the interior  the floors were roughly boarded over and the stairways were in place with provisional treads rudely laid  they had not begun to lath and plaster yet but the clean fresh smell of the mortar in the walls mingling with the pungent fragrance of the pine shavings neutralised the venetian odour that drew in over the water  it was pleasantly shady there though for the matter of that the heat of the morning had all been washed out of the atmosphere by a tide of east wind setting in at noon and the thrilling delicious cool of a boston summer afternoon bathed every nerve  the foreman went about with mrs lapham showing her where the doors were to be but lapham soon tired of this and having found a pine stick of perfect grain he abandoned himself to the pleasure of whittling it in what was to be the receptionroom where he sat looking out on the street from what was to be the baywindow here he was presently joined by his girls who after locating their own room on the water side above the musicroom had no more wish to enter into details than their father  come and take a seat in the baywindow ladies he called out to them as they looked in at him through the ribs of the wall  he jocosely made room for them on the trestle on which he sat  they came gingerly and vaguely forward as young ladies do when they wish not to seem to be going to do a thing they have made up their minds to do  when they had taken their places on their trestle they could not help laughing with scorn open and acceptable to their father and irene curled her chin up in a little way she had and said how ridiculous to her sister  well i can tell you what said the colonel in fond enjoyment of their young ladyishness your mother want ashamed to sit with me on a trestle when i called her out to look at the first coat of my paint that i ever tried on a house  yes weve heard that story said penelope with easy security of her fathers liking what she said  we were brought up on that story  well its a good story said her father  at that moment a young man came suddenly in range who began to look up at the signs of building as he approached  he dropped his eyes in coming abreast of the baywindow where lapham sat with his girls and then his face lightened and he took off his hat and bowed to irene she rose mechanically from the trestle and her face lightened too  she was a very pretty figure of a girl after our fashion of girls round and slim and flexible and her face was admirably regular  but her great beautyand it was very greatwas in her colouring  this was of an effect for which there is no word but delicious as we use it of fruit or flowers  she had red hair like her father in his earlier days and the tints of her cheeks and temples were such as suggested mayflowers and appleblossoms and peaches  instead of the grey that often dulls this complexion her eyes were of a blue at once intense and tender and they seemed to burn on what they looked at with a soft lambent flame  it was well understood by her sister and mother that her eyes always expressed a great deal more than irene ever thought or felt but this is not saying that she was not a very sensible girl and very honest  the young man faltered perceptibly and irene came a little forward and then there gushed from them both a smiling exchange of greeting of which the sum was that he supposed she was out of town and that she had not known that he had got back  a pause ensued and flushing again in her uncertainty as to whether she ought or ought not to do it she said my father mr corey and my sister  the young man took off his hat again showing his shapely head with a line of wholesome sunburn ceasing where the recently and closely clipped hair began  he was dressed in a fine summer check with a blue whitedotted neckerchief and he had a white hat in which he looked very well when he put it back on his head  his whole dress seemed very fresh and new and in fact he had cast aside his texan habiliments only the day before  how do you do sir said the colonel stepping to the window and reaching out of it the hand which the young man advanced to take wont you come in were at home here  house im building  oh indeed returned the young man and he came promptly up the steps and through its ribs into the receptionroom  have a trestle asked the colonel while the girls exchanged little shocks of terror and amusement at the eyes  thank you said the young man simply and sat down  mrs lapham is upstairs interviewing the carpenter but shell be down in a minute  i hope shes quite well said corey  i supposedi was afraid she might be out of town  well we are off to nantasket next week  the house kept us in town pretty late  it must be very exciting building a house said corey to the elder sister  yes it is she assented loyally refusing in irenes interest the opportunity of saying anything more  corey turned to the latter  i suppose youve all helped to plan it  oh no the architect and mamma did that  but they allowed the rest of us to agree when we were good said penelope  corey looked at her and saw that she was shorter than her sister and had a dark complexion  its very exciting said irene  come up said the colonel rising and look round if youd like to  i should like to very much said the young man  he helped the young ladies over crevasses of carpentry and along narrow paths of planking on which they had made their way unassisted before  the elder sister left the younger to profit solely by these offices as much as possible she walked between them and her father who went before lecturing on each apartment and taking the credit of the whole affair more and more as he talked on  there he said were going to throw out a baywindow here so as get the water all the way up and down  this is my girls room he added looking proudly at them both  it seemed terribly intimate  irene blushed deeply and turned her head away  but the young man took it all apparently as simply as their father what a lovely lookout he said  the back bay spread its glassy sheet before them empty but for a few small boats and a large schooner with her sails closefurled and dripping like snow from her spars which a tug was rapidly towing toward cambridge  the carpentry of that city embanked and embowered in foliage shared the picturesqueness of charlestown in the distance  yes said lapham i go in for using the best rooms in your house yourself  if people come to stay with you they can put up with the second best  though we dont intend to have any second best  there aint going to be an unpleasant room in the whole house from top to bottom  oh i wish papa wouldnt brag so breathed irene to her sister where they stood a little apart looking away together  the colonel went on  no sir he swelled out i have gone in for making a regular job of it  ive got the best architect in boston and im building a house to suit myself  and if money can do it guess im going to be suited  it seems very delightful said corey and very original  yes sir  that fellow hadnt talked five minutes before i saw that he knew what he was about every time  i wish mamma would come breathed irene again  i shall certainly go through the floor if papa says anything more  they are making a great many very pretty houses nowadays said the young man  its very different from the oldfashioned building  well said the colonel with a large toleration of tone and a deep breath that expanded his ample chest we spend more on our houses nowadays  i started out to build a fortythousanddollar house  well sir that fellow has got me in for more than sixty thousand already and i doubt if i get out of it much under a hundred  you cant have a nice house for nothing  its just like ordering a picture of a painter  you pay him enough and he can afford to paint you a firstclass picture and if you dont he cant thats all there is of it  why they tell me that a t stewart gave one of those french fellows sixty thousand dollars for a little sevenbynine picture the other day  yes sir give an architect money enough and hell give you a nice house every time  ive heard that theyre sharp at getting money to realise their ideas assented the young man with a laugh  well i should say so exclaimed the colonel  they come to you with an improvement that you cant resist  it has good looks and commonsense and everything in its favour and its like throwing money away to refuse  and they always manage to get you when your wife is around and then youre helpless  the colonel himself set the example of laughing at this joke and the young man joined him less obstreperously  the girls turned and he said i dont think i ever saw this view to better advantage  its surprising how well the memorial hall and the cambridge spires work up over there  and the sunsets must be magnificent  lapham did not wait for them to reply  yes sir its about the sightliest view i know of  i always did like the water side of beacon  long before i owned property here or ever expected to mwife and i used to ride down this way and stop the buggy to get this view over the water  when people talk to me about the hill i can understand em its snug and its oldfashioned and its where theyve always lived  but when they talk about commonwealth avenue i dont know what they mean  it dont hold a candle to the water side of beacon  youve got just as much wind over there and youve got just as much dust and all the view youve got is the view across the street  no sir when you come to the back bay at all give me the water side of beacon  oh i think youre quite right said the young man  the view here is everything  irene looked i wonder what papa is going to say next at her sister when their mothers voice was heard overhead approaching the opening in the floor where the stairs were to be and she presently appeared with one substantial foot a long way ahead  she was followed by the carpenter with his rule sticking out of his overalls pocket and she was still talking to him about some measurements they had been taking when they reached the bottom so that irene had to say mamma mr corey before mrs lapham was aware of him  he came forward with as much grace and speed as the uncertain footing would allow and mrs lapham gave him a stout squeeze of her comfortable hand  why mr corey when did you get back  yesterday it hardly seems as if i had got back  i didnt expect to find you in a new house  well you are our first caller  i presume you wont expect i should make excuses for the state you find it in  has the colonel been doing the honours  oh yes  and ive seen more of your house than i ever shall again i suppose  well i hope not said lapham  therell be several chances to see us in the old one yet before we leave  he probably thought this a neat offhand way of making the invitation for he looked at his womankind as if he might expect their admiration  oh yes indeed said his wife  we shall be very glad to see mr corey any time  thank you i shall be glad to come  he and the colonel went before and helped the ladies down the difficult descent  irene seemed less surefooted than the others she clung to the young mans hand an imperceptible moment longer than need be or else he detained her  he found opportunity of saying its so pleasant seeing you again adding all of you  thank you said the girl  they must all be glad to have you at home again  corey laughed  well i suppose they would be if they were at home to have me  but the fact is theres nobody in the house but my father and myself and im only on my way to bar harbour  oh are they there  yes it seems to be the only place where my mother can get just the combination of sea and mountain air that she wants  we go to nantasketits convenient for papa and i dont believe we shall go anywhere else this summer mammas so taken up with building we do nothing but talk house and pen says we eat and sleep house  she says it would be a sort of relief to go and live in tents for a while  she seems to have a good deal of humour the young man ventured upon the slender evidence  the others had gone to the back of the house a moment to look at some suggested change  irene and corey were left standing in the doorway a lovely light of happiness played over her face and etherealised its delicious beauty  she had some ado to keep herself from smiling outright and the effort deepened the dimples in her cheeks she trembled a little and the pendants shook in the tips of her pretty ears  the others came back directly and they all descended the front steps together  the colonel was about to renew his invitation but he caught his wifes eye and without being able to interpret its warning exactly was able to arrest himself and went about gathering up the hitchingweight while the young man handed the ladies into the phaeton  then he lifted his hat and the ladies all bowed and the laphams drove off irenes blue ribbons fluttering backward from her hat as if they were her clinging thoughts  so thats young corey is it said the colonel letting the stately stepping tall coupe horse make his way homeward at will with the beachwagon well he aint a badlooking fellow and hes got a good fair and square honest eye  but i dont see how a fellow like that thats had every advantage in this world can hang round home and let his father support him  seems to me if i had his health and his education i should want to strike out and do something for myself  the girls on the back seat had hold of each others hands and they exchanged electrical pressures at the different points their father made  i presume said mrs lapham that he was down in texas looking after something  hes come back without finding it i guess  well if his father has the money to support him and dont complain of the burden i dont see why we should  oh i know its none of my business but i dont like the principle i like to see a man act like a man  i dont like to see him taken care of like a young lady  now i suppose that fellow belongs to two or three clubs and hangs around em all day lookin out the windowive seen eminstead of tryin to hunt up something to do for an honest livin  if i was a young man penelope struck in i would belong to twenty clubs if i could find them and i would hang around them all and look out the window till i dropped  oh you would would you demanded her father delighted with her defiance and twisting his fat head around over his shoulder to look at her  well you wouldnt do it on my money if you were a son of mine young lady  oh you wait and see retorted the girl  this made them all laugh  but the colonel recurred seriously to the subject that night as he was winding up his watch preparatory to putting it under his pillow  i could make a man of that fellow if i had him in the business with me  theres stuff in him  but i spoke up the way i did because i didnt choose irene should think i would stand any kind of a loafer roundi dont care who he is or how well educated or brought up and i guess from the way pen spoke up that rene saw what i was driving at  the girl apparently was less anxious about her fathers ideas and principles than about the impression which he had made upon the young man  she had talked it over and over with her sister before they went to bed and she asked in despair as she stood looking at penelope brushing out her hair before the glass  do you suppose hell think papa always talks in that bragging way  hell be right if he does answered her sister  its the way father always does talk  you never noticed it so much thats all  and i guess if he cant make allowance for fathers bragging hell be a little too good  i enjoyed hearing the colonel go on  i know you did returned irene in distress  then she sighed didnt you think he looked very nice  who the colonel penelope had caught up the habit of calling her father so from her mother and she used his title in all her jocose and perverse moods  you know very well i dont mean papa pouted irene  oh mr corey why didnt you say mr corey if you meant mr corey if i meant mr corey i should say mr corey  it isnt swearing corey corey co  her sister clapped her hand over her mouth will you hush you wretched thing she whimpered  the whole house can hear you  oh yes they can hear me all over the square  well i think he looked well enough for a plain youth who hadnt taken his hair out of curlpapers for some time  it was clipped pretty close irene admitted and they both laughed at the drab effect of mr coreys skull as they remembered it  did you like his nose asked irene timorously  ah now youre coming to something said penelope  i dont know whether if i had so much of a nose i should want it all roman  i dont see how you can expect to have a nose part one kind and part another argued irene  oh i do  look at mine she turned aside her face so as to get a threequarters view of her nose in the glass and crossing her hands with the brush in one of them before her regarded it judicially now my nose started grecian but changed its mind before it got over the bridge and concluded to be snub the rest of the way  youve got a very pretty nose pen said irene joining in the contemplation of its reflex in the glass  dont say that in hopes of getting me to compliment his mrsshe stopped and then added deliberatelyc  irene also had her hairbrush in her hand and now she sprang at her sister and beat her very softly on the shoulder with the flat of it you mean thing she cried between her shut teeth blushing hotly  well d then said penelope  youve nothing to say against d though i think c is just as nice an initial  oh cried the younger for all expression of unspeakable things  i think he has very good eyes admitted penelope  oh he has and didnt you like the way his sackcoat set so close to him and yet freekind of peeling away at the lapels  yes i should say he was a young man of great judgment  he knows how to choose his tailor  irene sat down on the edge of a chair  it was so nice of you pen to come in that way about clubs  oh i didnt mean anything by it except opposition said penelope i couldnt have father swelling on so without saying something  how he did swell sighed irene  wasnt it a relief to have mamma come down even if she did seem to be all stocking at first  the girls broke into a wild giggle and hid their faces in each others necks  i thought i should die said irene  its just like ordering a painting said penelope recalling her fathers talk with an effect of dreamy absentmindedness you give the painter money enough and he can afford to paint you a firstclass picture  give an architect money enough and hell give you a firstclass house every time  oh wasnt it awful moaned her sister  no one would ever have supposed that he had fought the very idea of an architect for weeks before he gave in  penelope went on  i always did like the water side of beaconlong before i owned property there  when you come to the back bay at all give me the water side of beacon  owwww shrieked irene  do stop  the door of their mothers chamber opened below and the voice of the real colonel called what are you doing up there girls why dont you go to bed  this extorted nervous shrieks from both of them  the colonel heard a sound of scurrying feet whisking drapery and slamming doors  then he heard one of the doors opened again and penelope said i was only repeating something you said when you talked to mr corey  very well now answered the colonel  you postpone the rest of it till tomorrow at breakfast and see that youre up in time to let me hear it    v   at the same moment young corey let himself in at his own door with his latchkey and went to the library where he found his father turning the last leaves of a story in the revue des deux mondes  he was a whitemoustached old gentleman who had never been able to abandon his pincenez for the superior comfort of spectacles even in the privacy of his own library  he knocked the glasses off as his son came in and looked up at him with lazy fondness rubbing the two red marks that they always leave on the side of the nose  tom he said where did you get such good clothes  i stopped over a day in new york replied the son finding himself a chair  im glad you like them  yes i always do like your clothes tom returned the father thoughtfully swinging his glasses but i dont see how you can afford em i cant  well sir said the son who dropped the sir into his speech with his father now and then in an oldfashioned way that was rather charming you see i have an indulgent parent  smoke suggested the father pushing toward his son a box of cigarettes from which he had taken one  no thank you said the son  ive dropped that  ah is that so the father began to feel about on the table for matches in the purblind fashion of elderly men  his son rose lighted one and handed it to him  welloh thank you tomi believe some statisticians prove that if you will give up smoking you can dress very well on the money your tobacco costs even if you havent got an indulgent parent  but im too old to try  though i confess i should rather like the clothes  whom did you find at the club  there were a lot of fellows there said young corey watching the accomplished fumigation of his father in an absent way  its astonishing what a hardy breed the young clubmen are observed his father  all summer through in weather that sends the sturdiest female flying to the seashore you find the clubs filled with young men who dont seem to mind the heat in the least  boston isnt a bad place at the worst in summer said the son declining to take up the matter in its ironical shape  i dare say it isnt compared with texas returned the father smoking tranquilly on  but i dont suppose you find many of your friends in town outside of the club  no youre requested to ring at the rear door all the way down beacon street and up commonwealth avenue  its rather a blank reception for the returning prodigal  ah the prodigal must take his chance if he comes back out of season but im glad to have you back tom even as it is and i hope youre not going to hurry away  you must give your energies a rest  im sure you never had to reproach me with abnormal activity suggested the son taking his fathers jokes in good part  no i dont know that i have admitted the elder  youve always shown a fair degree of moderation after all  what do you think of taking up next i mean after you have embraced your mother and sisters at mount desert  real estate it seems to me that it is about time for you to open out as a realestate broker  or did you ever think of matrimony  well not just in that way sir said the young man  i shouldnt quite like to regard it as a career you know  no no  i understand that  and i quite agree with you  but you know ive always contended that the affections could be made to combine pleasure and profit  i wouldnt have a man marry for moneythat would be rather badbut i dont see why when it comes to falling in love a man shouldnt fall in love with a rich girl as easily as a poor one  some of the rich girls are very nice and i should say that the chances of a quiet life with them were rather greater  theyve always had everything and they wouldnt be so ambitious and uneasy  dont you think so  it would depend said the son upon whether a girls people had been rich long enough to have given her position before she married  if they hadnt i dont see how she would be any better than a poor girl in that respect  yes theres sense in that  but the suddenly rich are on a level with any of us nowadays  money buys position at once  i dont say that it isnt all right  the world generally knows what its about and knows how to drive a bargain  i dare say it makes the new rich pay too much but theres no doubt but money is to the fore now  it is the romance the poetry of our age  its the thing that chiefly strikes the imagination  the englishmen who come here are more curious about the great new millionaires than about any one else and they respect them more  its all very well  i dont complain of it  and you would like a rich daughterinlaw quite regardless then  oh not quite so bad as that tom said his father  a little youth a little beauty a little good sense and pretty behaviourone mustnt object to those things and they go just as often with money as without it  and i suppose i should like her people to be rather grammatical  it seems to me that youre exacting sir said the son  how can you expect people who have been strictly devoted to business to be grammatical isnt that rather too much  perhaps it is  perhaps youre right  but i understood your mother to say that those benefactors of hers whom you met last summer were very passably grammatical  the father isnt  the elder who had been smoking with his profile toward his son now turned his face full upon him  i didnt know you had seen him  i hadnt until today said young corey with a little heightening of his colour  but i was walking down street this afternoon and happened to look round at a new house some one was putting up and i saw the whole family in the window  it appears that mr lapham is building the house  the elder corey knocked the ash of his cigarette into the holder at his elbow  i am more and more convinced the longer i know you tom that we are descended from giles corey  the gift of holding ones tongue seems to have skipped me but you have it in full force  i cant say just how you would behave under peine forte et dure but under ordinary pressure you are certainly able to keep your own counsel  why didnt you mention this encounter at dinner you werent asked to plead to an accusation of witchcraft  no not exactly said the young man  but i didnt quite see my way to speaking of it  we had a good many other things before us  yes thats true  i suppose you wouldnt have mentioned it now if i hadnt led up to it would you  i dont know sir  it was rather on my mind to do so  perhaps it was i who led up to it  his father laughed  perhaps you did tom perhaps you did  your mother would have known you were leading up to something but ill confess that i didnt what is it  nothing very definite  but do you know that in spite of his syntax i rather liked him  the father looked keenly at the son but unless the boys full confidence was offered corey was not the man to ask it  well was all that he said  i suppose that in a new country one gets to looking at people a little out of our tradition and i dare say that if i hadnt passed a winter in texas i might have found colonel lapham rather too much  you mean that there are worse things in texas  not that exactly  i mean that i saw it wouldnt be quite fair to test him by our standards  this comes of the error which i have often deprecated said the elder corey  in fact i am always saying that the bostonian ought never to leave boston  then he knowsand then onlythat there can be no standard but ours  but we are constantly going away and coming back with our convictions shaken to their foundations  one man goes to england and returns with the conception of a grander social life another comes home from germany with the notion of a more searching intellectual activity a fellow just back from paris has the absurdest ideas of art and literature and you revert to us from the cowboys of texas and tell us to our faces that we ought to try papa lapham by a jury of his peers  it ought to be stoppedit ought really  the bostonian who leaves boston ought to be condemned to perpetual exile  the son suffered the father to reach his climax with smiling patience when he asked finally what are the characteristics of papa lapham that place him beyond our jurisdiction the younger corey crossed his long legs and leaned forward to take one of his knees between his hands  well sir he bragged rather  oh i dont know that bragging should exempt him from the ordinary processes  ive heard other people brag in boston  ah not just in that personal waynot about money  no that was certainly different  i dont mean said the young fellow with the scrupulosity which people could not help observing and liking in him that it was more than an indirect expression of satisfaction in the ability to spend  no i should be glad to express something of the kind myself if the facts would justify me  the son smiled tolerantly again  but if he was enjoying his money in that way i didnt see why he shouldnt show his pleasure in it  it might have been vulgar but it wasnt sordid  and i dont know that it was vulgar  perhaps his successful strokes of business were the romance of his life  the father interrupted with a laugh  the girl must be uncommonly pretty  what did she seem to think of her fathers brag  there were two of them answered the son evasively  oh two and is the sister pretty too  not pretty but rather interesting  she is like her mother  then the pretty one isnt the fathers pet  i cant say sir  i dont believe added the young fellow that i can make you see colonel lapham just as i did  he struck me as very simplehearted and rather wholesome  of course he could be tiresome we all can and i suppose his range of ideas is limited  but he is a force and not a bad one  if he hasnt got over being surprised at the effect of rubbing his lamp  oh one could make out a case  i suppose you know what you are about tom  but remember that we are essex county people and that in savour we are just a little beyond the salt of the earth  i will tell you plainly that i dont like the notion of a man who has rivalled the hues of nature in her wildest haunts with the tints of his mineral paint but i dont say there are not worse men  he isnt to my taste though he might be ever so much to my conscience  i suppose said the son that there is nothing really to be ashamed of in mineral paint  people go into all sorts of things  his father took his cigarette from his mouth and once more looked his son full in the face  oh is that it  it has crossed my mind admitted the son  i must do something ive wasted time and money enough  ive seen much younger men all through the west and southwest taking care of themselves  i dont think i was particularly fit for anything out there but i am ashamed to come back and live upon you sir  his father shook his head with an ironical sigh  ah we shall never have a real aristocracy while this plebeian reluctance to live upon a parent or a wife continues the animating spirit of our youth  it strikes at the root of the whole feudal system  i really think you owe me an apology tom  i supposed you wished to marry the girls money and here you are basely seeking to go into business with her father  young corey laughed again like a son who perceives that his father is a little antiquated but keeps a filial faith in his wit  i dont know that its quite so bad as that but the thing had certainly crossed my mind  i dont know how its to be approached and i dont know that its at all possible  but i confess that i took to colonel lapham from the moment i saw him  he looked as if he meant business and i mean business too  the father smoked thoughtfully  of course people do go into all sorts of things as you say and i dont know that one thing is more ignoble than another if its decent and large enough  in my time you would have gone into the china trade or the india tradethough i didnt and a little later cotton would have been your manifest destinythough it wasnt mine but now a man may do almost anything  the realestate business is pretty full  yes if you have a deep inward vocation for it i dont see why mineral paint shouldnt do  i fancy its easy enough approaching the matter  we will invite papa lapham to dinner and talk it over with him  oh i dont think that would be exactly the way sir said the son smiling at his fathers patrician unworldliness  no why not  im afraid it would be a bad start  i dont think it would strike him as businesslike  i dont see why he should be punctilious if were not  ah we might say that if he were making the advances  well perhaps you are right tom  what is your idea  i havent a very clear one  it seems to me i ought to get some business friend of ours whose judgment he would respect to speak a good word for me  give you a character  yes and of course i must go to colonel lapham  my notion would be to inquire pretty thoroughly about him and then if i liked the look of things to go right down to republic street and let him see what he could do with me if anything  that sounds tremendously practical to me tom though it may be just the wrong way  when are you going down to mount desert  tomorrow i think sir said the young man  i shall turn it over in my mind while im off  the father rose showing something more than his sons height with a very slight stoop which the sons figure had not  well he said whimsically i admire your spirit and i dont deny that it is justified by necessity  its a consolation to think that while ive been spending and enjoying i have been preparing the noblest future for youa future of industry and selfreliance you never could draw but this scheme of going into the mineralpaint business shows that you have inherited something of my feeling for colour  the son laughed once more and waiting till his father was well on his way upstairs turned out the gas and then hurried after him and preceded him into his chamber  he glanced over it to see that everything was there to his fathers hand  then he said good night sir and the elder responded good night my son and the son went to his own room  over the mantel in the elder coreys room hung a portrait which he had painted of his own father and now he stood a moment and looked at this as if struck by something novel in it  the resemblance between his son and the old india merchant who had followed the trade from salem to boston when the larger city drew it away from the smaller must have been what struck him  grandfather and grandson had both the roman nose which appears to have flourished chiefly at the formative period of the republic and which occurs more rarely in the descendants of the conscript fathers though it still characterises the profiles of a good many boston ladies  bromfield corey had not inherited it and he had made his straight nose his defence when the old merchant accused him of a want of energy  he said what could a man do whose unnatural father had left his own nose away from him this amused but did not satisfy the merchant  you must do something he said and its for you to choose  if you dont like the india trade go into something else or take up law or medicine  no corey yet ever proposed to do nothing ah then its quite time one of us made a beginning urged the man who was then young and who was now old looking into the somewhat fierce eyes of his fathers portrait  he had inherited as little of the fierceness as of the nose and there was nothing predatory in his son either though the aquiline beak had come down to him in such force  bromfield corey liked his son tom for the gentleness which tempered his energy  well let us compromise he seemed to be saying to his fathers portrait  i will travel travel how long the keen eyes demanded oh indefinitely  i wont be hard with you father he could see the eyes soften and the smile of yielding come over his fathers face the merchant could not resist a son who was so much like his dead mother there was some vague understanding between them that bromfield corey was to come back and go into business after a time but he never did so  he travelled about over europe and travelled handsomely frequenting good society everywhere and getting himself presented at several courts at a period when it was a distinction to do so  he had always sketched and with his fathers leave he fixed himself at rome where he remained studying art and rounding the being inherited from his yankee progenitors till there was very little left of the ancestral angularities  after ten years he came home and painted that portrait of his father  it was very good if a little amateurish and he might have made himself a name as a painter of portraits if he had not had so much money  but he had plenty of money though by this time he was married and beginning to have a family  it was absurd for him to paint portraits for pay and ridiculous to paint them for nothing so he did not paint them at all  he continued a dilettante never quite abandoning his art but working at it fitfully and talking more about it than working at it  he had his theory of titians method and now and then a bostonian insisted upon buying a picture of him  after a while he hung it more and more inconspicuously and said apologetically oh yes thats one of bromfield coreys things  it has nice qualities but its amateurish  in process of time the money seemed less abundant  there were shrinkages of one kind and another and living had grown much more expensive and luxurious  for many years he talked about going back to rome but he never went and his children grew up in the usual way before he knew it his son had him out to his classday spread at harvard and then he had his son on his hands  the son made various unsuccessful provisions for himself and still continued upon his fathers hands to their common dissatisfaction though it was chiefly the younger who repined  he had the roman nose and the energy without the opportunity and at one of the reversions his father said to him you ought not to have that nose tom then you would do very well you would go and travel as i did   lapham and his wife continued talking after he had quelled the disturbance in his daughters room overhead and their talk was not altogether of the new house  i tell you he said if i had that fellow in the business with me i would make a man of him  well silas lapham returned his wife i do believe youve got mineral paint on the brain  do you suppose a fellow like young corey brought up the way hes been would touch mineral paint with a tenfoot pole  why not haughtily asked the colonel  well if you dont know already theres no use trying to tell you    vi   the coreys had always had a house at nahant but after letting it for a season or two they found they could get on without it and sold it at the sons instance who foresaw that if things went on as they were going the family would be straitened to the point of changing their mode of life altogether  they began to be of the people of whom it was said that they stayed in town very late and when the ladies did go away it was for a brief summering in this place and that  the father remained at home altogether and the son joined them in the intervals of his enterprises which occurred only too often  at bar harbour where he now went to find them after his winter in texas he confessed to his mother that there seemed no very good opening there for him  he might do as well as loring stanton but he doubted if stanton was doing very well  then he mentioned the new project which he had been thinking over  she did not deny that there was something in it but she could not think of any young man who had gone into such a business as that and it appeared to her that he might as well go into a patent medicine or a stovepolish  there was one of his hideous advertisements she said painted on a reef that we saw as we came down  corey smiled  well i suppose if it was in a good state of preservation that is proof positive of the efficacy of the paint on the hulls of vessels  its very distasteful to me tom said his mother and if there was something else in her mind she did not speak more plainly of it than to add its not only the kind of business but the kind of people you would be mixed up with  i thought you didnt find them so very bad suggested corey  i hadnt seen them in nankeen square then  you can see them on the water side of beacon street when you go back  then he told of his encounter with the lapham family in their new house  at the end his mother merely said it is getting very common down there and she did not try to oppose anything further to his scheme  the young man went to see colonel lapham shortly after his return to boston  he paid his visit at laphams office and if he had studied simplicity in his summer dress he could not have presented himself in a figure more to the mind of a practical man  his hands and neck still kept the brown of the texan suns and winds and he looked as businesslike as lapham himself  he spoke up promptly and briskly in the outer office and caused the pretty girl to look away from her copying at him  is mr lapham in he asked and after that moment for reflection which an array of bookkeepers so addressed likes to give the inquirer a head was lifted from a ledger and nodded toward the inner office  lapham had recognised the voice and he was standing in considerable perplexity to receive corey when the young man opened his painted glass door  it was a hot afternoon and lapham was in his shirt sleeves  scarcely a trace of the boastful hospitality with which he had welcomed corey to his house a few days before lingered in his present address  he looked at the young mans face as if he expected him to despatch whatever unimaginable affair he had come upon  wont you sit down how are you youll excuse me he added in brief allusion to the shirtsleeves im about roasted  corey laughed  i wish youd let me take off my coat  why take it off cried the colonel with instant pleasure  there is something in human nature which causes the man in his shirtsleeves to wish all other men to appear in the same deshabille  i will if you ask me after ive talked with you two minutes said the young fellow companionably pulling up the chair offered him toward the desk where lapham had again seated himself  but perhaps you havent got two minutes to give me  oh yes i have said the colonel  i was just going to knock off  i can give you twenty and then i shall have fifteen minutes to catch the boat  all right said corey  i want you to take me into the mineral paint business  the colonel sat dumb  he twisted his thick neck and looked round at the door to see if it was shut  he would not have liked to have any of those fellows outside hear him but there is no saying what sum of money he would not have given if his wife had been there to hear what corey had just said  i suppose continued the young man i could have got several people whose names you know to back my industry and sobriety and say a word for my business capacity  but i thought i wouldnt trouble anybody for certificates till i found whether there was a chance or the ghost of one of your wanting me  so i came straight to you  lapham gathered himself together as well as he could  he had not yet forgiven corey for mrs laphams insinuation that he would feel himself too good for the mineral paint business and though he was dispersed by that astounding shot at first he was not going to let any one even hypothetically despise his paint with impunity  how do you think i am going to take you on they took on hands at the works and lapham put it as if corey were a hand coming to him for employment  whether he satisfied himself by this or not he reddened a little after he had said it  corey answered ignorant of the offence i havent a very clear idea im afraid but ive been looking a little into the matter from the outside  i hope you haint been paying any attention to that fellows stuff in the events lapham interrupted  since bartleys interview had appeared lapham had regarded it with very mixed feelings  at first it gave him a glow of secret pleasure blended with doubt as to how his wife would like the use bartley had made of her in it  but she had not seemed to notice it much and lapham had experienced the gratitude of the man who escapes  then his girls had begun to make fun of it and though he did not mind penelopes jokes much he did not like to see that irenes gentility was wounded  business friends met him with the kind of knowing smile about it that implied their sense of the fraudulent character of its praisethe smile of men who had been there and who knew how it was themselves  lapham had his misgivings as to how his clerks and underlings looked at it he treated them with stately severity for a while after it came out and he ended by feeling rather sore about it  he took it for granted that everybody had read it  i dont know what you mean replied corey i dont see the events regularly  oh it was nothing  they sent a fellow down here to interview me and he got everything about as twisted as he could  i believe they always do said corey  i hadnt seen it  perhaps it came out before i got home  perhaps it did  my notion of making myself useful to you was based on a hint i got from one of your own circulars  lapham was proud of those circulars he thought they read very well what was that  i could put a little capital into the business said corey with the tentative accent of a man who chances a thing  ive got a little money but i didnt imagine you cared for anything of that kind  no sir i dont returned the colonel bluntly  ive had one partner and ones enough  yes assented the young man who doubtless had his own ideas as to eventualitiesor perhaps rather had the vague hopes of youth  i didnt come to propose a partnership  but i see that you are introducing your paint into the foreign markets and there i really thought i might be of use to you and to myself too  how asked the colonel scantly  well i know two or three languages pretty well  i know french and i know german and ive got a pretty fair sprinkling of spanish  you mean that you can talk them asked the colonel with the mingled awe and slight that such a man feels for such accomplishments  yes and i can write an intelligible letter in either of them  lapham rubbed his nose  its easy enough to get all the letters we want translated  well pursued corey not showing his discouragement if he felt any i know the countries where you want to introduce this paint of yours ive been there  ive been in germany and france and ive been in south america and mexico ive been in italy of course  i believe i could go to any of those countries and place it to advantage  lapham had listened with a trace of persuasion in his face but now he shook his head  its placing itself as fast as theres any call for it  it wouldnt pay us to send anybody out to look after it  your salary and expenses would eat up about all we should make on it  yes returned the young man intrepidly if you had to pay me any salary and expenses  you dont propose to work for nothing  i propose to work for a commission the colonel was beginning to shake his head again but corey hurried on  i havent come to you without making some inquiries about the paint and i know how it stands with those who know best  i believe in it  lapham lifted his head and looked at the young man deeply moved  its the best paint in gods universe he said with the solemnity of prayer  its the best in the market said corey and he repeated i believe in it  you believe in it began the colonel and then he stopped  if there had really been any purchasing power in money a years income would have bought mrs laphams instant presence  he warmed and softened to the young man in every way not only because he must do so to any one who believed in his paint but because he had done this innocent person the wrong of listening to a defamation of his instinct and good sense and had been willing to see him suffer for a purely supposititious offence  corey rose  you mustnt let me outstay my twenty minutes he said taking out his watch  i dont expect you to give a decided answer on the spot  all that i ask is that youll consider my proposition  dont hurry said lapham  sit still i want to tell you about this paint he added in a voice husky with the feeling that his hearer could not divine  i want to tell you all about it  i could walk with you to the boat suggested the young man  never mind the boat i can take the next one  look here the colonel pulled open a drawer as corey sat down again and took out a photograph of the locality of the mine  heres where we get it  this photograph dont half do the place justice he said as if the imperfect art had slighted the features of a beloved face  its one of the sightliest places in the country and heres the very spot he covered it with his huge forefingerwhere my father found that paint more than fortyyearsago yes sir  he went on and told the story in unsparing detail while his chance for the boat passed unheeded and the clerks in the outer office hung up their linen office coats and put on their seersucker or flannel street coats  the young lady went too and nobody was left but the porter who made from time to time a noisy demonstration of fastening a distant blind or putting something in place  at last the colonel roused himself from the autobiographical delight of the history of his paint  well sir thats the story  its an interesting story said corey with a long breath as they rose together and lapham put on his coat  thats what it is said the colonel  well he added i dont see but what weve got to have another talk about this thing  its a surprise to me and i dont see exactly how youre going to make it pay  im willing to take the chances answered corey  as i said i believe in it  i should try south america first  i should try chili  look here said lapham with his watch in his hand  i like to get things over  weve just got time for the six oclock boat  why dont you come down with me to nantasket i can give you a bed as well as not  and then we can finish up  the impatience of youth in corey responded to the impatience of temperament in his elder  why i dont see why i shouldnt he allowed himself to say  i confess i should like to have it finished up myself if it could be finished up in the right way  well well see  dennis lapham called to the remote porter and the man came  want to send any word home he asked corey  no my father and i go and come as we like without keeping account of each other  if i dont come home he knows that im not there  thats all  well thats convenient  youll find you cant do that when youre married  never mind dennis said the colonel  he had time to buy two newspapers on the wharf before he jumped on board the steamboat with corey  just made it he said and thats what i like to do  i cant stand it to be aboard much more than a minute before she shoves out he gave one of the newspapers to corey as he spoke and set him the example of catching up a campstool on their way to that point on the boat which his experience had taught him was the best  he opened his paper at once and began to run over its news while the young man watched the spectacular recession of the city and was vaguely conscious of the people about him and of the gay life of the water round the boat  the air freshened the craft thinned in number they met larger sail lagging slowly inward in the afternoon light the islands of the bay waxed and waned as the steamer approached and left them behind  i hate to see them stirring up those southern fellows again said the colonel speaking into the paper on his lap  seems to me its time to let those old issues go  yes said the young man  what are they doing now  oh stirring up the confederate brigadiers in congress  i dont like it  seems to me if our party haint got any other stockintrade we better shut up shop altogether lapham went on as he scanned his newspaper to give his ideas of public questions in a fragmentary way while corey listened patiently and waited for him to come back to business  he folded up his paper at last and stuffed it into his coat pocket  theres one thing i always make it a rule to do he said and that is to give my mind a complete rest from business while im going down on the boat  i like to get the fresh air all through me soul and body  i believe a man can give his mind a rest just the same as he can give his legs a rest or his back  all hes got to do is to use his willpower why i suppose if i hadnt adopted some such rule with the strain ive had on me for the last ten years i should a been a dead man long ago  thats the reason i like a horse  youve got to give your mind to the horse you cant help it unless you want to break your neck but a boats different and there you got to use your willpower  you got to take your mind right up and put it where you want it  i make it a rule to read the paper on the boathold on he interrupted himself to prevent corey from paying his fare to the man who had come round for it  ive got tickets  and when i get through the paper i try to get somebody to talk to or i watch the people  its an astonishing thing to me where they all come from ive been riding up and down on these boats for six or seven years and i dont know but very few of the faces i see on board  seems to be a perfectly fresh lot every time  well of course towns full of strangers in the summer season anyway and folks keep coming down from the country  they think its a great thing to get down to the beach and theyve all heard of the electric light on the water and they want to see it  but you take faces now the astonishing thing to me is not what a face tells but what it dont tell  when you think of what a man is or a woman is and what most of em have been through before they get to be thirty it seems as if their experience would burn right through  but it dont i like to watch the couples and try to make out which are engaged or going to be and which are married or better be  but half the time i cant make any sort of guess  of course where theyre young and kittenish you can tell but where theyre anyways on you cant  heigh  yes i think youre right said corey not perfectly reconciled to philosophy in the place of business but accepting it as he must  well said the colonel i dont suppose it was meant we should know what was in each others minds  it would take a man out of his own hands  as long as hes in his own hands theres some hopes of his doing something with himself but if a fellow has been found outeven if he hasnt been found out to be so very badits pretty much all up with him  no sir  i dont want to know people through and through  the greater part of the crowd on boardand of course the boat was crowdedlooked as if they might not only be easily but safely known there was little style and no distinction among them they were people who were going down to the beach for the fun or the relief of it and were able to afford it  in face they were commonplace with nothing but the american poetry of vivid purpose to light them up where they did not wholly lack fire  but they were nearly all shrewd and friendlylooking with an apparent readiness for the humorous intimacy native to us all  the women were dandified in dress according to their means and taste and the men differed from each other in degrees of indifference to it  to a strawhatted population such as ours is in summer no sort of personal dignity is possible  we have not even the power over observers which comes from the fantasticality of an englishman when he discards the conventional dress  in our straw hats and our serge or flannel sacks we are no more imposing than a crowd of boys  some day said lapham rising as the boat drew near the wharf of the final landing theres going to be an awful accident on these boats just look at that jam  he meant the people thickly packed on the pier and under strong restraint of locks and gates to prevent them from rushing on board the boat and possessing her for the return trip before she had landed her nantasket passengers  overload em every time he continued with a sort of dry impersonal concern at the impending calamity as if it could not possibly include him  they take about twice as many as they ought to carry and about ten times as many as they could save if anything happened  yes sir its bound to come  hello theres my girl he took out his folded newspaper and waved it toward a group of phaetons and barouches drawn up on the pier a little apart from the pack of people and a lady in one of them answered with a flourish of her parasol  when he had made his way with his guest through the crowd she began to speak to her father before she noticed corey  well colonel youve improved your last chance  weve been coming to every boat since four oclockor jerry hasand i told mother that i would come myself once and see if i couldnt fetch you and if i failed you could walk next time  youre getting perfectly spoiled  the colonel enjoyed letting her scold him to the end before he said with a twinkle of pride in his guest and satisfaction in her probably being able to hold her own against any discomfiture ive brought mr corey down for the night with me and i was showing him things all the way and it took time  the young fellow was at the side of the open beachwagon making a quick bow and penelope lapham was cozily drawling oh how do you do mr corey before the colonel had finished his explanation  get right in there alongside of miss lapham mr corey he said pulling himself up into the place beside the driver  no no he had added quickly at some signs of polite protest in the young man i dont give up the best place to anybody  jerry suppose you let me have hold of the leathers a minute  this was his way of taking the reins from the driver and in half the time he specified he had skilfully turned the vehicle on the pier among the crooked lines and groups of footpassengers and was spinning up the road toward the stretch of verandaed hotels and restaurants in the sand along the shore  pretty gay down here he said indicating all this with a turn of his whip as he left it behind him  but ive got about sick of hotels and this summer i made up my mind that id take a cottage  well pen how are the folks he looked halfway round for her answer and with the eye thus brought to bear upon her he was able to give her a wink of supreme content  the colonel with no sort of ulterior design and nothing but his triumph over mrs lapham definitely in his mind was feeling as he would have said about right   the girl smiled a daughters amusement at her fathers boyishness  i dont think theres much change since morning  did irene have a headache when you left  no said the colonel  well then theres that to report  pshaw said the colonel with vexation in his tone  im sorry miss irene isnt well said corey politely  i think she must have got it from walking too long on the beach  the air is so cool here that you forget how hot the sun is  yes thats true assented corey  a good nights rest will make it all right suggested the colonel without looking round  but you girls have got to look out  if youre fond of walking said corey i suppose you find the beach a temptation  oh it isnt so much that returned the girl  you keep walking on and on because its so smooth and straight before you  weve been here so often that we know it all by heartjust how it looks at high tide and how it looks at low tide and how it looks after a storm  were as well acquainted with the crabs and stranded jellyfish as we are with the children digging in the sand and the people sitting under umbrellas  i think theyre always the same all of them  the colonel left the talk to the young people  when he spoke next it was to say well here we are and he turned from the highway and drove up in front of a brown cottage with a vermilion roof and a group of geraniums clutching the rock that cropped up in the loop formed by the road  it was treeless and bare all round and the ocean unnecessarily vast weltered away a little more than a stonescast from the cottage  a hospitable smell of supper filled the air and mrs lapham was on the veranda with that demand in her eyes for her belated husbands excuses which she was obliged to check on her tongue at sight of corey    vii   the exultant colonel swung himself lightly down from his seat  ive brought mr corey with me he nonchalantly explained  mrs lapham made their guest welcome and the colonel showed him to his room briefly assuring himself that there was nothing wanting there then he went to wash his own hands carelessly ignoring the eagerness with which his wife pursued him to their chamber  what gave irene a headache he asked making himself a fine lather for his hairy paws  never you mind irene promptly retorted his wife  how came he to come did you press him if you did ill never forgive you silas  the colonel laughed and his wife shook him by the shoulder to make him laugh lower  sh she whispered  do you want him to hear every thing did you urge him  the colonel laughed the more  he was going to get all the good out of this  no i didnt urge him  seemed to want to come  i dont believe it  where did you meet him  at the office  what office  mine  nonsense what was he doing there  oh nothing much  what did he come for come for oh he said he wanted to go into the mineral paint business  mrs lapham dropped into a chair and watched his bulk shaken with smothered laughter  silas lapham she gasped if you try to get off any more of those things on me  the colonel applied himself to the towel  had a notion he could work it in south america  i dont know what hes up to  never mind cried his wife  ill get even with you yet  so i told him he had better come down and talk it over continued the colonel in wellaffected simplicity  i knew he wouldnt touch it with a tenfoot pole  go on threatened mrs lapham  right thing to do want it  a tap was heard at the door and mrs lapham answered it  a maid announced supper  very well she said come to tea now  but ill make you pay for this silas  penelope had gone to her sisters room as soon as she entered the house  is your head any better rene she asked  yes a little came a voice from the pillows  but i shall not come to tea  i dont want anything  if i keep still i shall be all right by morning  well im sorry said the elder sister  hes come down with father  he hasnt who cried irene starting up in simultaneous denial and demand  oh well if you say he hasnt whats the use of my telling you who  oh how can you treat me so moaned the sufferer  what do you mean pen  i guess id better not tell you said penelope watching her like a cat playing with a mouse  if youre not coming to tea it would just excite you for nothing  the mouse moaned and writhed upon the bed  oh i wouldnt treat you so  the cat seated herself across the room and asked quietly   well what could you do if it was mr corey you couldnt come to tea you say  but hell excuse you  ive told him you had a headache why of course you cant come it would be too barefaced but you neednt be troubled irene ill do my best to make the time pass pleasantly for him here the cat gave a low titter and the mouse girded itself up with a momentary courage and selfrespect  i should think you would be ashamed to come here and tease me so  i dont see why you shouldnt believe me argued penelope  why shouldnt he come down with father if father asked him and hed be sure to if he thought of it  i dont see any pints about that frog thats any better than any other frog  the sense of her sisters helplessness was too much for the tease she broke down in a fit of smothered laughter which convinced her victim that it was nothing but an illtimed joke  well pen i wouldnt use you so she whimpered  penelope threw herself on the bed beside her  oh poor irene he is here  its a solemn fact and she caressed and soothed her sister while she choked with laughter  you must get up and come out  i dont know what brought him here but here he is  its too late now said irene desolately  then she added with a wilder despair what a fool i was to take that walk  well coaxed her sister come out and get some tea  the tea will do you good  no no i cant come  but send me a cup here  yes and then perhaps you can see him later in the evening  i shall not see him at all  an hour after penelope came back to her sisters room and found her before her glass  you might as well have kept still and been well by morning rene she said  as soon as we were done father said well mr corey and i have got to talk over a little matter of business and well excuse you ladies he looked at mother in a way that i guess was pretty hard to bear  rene you ought to have heard the colonel swelling at supper  it would have made you feel that all he said the other day was nothing  mrs lapham suddenly opened the door  now see here pen she said as she closed it behind her ive had just as much as i can stand from your father and if you dont tell me this instant what it all means  she left the consequences to imagination and penelope replied with her mock soberness  well the colonel does seem to be on his high horse maam but you mustnt ask me what his business with mr corey is for i dont know all that i know is that i met them at the landing and that they conversed all the way downon literary topics  nonsense what do you think it is  well if you want my candid opinion i think this talk about business is nothing but a blind  it seems a pity irene shouldnt have been up to receive him she added  irene cast a mute look of imploring at her mother who was too much preoccupied to afford her the protection it asked  your father said he wanted to go into the business with him  irenes look changed to a stare of astonishment and mystification but penelope preserved her imperturbability  well its a lucrative business i believe  well i dont believe a word of it cried mrs lapham  and so i told your father  did it seem to convince him inquired penelope  her mother did not reply  i know one thing she said  hes got to tell me every word or therell be no sleep for him this night  well maam said penelope breaking down in one of her queer laughs i shouldnt be a bit surprised if you were right  go on and dress irene ordered her mother and then you and pen come out into the parlour  they can have just two hours for business and then we must all be there to receive him  you havent got headache enough to hurt you  oh its all gone now said the girl  at the end of the limit she had given the colonel mrs lapham looked into the diningroom which she found blue with his smoke  i think you gentlemen will find the parlour pleasanter now and we can give it up to you  oh no you neednt said her husband  weve got about through corey was already standing and lapham rose too  i guess we can join the ladies now  we can leave that little point till tomorrow  both of the young ladies were in the parlour when corey entered with their father and both were frankly indifferent to the few books and the many newspapers scattered about on the table where the large lamp was placed  but after corey had greeted irene he glanced at the novel under his eye and said in the dearth that sometimes befalls people at such times i see youre reading middlemarch  do you like george eliot  who asked the girl  penelope interposed  i dont believe irenes read it yet  ive just got it out of the library i heard so much talk about it  i wish she would let you find out a little about the people for yourself she added  but here her father struck in  i cant get the time for books  its as much as i can do to keep up with the newspapers and when night comes im tired and id rather go out to the theatre or a lecture if theyve got a good stereopticon to give you views of the places  but i guess we all like a play better than most anything else  i want something thatll make me laugh  i dont believe in tragedy  i think theres enough of that in real life without putting it on the stage  seen joshua whitcomb  the whole family joined in the discussion and it appeared that they all had their opinions of the plays and actors  mrs lapham brought the talk back to literature  i guess penelope does most of our reading  now mother youre not going to put it all on me said the girl in comic protest  her mother laughed and then added with a sigh i used to like to get hold of a good book when i was a girl but we werent allowed to read many novels in those days  my mother called them all lies  and i guess she wasnt so very far wrong about some of them  theyre certainly fictions said corey smiling  well we do buy a good many books first and last said the colonel who probably had in mind the costly volumes which they presented to one another on birthdays and holidays  but i get about all the reading i want in the newspapers  and when the girls want a novel i tell em to get it out of the library  thats what the librarys for  phew he panted blowing away the whole unprofitable subject  how close you womenfolks like to keep a room you go down to the seaside or up to the mountains for a change of air and then you cork yourselves into a room so tight you dont have any air at all  here you girls get on your bonnets and go and show mr corey the view of the hotels from the rocks  corey said that he should be delighted  the girls exchanged looks with each other and then with their mother  irene curved her pretty chin in comment upon her fathers incorrigibility and penelope made a droll mouth but the colonel remained serenely content with his finesse  i got em out of the way he said as soon as they were gone and before his wife had time to fall upon him because ive got through my talk with him and now i want to talk with you  its just as i said persis he wants to go into the business with me  its lucky for you said his wife meaning that now he would not be made to suffer for attempting to hoax her  but she was too intensely interested to pursue that matter further  what in the world do you suppose he means by it  well i should judge by his talk that he had been trying a good many different things since he left college and he haint found just the thing he likesor the thing that likes him  it aint so easy  and now hes got an idea that he can take hold of the paint and push it in other countriespush it in mexico and push it in south america  hes a splendid spanish scholarthis was laphams version of coreys modest claim to a smattering of the languageand hes been among the natives enough to know their ways  and he believes in the paint added the colonel  i guess he believes in something else besides the paint said mrs lapham  what do you mean  well silas lapham if you cant see now that hes after irene i dont know what ever can open your eyes  thats all  the colonel pretended to give the idea silent consideration as if it had not occurred to him before  well then all ive got to say is that hes going a good way round  i dont say youre wrong but if its irene i dont see why he should want to go off to south america to get her  and thats what he proposes to do  i guess theres some paint about it too persis  he says he believes in itthe colonel devoutly lowered his voiceand hes willing to take the agency on his own account down there and run it for a commission on what he can sell  of course he isnt going to take hold of it any way so as to feel beholden to you  hes got too much pride for that  he aint going to take hold of it at all if he dont mean paint in the first place and irene afterward  i dont object to him as i know either way but the two things wont mix and i dont propose he shall pull the wool over my eyesor anybody else  but as far as heard from up to date he means paint first last and all the time  at any rate im going to take him on that basis  hes got some pretty good ideas about it and hes been stirred up by this talk just now about getting our manufactures into the foreign markets  theres an overstock in everything and weve got to get rid of it or weve got to shut down till the home demand begins again  weve had two or three such flurries before now and they didnt amount to much  they say we cant extend our commerce under the high tariff system weve got now because there aint any sort of reciprocity on our sidewe want to have the other fellows show all the reciprocityand the english have got the advantage of us every time  i dont know whether its so or not but i dont see why it should apply to my paint  anyway he wants to try it and ive about made up my mind to let him  of course i aint going to let him take all the risk  i believe in the paint too and i shall pay his expenses anyway  so you want another partner after all mrs lapham could not forbear saying  yes if thats your idea of a partner  it isnt mine returned her husband dryly  well if youve made up your mind si i suppose youre ready for advice said mrs lapham  the colonel enjoyed this  yes i am  what have you got to say against it  i dont know as ive got anything  im satisfied if you are  well  when is he going to start for south america  i shall take him into the office a while  hell get off some time in the winter  but hes got to know the business first  oh indeed are you going to take him to board in the family  what are you after persis  oh nothing i presume he will feel free to visit in the family even if he dont board with us  i presume he will  and if he dont use his privileges do you think hell be a fit person to manage your paint in south america  the colonel reddened consciously  im not taking him on that basis  oh yes you are you may pretend you aint to yourself but you mustnt pretend so to me  because i know you  the colonel laughed  pshaw he said  mrs lapham continued i dont see any harm in hoping that hell take a fancy to her  but if you really think it wont do to mix the two things i advise you not to take mr corey into the business  it will do all very well if he does take a fancy to her but if he dont you know how youll feel about it  and i know you well enough silas to know that you cant do him justice if that happens  and i dont think its right you should take this step unless youre pretty sure  i can see that youve set your heart on this thing  i havent set my heart on it at all protested lapham  and if you cant bring it about youre going to feel unhappy over it pursued his wife regardless of his protest  oh very well he said  if you know more about whats in my mind than i do theres no use arguing as i can see  he got up to carry off his consciousness and sauntered out of the door on to his piazza  he could see the young people down on the rocks and his heart swelled in his breast  he had always said that he did not care what a mans family was but the presence of young corey as an applicant to him for employment as his guest as the possible suitor of his daughter was one of the sweetest flavours that he had yet tasted in his success  he knew who the coreys were very well and in his simple brutal way he had long hated their name as a symbol of splendour which unless he should live to see at least three generations of his descendants gilded with mineral paint he could not hope to realise in his own  he was acquainted in a business way with the tradition of old phillips corey and he had heard a great many things about the corey who had spent his youth abroad and his fathers money everywhere and done nothing but say smart things  lapham could not see the smartness of some of them which had been repeated to him once he had encountered the fellow and it seemed to lapham that the tall slim whitemoustached man with the slight stoop was everything that was offensively aristocratic  he had bristled up aggressively at the name when his wife told how she had made the acquaintance of the fellows family the summer before and he had treated the notion of young coreys caring for irene with the contempt which such a ridiculous superstition deserved  he had made up his mind about young corey beforehand yet when he met him he felt an instant liking for him which he frankly acknowledged and he had begun to assume the burden of his wifes superstition of which she seemed now ready to accuse him of being the inventor  nothing had moved his thick imagination like this days events since the girl who taught him spelling and grammar in the school at lumberville had said she would have him for her husband  the dark figures stationary on the rocks began to move and he could see that they were coming toward the house  he went indoors so as not to appear to have been watching them    viii   a week after she had parted with her son at bar harbour mrs corey suddenly walked in upon her husband in their house in boston  he was at breakfast and he gave her the patronising welcome with which the husband who has been staying in town all summer receives his wife when she drops down upon him from the mountains or the seaside for a little moment she feels herself strange in the house and suffers herself to be treated like a guest before envy of his comfort vexes her back into possession and authority  mrs corey was a lady and she did not let her envy take the form of open reproach  well anna you find me here in the luxury you left me to  how did you leave the girls  the girls were well said mrs corey looking absently at her husbands brown velvet coat in which he was so handsome  no man had ever grown grey more beautifully  his hair while not remaining dark enough to form a theatrical contrast with his moustache was yet some shades darker and in becoming a little thinner it had become a little more gracefully wavy  his skin had the pearly tint which that of elderly men sometimes assumes and the lines which time had traced upon it were too delicate for the name of wrinkles  he had never had any personal vanity and there was no consciousness in his good looks now  i am glad of that  the boy i have with me he returned that is when he is with me  why where is he demanded the mother  probably carousing with the boon lapham somewhere  he left me yesterday afternoon to go and offer his allegiance to the mineral paint king and i havent seen him since  bromfield cried mrs corey  why didnt you stop him  well my dear im not sure that it isnt a very good thing  a good thing its horrid  no i dont think so  its decent  tom had found outwithout consulting the landscape which i believe proclaims it everywhere  hideous  that its really a good thing and he thinks that he has some ideas in regard to its dissemination in the parts beyond seas  why shouldnt he go into something else lamented the mother  i believe he has gone into nearly everything else and come out of it so there is a chance of his coming out of this  but as i had nothing to suggest in place of it i thought it best not to interfere  in fact what good would my telling him that mineral paint was nasty have done i dare say you told him it was nasty  yes i did  and you see with what effect though he values your opinion three times as much as he values mine  perhaps you came up to tell him again that it was nasty  i feel very unhappy about it  he is throwing himself away  yes i should like to prevent it if i could  the father shook his head  if lapham hasnt prevented it i fancy its too late  but there may be some hopes of lapham  as for toms throwing himself away i dont know  theres no question but he is one of the best fellows under the sun  hes tremendously energetic and he has plenty of the kind of sense which we call horse but he isnt brilliant  no tom is not brilliant  i dont think he would get on in a profession and hes instinctively kept out of everything of the kind  but he has got to do something  what shall he do he says mineral paint and really i dont see why he shouldnt if money is fairly and honestly earned why should we pretend to care what it comes out of when we dont really care that superstition is exploded everywhere  oh it isnt the paint alone said mrs corey and then she perceptibly arrested herself and made a diversion in continuing i wish he had married some one  with money suggested her husband  from time to time i have attempted toms corruption from that side but i suspect tom has a conscience against it and i rather like him for it  i married for love myself said corey looking across the table at his wife  she returned his look tolerantly though she felt it right to say what nonsense  besides continued her husband if you come to money there is the paint princess  she will have plenty  ah thats the worst of it sighed the mother  i suppose i could get on with the paint  but not with the princess i thought you said she was a very pretty wellbehaved girl  she is very pretty and she is wellbehaved but there is nothing of her  she is insipid she is very insipid  but tom seemed to like her flavour such as it was  how can i tell we were under a terrible obligation to them and i naturally wished him to be polite to them  in fact i asked him to be so  and he was too polite  i cant say that he was  but there is no doubt that the child is extremely pretty  tom says there are two of them  perhaps they will neutralise each other  yes there is another daughter assented mrs corey  i dont see how you can joke about such things bromfield she added  well i dont either my dear to tell you the truth  my hardihood surprises me  here is a son of mine whom i see reduced to making his living by a shrinkage in values  its very odd interjected corey that some values should have this peculiarity of shrinking  you never hear of values in a picture shrinking but rents stocks real estateall those values shrink abominably  perhaps it might be argued that one should put all his values into pictures ive got a good many of mine there  tom neednt earn his living said mrs corey refusing her husbands jest  theres still enough for all of us  that is what i have sometimes urged upon tom  i have proved to him that with economy and strict attention to business he need do nothing as long as he lives  of course he would be somewhat restricted and it would cramp the rest of us but it is a world of sacrifices and compromises  he couldnt agree with me and he was not in the least moved by the example of persons of quality in europe which i alleged in support of the life of idleness  it appears that he wishes to do somethingto do something for himself  i am afraid that tom is selfish  mrs corey smiled wanly  thirty years before she had married the rich young painter in rome who said so much better things than he paintedcharming things just the things to please the fancy of a girl who was disposed to take life a little too seriously and practically she saw him in a different light when she got him home to boston but he had kept on saying the charming things and he had not done much else  in fact he had fulfilled the promise of his youth  it was a good trait in him that he was not actively but only passively extravagant  he was not adventurous with his money his tastes were as simple as an italians he had no expensive habits  in the process of time he had grown to lead a more and more secluded life  it was hard to get him out anywhere even to dinner  his patience with their narrowing circumstances had a pathos which she felt the more the more she came into charge of their joint life  at times it seemed too bad that the children and their education and pleasures should cost so much  she knew besides that if it had not been for them she would have gone back to rome with him and lived princely there for less than it took to live respectably in boston  tom hasnt consulted me continued his father but he has consulted other people  and he has arrived at the conclusion that mineral paint is a good thing to go into  he has found out all about it and about its founder or inventor  its quite impressive to hear him talk  and if he must do something for himself i dont see why his egotism shouldnt as well take that form as another  combined with the paint princess it isnt so agreeable but thats only a remote possibility for which your principal ground is your motherly solicitude  but even if it were probable and imminent what could you do the chief consolation that we american parents have in these matters is that we can do nothing  if we were europeans even english we should take some cognisance of our childrens love affairs and in some measure teach their young affections how to shoot  but it is our custom to ignore them until they have shot and then they ignore us  we are altogether too delicate to arrange the marriages of our children and when they have arranged them we dont like to say anything for fear we should only make bad worse  the right way is for us to school ourselves to indifference  that is what the young people have to do elsewhere and that is the only logical result of our position here it is absurd for us to have any feeling about what we dont interfere with  oh people do interfere with their childrens marriages very often said mrs corey  yes but only in a halfhearted way so as not to make it disagreeable for themselves if the marriages go on in spite of them as theyre pretty apt to do  now my idea is that i ought to cut tom off with a shilling  that would be very simple and it would be economical  but you would never consent and tom wouldnt mind it  i think our whole conduct in regard to such things is wrong said mrs corey  oh very likely  but our whole civilisation is based upon it  and who is going to make a beginning to which father in our acquaintance shall i go and propose an alliance for tom with his daughter i should feel like an ass  and will you go to some mother and ask her sons in marriage for our daughters you would feel like a goose  no the only motto for us is hands off altogether  i shall certainly speak to tom when the time comes said mrs corey  and i shall ask leave to be absent from your discomfiture my dear answered her husband  the son returned that afternoon and confessed his surprise at finding his mother in boston  he was so frank that she had not quite the courage to confess in turn why she had come but trumped up an excuse  well mother he said promptly i have made an engagement with mr lapham  have you tom she asked faintly  yes for the present i am going to have charge of his foreign correspondence and if i see my way to the advantage i expect to find in it i am going out to manage that side of his business in south america and mexico  hes behaved very handsomely about it  he says that if it appears for our common interest he shall pay me a salary as well as a commission  ive talked with uncle jim and he thinks its a good opening  your uncle jim does queried mrs corey in amaze  yes i consulted him the whole way through and ive acted on his advice  this seemed an incomprehensible treachery on her brothers part  yes i thought you would like to have me  and besides i couldnt possibly have gone to any one so well fitted to advise me  his mother said nothing  in fact the mineral paint business however painful its interest was for the moment superseded by a more poignant anxiety  she began to feel her way cautiously toward this  have you been talking about your business with mr lapham all night  well pretty much said her son with a guiltless laugh  i went to see him yesterday afternoon after i had gone over the whole ground with uncle jim and mr lapham asked me to go down with him and finish up  down repeated mrs corey  yes to nantasket  he has a cottage down there  at nantasket mrs corey knitted her brows a little  what in the world can a cottage at nantasket be like  oh very much like a cottage anywhere  it has the usual allowance of red roof and veranda  there are the regulation rocks by the sea and the big hotels on the beach about a mile off flaring away with electric lights and romancandles at night  we didnt have them at nahant  no said his mother  is mrs lapham well and her daughter  yes i think so said the young man  the young ladies walked me down to the rocks in the usual way after dinner and then i came back and talked paint with mr lapham till midnight  we didnt settle anything till this morning coming up on the boat  what sort of people do they seem to be at home  what sort well i dont know that i noticed mrs corey permitted herself the first part of a sigh of relief and her son laughed but apparently not at her  theyre just reading middlemarch  they say theres so much talk about it  oh i suppose theyre very good people they seemed to be on very good terms with each other  i suppose its the plain sister whos reading middlemarch  plain is she plain asked the young man as if searching his consciousness  yes its the older one who does the reading apparently  but i dont believe that even she overdoes it  they like to talk better  they reminded me of southern people in that the young man smiled as if amused by some of his impressions of the lapham family  the living as the country people call it is tremendously good  the colonelhes a coloneltalked of the coffee as his wifes coffee as if she had personally made it in the kitchen though i believe it was merely inspired by her  and there was everything in the house that money could buy  but money has its limitations  this was a fact which mrs corey was beginning to realise more and more unpleasantly in her own life but it seemed to bring her a certain comfort in its application to the laphams  yes there is a point where taste has to begin she said  they seemed to want to apologise to me for not having more books said corey  i dont know why they should  the colonel said they bought a good many books first and last but apparently they dont take them to the seaside  i dare say they never buy a new book  ive met some of these moneyed people lately and they lavish on every conceivable luxury and then borrow books and get them in the cheap paper editions  i fancy thats the way with the lapham family said the young man smilingly  but they are very good people  the other daughter is humorous  humorous mrs corey knitted her brows in some perplexity  do you mean like mrs sayre she asked naming the lady whose name must come into every boston mind when humour is mentioned  oh no nothing like that  she never says anything that you can remember nothing in flashes or ripples nothing the least literary but its a sort of droll way of looking at things or a droll medium through which things present themselves  i dont know  she tells what shes seen and mimics a little  oh said mrs corey coldly  after a moment she asked and is miss irene as pretty as ever  shes a wonderful complexion said the son unsatisfactorily  i shall want to be by when father and colonel lapham meet he added with a smile  ah yes your father said the mother in that way in which a wife at once compassionates and censures her husband to their children  do you think its really going to be a trial to him asked the young man quickly  no no i cant say it is  but i confess i wish it was some other business tom  well mother i dont see why  the principal thing looked at now is the amount of money and while i would rather starve than touch a dollar that was dirty with any sort of dishonesty  of course you would my son interposed his mother proudly  i shouldnt at all mind its having a little mineral paint on it  ill use my influence with colonel laphamif i ever have anyto have his paint scraped off the landscape  i suppose you wont begin till the autumn  oh yes i shall said the son laughing at his mothers simple ignorance of business  i shall begin tomorrow morning  tomorrow morning  yes ive had my desk appointed already and i shall be down there at nine in the morning to take possession  tom cried his mother why do you think mr lapham has taken you into business so readily ive always heard that it was so hard for young men to get in  and do you think i found it easy with him we had about twelve hours solid talk  and you dont suppose it was any sort ofpersonal consideration  why i dont know exactly what you mean mother  i suppose he likes me  mrs corey could not say just what she meant  she answered ineffectually enough  yes you wouldnt like it to be a favour would you  i think hes a man who may be trusted to look after his own interest but i dont mind his beginning by liking me  itll be my own fault if i dont make myself essential to him  yes said mrs corey  well demanded her husband at their first meeting after her interview with their son what did you say to tom  very little if anything  i found him with his mind made up and it would only have distressed him if i had tried to change it  that is precisely what i said my dear  besides he had talked the matter over fully with james and seems to have been advised by him  i cant understand james  oh its in regard to the paint and not the princess that hes made up his mind  well i think you were wise to let him alone anna  we represent a faded tradition  we dont really care what business a man is in so it is large enough and he doesnt advertise offensively but we think it fine to affect reluctance  do you really feel so bromfield asked his wife seriously  certainly i do  there was a long time in my misguided youth when i supposed myself some sort of porcelain but its a relief to be of the common clay after all and to know it  if i get broken i can be easily replaced  if tom must go into such a business said mrs corey im glad james approves of it  im afraid it wouldnt matter to tom if he didnt and i dont know that i should care said corey betraying the fact that he had perhaps had a good deal of his brotherinlaws judgment in the course of his life  you had better consult him in regard to toms marrying the princess  there is no necessity at present for that said mrs corey with dignity  after a moment she asked should you feel quite so easy if it were a question of that bromfield  it would be a little more personal  you feel about it as i do  of course we have both lived too long and seen too much of the world to suppose we can control such things the child is good i havent the least doubt and all those things can be managed so that they wouldnt disgrace us  but she has had a certain sort of bringing up  i should prefer tom to marry a girl with another sort and this business venture of his increases the chances that he wont thats all  tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but twill serve  i shouldnt like it  well it hasnt happened yet  ah you never can realise anything beforehand  perhaps that has saved me some suffering  but you have at least the consolation of two anxieties at once  i always find that a great advantage  you can play one off against the other  mrs corey drew a long breath as if she did not experience the suggested consolation and she arranged to quit the following afternoon the scene of her defeat which she had not had the courage to make a battlefield  her son went down to see her off on the boat after spending his first day at his desk in laphams office  he was in a gay humour and she departed in a reflected gleam of his good spirits  he told her all about it as he sat talking with her at the stern of the boat lingering till the last moment and then stepping ashore with as little waste of time as lapham himself on the gangplank which the deckhands had laid hold of  he touched his hat to her from the wharf to reassure her of his escape from being carried away with her and the next moment his smiling face hid itself in the crowd  he walked on smiling up the long wharf encumbered with trucks and hacks and piles of freight and taking his way through the deserted business streets beyond this bustle made a point of passing the door of laphams warehouse on the jambs of which his name and paint were lettered in black on a square ground of white  the door was still open and corey loitered a moment before it tempted to go upstairs and fetch away some foreign letters which he had left on his desk and which he thought he might finish up at home  he was in love with his work and he felt the enthusiasm for it which nothing but the work we can do well inspires in us  he believed that he had found his place in the world after a good deal of looking and he had the relief the repose of fitting into it  every little incident of the momentous uneventful day was a pleasure in his mind from his sitting down at his desk to which laphams boy brought him the foreign letters till his rising from it an hour ago  lapham had been in view within his own office but he had given corey no formal reception and had in fact not spoken to him till toward the end of the forenoon when he suddenly came out of his den with some more letters in his hand and after a brief how dye do had spoken a few words about them and left them with him  he was in his shirtsleeves again and his sanguine person seemed to radiate the heat with which he suffered  he did not go out to lunch but had it brought to him in his office where corey saw him eating it before he left his own desk to go out and perch on a swinging seat before the long counter of a downtown restaurant  he observed that all the others lunched at twelve and he resolved to anticipate his usual hour  when he returned the pretty girl who had been clicking away at a typewriter all the morning was neatly putting out of sight the evidences of pie from the table where her machine stood and was preparing to go on with her copying  in his office lapham lay asleep in his armchair with a newspaper over his face  now while corey lingered at the entrance to the stairway these two came down the stairs together and he heard lapham saying well then you better get a divorce  he looked red and excited and the girls face which she veiled at sight of corey showed traces of tears  she slipped round him into the street  but lapham stopped and said with the show of no feeling but surprise hello corey did you want to go up  yes there were some letters i hadnt quite got through with  youll find dennis up there  but i guess you better let them go till tomorrow i always make it a rule to stop work when im done  perhaps youre right said corey yielding  come along down as far as the boat with me  theres a little matter i want to talk over with you  it was a business matter and related to coreys proposed connection with the house  the next day the head bookkeeper who lunched at the long counter of the same restaurant with corey began to talk with him about lapham walker had not apparently got his place by seniority though with his forehead bald far up toward the crown and his round smooth face one might have taken him for a plump elder if he had not looked equally like a robust infant  the thick drabbish yellow moustache was what arrested decision in either direction and the prompt vigour of all his movements was that of a young man of thirty which was really walkers age  he knew of course who corey was and he had waited for a man who might look down on him socially to make the overtures toward something more than business acquaintance but these made he was readily responsive and drew freely on his philosophy of lapham and his affairs  i think about the only difference between people in this world is that some know what they want and some dont well now said walker beating the bottom of his saltbox to make the salt come out the old man knows what he wants every time  and generally he gets it  yes sir he generally gets it  he knows what hes about but ill be blessed if the rest of us do half the time  anyway we dont till hes ready to let us  you take my position in most business houses  its confidential  the head bookkeeper knows right along pretty much everything the house has got in hand  ill give you my word i dont he may open up to you a little more in your department but as far as the rest of us go he dont open up any more than an oyster on a hot brick  they say he had a partner once i guess hes dead  i wouldnt like to be the old mans partner  well you see this paint of his is like his hearts blood  better not try to joke him about it  ive seen people come in occasionally and try it  they didnt get much fun out of it  while he talked walker was plucking up morsels from his plate tearing off pieces of french bread from the long loaf and feeding them into his mouth in an impersonal way as if he were firing up an engine  i suppose he thinks suggested corey that if he doesnt tell nobody else will  walker took a draught of beer from his glass and wiped the foam from his moustache  oh but he carries it too far its a weakness with him  hes just so about everything  look at the way he keeps it up about that typewriter girl of his  youd think she was some princess travelling incognito  there isnt one of us knows who she is or where she came from or who she belongs to  he brought her and her machine into the office one morning and set em down at a table and thats all there is about it as far as were concerned  its pretty hard on the girl for i guess shed like to talk and to any one that didnt know the old man walker broke off and drained his glass of what was left in it  corey thought of the words he had overheard from lapham to the girl but he said she seems to be kept pretty busy  oh yes said walker there aint much loafing round the place in any of the departments from the old mans down  thats just what i say  hes got to work just twice as hard if he wants to keep everything in his own mind  but he aint afraid of work  thats one good thing about him  and miss dewey has to keep step with the rest of us  but she dont look like one that would take to it naturally  such a pretty girl as that generally thinks she does enough when she looks her prettiest  shes a pretty girl said corey noncommittally but i suppose a great many pretty girls have to earn their living  dont any of em like to do it returned the bookkeeper  they think its a hardship and i dont blame em they have got a right to get married and they ought to have the chance  and miss deweys smart too  shes as bright as a biscuit  i guess shes had trouble i shouldnt be much more than half surprised if miss dewey wasnt miss dewey or hadnt always been  yes sir continued the bookkeeper who prolonged the talk as they walked back to laphams warehouse together i dont know exactly what it isit isnt any one thing in particularbut i should say that girl had been married  i wouldnt speak so freely to any of the rest mr coreyi want you to understand thatand it isnt any of my business anyway but thats my opinion  corey made no reply as he walked beside the bookkeeper who continued  its curious what a difference marriage makes in people  now i know that i dont look any more like a bachelor of my age than i do like the man in the moon and yet i couldnt say where the difference came in to save me  and its just so with a woman  the minute you catch sight of her face theres something in it that tells you whether shes married or not  what do you suppose it is  im sure i dont know said corey willing to laugh away the topic and from what i read occasionally of some people who go about repeating their happiness i shouldnt say that the intangible evidences were always unmistakable  oh of course admitted walker easily surrendering his position all signs fail in dry weather  hello whats that he caught corey by the arm and they both stopped  at a corner half a block ahead of them the summer noon solitude of the place was broken by a bit of drama  a man and woman issued from the intersecting street and at the moment of coming into sight the man who looked like a sailor caught the woman by the arm as if to detain her  a brief struggle ensued the woman trying to free herself and the man half coaxing half scolding  the spectators could now see that he was drunk but before they could decide whether it was a case for their interference or not the woman suddenly set both hands against the mans breast and gave him a quick push  he lost his footing and tumbled into a heap in the gutter  the woman faltered an instant as if to see whether he was seriously hurt and then turned and ran  when corey and the bookkeeper reentered the office miss dewey had finished her lunch and was putting a sheet of paper into her typewriter she looked up at them with her eyes of turquoise blue under her low white forehead with the hair neatly rippled over it and then began to beat the keys of her machine    ix   lapham had the pride which comes of selfmaking and he would not openly lower his crest to the young fellow he had taken into his business  he was going to be obviously master in his own place to every one and during the hours of business he did nothing to distinguish corey from the halfdozen other clerks and bookkeepers in the outer office but he was not silent about the fact that bromfield coreys son had taken a fancy to come to him  did you notice that fellow at the desk facing my typewriter girl well sir thats the son of bromfield coreyold phillips coreys grandson  and ill say this for him that there isnt a man in the office that looks after his work better  there isnt anything hes too good for  hes right here at nine every morning before the clock gets in the word  i guess its his grandfather coming out in him  hes got charge of the foreign correspondence  were pushing the paint everywhere he flattered himself that he did not lug the matter in  he had been warned against that by his wife but he had the right to do corey justice and his brag took the form of illustration  talk about training for businessi tell you its all in the man himself i used to believe in what old horace greeley said about college graduates being the poorest kind of horned cattle but ive changed my mind a little  you take that fellow corey  hes been through harvard and hes had about every advantage that a fellow could have  been everywhere and talks half a dozen languages like english  i suppose hes got money enough to live without lifting a hand any more than his father does son of bromfield corey you know  but the thing was in him  hes a naturalborn business man and ive had many a fellow with me that had come up out of the street and worked hard all his life without ever losing his original opposition to the thing  but corey likes it  i believe the fellow would like to stick at that desk of his night and day  i dont know where he got it  i guess it must be his grandfather old phillips corey it often skips a generation you know  but what i say is a thing has got to be born in a man and if it aint born in him all the privations in the world wont put it there and if it is all the college training wont take it out  sometimes lapham advanced these ideas at his own table to a guest whom he had brought to nantasket for the night  then he suffered exposure and ridicule at the hands of his wife when opportunity offered  she would not let him bring corey down to nantasket at all  no indeed she said  i am not going to have them think were running after him  if he wants to see irene he can find out ways of doing it for himself  who wants him to see irene retorted the colonel angrily  i do said mrs lapham  and i want him to see her without any of your connivance silas  im not going to have it said that i put my girls at anybody  why dont you invite some of your other clerks  he aint just like the other clerks  hes going to take charge of a part of the business  its quite another thing  oh indeed said mrs lapham vexatiously  then you are going to take a partner  i shall ask him down if i choose returned the colonel disdaining her insinuation  his wife laughed with the fearlessness of a woman who knows her husband  but you wont choose when youve thought it over si then she applied an emollient to his chafed surface  dont you suppose i feel as you do about it i know just how proud you are and im not going to have you do anything that will make you feel meeching afterward  you just let things take their course  if he wants irene hes going to find out some way of seeing her and if he dont all the plotting and planning in the world isnt going to make him  whos plotting again retorted the colonel shuddering at the utterance of hopes and ambitions which a man hides with shame but a woman talks over as freely and coolly as if they were items of a milliners bill  oh not you exulted his wife  i understand what you want  you want to get this fellow who is neither partner nor clerk down here to talk business with him  well now you just talk business with him at the office  the only social attention which lapham succeeded in offering corey was to take him in his buggy now and then for a spin out over the milldam he kept the mare in town and on a pleasant afternoon he liked to knock off early as he phrased it and let the mare out a little  corey understood something about horses though in a passionless way and he would have preferred to talk business when obliged to talk horse  but he deferred to his business superior with the sense of discipline which is innate in the apparently insubordinate american nature  if corey could hardly have helped feeling the social difference between lapham and himself in his presence he silenced his traditions and showed him all the respect that he could have exacted from any of his clerks  he talked horse with him and when the colonel wished he talked house  besides himself and his paint lapham had not many other topics and if he had a choice between the mare and the edifice on the water side of beacon street it was just now the latter sometimes in driving in or out he stopped at the house and made corey his guest there if he might not at nantasket and one day it happened that the young man met irene there again  she had come up with her mother alone and they were in the house interviewing the carpenter as before when the colonel jumped out of his buggy and cast anchor at the pavement  more exactly mrs lapham was interviewing the carpenter and irene was sitting in the bowwindow on a trestle and looking out at the driving  she saw him come up with her father and bowed and blushed  her father went on upstairs to find her mother and corey pulled up another trestle which he found in the back part of the room  the first floorings had been laid throughout the house and the partitions had been lathed so that one could realise the shape of the interior  i suppose you will sit at this window a good deal said the young man  yes i think it will be very nice  theres so much more going on than there is in the square  it must be very interesting to you to see the house grow  it is  only it doesnt seem to grow so fast as i expected  why im amazed at the progress your carpenter has made every time i come  the girl looked down and then lifting her eyes she said with a sort of timorous appeal  ive been reading that book since you were down at nantasket  book repeated corey while she reddened with disappointment  oh yes  middlemarch  did you like it  i havent got through with it yet  pen has finished it  what does she think of it  oh i think she likes it very well  i havent heard her talk about it much  do you like it  yes i liked it immensely  but its several years since i read it  i didnt know it was so old  its just got into the seaside library she urged with a little sense of injury in her tone  oh it hasnt been out such a very great while said corey politely it came a little before daniel deronda  the girl was again silent  she followed the curl of a shaving on the floor with the point of her parasol  do you like that rosamond vincy she asked without looking up  corey smiled in his kind way  i didnt suppose she was expected to have any friends  i cant say i liked her  but i dont think i disliked her so much as the author does  shes pretty hard on her goodlookinghe was going to say girls but as if that might have been rather personal he saidpeople  yes thats what pen says  she says she doesnt give her any chance to be good  she says she should have been just as bad as rosamond if she had been in her place  the young man laughed  your sister is very satirical isnt she  i dont know said irene still intent upon the convolutions of the shaving  she keeps us laughing  papa thinks theres nobody that can talk like her she gave the shaving a little toss from her and took the parasol up across her lap  the unworldliness of the lapham girls did not extend to their dress irenes costume was very stylish and she governed her head and shoulders stylishly  we are going to have the back room upstairs for a musicroom and library she said abruptly  yes returned corey  i should think that would be charming  we expected to have bookcases but the architect wants to build the shelves in  the fact seemed to be referred to corey for his comment  it seems to me that would be the best way  theyll look like part of the room then  you can make them low and hang your pictures above them  yes thats what he said the girl looked out of the window in adding i presume with nice bindings it will look very well  oh nothing furnishes a room like books  no there will have to be a good many of them  that depends upon the size of your room and the number of your shelves  oh of course i presume said irene thoughtfully we shall have to have gibbon  if you want to read him said corey with a laugh of sympathy for an imaginable joke  we had a great deal about him at school  i believe we had one of his books  mines lost but pen will remember  the young man looked at her and then said seriously youll want greene of course and motley and parkman  yes what kind of writers are they  theyre historians too  oh yes i remember now  thats what gibbon was  is it gibbon or gibbons  the young man decided the point with apparently superfluous delicacy gibbon i think  there used to be so many of them said irene gaily  i used to get them mixed up with each other and i couldnt tell them from the poets should you want to have poetry  yes i suppose some edition of the english poets  we dont any of us like poetry  do you like it  im afraid i dont very much corey owned  but of course there was a time when tennyson was a great deal more to me than he is now  we had something about him at school too  i think i remember the name  i think we ought to have all the american poets  well not all  five or six of the best you want longfellow and bryant and whittier and holmes and emerson and lowell  the girl listened attentively as if making mental note of the names  and shakespeare she added  dont you like shakespeares plays  oh yes very much  i used to be perfectly crazy about his plays  dont you think hamlet is splendid we had ever so much about shakespeare  werent you perfectly astonished when you found out how many other plays of his there were i always thought there was nothing but hamlet and romeo and juliet and macbeth and richard iii and king lear and that one that robeson and crane haveoh yes comedy of errors  those are the ones they usually play said corey  i presume we shall have to have scotts works said irene returning to the question of books  oh yes  one of the girls used to think he was great  she was always talking about scott irene made a pretty little amiably contemptuous mouth he isnt american though she suggested  no said corey hes scotch i believe  irene passed her glove over her forehead  i always get him mixed up with cooper  well papa has got to get them  if we have a library we have got to have books in it  pen says its perfectly ridiculous having one  but papa thinks whatever the architect says is right  he fought him hard enough at first  i dont see how any one can keep the poets and the historians and novelists separate in their mind  of course papa will buy them if we say so  but i dont see how im ever going to tell him which ones the joyous light faded out of her face and left it pensive  why if you like said the young man taking out his pencil ill put down the names weve been talking about  he clapped himself on his breast pockets to detect some lurking scrap of paper  will you she cried delightedly  here take one of my cards and she pulled out her cardcase the carpenter writes on a threecornered block and puts it into his pocket and its so uncomfortable he cant help remembering it  pen says shes going to adopt the threecorneredblock plan with papa  thank you said corey  i believe ill use your card he crossed over to her and after a moment sat down on the trestle beside her she looked over the card as he wrote  those are the ones we mentioned but perhaps id better add a few others  oh thank you she said when he had written the card full on both sides  he has got to get them in the nicest binding too  i shall tell him about their helping to furnish the room and then he cant object she remained with the card looking at it rather wistfully  perhaps corey divined her trouble of mind  if he will take that to any bookseller and tell him what bindings he wants he will fill the order for him  oh thank you very much she said and put the card back into her cardcase with great apparent relief  then she turned her lovely face toward the young man beaming with the triumph a woman feels in any bit of successful manoeuvring and began to talk with recovered gaiety of other things as if having got rid of a matter annoying out of all proportion to its importance she was now going to indemnify herself  corey did not return to his own trestle  she found another shaving within reach of her parasol and began poking that with it and trying to follow it through its folds  corey watched her a while  you seem to have a great passion for playing with shavings he said is it a new one  new what  passion  i dont know she said dropping her eyelids and keeping on with her effort  she looked shyly aslant at him  perhaps you dont approve of playing with shavings  oh yes i do  i admire it very much  but it seems rather difficult ive a great ambition to put my foot on the shavings tail and hold it for you  well said the girl  thank you said the young man  he did so and now she ran her parasol point easily through it  they looked at each other and laughed  that was wonderful  would you like to try another he asked  no i thank you she replied  i think one will do  they both laughed again for whatever reason or no reason and then the young girl became sober  to a girl everything a young man does is of significance and if he holds a shaving down with his foot while she pokes through it with her parasol she must ask herself what he means by it  they seem to be having rather a long interview with the carpenter today said irene looking vaguely toward the ceiling  she turned with polite ceremony to corey  im afraid youre letting them keep you  you mustnt  oh no  youre letting me stay he returned  she bridled and bit her lip for pleasure  i presume they will be down before a great while  dont you like the smell of the wood and the mortar its so fresh  yes its delicious he bent forward and picked up from the floor the shaving with which they had been playing and put it to his nose its like a flower  may i offer it to you he asked as if it had been one  oh thank you thank you she took it from him and put it into her belt and then they both laughed once more  steps were heard descending  when the elder people reached the floor where they were sitting corey rose and presently took his leave  what makes you so solemn rene asked mrs lapham  solemn echoed the girl  im not a bit solemn  what can you mean  corey dined at home that evening and as he sat looking across the table at his father he said i wonder what the average literature of noncultivated people is  ah said the elder i suspect the average is pretty low even with cultivated people  you dont read a great many books yourself tom  no i dont the young man confessed  i read more books when i was with stanton last winter than i had since i was a boy  but i read them because i mustthere was nothing else to do  it wasnt because i was fond of reading  still i think i read with some sense of literature and the difference between authors  i dont suppose that people generally do that i have met people who had read books without troubling themselves to find out even the authors name much less trying to decide upon his quality  i suppose thats the way the vast majority of people read  yes if authors were not almost necessarily recluses and ignorant of the ignorance about them i dont see how they could endure it  of course they are fated to be overwhelmed by oblivion at last poor fellows but to see it weltering all round them while they are in the very act of achieving immortality must be tremendously discouraging  i dont suppose that we who have the habit of reading and at least a nodding acquaintance with literature can imagine the bestial darkness of the great mass of peopleeven people whose houses are rich and whose linen is purple and fine  but occasionally we get glimpses of it  i suppose you found the latest publications lying all about in lapham cottage when you were down there  young corey laughed  it wasnt exactly cumbered with them  no  to tell the truth i dont suppose they ever buy books  the young ladies get novels that they hear talked of out of the circulating library  had they knowledge enough to be ashamed of their ignorance  yes in certain waysto a certain degree  its a curious thing this thing we call civilisation said the elder musingly  we think it is an affair of epochs and of nations  its really an affair of individuals  one brother will be civilised and the other a barbarian  ive occasionally met young girls who were so brutally insolently wilfully indifferent to the arts which make civilisation that they ought to have been clothed in the skins of wild beasts and gone about barefoot with clubs over their shoulders  yet they were of polite origin and their parents were at least respectful of the things that these young animals despised  i dont think that is exactly the case with the lapham family said the son smiling  the father and mother rather apologised about not getting time to read and the young ladies by no means scorned it  they are quite advanced  they are going to have a library in their beacon street house  oh poor things how are they ever going to get the books together  well sir said the son colouring a little i have been indirectly applied to for help  you tom his father dropped back in his chair and laughed  i recommended the standard authors said the son  oh i never supposed your prudence would be at fault tom  but seriously said the young man generously smiling in sympathy with his fathers enjoyment theyre not unintelligent people  they are very quick and they are shrewd and sensible  i have no doubt that some of the sioux are so  but that is not saying that they are civilised  all civilisation comes through literature now especially in our country  a greek got his civilisation by talking and looking and in some measure a parisian may still do it but we who live remote from history and monuments we must read or we must barbarise  once we were softened if not polished by religion but i suspect that the pulpit counts for much less now in civilising  theyre enormous devourers of newspapers and theatregoers and they go a great deal to lectures  the colonel prefers them with the stereopticon  they might get a something in that way said the elder thoughtfully yes i suppose one must take those things into accountespecially the newspapers and the lectures  i doubt if the theatre is a factor in civilisation among us  i dare say it doesnt deprave a great deal but from what ive seen of it i should say that it was intellectually degrading  perhaps they might get some sort of lift from it i dont know  tom he added after a moments reflection  i really think i ought to see this patron of yours  dont you think it would be rather decent in me to make his acquaintance  well if you have the fancy sir said the young man  but theres no sort of obligation  colonel lapham would be the last man in the world to want to give our relation any sort of social character  the meeting will come about in the natural course of things  ah i didnt intend to propose anything immediate said the father one cant do anything in the summer and i should prefer your mothers superintendence  still i cant rid myself of the idea of a dinner it appears to me that there ought to be a dinner  oh pray dont feel that theres any necessity  well said the elder with easy resignation theres at least no hurry   there is one thing i dont like said lapham in the course of one of those talks which came up between his wife and himself concerning corey or at least i dont understand it and thats the way his father behaves  i dont want to force myself on any man but it seems to me pretty queer the way he holds off  i should think he would take enough interest in his son to want to know something about his business  what is he afraid of demanded lapham angrily  does he think im going to jump at a chance to get in with him if he gives me one hes mightily mistaken if he does  i dont want to know him  silas said his wife making a wifes free version of her husbands words and replying to their spirit rather than their letter i hope you never said a word to mr corey to let him know the way you feel  i never mentioned his father to him roared the colonel  thats the way i feel about it  because it would spoil everything  i wouldnt have them think we cared the least thing in the world for their acquaintance  we shouldnt be a bit better off  we dont know the same people they do and we dont care for the same kind of things  lapham was breathless with resentment of his wifes implication dont i tell you he gasped that i dont want to know them who began it theyre friends of yours if theyre anybodys  theyre distant acquaintances of mine returned mrs lapham quietly and this young corey is a clerk of yours  and i want we should hold ourselves so that when they get ready to make the advances we can meet them halfway or not just as we choose  thats what grinds me cried her husband  why should we wait for them to make the advances why shouldnt we make em are they any better than we are  my note of hand would be worth ten times what bromfield coreys is on the street today and i made my money  i havent loafed my life away  oh it isnt what youve got and it isnt what youve done exactly its what you are  well then whats the difference  none that really amounts to anything or that need give you any trouble if you dont think of it  but hes been all his life in society and he knows just what to say and what to do and he can talk about the things that society people like to talk about and youcant  lapham gave a furious snort  and does that make him any better  no but it puts him where he can make the advances without demeaning himself and it puts you where you cant now look here silas lapham you understand this thing as well as i do  you know that i appreciate you and that id sooner die than have you humble yourself to a living soul  but im not going to have you coming to me and pretending that you can meet bromfield corey as an equal on his own ground  you cant hes got a better education than you and if he hasnt got more brains than you hes got different  and he and his wife and their fathers and grandfathers before em have always had a high position and you cant help it  if you want to know them youve got to let them make the advances  if you dont all well and good  i guess said the chafed and vanquished colonel after a moment for swallowing the pill that theyd have been in a pretty fix if youd waited to let them make the advances last summer  that was a different thing altogether  i didnt know who they were or may be i should have waited  but all i say now is that if youve got young corey into business with you in hopes of our getting into society with his father you better ship him at once  for i aint going to have it on that basis  who wants to have it on that basis retorted her husband  nobody if you dont said mrs lapham tranquilly  irene had come home with the shaving in her belt unnoticed by her father and unquestioned by her mother  but her sister saw it at once and asked her what she was doing with it  oh nothing said irene with a joyful smile of selfbetrayal taking the shaving carefully out and laying it among the laces and ribbons in her drawer  hadnt you better put it in water rene itll be all wilted by morning said pen  you mean thing cried the happy girl  it isnt a flower  oh i thought it was a whole bouquet  who gave it to you  i shant tell you said irene saucily  oh well never mind  did you know mr corey had been down here this afternoon walking on the beach with me  he wasnthe wasnt at all he was at the house with me  there ive caught you fairly  is that so drawled penelope  then i never could guess who gave you that precious shaving  no you couldnt said irene flushing beautifully  and you may guess and you may guess and you may guess with her lovely eyes she coaxed her sister to keep on teasing her and penelope continued the comedy with the patience that women have for such things  well im not going to try if its no use  but i didnt know it had got to be the fashion to give shavings instead of flowers  but theres some sense in it  they can be used for kindlings when they get old and you cant do anything with old flowers  perhaps hell get to sending em by the barrel  irene laughed for pleasure in this tormenting  o pen i want to tell you how it all happened  oh he did give it to you then well i guess i dont care to hear  you shall and youve got to irene ran and caught her sister who feigned to be going out of the room and pushed her into a chair there now she pulled up another chair and hemmed her in with it he came over and sat down on the trestle alongside of me  what as close as you are to me now  you wretch i will give it to you no at a proper distance  and here was this shaving on the floor that id been poking with my parasol  to hide your embarrassment  pshaw i wasnt a bit embarrassed  i was just as much at my ease and then he asked me to let him hold the shaving down with his foot while i went on with my poking  and i said yes he might  what a bold girl you said he might hold a shaving down for you  and thenand then continued irene lifting her eyes absently and losing herself in the beatific recollection and thenoh yes then i asked him if he didnt like the smell of pine shavings  and then he picked it up and said it smelt like a flower  and then he asked if he might offer it to mejust for a joke you know  and i took it and stuck it in my belt  and we had such a laugh we got into a regular gale  and o pen what do you suppose he meant by it she suddenly caught herself to her sisters breast and hid her burning face on her shoulder  well there used to be a book about the language of flowers  but i never knew much about the language of shavings and i cant say exactly  oh dontdont pen and here irene gave over laughing and began to sob in her sisters arms  why rene cried the elder girl  you know he didnt mean anything  he doesnt care a bit about me  he hates me he despises me oh what shall i do  a trouble passed over the face of the sister as she silently comforted the child in her arms then the drolling light came back into her eyes well rene you havent got to do anything  thats one advantage girls have gotif it is an advantage  im not always sure  irenes tears turned to laughing again  when she lifted her head it was to look into the mirror confronting them where her beauty showed all the more brilliant for the shower that had passed over it  she seemed to gather courage from the sight  it must be awful to have to do she said smiling into her own face i dont see how they ever can  some of em cantespecially when theres such a tearing beauty around  oh pshaw pen you know that isnt so  youve got a real pretty mouth pen she added thoughtfully surveying the feature in the glass and then pouting her own lips for the sake of that effect on them  its a useful mouth penelope admitted i dont believe i could get along without it now ive had it so long  its got such a funny expressionjust the mate of the look in your eyes as if you were just going to say something ridiculous  he said the very first time he saw you that he knew you were humorous  is it possible it must be so if the grand mogul said it  why didnt you tell me so before and not let me keep on going round just like a common person  irene laughed as if she liked to have her sister take his praises in that way rather than another  ive got such a stiff prim kind of mouth she said drawing it down and then looking anxiously at it  i hope you didnt put on that expression when he offered you the shaving  if you did i dont believe hell ever give you another splinter  the severe mouth broke into a lovely laugh and then pressed itself in a kiss against penelopes cheek  there be done you silly thing im not going to have you accepting me before ive offered myself anyway she freed herself from her sisters embrace and ran from her round the room  irene pursued her in the need of hiding her face against her shoulder again  o pen o pen she cried   the next day at the first moment of finding herself alone with her eldest daughter mrs lapham asked as if knowing that penelope must have already made it subject of inquiry what was irene doing with that shaving in her belt yesterday  oh just some nonsense of hers with mr corey  he gave it to her at the new house penelope did not choose to look up and meet her mothers grave glance  what do you think he meant by it  penelope repeated irenes account of the affair and her mother listened without seeming to derive much encouragement from it  he doesnt seem like one to flirt with her she said at last  then after a thoughtful pause irene is as good a girl as ever breathed and shes a perfect beauty  but i should hate the day when a daughter of mine was married for her beauty  youre safe as far as im concerned mother  mrs lapham smiled ruefully  she isnt really equal to him pen  i misdoubted that from the first and its been borne in upon me more and more ever since  she hasnt mind enough i didnt know that a man fell in love with a girls intellect said penelope quietly  oh no  he hasnt fallen in love with irene at all  if he had it wouldnt matter about the intellect  penelope let the selfcontradiction pass  perhaps he has after all  no said mrs lapham  she pleases him when he sees her  but he doesnt try to see her  he has no chance  you wont let father bring him here  he would find excuses to come without being brought if he wished to come said the mother  but she isnt in his mind enough to make him he goes away and doesnt think anything more about her  shes a child shes a good child and i shall always say it but shes nothing but a child  no shes got to forget him  perhaps that wont be so easy  no i presume not  and now your father has got the notion in his head and he will move heaven and earth to bring it to pass  i can see that hes always thinking about it  the colonel has a will of his own observed the girl rocking to and fro where she sat looking at her mother  i wish we had never met them cried mrs lapham  i wish we had never thought of building i wish he had kept away from your fathers business  well its too late now mother said the girl  perhaps it isnt so bad as you think  well we must stand it anyway said mrs lapham with the grim antique yankee submission  oh yes weve got to stand it said penelope with the quaint modern american fatalism    x   it was late june almost july when corey took up his life in boston again where the summer slips away so easily  if you go out of town early it seems a very long summer when you come back in october but if you stay it passes swiftly and seen foreshortened in its flight seems scarcely a months length  it has its days of heat when it is very hot but for the most part it is cool with baths of the east wind that seem to saturate the soul with delicious freshness  then there are stretches of grey westerly weather when the air is full of the sentiment of early autumn and the frying of the grasshopper in the blossomed weed of the vacant lots on the back bay is intershot with the carol of crickets and the yellowing leaf on the long slope of mt vernon street smites the sauntering observer with tender melancholy the caterpillar gorged with the spoil of the lindens on chestnut and weaving his own shroud about him in his lodgment on the brickwork records the passing of summer by midjuly and if after that comes august its breath is thick and short and september is upon the sojourner before he has fairly had time to philosophise the character of the town out of season  but it must have appeared that its most characteristic feature was the absence of everybody he knew  this was one of the things that commended boston to bromfield corey during the summer and if his son had any qualms about the life he had entered upon with such vigour it must have been a relief to him that there was scarcely a soul left to wonder or pity  by the time people got back to town the fact of his connection with the mineral paint man would be an old story heard afar off with different degrees of surprise and considered with different degrees of indifference  a man has not reached the age of twentysix in any community where he was born and reared without having had his capacity pretty well ascertained and in boston the analysis is conducted with an unsparing thoroughness which may fitly impress the unbostonian mind darkened by the popular superstition that the bostonians blindly admire one another  a mans qualities are sifted as closely in boston as they doubtless were in florence or athens and if final mercy was shown in those cities because a man was with all his limitations an athenian or florentine some abatement might as justly be made in boston for like reason  coreys powers had been gauged in college and he had not given his world reason to think very differently of him since he came out of college  he was rated as an energetic fellow a little indefinite in aim with the smallest amount of inspiration that can save a man from being commonplace  if he was not commonplace it was through nothing remarkable in his mind which was simply clear and practical but through some combination of qualities of the heart that made men trust him and women call him sweeta word of theirs which conveys otherwise indefinable excellences  some of the more nervous and excitable said that tom corey was as sweet as he could live but this perhaps meant no more than the word alone  no man ever had a son less like him than bromfield corey  if tom corey had ever said a witty thing no one could remember it and yet the father had never said a witty thing to a more sympathetic listener than his own son  the clear mind which produced nothing but practical results reflected everything with charming lucidity and it must have been this which endeared tom corey to every one who spoke ten words with him  in a city where people have good reason for liking to shine a man who did not care to shine must be little short of universally acceptable without any other effort for popularity and those who admired and enjoyed bromfield corey loved his son  yet when it came to accounting for tom corey as it often did in a community where every ones generation is known to the remotest degrees of cousinship they could not trace his sweetness to his mother for neither anna bellingham nor any of her family though they were so many blocks of wenham ice for purity and rectangularity had ever had any such savour and in fact it was to his father whose habit of talk wronged it in himself that they had to turn for this quality of the sons they traced to the mother the traits of practicality and commonsense in which he bordered upon the commonplace and which when they had dwelt upon them made him seem hardly worth the close inquiry they had given him  while the summer wore away he came and went methodically about his business as if it had been the business of his life sharing his fathers bachelor liberty and solitude and expecting with equal patience the return of his mother and sisters in the autumn  once or twice he found time to run down to mt  desert and see them and then he heard how the philadelphia and new york people were getting in everywhere and was given reason to regret the house at nahant which he had urged to be sold  he came back and applied himself to his desk with a devotion that was exemplary rather than necessary for lapham made no difficulty about the brief absences which he asked and set no term to the apprenticeship that corey was serving in the office before setting off upon that mission to south america in the early winter for which no date had yet been fixed  the summer was a dull season for the paint as well as for everything else  till things should brisk up as lapham said in the fall he was letting the new house take a great deal of his time  aesthetic ideas had never been intelligibly presented to him before and he found a delight in apprehending them that was very grateful to his imaginative architect  at the beginning the architect had foreboded a series of mortifying defeats and disastrous victories in his encounters with his client but he had never had a client who could be more reasonably led on from one outlay to another  it appeared that lapham required but to understand or feel the beautiful effect intended and he was ready to pay for it  his bullheaded pride was concerned in a thing which the architect made him see and then he believed that he had seen it himself perhaps conceived it  in some measure the architect seemed to share his delusion and freely said that lapham was very suggestive together they blocked out windows here and bricked them up there they changed doors and passages pulled down cornices and replaced them with others of different design experimented with costly devices of decoration and went to extravagant lengths in novelties of finish mrs lapham beginning with a womans adventurousness in the unknown region took fright at the reckless outlay at last and refused to let her husband pass a certain limit  he tried to make her believe that a farseeing economy dictated the expense and that if he put the money into the house he could get it out any time by selling it  she would not be persuaded  i dont want you should sell it  and youve put more money into it now than youll ever get out again unless you can find as big a goose to buy it and that isnt likely  no sir you just stop at a hundred thousand and dont you let him get you a cent beyond  why youre perfectly bewitched with that fellow youve lost your head silas lapham and if you dont look out youll lose your money too  the colonel laughed he liked her to talk that way and promised he would hold up a while  but theres no call to feel anxious pert  its only a question what to do with the money  i can reinvest it but i never had so much of it to spend before  spend it then said his wife dont throw it away  and how came you to have so much more money than you know what to do with silas lapham she added  oh ive made a very good thing in stocks lately  in stocks when did you take up gambling for a living  gambling stuff what gambling who said it was gambling  you have many a time  oh yes buying and selling on a margin  but this was a bona fide transaction  i bought at fortythree for an investment and i sold at a hundred and seven and the money passed both times  well you better let stocks alone said his wife with the conservatism of her sex  next time youll buy at a hundred and seven and sell at forty three  then wherell you be  left admitted the colonel  you better stick to paint a while yet the colonel enjoyed this too and laughed again with the ease of a man who knows what he is about  a few days after that he came down to nantasket with the radiant air which he wore when he had done a good thing in business and wanted his wifes sympathy  he did not say anything of what had happened till he was alone with her in their own room but he was very gay the whole evening and made several jokes which penelope said nothing but very great prosperity could excuse they all understood these moods of his  well what is it silas asked his wife when the time came  any more bigbugs wanting to go into the mineral paint business with you  something better than that  i could think of a good many better things said his wife with a sigh of latent bitterness  whats this one  ive had a visitor  who  cant you guess  i dont want to try  who was it  rogers  mrs lapham sat down with her hands in her lap and stared at the smile on her husbands face where he sat facing her  i guess you wouldnt want to joke on that subject si she said a little hoarsely and you wouldnt grin about it unless you had some good news  i dont know what the miracle is but if you could tell quick  she stopped like one who can say no more  i will persis said her husband and with that awed tone in which he rarely spoke of anything but the virtues of his paint  he came to borrow money of me and i lent him it  thats the short of it  the long  go on said his wife with gentle patience  well pert i was never so much astonished in my life as i was to see that man come into my office  you might have knocked me down withi dont know what  i dont wonder  go on  and he was as much embarrassed as i was  there we stood gaping at each other and i hadnt hardly sense enough to ask him to take a chair  i dont know just how we got at it  and i dont remember just how it was that he said he came to come to me  but he had got hold of a patent right that he wanted to go into on a large scale and there he was wanting me to supply him the funds  go on said mrs lapham with her voice further in her throat  i never felt the way you did about rogers but i know how you always did feel and i guess i surprised him with my answer  he had brought along a lot of stock as security  you didnt take it silas his wife flashed out  yes i did though said lapham  you wait  we settled our business and then we went into the old thing from the very start and we talked it all over  and when we got through we shook hands well i dont know when its done me so much good to shake hands with anybody  and you told himyou owned up to him that you were in the wrong silas  no i didnt returned the colonel promptly for i wasnt and before we got through i guess he saw it the same as i did  oh no matter so you had the chance to show how you felt  but i never felt that way persisted the colonel  ive lent him the money and ive kept his stocks  and he got what he wanted out of me  give him back his stocks  no i shant rogers came to borrow  he didnt come to beg  you neednt be troubled about his stocks  theyre going to come up in time but just now theyre so low down that no bank would take them as security and ive got to hold them till they do rise  i hope youre satisfied now persis said her husband and he looked at her with the willingness to receive the reward of a good action which we all feel when we have performed one  i lent him the money you kept me from spending on the house  truly si well im satisfied said mrs lapham with a deep tremulous breath  the lord has been good to you silas she continued solemnly  you may laugh if you choose and i dont know as i believe in his interfering a great deal but i believe hes interfered this time and i tell you silas it aint always he gives people a chance to make it up to others in this life  ive been afraid youd die silas before you got the chance but hes let you live to make it up to rogers  im glad to be let live said lapham stubbornly but i hadnt anything to make up to milton k rogers  and if god has let me live for that  oh say what you please si say what you please now youve done it i shant stop you  youve taken the one spotthe one speckoff you that was ever there and im satisfied  there want ever any speck there lapham held out lapsing more and more into his vernacular and what i done i done for you persis  and i thank you for your own souls sake silas  i guess my souls all right said lapham  and i want you should promise me one thing more  thought you said you were satisfied  i am  but i want you should promise me this that you wont let anything tempt youanythingto ever trouble rogers for that money you lent him  no matter what happensno matter if you lose it all do you promise  why i dont ever expect to press him for it  thats what i said to myself when i lent it  and of course im glad to have that old trouble healed up  i dont think i ever did rogers any wrong and i never did think so but if i did do itif i didim willing to call it square if i never see a cent of my money back again  well thats all said his wife  they did not celebrate his reconciliation with his old enemyfor such they had always felt him to be since he ceased to be an allyby any show of joy or affection  it was not in their tradition as stoical for the woman as for the man that they should kiss or embrace each other at such a moment  she was content to have told him that he had done his duty and he was content with her saying that  but before she slept she found words to add that she always feared the selfish part he had acted toward rogers had weakened him and left him less able to overcome any temptation that might beset him and that was one reason why she could never be easy about it  now she should never fear for him again  this time he did not explicitly deny her forgiving impeachment  well its all past and gone now anyway and i dont want you should think anything more about it  he was man enough to take advantage of the high favour in which he stood when he went up to town and to abuse it by bringing corey down to supper  his wife could not help condoning the sin of disobedience in him at such a time  penelope said that between the admiration she felt for the colonels boldness and her mothers forbearance she was hardly in a state to entertain company that evening but she did what she could  irene liked being talked to better than talking and when her sister was by she was always tacitly or explicitly referring to her for confirmation of what she said  she was content to sit and look pretty as she looked at the young man and listened to her sisters drolling she laughed and kept glancing at corey to make sure that he was understanding her  when they went out on the veranda to see the moon on the water penelope led the way and irene followed  they did not look at the moonlight long  the young man perched on the rail of the veranda and irene took one of the redpainted rockingchairs where she could conveniently look at him and at her sister who sat leaning forward lazily and running on as the phrase is  that low crooning note of hers was delicious her face glimpsed now and then in the moonlight as she turned it or lifted it a little had a fascination which kept his eye  her talk was very unliterary and its effect seemed hardly conscious  she was far from epigram in her funning  she told of this trifle and that she sketched the characters and looks of people who had interested her and nothing seemed to have escaped her notice she mimicked a little but not much she suggested and then the affair represented itself as if without her agency  she did not laugh when corey stopped she made a soft cluck in her throat as if she liked his being amused and went on again  the colonel left alone with his wife for the first time since he had come from town made haste to take the word  well pert ive arranged the whole thing with rogers and i hope youll be satisfied to know that he owes me twenty thousand dollars and that ive got security from him to the amount of a fourth of that if i was to force his stocks to a sale  how came he to come down with you asked mrs lapham  who rogers  mr corey  corey oh said lapham affecting not to have thought she could mean corey  he proposed it  likely jeered his wife but with perfect amiability  its so protested the colonel  we got talking about a matter just before i left and he walked down to the boat with me and then he said if i didnt mind he guessed hed come along down and go back on the return boat  of course i couldnt let him do that  its well for you you couldnt  and i couldnt do less than bring him here to tea  oh certainly not  but he aint going to stay the nightunless faltered lapham you want him to  oh of course i want him to i guess hell stay probably  well you know how crowded that last boat always is and he cant get any other now  mrs lapham laughed at the simple wile  i hope youll be just as well satisfied si if it turns out he doesnt want irene after all  pshaw persis what are you always bringing that up for pleaded the colonel  then he fell silent and presently his rude strong face was clouded with an unconscious frown  there cried his wife startling him from his abstraction  i see how youd feel and i hope that youll remember who youve got to blame  ill risk it said lapham with the confidence of a man used to success  from the veranda the sound of penelopes lazy tone came through the closed windows with joyous laughter from irene and peals from corey  listen to that said her father within swelling up with inexpressible satisfaction  that girl can talk for twenty right straight along  shes better than a circus any day  i wonder what shes up to now  oh shes probably getting off some of those yarns of hers or telling about some people  she cant step out of the house without coming back with more things to talk about than most folks would bring back from japan  there aint a ridiculous person shes ever seen but what shes got something from them to make you laugh at and i dont believe weve ever had anybody in the house since the girl could talk that she haint got some saying from or some trick thatll paint em out sot you can see em and hear em sometimes i want to stop her but when she gets into one of her gales there aint any standing up against her  i guess its lucky for irene that shes got pen there to help entertain her company  i cant ever feel down where pen is  thats so said the colonel  and i guess shes got about as much culture as any of them  dont you  she reads a great deal admitted her mother  she seems to be at it the whole while  i dont want she should injure her health and sometimes i feel like snatchin the books away from her  i dont know as its good for a girl to read so much anyway especially novels  i dont want she should get notions  oh i guess penll know how to take care of herself said lapham  shes got sense enough  but she aint so practical as irene  shes more up in the cloudsmore of what you may call a dreamer  irenes wideawake every minute and i declare any one to see these two together when theres anything to be done or any lead to be taken would say irene was the oldest nine times out of ten  its only when they get to talking that you can see pens got twice as much brains  well said lapham tacitly granting this point and leaning back in his chair in supreme content  did you ever see much nicer girls anywhere  his wife laughed at his pride  i presume theyre as much swans as anybodys geese  no but honestly now  oh theyll do but dont you be silly if you can help it si  the young people came in and corey said it was time for his boat mrs lapham pressed him to stay but he persisted and he would not let the colonel send him to the boat he said he would rather walk outside he pushed along toward the boat which presently he could see lying at her landing in the bay across the sandy tract to the left of the hotels  from time to time he almost stopped in his rapid walk as a man does whose mind is in a pleasant tumult and then he went forward at a swifter pace  shes charming he said and he thought he had spoken aloud  he found himself floundering about in the deep sand wide of the path he got back to it and reached the boat just before she started  the clerk came to take his fare and corey looked radiantly up at him in his lanternlight with a smile that he must have been wearing a long time his cheek was stiff with it  once some people who stood near him edged suddenly and fearfully away and then he suspected himself of having laughed outright    xi   corey put off his set smile with the help of a frown of which he first became aware after reaching home when his father asked  anything gone wrong with your department of the fine arts today tom  oh nono sir said the son instantly relieving his brows from the strain upon them and beaming again  but i was thinking whether you were not perhaps right in your impression that it might be well for you to make colonel laphams acquaintance before a great while  has he been suggesting it in any way asked bromfield corey laying aside his book and taking his lean knee between his clasped hands  oh not at all the young man hastened to reply  i was merely thinking whether it might not begin to seem intentional your not doing it  well tom you know i have been leaving it altogether to you  oh i understand of course and i didnt mean to urge anything of the kind  you are so very much more of a bostonian than i am you know that ive been waiting your motion in entire confidence that you would know just what to do and when to do it  if i had been left quite to my own lawless impulses i think i should have called upon your padrone at once  it seems to me that my father would have found some way of showing that he expected as much as that from people placed in the relation to him that we hold to colonel lapham  do you think so asked the young man  yes but you know i dont pretend to be an authority in such matters as far as they go i am always in the hands of your mother and you children  im very sorry sir  i had no idea i was overruling your judgment i only wanted to spare you a formality that didnt seem quite a necessity yet  im very sorry he said again and this time with more comprehensive regret  i shouldnt like to have seemed remiss with a man who has been so considerate of me  they are all very goodnatured  i dare say said bromfield corey with the satisfaction which no elder can help feeling in disabling the judgment of a younger man that it wont be too late if i go down to your office with you tomorrow  no no  i didnt imagine your doing it at once sir  ah but nothing can prevent me from doing a thing when once i take the bit in my teeth said the father with the pleasure which men of weak will sometimes take in recognising their weakness  how does their new house get on  i believe they expect to be in it before new year  will they be a great addition to society asked bromfield corey with unimpeachable seriousness  i dont quite know what you mean returned the son a little uneasily  ah i see that you do tom  no one can help feeling that they are all people of good sense andright ideas  oh that wont do  if society took in all the people of right ideas and good sense it would expand beyond the calling capacity of its most active members  even your mothers social conscientiousness could not compass it  society is a very different sort of thing from good sense and right ideas  it is based upon them of course but the airy graceful winning superstructure which we all know demands different qualities  have your friends got these qualitieswhich may be felt but not defined  the son laughed  to tell you the truth sir i dont think they have the most elemental ideas of society as we understand it  i dont believe mrs lapham ever gave a dinner  and with all that money sighed the father  i dont believe they have the habit of wine at table  i suspect that when they dont drink tea and coffee with their dinner they drink icewater  horrible said bromfield corey  it appears to me that this defines them  oh yes  there are people who give dinners and who are not cognoscible  but people who have never yet given a dinner how is society to assimilate them  it digests a great many people suggested the young man  yes but they have always brought some sort of sauce piquante with them  now as i understand you these friends of yours have no such sauce  oh i dont know about that cried the son  oh rude native flavours i dare say  but that isnt what i mean well then they must spend  there is no other way for them to win their way to general regard  we must have the colonel elected to the ten oclock club and he must put himself down in the list of those willing to entertain  any one can manage a large supper  yes i see a gleam of hope for him in that direction  in the morning bromfield corey asked his son whether he should find lapham at his place as early as eleven  i think you might find him even earlier  ive never been there before him  i doubt if the porter is there much sooner  well suppose i go with you then  why if you like sir said the son with some deprecation  oh the question is will he like  i think he will sir and the father could see that his son was very much pleased  lapham was rending an impatient course through the mornings news when they appeared at the door of his inner room  he looked up from the newspaper spread on the desk before him and then he stood up making an indifferent feint of not knowing that he knew bromfield corey by sight  good morning colonel lapham said the son and lapham waited for him to say further i wish to introduce my father then he answered good morning and added rather sternly for the elder corey how do you do sir will you take a chair and he pushed him one  they shook hands and sat down and lapham said to his subordinate have a seat but young corey remained standing watching them in their observance of each other with an amusement which was a little uneasy  lapham made his visitor speak first by waiting for him to do so  im glad to make your acquaintance colonel lapham and i ought to have come sooner to do so  my father in your place would have expected it of a man in my place at once i believe  but i cant feel myself altogether a stranger as it is  i hope mrs lapham is well and your daughter  thank you said lapham theyre quite well  they were very kind to my wife  oh that was nothing cried lapham  theres nothing mrs lapham likes better than a chance of that sort  mrs corey and the young ladies well  very well when i heard from them  theyre out of town  yes so i understood said lapham with a nod toward the son  i believe mr corey here told mrs lapham he leaned back in his chair stiffly resolute to show that he was not incommoded by the exchange of these civilities  yes said bromfield corey  tom has had the pleasure which i hope for of seeing you all  i hope youre able to make him useful to you here corey looked round laphams room vaguely and then out at the clerks in their railed enclosure where his eye finally rested on an extremely pretty girl who was operating a typewriter  well sir replied lapham softening for the first time with this approach to business i guess it will be our own fault if we dont by the way corey he added to the younger man as he gathered up some letters from his desk heres something in your line  spanish or french i guess  ill run them over said corey taking them to his desk  his father made an offer to rise  dont go said lapham gesturing him down again  i just wanted to get him away a minute  i dont care to say it to his facei dont like the principlebut since you ask me about it id just as lief say that ive never had any young man take hold here equal to your son i dont know as you care  you make me very happy said bromfield corey  very happy indeed ive always had the idea that there was something in my son if he could only find the way to work it out  and he seems to have gone into your business for the love of it  he went to work in the right way sir he told me about it  he looked into it  and that paint is a thing that will bear looking into  oh yes  you might think he had invented it if you heard him celebrating it  is that so demanded lapham pleased through and through  well there aint any other way  youve got to believe in a thing before you can put any heart in it  why i had a partner in this thing once along back just after the war and he used to be always wanting to tinker with something else  why says i youve got the best thing in gods universe now  why aint you satisfied i had to get rid of him at last  i stuck to my paint and that fellows drifted round pretty much all over the whole country whittling his capital down all the while till here the other day i had to lend him some money to start him new  no sir youve got to believe in a thing  and i believe in your son  and i dont mind telling you that so far as hes gone hes a success  thats very kind of you  no kindness about it  as i was saying the other day to a friend of mine ive had many a fellow right out of the street that had to work hard all his life and didnt begin to take hold like this son of yours  lapham expanded with profound selfsatisfaction as he probably conceived it he had succeeded in praising in a perfectly casual way the supreme excellence of his paint and his own sagacity and benevolence and here he was sitting face to face with bromfield corey praising his son to him and receiving his grateful acknowledgments as if he were the father of some officeboy whom lapham had given a place half but of charity  yes sir when your son proposed to take hold here i didnt have much faith in his ideas thats the truth  but i had faith in him and i saw that he meant business from the start  i could see it was born in him  any one could  im afraid he didnt inherit it directly from me said bromfield corey but its in the blood on both sides well sir we cant help those things said lapham compassionately  some of us have got it and some of us havent the idea is to make the most of what we have got  oh yes that is the idea  by all means  and you cant ever tell whats in you till you try  why when i started this thing i didnt more than half understand my own strength i wouldnt have said looking back that i could have stood the wear and tear of what ive been through  but i developed as i went along its just like exercising your muscles in a gymnasium  you can lift twice or three times as much after youve been in training a month as you could before  and i can see that its going to be just so with your son  his going through college wont hurt himhell soon slough all that offand his bringing up wont dont be anxious about it  i noticed in the army that some of the fellows that had the most goahead were fellows that hadnt ever had much more to do than girls before the war broke out  your son will get along  thank you said bromfield corey and smiledwhether because his spirit was safe in the humility he sometimes boasted or because it was triply armed in pride against anything the colonels kindness could do  hell get along  hes a good business man and hes a fine fellow must you go asked lapham as bromfield corey now rose more resolutely  well glad to see you  it was natural you should want to come and see what he was about and im glad you did  i should have felt just so about it  here is some of our stuff he said pointing out the various packages in his office including the persis brand  ah thats very nice very nice indeed said his visitor  that colour through the jarvery richdelicious  is persis brand a name  lapham blushed  well persis is  i dont know as you saw an interview that fellow published in the events a while back  what is the events  well its that new paper witherbys started  no said bromfield corey i havent seen it  i read the daily he explained by which he meant the daily advertiser the only daily there is in the oldfashioned bostonian sense  he put a lot of stuff in my mouth that i never said resumed lapham but thats neither here nor there so long as you havent seen it heres the department your sons in and he showed him the foreign labels  then he took him out into the warehouse to see the large packages  at the head of the stairs where his guest stopped to nod to his son and say goodbye tom lapham insisted upon going down to the lower door with him well call again he said in hospitable dismissal  i shall always be glad to see you  there aint a great deal doing at this season bromfield corey thanked him and let his hand remain perforce in laphams lingering grasp  if you ever like to ride after a good horse the colonel began  oh no no no thank you the better the horse the more i should be scared  tom has told me of your driving  ha ha ha laughed the colonel  well every one to his taste well good morning sir and he suffered him to go  who is the old man blowing to this morning asked walker the bookkeeper making an errand to coreys desk  my father  oh that your father i thought he must be one of your italian correspondents that youd been showing round or spanish  in fact as bromfield corey found his way at his leisurely pace up through the streets on which the prosperity of his native city was founded hardly any figure could have looked more alien to its life he glanced up and down the facades and through the crooked vistas like a stranger and the swarthy fruiterer of whom he bought an apple apparently for the pleasure of holding it in his hand was not surprised that the purchase should be transacted in his own tongue  lapham walked back through the outer office to his own room without looking at corey and during the day he spoke to him only of business matters  that must have been his way of letting corey see that he was not overcome by the honour of his fathers visit  but he presented himself at nantasket with the event so perceptibly on his mind that his wife asked well silas has rogers been borrowing any more money of you i dont want you should let that thing go too far  youve done enough  you neednt be afraid  ive seen the last of rogers for one while he hesitated to give the fact an effect of no importance  coreys father called this morning  did he said mrs lapham willing to humour his feint of indifference  did he want to borrow some money too not as i understood lapham was smoking at great ease and his wife had some crocheting on the other side of the lamp from him  the girls were on the piazza looking at the moon on the water again theres no man in it tonight penelope said and irene laughed forlornly  what did he want then asked mrs lapham  oh i dont know  seemed to be just a friendly call  said he ought to have come before  mrs lapham was silent a while  then she said well i hope youre satisfied now  lapham rejected the sympathy too openly offered  i dont know about being satisfied  i want in any hurry to see him  his wife permitted him this pretence also  what sort of a person is he anyway  well not much like his son  theres no sort of business about him i dont know just how youd describe him  hes tall and hes got white hair and a moustache and his fingers are very long and limber i couldnt help noticing them as he sat there with his hands on the top of his cane  didnt seem to be dressed very much and acted just like anybody  didnt talk much  guess i did most of the talking  said he was glad i seemed to be getting along so well with his son  he asked after you and irene and he said he couldnt feel just like a stranger said you had been very kind to his wife  of course i turned it off yes said lapham thoughtfully with his hands resting on his knees and his cigar between the fingers of his left hand i guess he meant to do the right thing every way  dont know as i ever saw a much pleasanter man  dunno but what hes about the pleasantest man i ever did see he was not letting his wife see in his averted face the struggle that revealed itself therethe struggle of stalwart achievement not to feel flattered at the notice of sterile elegance not to be sneakingly glad of its amiability but to stand up and look at it with eyes on the same level  god who made us so much like himself but out of the dust alone knows when that struggle will end the time had been when lapham could not have imagined any worldly splendour which his dollars could not buy if he chose to spend them for it but his wifes half discoveries taking form again in his ignorance of the world filled him with helpless misgiving  a cloudy vision of something unpurchasable where he had supposed there was nothing had cowed him in spite of the burly resistance of his pride  i dont see why he shouldnt be pleasant said mrs lapham  hes never done anything else  lapham looked up consciously with an uneasy laugh  pshaw persis you never forget anything  oh ive got more than that to remember  i suppose you asked him to ride after the mare  well said lapham reddening guiltily he said he was afraid of a good horse  then of course you hadnt asked him mrs lapham crocheted in silence and her husband leaned back in his chair and smoked  at last he said im going to push that house forward  theyre loafing on it  theres no reason why we shouldnt be in it by thanksgiving  i dont believe in moving in the dead of winter  we can wait till spring  were very comfortable in the old place answered his wife  then she broke out on him what are you in such a hurry to get into that house for do you want to invite the coreys to a housewarming  lapham looked at her without speaking  dont you suppose i can see through you i declare silas lapham if i didnt know different i should say you were about the biggest fool dont you know anything  dont you know that it wouldnt do to ask those people to our house before theyve asked us to theirs theyd laugh in our faces  i dont believe theyd laugh in our faces  whats the difference between our asking them and their asking us demanded the colonel sulkily  oh well if you don t see  well i dont see  but i dont want to ask them to the house  i suppose if i want to i can invite him down to a fish dinner at tafts  mrs lapham fell back in her chair and let her work drop in her lap with that tckk in which her sex knows how to express utter contempt and despair  whats the matter  well if you do such a thing silas ill never speak to you again its no use its no use i did think after youd behaved so well about rogers i might trust you a little  but i see i cant i presume as long as you live youll have to be nosed about like a perfecti dont know what  what are you making such a fuss about demanded lapham terribly crestfallen but trying to pluck up a spirit  i havent done anything yet  i cant ask your advice about anything any more without having you fly out  confound it i shall do as i please after this  but as if he could not endure that contemptuous atmosphere he got up and his wife heard him in the diningroom pouring himself out a glass of icewater and then heard him mount the stairs to their room and slam its door after him  do you know what your fathers wanting to do now mrs lapham asked her eldest daughter who lounged into the parlour a moment with her wrap stringing from her arm while the younger went straight to bed he wants to invite mr coreys father to a fish dinner at tafts  penelope was yawning with her hand on her mouth she stopped and with a laugh of amused expectance sank into a chair her shoulders shrugged forward  why what in the world has put the colonel up to that  put him up to it theres that fellow who ought have come to see him long ago drops into his office this morning and talks five minutes with him and your father is flattered out of his five senses  hes crazy to get in with those people and i shall have a perfect battle to keep him within bounds  well persis maam you cant say but what you began it said penelope  oh yes i began it confessed mrs lapham  pen she broke out what do you suppose he means by it  who mr coreys father what does the colonel think  oh the colonel cried mrs lapham  she added tremulously perhaps he is right  he did seem to take a fancy to her last summer and now if hes called in that way    she left her daughter to distribute the pronouns aright and resumed of course i should have said once that there wasnt any question about it  i should have said so last year and i dont know what it is keeps me from saying so now  i suppose i know a little more about things than i did and your fathers being so bent on it sets me all in a twitter  he thinks his money can do everything  well i dont say but what it can a good many  and rene is as good a child as ever there was and i dont see but what shes prettyappearing enough to suit any one  shes prettybehaved too and she is the most capable girl  i presume young men dont care very much for such things nowadays but there aint a great many girls can go right into the kitchen and make such a custard as she did yesterday  and look at the way she does through the whole house she cant seem to go into a room without the things fly right into their places  and if she had to do it tomorrow she could make all her own dresses a great deal better than them we pay to do it  i dont say but what hes about as nice a fellow as ever stepped  but there im ashamed of going on so  well mother said the girl after a pause in which she looked as if a little weary of the subject why do you worry about it if its to be itll be and if it isnt  yes thats what i tell your father  but when it comes to myself i see how hard it is for him to rest quiet  im afraid we shall all do something well repent of afterwards  well maam said penelope i dont intend to do anything wrong but if i do i promise not to be sorry for it  ill go that far  and i think i wouldnt be sorry for it beforehand if i were in your place mother  let the colonel go on he likes to manoeuvre and he isnt going to hurt any one  the corey family can take care of themselves i guess  she laughed in her throat drawing down the corners of her mouth and enjoying the resolution with which her mother tried to fling off the burden of her anxieties  pen i believe youre right  you always do see things in such a light there i dont care if he brings him down every day  well maam said pen i dont believe rene would either  shes just so indifferent  the colonel slept badly that night and in the morning mrs lapham came to breakfast without him  your father aint well she reported  hes had one of his turns  i should have thought he had two or three of them said penelope by the stamping round i heard  isnt he coming to breakfast  not just yet said her mother  hes asleep and hell be all right if he gets his nap out  i dont want you girls should make any great noise oh well be quiet enough returned penelope  well im glad the colonel isnt sojering  at first i thought he might be sojering she broke into a laugh and struggling indolently with it looked at her sister  you dont think itll be necessary for anybody to come down from the office and take orders from him while hes laid up do you mother she inquired  pen cried irene  hell be well enough to go up on the ten oclock boat said the mother sharply  i think papa works too hard all through the summer  why dont you make him take a rest mamma asked irene  oh take a rest the man slaves harder every year  it used to be so that hed take a little time off now and then but i declare he hardly ever seems to breathe now away from his office  and this year he says he doesnt intend to go down to lapham except to see after the works for a few days  i dont know what to do with the man any more seems as if the more money he got the more he wanted to get  it scares me to think what would happen to him if he lost it  i know one thing concluded mrs lapham  he shall not go back to the office today  then he wont go up on the ten oclock boat pen reminded her  no he wont you can just drive over to the hotel as soon as youre through girls and telegraph that hes not well and wont be at the office till tomorrow im not going to have them send anybody down here to bother him  thats a blow said pen  i didnt know but they might send she looked demurely at her sisterdennis  mamma cried irene  well i declare theres no living with this family any more said penelope  there pen be done commanded her mother  but perhaps she did not intend to forbid her teasing  it gave a pleasant sort of reality to the affair that was in her mind and made what she wished appear not only possible but probable  lapham got up and lounged about fretting and rebelling as each boat departed without him through the day before night he became very cross in spite of the efforts of the family to soothe him and grumbled that he had been kept from going up to town  i might as well have gone as not he repeated till his wife lost her patience  well you shall go tomorrow silas if you have to be carried to the boat  i declare said penelope the colonel dont pet worth a cent  the six oclock boat brought corey  the girls were sitting on the piazza and irene saw him first  o pen she whispered with her heart in her face and penelope had no time for mockery before he was at the steps  i hope colonel lapham isnt ill he said and they could hear their mother engaged in a moral contest with their father indoors  go and put on your coat i say you shall it dont matter how he sees you at the office shirtsleeves or not  youre in a gentlemans house nowor you ought to beand you shant see company in your dressinggown  penelope hurried in to subdue her mothers anger  oh hes very much better thank you said irene speaking up loudly to drown the noise of the controversy  im glad of that said corey and when she led him indoors the vanquished colonel met his visitor in a doublebreasted frockcoat which he was still buttoning up  he could not persuade himself at once that corey had not come upon some urgent business matter and when he was clear that he had come out of civility surprise mingled with his gratification that he should be the object of solicitude to the young man  in laphams circle of acquaintance they complained when they were sick but they made no womanish inquiries after one anothers health and certainly paid no visits of sympathy till matters were serious  he would have enlarged upon the particulars of his indisposition if he had been allowed to do so and after tea which corey took with them he would have remained to entertain him if his wife had not sent him to bed  she followed him to see that he took some medicine she had prescribed for him but she went first to penelopes room where she found the girl with a book in her hand which she was not reading  you better go down said the mother  ive got to go to your father and irene is all alone with mr corey and i know shell be on pins and needles without youre there to help make it go off  shed better try to get along without me mother said penelope soberly  i cant always be with them  well replied mrs lapham then i must  therell be a perfect quaker meeting down there  oh i guess rene will find something to say if you leave her to herself  or if she dont he must  itll be all right for you to go down when you get ready but i shant go till toward the last  if hes coming here to see ireneand i dont believe hes come on fathers accounthe wants to see her and not me  if she cant interest him alone perhaps hed as well find it out now as any time  at any rate i guess youd better make the experiment  youll know whether its a success if he comes again  well said the mother may be youre right  ill go down directly it does seem as if he did mean something after all  mrs lapham did not hasten to return to her guest  in her own girlhood it was supposed that if a young man seemed to be coming to see a girl it was only commonsense to suppose that he wished to see her alone and her life in town had left mrs laphams simple traditions in this respect unchanged  she did with her daughter as her mother would have done with her  where penelope sat with her book she heard the continuous murmur of voices below and after a long interval she heard her mother descend she did not read the open book that lay in her lap though she kept her eyes fast on the print  once she rose and almost shut the door so that she could scarcely hear then she opened it wide again with a selfdisdainful air and resolutely went back to her book which again she did not read  but she remained in her room till it was nearly time for corey to return to his boat  when they were alone again irene made a feint of scolding her for leaving her to entertain mr corey  why didnt you have a pleasant call asked penelope  irene threw her arms round her  oh it was a splendid call i didnt suppose i could make it go off so well  we talked nearly the whole time about you  i dont think that was a very interesting subject  he kept asking about you  he asked everything  you dont know how much he thinks of you pen  o pen  what do you think made him come do you think he really did come to see how papa was irene buried her face in her sisters neck  penelope stood with her arms at her side submitting  well she said i dont think he did altogether  irene all glowing released her  dont youdont you really o pen dont you think he is nice dont you think hes handsome dont you think i behaved horridly when we first met him this evening not thanking him for coming i know he thinks ive no manners  but it seemed as if it would be thanking him for coming to see me  ought i to have asked him to come again when he said goodnight i didnt i couldnt do you believe hell think i dont want him to you dont believe he would keep coming if he didntwant to  he hasnt kept coming a great deal yet suggested penelope  no i know he hasnt but if heif he should  then i should think he wanted to  oh would youwould you oh how good you always are pen and you always say what you think  i wish there was some one coming to see you too  thats all that i dont like about it  perhapshe was telling about his friend there in texas  well said penelope his friend couldnt call often from texas  you neednt ask mr corey to trouble about me rene i think i can manage to worry along if youre satisfied  oh i am pen  when do you suppose hell come again irene pushed some of penelopes things aside on the dressingcase to rest her elbow and talk at ease  penelope came up and put them back  well not tonight she said and if thats what youre sitting up for  irene caught her round the neck again and ran out of the room  the colonel was packed off on the eight oclock boat the next morning but his recovery did not prevent corey from repeating his visit in a week  this time irene came radiantly up to penelopes room where she had again withdrawn herself  you must come down pen she said hes asked if youre not well and mamma says youve got to come  after that penelope helped irene through with her calls and talked them over with her far into the night after corey was gone  but when the impatient curiosity of her mother pressed her for some opinion of the affair she said you know as much as i do mother  dont he ever say anything to you about herpraise her up any  hes never mentioned irene to me  he hasnt to me either said mrs lapham with a sigh of trouble then what makes him keep coming  i cant tell you  one thing he says there isnt a house open in boston where hes acquainted  wait till some of his friends get back and then if he keeps coming itll be time to inquire  well said the mother but as the weeks passed she was less and less able to attribute coreys visits to his loneliness in town and turned to her husband for comfort  silas i dont know as we ought to let young corey keep coming so  i dont quite like it with all his family away  hes of age said the colonel  he can go where he pleases  it dont matter whether his familys here or not  yes but if they dont want he should come should you feel just right about letting him  howre you going to stop him i swear persis i dont know whats got over you what is it you didnt use to be so  but to hear you talk youd think those coreys were too good for this world and we want fit for em to walk on  im not going to have em say we took an advantage of their being away and tolled him on  i should like to hear em say it cried lapham  or anybody  well said his wife relinquishing this point of anxiety i cant make out whether he cares anything for her or not  and pen cant tell either or else she wont  oh i guess he cares for her fast enough said the colonel  i cant make out that hes said or done the first thing to show it  well i was better than a year getting my courage up  oh that was different said mrs lapham in contemptuous dismissal of the comparison and yet with a certain fondness  i guess if he cared for her a fellow in his position wouldnt be long getting up his courage to speak to irene  lapham brought his fist down on the table between them  look here persis once for all now dont you ever let me hear you say anything like that again im worth nigh on to a million and ive made it every cent myself and my girls are the equals of anybody i dont care who it is  he aint the fellow to take on any airs but if he ever tries it with me ill send him to the right about mighty quick  ill have a talk with him if  no no dont do that implored his wife  i didnt mean anything i dont know as i meant anything  hes just as unassuming as he can be and i think irenes a match for anybody  you just let things go on  itll be all right  you never can tell how it is with young people  perhaps shes offish  now you aintyou aint going to say anything  lapham suffered himself to be persuaded the more easily no doubt because after his explosion he must have perceived that his pride itself stood in the way of what his pride had threatened  he contented himself with his wifes promise that she would never again present that offensive view of the case and she did not remain without a certain support in his sturdy selfassertion    xii   mrs  corey returned with her daughters in the early days of october having passed three or four weeks at intervale after leaving bar harbour  they were somewhat browner than they were when they left town in june but they were not otherwise changed  lily the elder of the girls had brought back a number of studies of kelp and toadstools with accessory rocks and rotten logs which she would never finish up and never show any one knowing the slightness of their merit  nanny the younger had read a great many novels with a keen sense of their inaccuracy as representations of life and had seen a great deal of life with a sad regret for its difference from fiction  they were both nice girls accomplished welldressed of course and well enough looking but they had met no one at the seaside or the mountains whom their taste would allow to influence their fate and they had come home to the occupations they had left with no hopes and no fears to distract them  in the absence of these they were fitted to take the more vivid interest in their brothers affairs which they could see weighed upon their mothers mind after the first hours of greeting  oh it seems to have been going on and your father has never written a word about it she said shaking her head  what good would it have done asked nanny who was little and fair with rings of light hair that filled a bonnetfront very prettily she looked best in a bonnet  it would only have worried you  he could not have stopped tom you couldnt when you came home to do it  i dare say papa didnt know much about it suggested lily  she was a tall lean dark girl who looked as if she were not quite warm enough and whom you always associated with wraps of different aesthetic effect after you had once seen her  it is a serious matter always to the women of his family when a young man gives them cause to suspect that he is interested in some other woman  a soninlaw or brotherinlaw does not enter the family he need not be caressed or made anything of but the sons or brothers wife has a claim upon his mother and sisters which they cannot deny some convention of their sex obliges them to show her affection to like or to seem to like her to take her to their intimacy however odious she may be to them  with the coreys it was something more than an affair of sentiment  they were by no means poor and they were not dependent moneywise upon tom corey but the mother had come without knowing it to rely upon his sense his advice in everything and the sisters seeing him hitherto so indifferent to girls had insensibly grown to regard him as altogether their own till he should be released not by his marriage but by theirs an event which had not approached with the lapse of time  some kinds of girlsthey believed that they could readily have chosen a kindmight have taken him without taking him from them but this generosity could not be hoped for in such a girl as miss lapham  perhaps urged their mother it would not be so bad  she seemed an affectionate little thing with her mother without a great deal of character though she was so capable about some things  oh shell be an affectionate little thing with tom too you may be sure said nanny  and that characterless capability becomes the most in tense narrowmindedness  shell think we were against her from the beginning  she has no cause for that lily interposed and we shall not give her any  yes we shall retorted nanny  we cant help it and if we cant her own ignorance would be cause enough  i cant feel that shes altogether ignorant said mrs corey justly  of course she can read and write admitted nanny  i cant imagine what he finds to talk about with her said lily  oh thats very simple returned her sister  they talk about themselves with occasional references to each other i have heard people going on on the hotel piazzas  shes embroidering or knitting or tatting or something of that kind and he says she seems quite devoted to needlework and she says yes she has a perfect passion for it and everybody laughs at her for it but she cant help it she always was so from a child and supposes she always shall bewith remote and minute particulars  and she ends by saying that perhaps he does not like people to tat or knit or embroider or whatever  and he says oh yes he does what could make her think such a thing but for his part he likes boating rather better or if youre in the woods camping  then she lets him take up one corner of her work and perhaps touch her fingers and that encourages him to say that he supposes nothing could induce her to drop her work long enough to go down on the rocks or out among the huckleberry bushes and she puts her head on one side and says she doesnt know really  and then they go and he lies at her feet on the rocks or picks huckleberries and drops them in her lap and they go on talking about themselves and comparing notes to see how they differ from each other  and  that will do nanny said her mother  lily smiled autumnally  oh disgusting  disgusting not at all protested her sister  its very amusing when you see it and when you do it  its always a mystery what people see in each other observed mrs corey severely  yes nanny admitted but i dont know that there is much comfort for us in the application no there isnt said her mother  the most that we can do is to hope for the best till we know the worst  of course we shall make the best of the worst when it comes  yes and perhaps it would not be so very bad  i was saying to your father when i was here in july that those things can always be managed you must face them as if they were nothing out of the way and try not to give any cause for bitterness among ourselves  thats true  but i dont believe in too much resignation beforehand it amounts to concession said nanny  of course we should oppose it in all proper ways returned her mother  lily had ceased to discuss the matter  in virtue of her artistic temperament she was expected not to be very practical  it was her mother and her sister who managed submitting to the advice and consent of corey what they intended to do  your father wrote me that he had called on colonel lapham at his place of business said mrs corey seizing her first chance of approaching the subject with her son  yes said corey  a dinner was fathers idea but he came down to a call at my suggestion  oh said mrs corey in a tone of relief as if the statement threw a new light on the fact that corey had suggested the visit  he said so little about it in his letter that i didnt know just how it came about  i thought it was right they should meet explained the son and so did father  i was glad that i suggested it afterward it was extremely gratifying to colonel lapham  oh it was quite right in every way  i suppose you have seen something of the family during the summer  yes a good deal  ive been down at nantasket rather often  mrs corey let her eyes droop  then she asked are they well  yes except lapham himself now and then  i went down once or twice to see him  he hasnt given himself any vacation this summer he has such a passion for his business that i fancy he finds it hard being away from it at any time and hes made his new house an excuse for staying  oh yes his house is it to be something fine  yes its a beautiful house  seymour is doing it  then of course it will be very handsome  i suppose the young ladies are very much taken up with it and mrs lapham  mrs lapham yes  i dont think the young ladies care so much about it  it must be for them  arent they ambitious asked mrs corey delicately feeling her way  her son thought a while  then he answered with a smile  no i dont really think they are  they are unambitious i should say mrs corey permitted herself a long breath  but her son added its the parents who are ambitious for them and her respiration became shorter again  yes she said  theyre very simple nice girls pursued corey  i think youll like the elder when you come to know her  when you come to know her  the words implied an expectation that the two families were to be better acquainted  then she is more intellectual than her sister mrs corey ventured  intellectual repeated her son  no that isnt the word quite though she certainly has more mind  the younger seemed very sensible  oh sensible yes  and as practical as shes pretty  she can do all sorts of things and likes to be doing them  dont you think shes an extraordinary beauty  yesyes she is said mrs corey at some cost  shes good too said corey and perfectly innocent and transparent i think you will like her the better the more you know her  i thought her very nice from the beginning said the mother heroically and then nature asserted itself in her  but i should be afraid that she might perhaps be a little bit tiresome at last her range of ideas seemed so extremely limited  yes thats what i was afraid of  but as a matter of fact she isnt she interests you by her very limitations  you can see the working of her mind like that of a child  she isnt at all conscious even of her beauty  i dont believe young men can tell whether girls are conscious or not said mrs corey  but i am not saying the miss laphams are not her son sat musing with an inattentive smile on his face what is it  oh nothing  i was thinking of miss lapham and something she was saying  shes very droll you know  the elder sister yes you told me that  can you see the workings of her mind too  no shes everything thats unexpected corey fell into another reverie and smiled again but he did not offer to explain what amused him and his mother would not ask  i dont know what to make of his admiring the girl so frankly she said afterward to her husband  that couldnt come naturally till after he had spoken to her and i feel sure that he hasnt yet  you women havent risen yetits an evidence of the backwardness of your sexto a conception of the bismarck idea in diplomacy  if a man praises one woman you still think hes in love with another  do you mean that because tom didnt praise the elder sister so much he has spoken to her  mrs corey refused the consequence saying that it did not follow besides he did praise her  you ought to be glad that matters are in such good shape then  at any rate you can do absolutely nothing  oh i know it sighed mrs corey  i wish tom would be a little opener with me  hes as open as its in the nature of an americanborn son to be with his parents  i dare say if youd asked him plumply what he meant in regard to the young lady he would have told youif he knew  why dont you think he does know bromfield  im not at all sure he does  you women think that because a young man dangles after a girl or girls hes attached to them  it doesnt at all follow  he dangles because he must and doesnt know what to do with his time and because they seem to like it  i dare say that tom has dangled a good deal in this instance because there was nobody else in town  do you really think so  i throw out the suggestion  and it strikes me that a young lady couldnt do better than stay in or near boston during the summer  most of the young men are here kept by business through the week with evenings available only on the spot or a few miles off  what was the proportion of the sexes at the seashore and the mountains  oh twenty girls at least for even an excuse of a man  its shameful  you see i am right in one part of my theory  why shouldnt i be right in the rest  i wish you were  and yet i cant say that i do  those things are very serious with girls  i shouldnt like tom to have been going to see those people if he meant nothing by it  and you wouldnt like it if he did  you are difficult my dear her husband pulled an open newspaper toward him from the table  i feel that it wouldnt be at all like him to do so said mrs corey going on to entangle herself in her words as women often do when their ideas are perfectly clear  dont go to reading please bromfield i am really worried about this matter i must know how much it means  i cant let it go on so  i dont see how you can rest easy without knowing  i dont in the least know whats going to become of me when i die and yet i sleep well replied bromfield corey putting his newspaper aside  ah but this is a very different thing  so much more serious well what can you do we had this out when you were here in the summer and you agreed with me then that we could do nothing  the situation hasnt changed at all  yes it has it has continued the same said mrs corey again expressing the fact by a contradiction in terms  i think i must ask tom outright  you know you cant do that my dear  then why doesnt he tell us  ah thats what he cant do if hes making love to miss irenethats her name i believeon the american plan  he will tell us after he has told her  that was the way i did  dont ignore our own youth anna  it was a long while ago ill admit  it was very different said mrs corey a little shaken  i dont see how  i dare say mamma lapham knows whether tom is in love with her daughter or not and no doubt papa lapham knows it at second hand  but we shall not know it until the girl herself does  depend upon that  your mother knew and she told your father but my poor father knew nothing about it till we were engaged and i had been hanging aboutdangling as you call it  no no you called it that  was it ifor a year or more  the wife could not refuse to be a little consoled by the image of her young love which the words conjured up however little she liked its relation to her sons interest in irene lapham  she smiled pensively then you think it hasnt come to an understanding with them yet  an understanding oh probably  an explanation then  the only logical inference from what weve been saying is that it hasnt but i dont ask you to accept it on that account  may i read now my dear  yes you may read now said mrs corey with one of those sighs which perhaps express a feminine sense of the unsatisfactoriness of husbands in general rather than a personal discontent with her own  thank you my dear then i think ill smoke too said bromfield corey lighting a cigar  she left him in peace and she made no further attempt upon her sons confidence  but she was not inactive for that reason  she did not of course admit to herself and far less to others the motive with which she went to pay an early visit to the laphams who had now come up from nantasket to nankeen square  she said to her daughters that she had always been a little ashamed of using her acquaintance with them to get money for her charity and then seeming to drop it  besides it seemed to her that she ought somehow to recognise the business relation that tom had formed with the father they must not think that his family disapproved of what he had done  yes business is business said nanny with a laugh  do you wish us to go with you again  no i will go alone this time replied the mother with dignity  her coupe now found its way to nankeen square without difficulty and she sent up a card which mrs lapham received in the presence of her daughter penelope  i presume ive got to see her she gasped  well dont look so guilty mother joked the girl you havent been doing anything so very wrong  it seems as if i had  i dont know whats come over me  i wasnt afraid of the woman before but now i dont seem to feel as if i could look her in the face  hes been coming here of his own accord and i fought against his coming long enough goodness knows  i didnt want him to come  and as far forth as that goes were as respectable as they are and your fathers got twice their money any day  weve no need to go begging for their favour  i guess they were glad enough to get him in with your father  yes those are all good points mother said the girl and if you keep saying them over and count a hundred every time before you speak i guess youll worry through  mrs lapham had been fussing distractedly with her hair and ribbons in preparation for her encounter with mrs corey  she now drew in a long quivering breath stared at her daughter without seeing her and hurried downstairs  it was true that when she met mrs corey before she had not been awed by her but since then she had learned at least her own ignorance of the world and she had talked over the things she had misconceived and the things she had shrewdly guessed so much that she could not meet her on the former footing of equality  in spite of as brave a spirit and as good a conscience as woman need have mrs lapham cringed inwardly and tremulously wondered what her visitor had come for  she turned from pale to red and was hardly coherent in her greetings she did not know how they got to where mrs corey was saying exactly the right things about her sons interest and satisfaction in his new business and keeping her eyes fixed on mrs laphams reading her uneasiness there and making her feel in spite of her indignant innocence that she had taken a base advantage of her in her absence to get her son away from her and marry him to irene  then presently while this was painfully revolving itself in mrs laphams mind she was aware of mrs coreys asking if she was not to have the pleasure of seeing miss irene  no shes out just now said mrs lapham  i dont know just when shell be in  she went to get a book and here she turned red again knowing that irene had gone to get the book because it was one that corey had spoken of  oh im sorry said mrs corey  i had hoped to see her  and your other daughter whom i never met  penelope asked mrs lapham eased a little  she is at home  i will go and call her the laphams had not yet thought of spending their superfluity on servants who could be rung for they kept two girls and a man to look after the furnace as they had for the last ten years  if mrs lapham had rung in the parlour her second girl would have gone to the street door to see who was there  she went upstairs for penelope herself and the girl after some rebellious derision returned with her  mrs corey took account of her as penelope withdrew to the other side of the room after their introduction and sat down indolently submissive on the surface to the tests to be applied and following mrs coreys lead of the conversation in her odd drawl  you young ladies will be glad to be getting into your new house she said politely  i dont know said penelope  were so used to this one  mrs corey looked a little baffled but she said sympathetically of course you will be sorry to leave your old home  mrs lapham could not help putting in on behalf of her daughters i guess if it was left to the girls to say we shouldnt leave it at all  oh indeed said mrs corey are they so much attached  but i can quite understand it  my children would be heartbroken too if we were to leave the old place she turned to penelope  but you must think of the lovely new house and the beautiful position  yes i suppose we shall get used to them too said penelope in response to this didactic consolation  oh i could even imagine your getting very fond of them pursued mrs corey patronisingly  my son has told me of the lovely outlook youre to have over the water  he thinks you have such a beautiful house  i believe he had the pleasure of meeting you all there when he first came home  yes i think he was our first visitor  he is a great admirer of your house said mrs corey keeping her eyes very sharply however politely on penelopes face as if to surprise there the secret of any other great admiration of her sons that might helplessly show itself  yes said the girl hes been there several times with father and he wouldnt be allowed to overlook any of its good points  her mother took a little more courage from her daughters tranquillity  the girls make such fun of their fathers excitement about his building and the way he talks it into everybody  oh indeed said mrs corey with civil misunderstanding and inquiry  penelope flushed and her mother went on i tell him hes more of a child about it than any of them  young people are very philosophical nowadays remarked mrs corey  yes indeed said mrs lapham  i tell them theyve always had everything so that nothings a surprise to them  it was different with us in our young days  yes said mrs corey without assenting  i mean the colonel and myself explained mrs lapham  oh yesyes said mrs corey  im sure the former went on rather helplessly we had to work hard enough for everything we got  and so we appreciated it  so many things were not done for young people then said mrs corey not recognising the earlyhardships standpoint of mrs lapham  but i dont know that they are always the better for it now she added vaguely but with the satisfaction we all feel in uttering a just commonplace  its rather hard living up to blessings that youve always had said penelope  yes replied mrs corey distractedly and coming back to her slowly from the virtuous distance to which she had absented herself  she looked at the girl searchingly again as if to determine whether this were a touch of the drolling her son had spoken of  but she only added you will enjoy the sunsets on the back bay so much well not unless theyre new ones said penelope  i dont believe i could promise to enjoy any sunsets that i was used to a great deal  mrs corey looked at her with misgiving hardening into dislike  no she breathed vaguely  my son spoke of the fine effect of the lights about the hotel from your cottage at nantasket she said to mrs lapham  yes theyre splendid exclaimed that lady  i guess the girls went down every night with him to see them from the rocks  yes said mrs corey a little dryly and she permitted herself to add he spoke of those rocks  i suppose both you young ladies spend a great deal of your time on them when youre there  at nahant my children were constantly on them  irene likes the rocks said penelope  i dont care much about themespecially at night  oh indeed i suppose you find it quite as well looking at the lights comfortably from the veranda  no you cant see them from the house  oh said mrs corey  after a perceptible pause she turned to mrs lapham  i dont know what my son would have done for a breath of sea air this summer if you had not allowed him to come to nantasket  he wasnt willing to leave his business long enough to go anywhere else  yes hes a born business man responded mrs lapham enthusiastically  if its born in you its bound to come out thats what the colonel is always saying about mr corey  he says its born in him to be a business man and he cant help it she recurred to corey gladly because she felt that she had not said enough of him when his mother first spoke of his connection with the business  i dont believe she went on excitedly that colonel lapham has ever had anybody with him that he thought more of  you have all been very kind to my son said mrs corey in acknowledgment and stiffly bowing a little and we feel greatly indebted to you  very much so at these grateful expressions mrs lapham reddened once more and murmured that it had been very pleasant to them she was sure  she glanced at her daughter for support but penelope was looking at mrs corey who doubtless saw her from the corner of her eyes though she went on speaking to her mother  i was sorry to hear from him that mrcolonellapham had not been quite well this summer  i hope hes better now  oh yes indeed replied mrs lapham hes all right now  hes hardly ever been sick and he dont know how to take care of himself thats all  we dont any of us were all so well  health is a great blessing sighed mrs corey  yes so it is  how is your oldest daughter inquired mrs lapham is she as delicate as ever  she seems to be rather better since we returned and now mrs corey as if forced to the point said bunglingly that the young ladies had wished to come with her but had been detained  she based her statement upon nannys sarcastic demand and perhaps seeing it topple a little she rose hastily to get away from its fall  but we shall hope for somesome other occasion she said vaguely and she put on a parting smile and shook hands with mrs lapham and penelope and then after some lingering commonplaces got herself out of the house  penelope and her mother were still looking at each other and trying to grapple with the effect or purport of the visit when irene burst in upon them from the outside  o mamma wasnt that mrs coreys carriage just drove away  penelope answered with her laugh  yes youve just missed the most delightful call rene so easy and pleasant every way  not a bit stiff mrs corey was so friendly  she didnt make one feel at all as if shed bought me and thought shed given too much and mother held up her head as if she were all wool and a yard wide and she would just like to have anybody deny it  in a few touches of mimicry she dashed off a sketch of the scene her mothers trepidation and mrs coreys wellbred repose and polite scrutiny of them both  she ended by showing how she herself had sat huddled up in a dark corner mute with fear  if she came to make us say and do the wrong thing she must have gone away happy and its a pity you werent here to help irene  i dont know that i aimed to make a bad impression but i guess i succeededeven beyond my deserts she laughed then suddenly she flashed out in fierce earnest  if i missed doing anything that could make me as hateful to her as she made herself to me she checked herself and began to laugh  her laugh broke and the tears started into her eyes she ran out of the room and up the stairs  whatwhat does it mean asked irene in a daze  mrs lapham was still in the chilly torpor to which mrs coreys call had reduced her  penelopes vehemence did not rouse her  she only shook her head absently and said i dont know  why should pen care what impression she made i didnt suppose it would make any difference to her whether mrs corey liked her or not  i didnt either  but i could see that she was just as nervous as she could be every minute of the time  i guess she didnt like mrs corey any too well from the start and she couldnt seem to act like herself  tell me about it mamma said irene dropping into a chair   mrs corey described the interview to her husband on her return home well and what are your inferences he asked  they were extremely embarrassed and excitedthat is the mother  i dont wish to do her injustice but she certainly behaved consciously  you made her feel so i dare say anna  i can imagine how terrible you must have been in the character of an accusing spirit too ladylike to say anything  what did you hint  i hinted nothing said mrs corey descending to the weakness of defending herself  but i saw quite enough to convince me that the girl is in love with tom and the mother knows it  that was very unsatisfactory  i supposed you went to find out whether tom was in love with the girl  was she as pretty as ever  i didnt see her she was not at home i saw her sister  i dont know that i follow you quite anna  but no matter  what was the sister like  a thoroughly disagreeable young woman  what did she do  nothing shes far too sly for that  but that was the impression  then you didnt find her so amusing as tom does  i found her pert  theres no other word for it  she says things to puzzle you and put you out  ah that was worse than pert anna that was criminal  well let us thank heaven the younger one is so pretty  mrs corey did not reply directly  bromfield she said after a moment of troubled silence i have been thinking over your plan and i dont see why it isnt the right thing  what is my plan inquired bromfield corey  a dinner  her husband began to laugh  ah you overdid the accusingspirit business and this is reparation but mrs corey hurried on with combined dignity and anxiety  we cant ignore toms intimacy with themit amounts to that it will probably continue even if its merely a fancy and we must seem to know it whatever comes of it we cant disown it  they are very simple unfashionable people and unworldly but i cant say that they are offensive unlessunless she added in propitiation of her husbands smile unless the fatherhow did you find the father she implored  he will be very entertaining said corey if you start him on his paint  what was the disagreeable daughter like shall you have her  shes little and dark  we must have them all mrs corey sighed then you dont think a dinner would do  oh yes i do  as you say we cant disown toms relation to them whatever it is  we had much better recognise it and make the best of the inevitable  i think a lapham dinner would be delightful he looked at her with delicate irony in his voice and smile and she fetched another sigh so deep and sore now that he laughed outright perhaps he suggested it would be the best way of curing tom of his fancy if he has one  he has been seeing her with the dangerous advantages which a mother knows how to give her daughter in the family circle and with no means of comparing her with other girls  you must invite several other very pretty girls  do you really think so bromfield asked mrs corey taking courage a little  that might do but her spirits visibly sank again  i dont know any other girl half so pretty  well then better bred  she is very ladylike very modest and pleasing  well more cultivated  tom doesnt get on with such people  oh you wish him to marry her i see  no no  then youd better give the dinner to bring them together to promote the affair  you know i dont want to do that bromfield  but i feel that we must do something  if we dont it has a clandestine appearance  it isnt just to them  a dinner wont leave us in any worse position and may leave us in a better  yes said mrs corey after another thoughtful interval we must have themhave them all  it could be very simple  ah you cant give a dinner under a bushel if i take your meaning my dear  if we do this at all we mustnt do it as if we were ashamed of it  we must ask people to meet them  yes sighed mrs corey  there are not many people in town yet she added with relief that caused her husband another smile  there really seems a sort of fatality about it she concluded religiously  then you had better not struggle against it  go and reconcile lily and nanny to it as soon as possible  mrs corey blanched a little  but dont you think it will be the best thing bromfield  i do indeed my dear  the only thing that shakes my faith in the scheme is the fact that i first suggested it  but if you have adopted it it must be all right anna  i cant say that i expected it  no said his wife it wouldnt do    xiii   having distinctly given up the project of asking the laphams to dinner mrs corey was able to carry it out with the courage of sinners who have sacrificed to virtue by frankly acknowledging its superiority to their intended transgression  she did not question but the laphams would come and she only doubted as to the people whom she should invite to meet them  she opened the matter with some trepidation to her daughters but neither of them opposed her they rather looked at the scheme from her own point of view and agreed with her that nothing had really yet been done to wipe out the obligation to the laphams helplessly contracted the summer before and strengthened by that illadvised application to mrs lapham for charity  not only the principal of their debt of gratitude remained but the accruing interest  they said what harm could giving the dinner possibly do them they might ask any or all of their acquaintance without disadvantage to themselves but it would be perfectly easy to give the dinner just the character they chose and still flatter the ignorance of the laphams  the trouble would be with tom if he were really interested in the girl but he could not say anything if they made it a family dinner he could not feel anything  they had each turned in her own mind as it appeared from a comparison of ideas to one of the most comprehensive of those cousinships which form the admiration and terror of the adventurer in boston society  he finds himself hemmed in and left out at every turn by ramifications that forbid him all hope of safe personality in his comments on people he is never less secure than when he hears some given bostonian denouncing or ridiculing another  if he will be advised he will guard himself from concurring in these criticisms however just they appear for the probability is that their object is a cousin of not more than one remove from the censor  when the alien hears a group of boston ladies calling one another and speaking of all their gentlemen friends by the familiar abbreviations of their christian names he must feel keenly the exile to which he was born but he is then at least in comparatively little danger while these latent and tacit cousinships open pitfalls at every step around him in a society where middlesexes have married essexes and produced suffolks for two hundred and fifty years  these conditions however so perilous to the foreigner are a source of strength and security to those native to them  an uncertain acquaintance may be so effectually involved in the meshes of such a cousinship as never to be heard of outside of it and tremendous stories are told of people who have spent a whole winter in boston in a whirl of gaiety and who the original guests of the suffolks discover upon reflection that they have met no one but essexes and middlesexes  mrs coreys brother james came first into her mind and she thought with uncommon toleration of the easygoing uncritical goodnature of his wife  james bellingham had been the adviser of her son throughout and might be said to have actively promoted his connection with lapham she thought next of the widow of her cousin henry bellingham who had let her daughter marry that western steamboat man and was fond of her soninlaw she might be expected at least to endure the paintking and his family  the daughters insisted so strongly upon mrs bellinghams son charles that mrs corey put him downif he were in town he might be in central america he got on with all sorts of people  it seemed to her that she might stop at this four laphams five coreys and four bellinghams were enough  that makes thirteen said nanny  you can have mr and mrs sewell  yes that is a good idea assented mrs corey  he is our minister and it is very proper  i dont see why you dont have robert chase  it is a pity he shouldnt see herfor the colour  i dont quite like the idea of that said mrs corey but we can have him too if it wont make too many the painter had married into a poorer branch of the coreys and his wife was dead  is there any one else  there is miss kingsbury  we have had her so much  she will begin to think we are using her  she wont mind shes so goodnatured  well then the mother summed up there are four laphams five coreys four bellinghams one chase and one kingsburyfifteen oh and two sewells  seventeen  ten ladies and seven gentlemen  it doesnt balance very well and its too large  perhaps some of the ladies wont come suggested lily  oh the ladies always come said nanny  their mother reflected  well i will ask them  the ladies will refuse in time to let us pick up some gentlemen somewhere some more artists  why we must have mr seymour the architect hes a bachelor and hes building their house tom says  her voice fell a little when she mentioned her sons name and she told him of her plan when he came home in the evening with evident misgiving  what are you doing it for mother he asked looking at her with his honest eyes  she dropped her own in a little confusion  i wont do it at all my dear she said if you dont approve  but i thoughtyou know we have never made any proper acknowledgment of their kindness to us at baie st paul  then in the winter im ashamed to say i got money from her for a charity i was interested in and i hate the idea of merely using people in that way  and now your having been at their house this summerwe cant seem to disapprove of that and your business relations to him  yes i see said corey  do you think it amounts to a dinner  why i dont know returned his mother  we shall have hardly any one out of our family connection  well corey assented it might do  i suppose what you wish is to give them a pleasure  why certainly  dont you think theyd like to come  oh theyd like to come but whether it would be a pleasure after they were here is another thing  i should have said that if you wanted to have them they would enjoy better being simply asked to meet our own immediate family  thats what i thought of in the first place but your father seemed to think it implied a social distrust of them and we couldnt afford to have that appearance even to ourselves  perhaps he was right  and besides it might seem a little significant  corey seemed inattentive to this consideration  whom did you think of asking his mother repeated the names  yes that would do he said with a vague dissatisfaction  i wont have it at all if you dont wish tom  oh yes have it perhaps you ought  yes i dare say its right  what did you mean by a family dinner seeming significant  his mother hesitated  when it came to that she did not like to recognise in his presence the anxieties that had troubled her  but i dont know she said since she must  i shouldnt want to give that young girl or her mother the idea that we wished to make more of the acquaintance thanthan you did tom  he looked at her absentmindedly as if he did not take her meaning but he said oh yes of course and mrs corey in the uncertainty in which she seemed destined to remain concerning this affair went off and wrote her invitation to mrs lapham  later in the evening when they again found themselves alone her son said i dont think i understood you mother in regard to the laphams  i think i do now  i certainly dont wish you to make more of the acquaintance than i have done  it wouldnt be right it might be very unfortunate  dont give the dinner  its too late now my son said mrs corey  i sent my note to mrs lapham an hour ago her courage rose at the trouble which showed in coreys face  but dont be annoyed by it tom  it isnt a family dinner you know and everything can be managed without embarrassment if we take up the affair at this point you will seem to have been merely acting for us and they cant possibly understand anything more  well well let it go i dare say its all right at any rate it cant be helped now  i dont wish to help it tom said mrs corey with a cheerfullness which the thought of the laphams had never brought her before  i am sure it is quite fit and proper and we can make them have a very pleasant time  they are good inoffensive people and we owe it to ourselves not to be afraid to show that we have felt their kindness to us and his appreciation of you  well consented corey  the trouble that his mother had suddenly cast off was in his tone but she was not sorry  it was quite time that he should think seriously of his attitude toward these people if he had not thought of it before but according to his fathers theory had been merely dangling  it was a view of her sons character that could hardly have pleased her in different circumstances yet it was now unquestionably a consolation if not wholly a pleasure  if she considered the laphams at all it was with the resignation which we feel at the evils of others even when they have not brought them on themselves  mrs lapham for her part had spent the hours between mrs coreys visit and her husbands coming home from business in reaching the same conclusion with regard to corey and her spirits were at the lowest when they sat down to supper  irene was downcast with her penelope was purposely gay and the colonel was beginning after his first plate of the boiled hamwhich bristling with cloves rounded its bulk on a wide platter before himto take note of the surrounding mood when the doorbell jingled peremptorily and the girl left waiting on the table to go and answer it  she returned at once with a note for mrs lapham which she read and then after a helpless survey of her family read again  why what is it mamma asked irene while the colonel who had taken up his carvingknife for another attack on the ham held it drawn half across it  why i dont know what it does mean answered mrs lapham tremulously and she let the girl take the note from her  irene ran it over and then turned to the name at the end with a joyful cry and a flush that burned to the top of her forehead  then she began to read it once more  the colonel dropped his knife and frowned impatiently and mrs lapham said you read it out loud if you know what to make of it irene but irene with a nervous scream of protest handed it to her father who performed the office  dear mrs  lapham  will you and general lapham  i didnt know i was a general grumbled lapham  i guess i shall have to be looking up my back pay  who is it writes this anyway he asked turning the letter over for the signature  oh never mind  read it through cried his wife with a kindling glance of triumph at penelope and he resumed  and your daughters give us the pleasure of your company at dinner on thursday the 28th at halfpast six  yours sincerely  anna b corey  the brief invitation had been spread over two pages and the colonel had difficulties with the signature which he did not instantly surmount  when he had made out the name and pronounced it he looked across at his wife for an explanation  i dont know what it all means she said shaking her head and speaking with a pleased flutter  she was here this afternoon and i should have said she had come to see how bad she could make us feel  i declare i never felt so put down in my life by anybody  why what did she do what did she say lapham was ready in his dense pride to resent any affront to his blood but doubtful with the evidence of this invitation to the contrary if any affront had been offered  mrs lapham tried to tell him but there was really nothing tangible and when she came to put it into words she could not make out a case  her husband listened to her excited attempt and then he said with judicial superiority i guess nobodys been trying to make you feel bad persis  what would she go right home and invite you to dinner for if shed acted the way you say  in this view it did seem improbable and mrs lapham was shaken  she could only say penelope felt just the way i did about it  lapham looked at the girl who said oh i cant prove it i begin to think it never happened  i guess it didnt  humph said her father and he sat frowning thoughtfully a whileignoring her mocking irony or choosing to take her seriously you cant really put your finger on anything he said to his wife and it aint likely there is anything  anyway shes done the proper thing by you now  mrs lapham faltered between her lingering resentment and the appeals of her flattered vanity  she looked from penelopes impassive face to the eager eyes of irene  welljust as you say silas  i dont know as she was so very bad  i guess may be she was embarrassed some  thats what i told you mamma from the start interrupted irene didnt i tell you she didnt mean anything by it its just the way she acted at baie st paul when she got well enough to realise what youd done for her  penelope broke into a laugh  is that her way of showing her gratitude im sorry i didnt understand that before  irene made no effort to reply  she merely looked from her mother to her father with a grieved face for their protection and lapham said when weve done supper you answer her persis  say well come  with one exception said penelope  what do you mean demanded her father with a mouth full of ham oh nothing of importance  merely that im not going  lapham gave himself time to swallow his morsel and his rising wrath went down with it  i guess youll change your mind when the time comes he said  anyway persis you say well all come and then if penelope dont want to go you can excuse her after we get there thats the best way  none of them apparently saw any reason why the affair should not be left in this way or had a sense of the awful and binding nature of a dinner engagement  if she believed that penelope would not finally change her mind and go no doubt mrs lapham thought that mrs corey would easily excuse her absence  she did not find it so simple a matter to accept the invitation  mrs corey had said dear mrs lapham but mrs lapham had her doubts whether it would not be a servile imitation to say dear mrs corey in return and she was tormented as to the proper phrasing throughout and the precise temperature which she should impart to her politeness  she wrote an unpractised uncharacteristic round hand the same in which she used to set the childrens copies at school and she subscribed herself after some hesitation between her husbands given name and her own yours truly mrs s lapham  penelope had gone to her room without waiting to be asked to advise or criticise but irene had decided upon the paper and on the whole mrs laphams note made a very decent appearance on the page  when the furnaceman came the colonel sent him out to post it in the box at the corner of the square  he had determined not to say anything more about the matter before the girls not choosing to let them see that he was elated he tried to give the effect of its being an everyday sort of thing abruptly closing the discussion with his order to mrs lapham to accept but he had remained swelling behind his newspaper during her prolonged struggle with her note and he could no longer hide his elation when irene followed her sister upstairs  well pers he demanded what do you say now  mrs lapham had been sobered into something of her former misgiving by her difficulties with her note  well i dont know what to say  i declare im all mixed up about it and i dont know as weve begun as we can carry out in promising to go  i presume she sighed that we can all send some excuse at the last moment if we dont want to go  i guess we can carry out and i guess we shant want to send any excuse bragged the colonel  if were ever going to be anybody at all weve got to go and see how its done  i presume weve got to give some sort of party when we get into the new house and this gives the chance to ask em back again  you cant complain now but what theyve made the advances persis  no said mrs lapham lifelessly i wonder why they wanted to do it oh i suppose its all right she added in deprecation of the anger with her humility which she saw rising in her husbands face but if its all going to be as much trouble as that letter id rather be whipped  i dont know what im going to wear or the girls either  i do wonderive heard that people go to dinner in lownecks do you suppose its the custom  how should i know demanded the colonel  i guess youve got clothes enough  any rate you neednt fret about it  you just go round to whites or jordan  marshs and ask for a dinner dress  i guess thatll settle it theyll know  get some of them imported dresses  i see em in the window every time i pass lots of em  oh it aint the dress said mrs lapham  i dont suppose but what we could get along with that and i want to do the best we can for the children but i dont know what were going to talk about to those people when we get there  we havent got anything in common with them oh i dont say theyre any better she again made haste to say in arrest of her husbands resentment  i dont believe they are and i dont see why they should be  and there aint anybody has got a better right to hold up their head than you have silas  youve got plenty of money and youve made every cent of it  i guess i shouldnt amounted to much without you persis interposed lapham moved to this justice by her praise  oh dont talk about me protested the wife  now that youve made it all right about rogers there aint a thing in this world against you  but still for all that i can seeand i can feel it when i cant see itthat were different from those people  theyre wellmeaning enough and theyd excuse it i presume but were too old to learn to be like them  the children aint said lapham shrewdly  no the children aint admitted his wife and thats the only thing that reconciles me to it  you see how pleased irene looked when i read it  yes she was pleased  and i guess penelopell think better of it before the time comes  oh yes we do it for them  but whether were doing the best thing for em goodness knows  im not saying anything against him  irenell be a lucky girl to get him if she wants him  but there id ten times rather she was going to marry such a fellow as you were si that had to make every inch of his own way and she had to help him  its in her  lapham laughed aloud for pleasure in his wifes fondness but neither of them wished that he should respond directly to it  i guess if it want for me he wouldnt have a much easier time  but dont you fret its all coming out right  that dinner aint a thing for you to be uneasy about  itll pass off perfectly easy and natural  lapham did not keep his courageous mind quite to the end of the week that followed  it was his theory not to let corey see that he was set up about the invitation and when the young man said politely that his mother was glad they were able to come lapham was very short with him he said yes he believed that mrs lapham and the girls were going afterward he was afraid corey might not understand that he was coming too but he did not know how to approach the subject again and corey did not so he let it pass  it worried him to see all the preparation that his wife and irene were making and he tried to laugh at them for it and it worried him to find that penelope was making no preparation at all for herself but only helping the others  he asked her what should she do if she changed her mind at the last moment and concluded to go and she said she guessed she should not change her mind but if she did she would go to whites with him and get him to choose her an imported dress he seemed to like them so much  he was too proud to mention the subject again to her  finally all that dressmaking in the house began to scare him with vague apprehensions in regard to his own dress  as soon as he had determined to go an ideal of the figure in which he should go presented itself to his mind  he should not wear any dresscoat because for one thing he considered that a man looked like a fool in a dresscoat and for another thing he had nonehad none on principle  he would go in a frockcoat and black pantaloons and perhaps a white waistcoat but a black cravat anyway  but as soon as he developed this ideal to his family which he did in pompous disdain of their anxieties about their own dress they said he should not go so  irene reminded him that he was the only person without a dresscoat at a corps reunion dinner which he had taken her to some years before and she remembered feeling awfully about it at the time mrs lapham who would perhaps have agreed of herself shook her head with misgiving  i dont see but what youll have to get you one si she said  i dont believe they ever go without em to a private house  he held out openly but on his way home the next day in a sudden panic he cast anchor before his tailors door and got measured for a dresscoat after that he began to be afflicted about his waistcoat concerning which he had hitherto been airily indifferent  he tried to get opinion out of his family but they were not so clear about it as they were about the frock  it ended in their buying a book of etiquette which settled the question adversely to a white waistcoat the author however after being very explicit in telling them not to eat with their knives and above all not to pick their teeth with their forksa thing which he said no lady or gentleman ever didwas still far from decided as to the kind of cravat colonel lapham ought to wear shaken on other points lapham had begun to waver also concerning the black cravat  as to the question of gloves for the colonel which suddenly flashed upon him one evening it appeared never to have entered the thoughts of the etiquette man as lapham called him  other authors on the same subject were equally silent and irene could only remember having heard in some vague sort of way that gentlemen did not wear gloves so much any more  drops of perspiration gathered on laphams forehead in the anxiety of the debate he groaned and he swore a little in the compromise profanity which he used  i declare said penelope where she sat purblindly sewing on a bit of dress for irene the colonels clothes are as much trouble as anybodys why dont you go to jordan  marshs and order one of the imported dresses for yourself father that gave them all the relief of a laugh over it the colonel joining in piteously  he had an awful longing to find out from corey how he ought to go  he formulated and repeated over to himself an apparently careless question such as oh by the way corey where do you get your gloves this would naturally lead to some talk on the subject which would if properly managed clear up the whole trouble  but lapham found that he would rather die than ask this question or any question that would bring up the dinner again  corey did not recur to it and lapham avoided the matter with positive fierceness  he shunned talking with corey at all and suffered in grim silence  one night before they fell asleep his wife said to him i was reading in one of those books today and i dont believe but what weve made a mistake if pen holds out that she wont go  why demanded lapham in the dismay which beset him at every fresh recurrence to the subject  the book says that its very impolite not to answer a dinner invitation promptly  well weve done that all rightat first i didnt know but what we had been a little too quick may bebut then it says if youre not going that its the height of rudeness not to let them know at once so that they can fill your place at the table  the colonel was silent for a while  well im dumned he said finally if there seems to be any end to this thing  if it was to do over again id say no for all of us  ive wished a hundred times they hadnt asked us but its too late to think about that now  the question is what are we going to do about penelope  oh i guess shell go at the last moment  she says she wont she took a prejudice against mrs corey that day and she cant seem to get over it  well then hadnt you better write in the morning as soon as youre up that she aint coming  mrs lapham sighed helplessly  i shouldnt know how to get it in its so late now i dont see how i could have the face  well then shes got to go thats all  shes set she wont  and im set she shall said lapham with the loud obstinacy of a man whose women always have their way  mrs lapham was not supported by the sturdiness of his proclamation  but she did not know how to do what she knew she ought to do about penelope and she let matters drift  after all the child had a right to stay at home if she did not wish to go  that was what mrs lapham felt and what she said to her husband next morning bidding him let penelope alone unless she chose herself to go  she said it was too late now to do anything and she must make the best excuse she could when she saw mrs corey  she began to wish that irene and her father would go and excuse her too  she could not help saying this and then she and lapham had some unpleasant words  look here he cried  who wanted to go in for these people in the first place didnt you come home full of em last year and want me to sell out here and move somewheres else because it didnt seem to suit em and now you want to put it all on me i aint going to stand it  hush said his wife  do you want to raise the house i didnt put it on you as you say  you took it on yourself  ever since that fellow happened to come into the new house that day youve been perfectly crazy to get in with them  and now youre so afraid you shall do something wrong before em you dont hardly dare to say your lifes your own  i declare if you pester me any more about those gloves silas lapham i wont go  do you suppose i want to go on my own account he demanded furiously  no she admitted  of course i dont i know very well that youre doing it for irene but for goodness gracious sake dont worry our lives out and make yourself a perfect laughingstock before the children  with this modified concession from her the quarrel closed in sullen silence on laphams part  the night before the dinner came and the question of his gloves was still unsettled and in a fair way to remain so  he had bought a pair so as to be on the safe side perspiring in company with the young lady who sold them and who helped him try them on at the shop his nails were still full of the powder which she had plentifully peppered into them in order to overcome the resistance of his blunt fingers  but he was uncertain whether he should wear them they had found a book at last that said the ladies removed their gloves on sitting down at table but it said nothing about gentlemens gloves he left his wife where she stood half hookandeyed at her glass in her new dress and went down to his own den beyond the parlour  before he shut his door he caught a glimpse of irene trailing up and down before the long mirror in her new dress followed by the seamstress on her knees the woman had her mouth full of pins and from time to time she made irene stop till she could put one of the pins into her train penelope sat in a corner criticising and counselling  it made lapham sick and he despised himself and all his brood for the trouble they were taking  but another glance gave him a sight of the young girls face in the mirror beautiful and radiant with happiness and his heart melted again with paternal tenderness and pride  it was going to be a great pleasure to irene and lapham felt that she was bound to cut out anything there  he was vexed with penelope that she was not going too he would have liked to have those people hear her talk  he held his door a little open and listened to the things she was getting off there to irene  he showed that he felt really hurt and disappointed about penelope and the girls mother made her console him the next evening before they all drove away without her  you try to look on the bright side of it father  i guess youll see that its best i didnt go when you get there  irene neednt open her lips and they can all see how pretty she is but they wouldnt know how smart i was unless i talked and maybe then they wouldnt  this thrust at her fathers simple vanity in her made him laugh and then they drove away and penelope shut the door and went upstairs with her lips firmly shutting in a sob    xiv   the coreys were one of the few old families who lingered in bellingham place the handsome quiet old street which the sympathetic observer must grieve to see abandoned to boardinghouses the dwellings are stately and tall and the whole place wears an air of aristocratic seclusion which mrs coreys father might well have thought assured when he left her his house there at his death  it is one of two evidently designed by the same architect who built some houses in a characteristic taste on beacon street opposite the common  it has a wooden portico with slender fluted columns which have always been painted white and which with the delicate mouldings of the cornice form the sole and sufficient decoration of the street front nothing could be simpler and nothing could be better  within the architect has again indulged his preference for the classic the roof of the vestibule wide and low rests on marble columns slim and fluted like the wooden columns without and an ample staircase climbs in a graceful easy curve from the tesselated pavement  some carved venetian scrigni stretched along the wall a rug lay at the foot of the stairs but otherwise the simple adequacy of the architectural intention had been respected and the place looked bare to the eyes of the laphams when they entered  the coreys had once kept a man but when young corey began his retrenchments the man had yielded to the neat maid who showed the colonel into the receptionroom and asked the ladies to walk up two flights  he had his charges from irene not to enter the drawingroom without her mother and he spent five minutes in getting on his gloves for he had desperately resolved to wear them at last  when he had them on and let his large fists hang down on either side they looked in the saffron tint which the shopgirl said his gloves should be of like canvased hams  he perspired with doubt as he climbed the stairs and while he waited on the landing for mrs lapham and irene to come down from above before going into the drawingroom he stood staring at his hands now open and now shut and breathing hard  he heard quiet talking beyond the portiere within and presently tom corey came out  ah colonel lapham very glad to see you  lapham shook hands with him and gasped waiting for mis lapham to account for his presence  he had not been able to button his right glove and he now began with as much indifference as he could assume to pull them both off for he saw that corey wore none  by the time he had stuffed them into the pocket of his coatskirt his wife and daughter descended  corey welcomed them very cordially too but looked a little mystified mrs lapham knew that he was silently inquiring for penelope and she did not know whether she ought to excuse her to him first or not  she said nothing and after a glance toward the regions where penelope might conjecturably be lingering he held aside the portiere for the laphams to pass and entered the room with them  mrs lapham had decided against lownecks on her own responsibility and had entrenched herself in the safety of a black silk in which she looked very handsome  irene wore a dress of one of those shades which only a woman or an artist can decide to be green or blue and which to other eyes looks both or neither according to their degrees of ignorance  if it was more like a ball dress than a dinner dress that might be excused to the exquisite effect  she trailed a delicate splendour across the carpet in her mothers sombre wake and the consciousness of success brought a vivid smile to her face  lapham pallid with anxiety lest he should somehow disgrace himself giving thanks to god that he should have been spared the shame of wearing gloves where no one else did but at the same time despairing that corey should have seen him in them had an unwonted aspect of almost pathetic refinement  mrs corey exchanged a quick glance of surprise and relief with her husband as she started across the room to meet her guests and in her gratitude to them for being so irreproachable she threw into her manner a warmth that people did not always find there  general lapham she said shaking hands in quick succession with mrs lapham and irene and now addressing herself to him  no maam only colonel said the honest man but the lady did not hear him  she was introducing her husband to laphams wife and daughter and bromfield corey was already shaking his hand and saying he was very glad to see him again while he kept his artistic eye on irene and apparently could not take it off  lily corey gave the lapham ladies a greeting which was physically rather than socially cold and nanny stood holding irenes hand in both of hers a moment and taking in her beauty and her style with a generous admiration which she could afford for she was herself faultlessly dressed in the quiet taste of her city and looking very pretty  the interval was long enough to let every man present confide his sense of irenes beauty to every other and then as the party was small mrs corey made everybody acquainted  when lapham had not quite understood he held the persons hand and leaning urbanely forward inquired what name he did that because a great man to whom he had been presented on the platform at a public meeting had done so to him and he knew it must be right  a little lull ensued upon the introductions and mrs corey said quietly to mrs lapham can i send any one to be of use to miss lapham as if penelope must be in the dressingroom  mrs lapham turned firered and the graceful forms in which she had been intending to excuse her daughters absence went out of her head she isnt upstairs she said at her bluntest as country people are when embarrassed  she didnt feel just like coming tonight  i dont know as shes feeling very well  mrs corey emitted a very small overy small very coldwhich began to grow larger and hotter and to burn into mrs laphams soul before mrs corey could add im very sorry  its nothing serious i hope  robert chase the painter had not come and mrs james bellingham was not there so that the table really balanced better without penelope but mrs lapham could not know this and did not deserve to know it mrs corey glanced round the room as if to take account of her guests and said to her husband i think we are all here then and he came forward and gave his arm to mrs lapham  she perceived then that in their determination not to be the first to come they had been the last and must have kept the others waiting for them  lapham had never seen people go down to dinner arminarm before but he knew that his wife was distinguished in being taken out by the host and he waited in jealous impatience to see if tom corey would offer his arm to irene  he gave it to that big girl they called miss kingsbury and the handsome old fellow whom mrs corey had introduced as her cousin took irene out  lapham was startled from the misgiving in which this left him by mrs coreys passing her hand through his arm and he made a sudden movement forward but felt himself gently restrained they went out the last of all he did not know why but he submitted and when they sat down he saw that irene although she had come in with that mr bellingham was seated beside young corey after all  he fetched a long sigh of relief when he sank into his chair and felt himself safe from error if he kept a sharp lookout and did only what the others did  bellingham had certain habits which he permitted himself and one of these was tucking the corner of his napkin into his collar he confessed himself an uncertain shot with a spoon and defended his practice on the ground of neatness and commonsense lapham put his napkin into his collar too and then seeing that no one but bellingham did it became alarmed and took it out again slyly  he never had wine on his table at home and on principle he was a prohibitionist but now he did not know just what to do about the glasses at the right of his plate  he had a notion to turn them all down as he had read of a wellknown politicians doing at a public dinner to show that he did not take wine but after twiddling with one of them a moment he let them be for it seemed to him that would be a little too conspicuous and he felt that every one was looking he let the servant fill them all and he drank out of each not to appear odd  later he observed that the young ladies were not taking wine and he was glad to see that irene had refused it and that mrs lapham was letting it stand untasted  he did not know but he ought to decline some of the dishes or at least leave most of some on his plate but he was not able to decide he took everything and ate everything  he noticed that mrs corey seemed to take no more trouble about the dinner than anybody and mr corey rather less he was talking busily to mrs lapham and lapham caught a word here and there that convinced him she was holding her own  he was getting on famously himself with mrs corey who had begun with him about his new house he was telling her all about it and giving her his ideas  their conversation naturally included his architect across the table lapham had been delighted and secretly surprised to find the fellow there and at something seymour said the talk spread suddenly and the pretty house he was building for colonel lapham became the general theme  young corey testified to its loveliness and the architect said laughingly that if he had been able to make a nice thing of it he owed it to the practical sympathy of his client  practical sympathy is good said bromfield corey and slanting his head confidentially to mrs lapham he added does he bleed your husband mrs lapham hes a terrible fellow for appropriations  mrs lapham laughed reddening consciously and said she guessed the colonel knew how to take care of himself  this struck lapham then draining his glass of sauterne as wonderfully discreet in his wife bromfield corey leaned back in his chair a moment  well after all you cant say with all your modern fuss about it that you do much better now than the old fellows who built such houses as this  ah said the architect nobody can do better than well  your house is in perfect taste you know ive always admired it and i dont think its at all the worse for being oldfashioned what weve done is largely to go back of the hideous style that raged after they forgot how to make this sort of house  but i think we may claim a better feeling for structure  we use better material and more wisely and by and by we shall work out something more characteristic and original  with your chocolates and olives and your clutter of bricabrac  all thats bad of course but i dont mean that  i dont wish to make you envious of colonel lapham and modesty prevents my saying that his house is prettierthough i may have my convictionsbut its better built  all the new houses are better built  now your house  mrs coreys house interrupted the host with a burlesque haste in disclaiming responsibility for it that made them all laugh  my ancestral halls are in salem and im told you couldnt drive a nail into their timbers in fact i dont know that you would want to do it  i should consider it a species of sacrilege answered seymour and i shall be far from pressing the point i was going to make against a house of mrs coreys  this won seymour the easy laugh and lapham silently wondered that the fellow never got off any of those things to him  well said corey you architects and the musicians are the true and only artistic creators  all the rest of us sculptors painters novelists and tailors deal with forms that we have before us we try to imitate we try to represent  but you two sorts of artists create form  if you represent you fail  somehow or other you do evolve the camel out of your inner consciousness  i will not deny the soft impeachment said the architect with a modest air  i dare say  and youll own that its very handsome of me to say this after your unjustifiable attack on mrs coreys property  bromfield corey addressed himself again to mrs lapham and the talk subdivided itself as before  it lapsed so entirely away from the subject just in hand that lapham was left with rather a good idea as he thought it to perish in his mind for want of a chance to express it  the only thing like a recurrence to what they had been saying was bromfield coreys warning mrs lapham in some connection that lapham lost against miss kingsbury  shes worse he was saying when it comes to appropriations than seymour himself  depend upon it mrs lapham she will give you no peace of your mind now shes met you from this out  her tender mercies are cruel and i leave you to supply the content from your own scriptural knowledge  beware of her and all her works  she calls them works of charity but heaven knows whether they are  it dont stand to reason that she gives the poor all the money she gets out of people  i have my own beliefhe gave it in a whisper for the whole table to hearthat she spends it for champagne and cigars  lapham did not know about that kind of talking but miss kingsbury seemed to enjoy the fun as much as anybody and he laughed with the rest  you shall be asked to the very next debauch of the committee mr corey then you wont dare expose us said miss kingsbury  i wonder you havent been down upon corey to go to the chardon street home and talk with your indigent italians in their native tongue said charles bellingham  i saw in the transcript the other night that you wanted some one for the work  we did think of mr corey replied miss kingsbury but we reflected that he probably wouldnt talk with them at all he would make them keep still to be sketched and forget all about their wants  upon the theory that this was a fair return for coreys pleasantry the others laughed again  there is one charity said corey pretending superiority to miss kingsburys point that is so difficult i wonder it hasnt occurred to a lady of your courageous invention  yes said miss kingsbury  what is that  the occupation by deserving poor of neat habits of all the beautiful airy wholesome houses that stand empty the whole summer long while their owners are away in their lowly cots beside the sea  yes that is terrible replied miss kingsbury with quick earnestness while her eyes grew moist  i have often thought of our great cool houses standing useless here and the thousands of poor creatures stifling in their holes and dens and the little children dying for wholesome shelter  how cruelly selfish we are  that is a very comfortable sentiment miss kingsbury said corey and must make you feel almost as if you had thrown open no 31 to the whole north end  but i am serious about this matter  i spend my summers in town and i occupy my own house so that i can speak impartially and intelligently and i tell you that in some of my walks on the hill and down on the back bay nothing but the surveillance of the local policeman prevents my offering personal violence to those long rows of closeshuttered handsome brutally insensible houses  if i were a poor man with a sick child pining in some garret or cellar at the north end i should break into one of them and camp out on the grand piano  surely bromfield said his wife you dont consider what havoc such people would make with the furniture of a nice house  that is true answered corey with meek conviction  i never thought of that  and if you were a poor man with a sick child i doubt if youd have so much heart for burglary as you have now said james bellingham  its wonderful how patient they are said the minister  the spectacle of the hopeless comfort the hardworking poor man sees must be hard to bear  lapham wanted to speak up and say that he had been there himself and knew how such a man felt  he wanted to tell them that generally a poor man was satisfied if he could make both ends meet that he didnt envy any one his good luck if he had earned it so long as he wasnt running under himself  but before he could get the courage to address the whole table sewell added i suppose he dont always think of it  but some day he will think about it said corey  in fact we rather invite him to think about it in this country  my brotherinlaw said charles bellingham with the pride a man feels in a mentionably remarkable brotherinlaw has no end of fellows at work under him out there at omaha and he says its the fellows from countries where theyve been kept from thinking about it that are discontented  the americans never make any trouble  they seem to understand that so long as we give unlimited opportunity nobody has a right to complain  what do you hear from leslie asked mrs corey turning from these profitless abstractions to mrs bellingham  you know said that lady in a lower tone that there is another baby  no i hadnt heard of it  yes a boy  they have named him after his uncle  yes said charles bellingham joining in  he is said to be a noble boy and to resemble me  all boys of that tender age are noble said corey and look like anybody you wish them to resemble  is leslie still homesick for the beanpots of her native boston  she is getting over it i fancy replied mrs bellingham  shes very much taken up with mr blakes enterprises and leads a very exciting life  she says shes like people who have been home from europe three years shes past the most poignant stage of regret and hasnt reached the second when they feel that they must go again  lapham leaned a little toward mrs corey and said of a picture which he saw on the wall opposite picture of your daughter i presume  no my daughters grandmother  its a stewart newton he painted a great many salem beauties  she was a miss polly burroughs  my daughter is like her dont you think they both looked at nanny corey and then at the portrait  those pretty oldfashioned dresses are coming in again  im not surprised you took it for her  the othersshe referred to the other portraits more or less darkling on the wallsare my people mostly copleys  these names unknown to lapham went to his head like the wine he was drinking they seemed to carry light for the moment but a film of deeper darkness followed  he heard charles bellingham telling funny stories to irene and trying to amuse the girl she was laughing and seemed very happy  from time to time bellingham took part in the general talk between the host and james bellingham and miss kingsbury and that minister mr sewell  they talked of people mostly it astonished lapham to hear with what freedom they talked  they discussed these persons unsparingly james bellingham spoke of a man known to lapham for his business success and great wealth as not a gentleman his cousin charles said he was surprised that the fellow had kept from being governor so long  when the latter turned from irene to make one of these excursions into the general talk young corey talked to her and lapham caught some words from which it seemed that they were speaking of penelope  it vexed him to think she had not come she could have talked as well as any of them she was just as bright and lapham was aware that irene was not as bright though when he looked at her face triumphant in its young beauty and fondness he said to himself that it did not make any difference  he felt that he was not holding up his end of the line however  when some one spoke to him he could only summon a few words of reply that seemed to lead to nothing things often came into his mind appropriate to what they were saying but before he could get them out they were off on something else they jumped about so he could not keep up but he felt all the same that he was not doing himself justice  at one time the talk ran off upon a subject that lapham had never heard talked of before but again he was vexed that penelope was not there to have her say he believed that her say would have been worth hearing  miss kingsbury leaned forward and asked charles bellingham if he had read tears idle tears the novel that was making such a sensation and when he said no she said she wondered at him  its perfectly heartbreaking as youll imagine from the name but theres such a dear oldfashioned hero and heroine in it who keep dying for each other all the way through and making the most wildly satisfactory and unnecessary sacrifices for each other  you feel as if youd done them yourself  ah thats the secret of its success said bromfield corey  it flatters the reader by painting the characters colossal but with his limp and stoop so that he feels himself of their supernatural proportions  youve read it nanny  yes said his daughter  it ought to have been called slop silly slop  oh not quite slop nanny pleaded miss kingsbury  its astonishing said charles bellingham how we do like the books that go for our heartstrings and i really suppose that you cant put a more popular thing than selfsacrifice into a novel  we do like to see people suffering sublimely  there was talk some years ago said james bellingham about novels going out theyre just coming in cried miss kingsbury  yes said mr sewell the minister  and i dont think there ever was a time when they formed the whole intellectual experience of more people  they do greater mischief than ever  dont be envious parson said the host  no answered sewell  i should be glad of their help  but those novels with oldfashioned heroes and heroines in themexcuse me miss kingsburyare ruinous  dont you feel like a moral wreck miss kingsbury asked the host  but sewell went on the novelists might be the greatest possible help to us if they painted life as it is and human feelings in their true proportion and relation but for the most part they have been and are altogether noxious  this seemed sense to lapham but bromfield corey asked but what if life as it is isnt amusing arent we to be amused  not to our hurt sturdily answered the minister  and the selfsacrifice painted in most novels like this  slop silly slop suggested the proud father of the inventor of the phrase  yesis nothing but psychical suicide and is as wholly immoral as the spectacle of a man falling upon his sword  well i dont know but youre right parson said the host and the minister who had apparently got upon a battlehorse of his careered onward in spite of some tacit attempts of his wife to seize the bridle  right to be sure i am right  the whole business of love and lovemaking and marrying is painted by the novelists in a monstrous disproportion to the other relations of life  love is very sweet very pretty  oh thank you mr sewell said nanny corey in a way that set them all laughing  but its the affair commonly of very young people who have not yet character and experience enough to make them interesting  in novels its treated not only as if it were the chief interest of life but the sole interest of the lives of two ridiculous young persons and it is taught that love is perpetual that the glow of a true passion lasts for ever and that it is sacrilege to think or act otherwise well but isnt that true mr sewell pleaded miss kingsbury  i have known some most estimable people who had married a second time said the minister and then he had the applause with him lapham wanted to make some open recognition of his good sense but could not  i suppose the passion itself has been a good deal changed said bromfield corey since the poets began to idealise it in the days of chivalry  yes and it ought to be changed again said mr sewell  what back  i dont say that  but it ought to be recognised as something natural and mortal and divine honours which belong to righteousness alone ought not to be paid it  oh you ask too much parson laughed his host and the talk wandered away to something else  it was not an elaborate dinner but lapham was used to having everything on the table at once and this succession of dishes bewildered him he was afraid perhaps he was eating too much  he now no longer made any pretence of not drinking his wine for he was thirsty and there was no more water and he hated to ask for any  the icecream came and then the fruit  suddenly mrs corey rose and said across the table to her husband i suppose you will want your coffee here and he replied yes well join you at tea  the ladies all rose and the gentlemen got up with them  lapham started to follow mrs corey but the other men merely stood in their places except young corey who ran and opened the door for his mother lapham thought with shame that it was he who ought to have done that but no one seemed to notice and he sat down again gladly after kicking out one of his legs which had gone to sleep  they brought in cigars with coffee and bromfield corey advised lapham to take one that he chose for him  lapham confessed that he liked a good cigar about as well as anybody and corey said these are new  i had an englishman here the other day who was smoking old cigars in the superstition that tobacco improved with age like wine  ah said lapham anybody who had ever lived off a tobacco country could tell him better than that with the fuming cigar between his lips he felt more at home than he had before  he turned sidewise in his chair and resting one arm on the back intertwined the fingers of both hands and smoked at large ease  james bellingham came and sat down by him  colonel lapham werent you with the 96th vermont when they charged across the river in front of pickensburg and the rebel battery opened fire on them in the water  lapham slowly shut his eyes and slowly dropped his head for assent letting out a white volume of smoke from the corner of his mouth  i thought so said bellingham  i was with the 85th massachusetts and i shant forget that slaughter  we were all new to it still perhaps thats why it made such an impression  i dont know suggested charles bellingham  was there anything much more impressive afterward i read of it out in missouri where i was stationed at the time and i recollect the talk of some old army men about it  they said that deathrate couldnt be beaten  i dont know that it ever was  about one in five of us got out safe said lapham breaking his cigarash off on the edge of a plate  james bellingham reached him a bottle of apollinaris  he drank a glass and then went on smoking  they all waited as if expecting him to speak and then corey said how incredible those things seem already  you gentlemen know that they happened but are you still able to believe it  ah nobody feels that anything happened said charles bellingham the past of ones experience doesnt differ a great deal from the past of ones knowledge  it isnt much more probable its really a great deal less vivid than some scenes in a novel that one read when a boy  im not sure of that said james bellingham  well james neither am i consented his cousin helping himself from laphams apollinaris bottle  there would be very little talking at dinner if one only said the things that one was sure of  the others laughed and bromfield corey remarked thoughtfully what astonishes the craven civilian in all these things is the abundancethe superabundanceof heroism  the cowards were the exception the men that were ready to die the rule  the woods were full of them said lapham without taking his cigar from his mouth  thats a nice little touch in school interposed charles bellingham where the girl says to the fellow who was at inkerman i should think you would be so proud of it and he reflects a while and says well the fact is you know there were so many of us  yes i remember that said james bellingham smiling for pleasure in it  but i dont see why you claim the credit of being a craven civilian bromfield he added with a friendly glance at his brotherinlaw and with the willingness boston men often show to turn one anothers good points to the light in company bred so intimately together at school and college and in society they all know these points  a man who was out with garibaldi in 48 continued james bellingham  oh a little amateur redshirting corey interrupted in deprecation but even if you choose to dispute my claim what has become of all the heroism tom how many club men do you know who would think it sweet and fitting to die for their country  i cant think of a great many at the moment sir replied the son with the modesty of his generation  and i couldnt in 61 said his uncle  nevertheless they were there  then your theory is that its the occasion that is wanting said bromfield corey  but why shouldnt civil service reform and the resumption of specie payment and a tariff for revenue only inspire heroes they are all good causes  its the occasion thats wanting said james bellingham ignoring the persiflage  and im very glad of it  so am i said lapham with a depth of feeling that expressed itself in spite of the haze in which his brain seemed to float  there was a great deal of the talk that he could not follow it was too quick for him but here was something he was clear of  i dont want to see any more men killed in my time something serious something sombre must lurk behind these words and they waited for lapham to say more but the haze closed round him again and he remained silent drinking apollinaris  we noncombatants were notoriously reluctant to give up fighting said mr sewell the minister but i incline to think colonel lapham and mr bellingham may be right  i dare say we shall have the heroism again if we have the occasion  till it comes we must content ourselves with the everyday generosities and sacrifices  they make up in quantity what they lack in quality perhaps theyre not so picturesque said bromfield corey  you can paint a man dying for his country but you cant express on canvas a man fulfilling the duties of a good citizen  perhaps the novelists will get at him by and by suggested charles bellingham  if i were one of these fellows i shouldnt propose to myself anything short of that  what the commonplace asked his cousin  commonplace the commonplace is just that light impalpable aerial essence which theyve never got into their confounded books yet  the novelist who could interpret the common feelings of commonplace people would have the answer to the riddle of the painful earth on his tongue  oh not so bad as that i hope said the host and lapham looked from one to the other trying to make out what they were at  he had never been so up a tree before  i suppose it isnt well for us to see human nature at white heat habitually continued bromfield corey after a while  it would make us vain of our species  many a poor fellow in that war and in many another has gone into battle simply and purely for his countrys sake not knowing whether if he laid down his life he should ever find it again or whether if he took it up hereafter he should take it up in heaven or hell  come parson he said turning to the minister what has ever been conceived of omnipotence of omniscience so sublime so divine as that  nothing answered the minister quietly  god has never been imagined at all  but if you suppose such a man as that was authorised i think it will help you to imagine what god must be  theres sense in that said lapham  he took his cigar out of his mouth and pulled his chair a little toward the table on which he placed his ponderous forearms  i want to tell you about a fellow i had in my own company when we first went out  we were all privates to begin with after a while they elected me captainid had the tavern stand and most of em knew me  but jim millon never got to be anything more than corporal corporal when he was killed the others arrested themselves in various attitudes of attention and remained listening to lapham with an interest that profoundly flattered him now at last he felt that he was holding up his end of the rope  i cant say he went into the thing from the highest motives altogether our motives are always pretty badly mixed and when theres such a hurrahboys as there was then you cant tell which is which  i suppose jim millons wife was enough to account for his going herself she was a pretty bad assortment said lapham lowering his voice and glancing round at the door to make sure that it was shut and she used to lead jim one kind of life  well sir continued lapham synthetising his auditors in that form of address that fellow used to save every cent of his pay and send it to that woman  used to get me to do it for him  i tried to stop him  why jim said i you know what shell do with it thats so cap says he but i dont know what shell do without it and it did keep her straightstraight as a stringas long as jim lasted  seemed as if there was something mysterious about it  they had a little girlabout as old as my oldest girland jim used to talk to me about her  guess he done it as much for her as for the mother and he said to me before the last action we went into i should like to turn tail and run cap  i aint comin out o this one  but i dont suppose it would do well not for you jim said i i want to live he says and he bust out crying right there in my tent  i want to live for poor molly and zerrillathats what they called the little one i dunno where they got the name  i aint ever had half a chance and now shes doing better and i believe we should get along after this he set there cryin like a baby  but he want no baby when he went into action  i hated to look at him after it was over not so much because hed got a ball that was meant for me by a sharpshooterhe saw the devil takin aim and he jumped to warn meas because he didnt look like jim he looked likefun all desperate and savage  i guess he died hard  the story made its impression and lapham saw it  now i say he resumed as if he felt that he was going to do himself justice and say something to heighten the effect his story had produced  at the same time he was aware of a certain want of clearness  he had the idea but it floated vague elusive in his brain  he looked about as if for something to precipitate it in tangible shape  apollinaris asked charles bellingham handing the bottle from the other side  he had drawn his chair closer than the rest to laphams and was listening with great interest  when mrs corey asked him to meet lapham he accepted gladly  you know i go in for that sort of thing anna  since leslies affair were rather bound to do it  and i think we meet these practical fellows too little  theres always something original about them he might naturally have believed that the reward of his faith was coming  thanks i will take some of this wine said lapham pouring himself a glass of madeira from a black and dusty bottle caressed by a label bearing the date of the vintage  he tossed off the wine unconscious of its preciousness and waited for the result  that cloudiness in his brain disappeared before it but a mere blank remained  he not only could not remember what he was going to say but he could not recall what they had been talking about  they waited looking at him and he stared at them in return  after a while he heard the host saying shall we join the ladies  lapham went trying to think what had happened  it seemed to him a long time since he had drunk that wine  miss corey gave him a cup of tea where he stood aloof from his wife who was talking with miss kingsbury and mrs sewell irene was with miss nanny corey  he could not hear what they were talking about but if penelope had come he knew that she would have done them all credit he meant to let her know how he felt about her behaviour when he got home  it was a shame for her to miss such a chance  irene was looking beautiful as pretty as all the rest of them put together but she was not talking and lapham perceived that at a dinnerparty you ought to talk  he was himself conscious of having talked very well  he now wore an air of great dignity and in conversing with the other gentlemen he used a grave and weighty deliberation  some of them wanted him to go into the library  there he gave his ideas of books he said he had not much time for anything but the papers but he was going to have a complete library in his new place  he made an elaborate acknowledgment to bromfield corey of his sons kindness in suggesting books for his library he said that he had ordered them all and that he meant to have pictures  he asked mr corey who was about the best american painter going now  i dont set up to be a judge of pictures but i know what i like he said  he lost the reserve which he had maintained earlier and began to boast  he himself introduced the subject of his paint in a natural transition from pictures he said mr corey must take a run up to lapham with him some day and see the works they would interest him and he would drive him round the country he kept most of his horses up there and he could show mr corey some of the finest jersey grades in the country  he told about his brother william the judge at dubuque and a farm he had out there that paid for itself every year in wheat  as he cast off all fear his voice rose and he hammered his armchair with the thick of his hand for emphasis  mr corey seemed impressed he sat perfectly quiet listening and lapham saw the other gentlemen stop in their talk every now and then to listen  after this proof of his ability to interest them he would have liked to have mrs lapham suggest again that he was unequal to their society or to the society of anybody else  he surprised himself by his ease among men whose names had hitherto overawed him  he got to calling bromfield corey by his surname alone he did not understand why young corey seemed so preoccupied and he took occasion to tell the company how he had said to his wife the first time he saw that fellow that he could make a man of him if he had him in the business and he guessed he was not mistaken  he began to tell stories of the different young men he had had in his employ  at last he had the talk altogether to himself no one else talked and he talked unceasingly  it was a great time it was a triumph  he was in this successful mood when word came to him that mrs lapham was going tom corey seemed to have brought it but he was not sure anyway he was not going to hurry  he made cordial invitations to each of the gentlemen to drop in and see him at his office and would not be satisfied till he had exacted a promise from each  he told charles bellingham that he liked him and assured james bellingham that it had always been his ambition to know him and that if any one had said when he first came to boston that in less than ten years he should be hobnobbing with jim bellingham he should have told that person he lied  he would have told anybody he lied that had told him ten years ago that a son of bromfield corey would have come and asked him to take him into the business  ten years ago he silas lapham had come to boston a little worse off than nothing at all for he was in debt for half the money that he had bought out his partner with and here he was now worth a million and meeting you gentlemen like one of you  and every cent of that was honest moneyno speculationevery copper of it for value received  and here only the other day his old partner who had been going to the dogs ever since he went out of the business came and borrowed twenty thousand dollars of him lapham lent it because his wife wanted him to she had always felt bad about the fellows having to go out of the business  he took leave of mr sewell with patronising affection and bade him come to him if he ever got into a tight place with his parish work he would let him have all the money he wanted he had more money than he knew what to do with  why when your wife sent to mine last fall he said turning to mr corey i drew my cheque for five hundred dollars but my wife wouldnt take more than one hundred said she wasnt going to show off before mrs corey  i call that a pretty good joke on mrs corey  i must tell her how mrs lapham done her out of a cool four hundred dollars  he started toward the door of the drawingroom to take leave of the ladies but tom corey was at his elbow saying i think mrs lapham is waiting for you below sir and in obeying the direction corey gave him toward another door he forgot all about his purpose and came away without saying goodnight to his hostess  mrs lapham had not known how soon she ought to go and had no idea that in her quality of chief guest she was keeping the others  she stayed till eleven oclock and was a little frightened when she found what time it was but mrs corey without pressing her to stay longer had said it was not at all late  she and irene had had a perfect time everybody had been very polite on the way home they celebrated the amiability of both the miss coreys and of miss kingsbury  mrs lapham thought that mrs bellingham was about the pleasantest person she ever saw she had told her all about her married daughter who had married an inventor and gone to live in omahaa mrs blake  if its that carwheel blake said lapham proudly i know all about him  ive sold him tons of the paint  pooh papa how you do smell of smoking cried irene  pretty strong eh laughed lapham letting down a window of the carriage  his heart was throbbing wildly in the close air and he was glad of the rush of cold that came in though it stopped his tongue and he listened more and more drowsily to the rejoicings that his wife and daughter exchanged  he meant to have them wake penelope up and tell her what she had lost but when he reached home he was too sleepy to suggest it  he fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow full of supreme triumph  but in the morning his skull was sore with the unconscious nightlong ache and he rose cross and taciturn  they had a silent breakfast  in the cold grey light of the morning the glories of the night before showed poorer  here and there a painful doubt obtruded itself and marred them with its awkward shadow  penelope sent down word that she was not well and was not coming to breakfast and lapham was glad to go to his office without seeing her  he was severe and silent all day with his clerks and peremptory with customers  of corey he was slyly observant and as the day wore away he grew more restively conscious  he sent out word by his officeboy that he would like to see mr corey for a few minutes after closing the typewriter girl had lingered too as if she wished to speak with him and corey stood in abeyance as she went toward laphams door  cant see you tonight zerrilla he said bluffly but not unkindly perhaps ill call at the house if its important  it is said the girl with a spoiled air of insistence  well said lapham and nodding to corey to enter he closed the door upon her  then he turned to the young man and demanded was i drunk last night    xv   laphams strenuous face was broken up with the emotions that had forced him to this question shame fear of the things that must have been thought of him mixed with a faint hope that he might be mistaken which died out at the shocked and pitying look in coreys eyes  was i drunk he repeated  i ask you because i was never touched by drink in my life before and i dont know he stood with his huge hands trembling on the back of his chair and his dry lips apart as he stared at corey  that is what every one understood colonel lapham said the young man  every one saw how it was  dont  did they talk it over after i left asked lapham vulgarly  excuse me said corey blushing my father doesnt talk his guests over with one another he added with youthful superfluity you were among gentlemen  i was the only one that wasnt a gentleman there lamented lapham i disgraced you i disgraced my family i mortified your father before his friends his head dropped  i showed that i wasnt fit to go with you  im not fit for any decent place  what did i say what did i do he asked suddenly lifting his head and confronting corey  out with it if you could bear to see it and hear it i had ought to bear to know it  there was nothingreally nothing said corey  beyond the fact that you were not quite yourself there was nothing whatever  my father did speak of it to me he confessed when we were alone  he said that he was afraid we had not been thoughtful of you if you were in the habit of taking only water i told him i had not seen wine at your table the others said nothing about you  ah but what did they think  probably what we did that it was purely a misfortunean accident  i wasnt fit to be there persisted lapham  do you want to leave he asked with savage abruptness  leave faltered the young man  yes quit the business cut the whole connection  i havent the remotest idea of it cried corey in amazement  why in the world should i because youre a gentleman and im not and it aint right i should be over you  if you want to go i know some parties that would be glad to get you  i will give you up if you want to go before anything worse happens and i shant blame you  i can help you to something better than i can offer you here and i will  theres no question of my going unless you wish it said corey  if you do  will you tell your father interrupted lapham that i had a notion all the time that i was acting the drunken blackguard and that ive suffered for it all day will you tell him i dont want him to notice me if we ever meet and that i know im not fit to associate with gentlemen in anything but a business way if i am that  certainly i shall do nothing of the kind retorted corey  i cant listen to you any longer  what you say is shocking to meshocking in a way you cant think  why man exclaimed lapham with astonishment if i can stand it you can  no said corey with a sick look that doesnt follow  you may denounce yourself if you will but i have my reasons for refusing to hear youmy reasons why i cant hear you  if you say another word i must go away  i dont understand you faltered lapham in bewilderment which absorbed even his shame  you exaggerate the effect of what has happened said the young man its enough more than enough for you to have mentioned the matter to me and i think its unbecoming in me to hear you  he made a movement toward the door but lapham stopped him with the tragic humility of his appeal  dont go yet i cant let you  ive disgusted youi see that but i didnt mean to  ii take it back  oh theres nothing to take back said corey with a repressed shudder for the abasement which he had seen  but let us say no more about itthink no more  there wasnt one of the gentlemen present last night who didnt understand the matter precisely as my father and i did and that fact must end it between us two  he went out into the larger office beyond leaving lapham helpless to prevent his going  it had become a vital necessity with him to think the best of lapham but his mind was in a whirl of whatever thoughts were most injurious  he thought of him the night before in the company of those ladies and gentlemen and he quivered in resentment of his vulgar braggart uncouth nature  he recognised his own allegiance to the exclusiveness to which he was born and bred as a man perceives his duty to his country when her rights are invaded  his eye fell on the porter going about in his shirtsleeves to make the place fast for the night and he said to himself that dennis was not more plebeian than his master that the gross appetites the blunt sense the purblind ambition the stupid arrogance were the same in both and the difference was in a brute will that probably left the porter the gentler man of the two  the very innocence of laphams life in the direction in which he had erred wrought against him in the young mans mood it contained the insult of clownish inexperience  amidst the stings and flashes of his wounded pride all the social traditions all the habits of feeling which he had silenced more and more by force of will during the past months asserted their natural sway and he rioted in his contempt of the offensive boor who was even more offensive in his shame than in his trespass  he said to himself that he was a corey as if that were somewhat yet he knew that at the bottom of his heart all the time was that which must control him at last and which seemed sweetly to be suffering his rebellion secure of his submission in the end  it was almost with the girls voice that it seemed to plead with him to undo in him effect by effect the work of his indignant resentment to set all things in another and fairer light to give him hopes to suggest palliations to protest against injustices it was in laphams favour that he was so guiltless in the past and now corey asked himself if it were the first time he could have wished a guest at his fathers table to have taken less wine whether lapham was not rather to be honoured for not knowing how to contain his folly where a veteran transgressor might have held his tongue  he asked himself with a thrill of sudden remorse whether when lapham humbled himself in the dust so shockingly he had shown him the sympathy to which such abandon had the right and he had to own that he had met him on the gentlemanly ground sparing himself and asserting the superiority of his sort and not recognising that laphams humiliation came from the sense of wrong which he had helped to accumulate upon him by superfinely standing aloof and refusing to touch him  he shut his desk and hurried out into the early night not to go anywhere but to walk up and down to try to find his way out of the chaos which now seemed ruin and now the materials out of which fine actions and a happy life might be shaped  three hours later he stood at laphams door  at times what he now wished to do had seemed for ever impossible and again it had seemed as if he could not wait a moment longer  he had not been careless but very mindful of what he knew must be the feelings of his own family in regard to the laphams and he had not concealed from himself that his family had great reason and justice on their side in not wishing him to alienate himself from their common life and associations  the most that he could urge to himself was that they had not all the reason and justice but he had hesitated and delayed because they had so much  often he could not make it appear right that he should merely please himself in what chiefly concerned himself  he perceived how far apart in all their experiences and ideals the lapham girls and his sisters were how different mrs lapham was from his mother how grotesquely unlike were his father and lapham and the disparity had not always amused him  he had often taken it very seriously and sometimes he said that he must forego the hope on which his heart was set  there had been many times in the past months when he had said that he must go no further and as often as he had taken this stand he had yielded it upon this or that excuse which he was aware of trumping up  it was part of the complication that he should be unconscious of the injury he might be doing to some one besides his family and himself this was the defect of his diffidence and it had come to him in a pang for the first time when his mother said that she would not have the laphams think she wished to make more of the acquaintance than he did and then it had come too late  since that he had suffered quite as much from the fear that it might not be as that it might be so and now in the mood romantic and exalted in which he found himself concerning lapham he was as far as might be from vain confidence  he ended the question in his own mind by affirming to himself that he was there first of all to see lapham and give him an ultimate proof of his own perfect faith and unabated respect and to offer him what reparation this involved for that want of sympathyof humanitywhich he had shown    xvi   the nova scotia secondgirl who answered coreys ring said that lapham had not come home yet  oh said the young man hesitating on the outer step  i guess you better come in said the girl ill go and see when theyre expecting him  corey was in the mood to be swayed by any chance  he obeyed the suggestion of the secondgirls patronising friendliness and let her shut him into the drawingroom while she went upstairs to announce him to penelope  did you tell him father wasnt at home  yes he seemed so kind of disappointed i told him to come in and id see when he would be in said the girl with the human interest which sometimes replaces in the american domestic the servile deference of other countries  a gleam of amusement passed over penelopes face as she glanced at herself in the glass  well she cried finally dropping from her shoulders the light shawl in which she had been huddled over a book when corey rang i will go down  all right said the girl and penelope began hastily to amend the disarray of her hair which she tumbled into a mass on the top of her little head setting off the pale dark of her complexion with a flash of crimson ribbon at her throat  she moved across the carpet once or twice with the quaint grace that belonged to her small figure made a dissatisfied grimace at it in the glass caught a handkerchief out of a drawer and slid it into her pocket and then descended to corey  the lapham drawingroom in nankeen square was in the particoloured paint which the colonel had hoped to repeat in his new house the trim of the doors and windows was in light green and the panels in salmon the walls were a plain tint of french grey paper divided by gilt mouldings into broad panels with a wide stripe of red velvet paper running up the corners the chandelier was of massive imitation bronze the mirror over the mantel rested on a fringed mantelcover of green reps and heavy curtains of that stuff hung from gilt lambrequin frames at the window the carpet was of a small pattern in crude green which at the time mrs lapham bought it covered half the new floors in boston  in the panelled spaces on the walls were some stonecoloured landscapes representing the mountains and canyons of the west which the colonel and his wife had visited on one of the early official railroad excursions  in front of the long windows looking into the square were statues kneeling figures which turned their backs upon the company withindoors and represented allegories of faith and prayer to people without  a white marble group of several figures expressing an italian conception of lincoln freeing the slavesa latin negro and his wifewith our eagle flapping his wings in approval at lincolns feet occupied one corner and balanced the whatnot of an earlier period in another  these phantasms added their chill to that imparted by the tone of the walls the landscapes and the carpets and contributed to the violence of the contrast when the chandelier was lighted up full glare and the heat of the whole furnace welled up from the registers into the quivering atmosphere on one of the rare occasions when the laphams invited company  corey had not been in this room before the family had always received him in what they called the sittingroom  penelope looked into this first and then she looked into the parlour with a smile that broke into a laugh as she discovered him standing under the single burner which the secondgirl had lighted for him in the chandelier  i dont understand how you came to be put in there she said as she led the way to the cozier place unless it was because alice thought you were only here on probation anyway  father hasnt got home yet but im expecting him every moment i dont know whats keeping him did the girl tell you that mother and irene were out  no she didnt say  its very good of you to see me she had not seen the exaltation which he had been feeling he perceived with half a sigh it must all be upon this lower level perhaps it was best so there was something i wished to say to your fatheri hope he broke off youre better tonight  oh yes thank you said penelope remembering that she had not been well enough to go to dinner the night before  we all missed you very much  oh thank you im afraid you wouldnt have missed me if i had been there  oh yes we should said corey i assure you  they looked at each other  i really think i believed i was saying something said the girl  and so did i replied the young man  they laughed rather wildly and then they both became rather grave  he took the chair she gave him and looked across at her where she sat on the other side of the hearth in a chair lower than his with her hands dropped in her lap and the back of her head on her shoulders as she looked up at him  the softcoal fire in the grate purred and flickered the droplight cast a mellow radiance on her face  she let her eyes fall and then lifted them for an irrelevant glance at the clock on the mantel  mother and irene have gone to the spanish students concert  oh have they asked corey and he put his hat which he had been holding in his hand on the floor beside his chair  she looked down at it for no reason and then looked up at his face for no other and turned a little red  corey turned a little red himself she who had always been so easy with him now became a little constrained  do you know how warm it is outofdoors he asked  no is it warm i havent been out all day  its like a summer night  she turned her face towards the fire and then started abruptly perhaps its too warm for you here  oh no its very comfortable  i suppose its the cold of the last few days thats still in the house  i was reading with a shawl on when you came  i interrupted you  oh no  i had finished the book  i was just looking over it again  do you like to read books over  yes books that i like at all  that was it asked corey  the girl hesitated  it has rather a sentimental name  did you ever read ittears idle tears  oh yes they were talking of that last night its a famous book with ladies  they break their hearts over it  did it make you cry  oh its pretty easy to cry over a book said penelope laughing and that one is very natural till you come to the main point  then the naturalness of all the rest makes that seem natural too but i guess its rather forced  her giving him up to the other one  yes simply because she happened to know that the other one had cared for him first  why should she have done it what right had she  i dont know  i suppose that the selfsacrifice  but it wasnt selfsacrificeor not selfsacrifice alone  she was sacrificing him too and for some one who couldnt appreciate him half as much as she could  im provoked with myself when i think how i cried over that bookfor i did cry  its sillyits wicked for any one to do what that girl did  why cant they let people have a chance to behave reasonably in stories  perhaps they couldnt make it so attractive suggested corey with a smile  it would be novel at any rate said the girl  but so it would in real life i suppose she added  i dont know  why shouldnt people in love behave sensibly  thats a very serious question said penelope gravely  i couldnt answer it and she left him the embarrassment of supporting an inquiry which she had certainly instigated herself  she seemed to have finally recovered her own ease in doing this  do you admire our autumnal display mr corey  your display  the trees in the square  we think its quite equal to an opening at jordan  marshs  ah im afraid you wouldnt let me be serious even about your maples  oh yes i shouldif you like to be serious  dont you  well not about serious matters  thats the reason that book made me cry  you make fun of everything  miss irene was telling me last night about you  then its no use for me to deny it so soon  i must give irene a talking to  i hope you wont forbid her to talk about you  she had taken up a fan from the table and held it now between her face and the fire and now between her face and him  her little visage with that arch lazy look in it topped by its mass of dusky hair and dwindling from the full cheeks to the small chin had a japanese effect in the subdued light and it had the charm which comes to any woman with happiness  it would be hard to say how much of this she perceived that he felt  they talked about other things a while and then she came back to what he had said  she glanced at him obliquely round her fan and stopped moving it  does irene talk about me she asked  i think soyes  perhaps its only i who talk about you  you must blame me if its wrong he returned  oh i didnt say it was wrong she replied  but i hope if you said anything very bad of me youll let me know what it was so that i can reform  no dont change please cried the young man  penelope caught her breath but went on resolutelyor rebuke you for speaking evil of dignities she looked down at the fan now flat in her lap and tried to govern her head but it trembled and she remained looking down  again they let the talk stray and then it was he who brought it back to themselves as if it had not left them  i have to talk of you said corey because i get to talk to you so seldom  you mean that i do all the talking when weretogether she glanced sidewise at him but she reddened after speaking the last word  were so seldom together he pursued  i dont know what you mean  sometimes ive thoughtive been afraid that you avoided me  avoided you  yes tried not to be alone with me  she might have told him that there was no reason why she should be alone with him and that it was very strange he should make this complaint of her  but she did not  she kept looking down at the fan and then she lifted her burning face and looked at the clock again mother and irene will be sorry to miss you she gasped  he instantly rose and came towards her  she rose too and mechanically put out her hand  he took it as if to say goodnight i didnt mean to send you away she besought him  oh im not going he answered simply  i wanted to sayto say that its i who make her talk about you  to say ithere is something i want to say to you ive said it so often to myself that i feel as if you must know it she stood quite still letting him keep her hand and questioning his face with a bewildered gaze  you must knowshe must have told youshe must have guessed penelope turned white but outwardly quelled the panic that sent the blood to her heart ii didnt expecti hoped to have seen your fatherbut i must speak now whateveri love you  she freed her hand from both of those he had closed upon it and went back from him across the room with a sinuous spring  me whatever potential complicity had lurked in her heart his words brought her only immeasurable dismay  he came towards her again  yes you  who else  she fended him off with an imploring gesture  i thoughtiit was  she shut her lips tight and stood looking at him where he remained in silent amaze  then her words came again shudderingly  oh what have you done  upon my soul he said with a vague smile i dont know  i hope no harm  oh dont laugh she cried laughing hysterically herself  unless you want me to think you the greatest wretch in the world  i he responded  for heavens sake tell me what you mean  you know i cant tell you  can you saycan you put your hand on your heart and say thatyousay you never meantthat you meant meall along  yesyes who else i came here to see your father and to tell him that i wished to tell you thisto ask himbut what does it matter you must have known ityou must have seenand its for you to answer me  ive been abrupt i know and ive startled you but if you love me you can forgive that to my loving you so long before i spoke  she gazed at him with parted lips  oh mercy what shall i do if its truewhat you sayyou must go she said  and you must never come any more  do you promise that  certainly not said the young man  why should i promise such a thingso abominably wrong i could obey if you didnt love me  oh i dont indeed i dont now will you obey  no i dont believe you oh  he possessed himself of her hand again  my lovemy dearest what is this trouble that you cant tell it it cant be anything about yourself  if it is anything about any one else it wouldnt make the least difference in the world no matter what it was  i would be only too glad to show by any act or deed i could that nothing could change me towards you  oh you dont understand  no i dont you must tell me  i will never do that  then i will stay here till your mother comes and ask her what it is  ask her  yes do you think i will give you up till i know why i must  you force me to it will you go if i tell you and never let any human creature know what you have said to me  not unless you give me leave  that will be never  well then she stopped and made two or three ineffectual efforts to begin again  no no i cant you must go  i will not go  you said youloved me  if you do you will go  he dropped the hands he had stretched towards her and she hid her face in her own  there she said turning it suddenly upon him  sit down there  and will you promise meon your honournot to speaknot to try to persuade menot totouch me you wont touch me  i will obey you penelope  as if you were never to see me again as if i were dying  i will do what you say  but i shall see you again and dont talk of dying  this is the beginning of life  no its the end said the girl resuming at last something of the hoarse drawl which the tumult of her feeling had broken into those halfarticulate appeals  she sat down too and lifted her face towards him  its the end of life for me because i know now that i must have been playing false from the beginning  you dont know what i mean and i can never tell you  it isnt my secretits some one elses youyou must never come here again  i cant tell you why and you must never try to know  do you promise  you can forbid me  i must do what you say  i do forbid you then  and you shall not think i am cruel  how could i think that  oh how hard you make it  corey laughed for very despair  can i make it easier by disobeying you  i know i am talking crazily  but im not crazy  no no he said with some wild notion of comforting her but try to tell me this trouble there is nothing under heavenno calamity no sorrowthat i wouldnt gladly share with you or take all upon myself if i could  i know but this you cant oh my  dearest wait think let me ask your motheryour father  she gave a cry  no if you do that you will make me hate you will you  the rattling of a latchkey was heard in the outer door  promise cried penelope  oh i promise  goodbye she suddenly flung her arms round his neck and pressing her cheek tight against his flashed out of the room by one door as her father entered it by another  corey turned to him in a daze  ii called to speak with youabout a matterbut its so late now  illill see you tomorrow  no time like the present said lapham with a fierceness that did not seem referable to corey  he had his hat still on and he glared at the young man out of his blue eyes with a fire that something else must have kindled there  i really cant now said corey weakly  it will do quite as well tomorrow good night sir  good night answered lapham abruptly following him to the door and shutting it after him  i think the devil must have got into pretty much everybody tonight he muttered coming back to the room where he put down his hat  then he went to the kitchenstairs and called down hello alice i want something to eat    xvii   whats the reason the girls never get down to breakfast any more asked lapham when he met his wife at the table in the morning  he had been up an hour and a half and he spoke with the severity of a hungry man  it seems to me they dont amount to anything  here i am at my time of life up the first one in the house  i ring the bell for the cook at quarterpast six every morning and the breakfast is on the table at halfpast seven right along like clockwork but i never see anybody but you till i go to the office  oh yes you do si said his wife soothingly  the girls are nearly always down  but theyre young and it tires them more than it does us to get up early  they can rest afterwards  they dont do anything after they are up grumbled lapham  well thats your fault aint it  you oughtnt to have made so much money and then theyd have had to work she laughed at laphams spartan mood and went on to excuse the young people  irenes been up two nights hand running and penelope says she aint well  what makes you so cross about the girls been doing something youre ashamed of  ill tell you when ive been doing anything to be ashamed of growled lapham  oh no you wont said his wife jollily  youll only be hard on the rest of us  come now si what is it  lapham frowned into his coffee with sulky dignity and said without looking up i wonder what that fellow wanted here last night what fellow  corey i found him here when i came home and he said he wanted to see me but he wouldnt stop  where was he  in the sittingroom  was pen there  i didnt see her  mrs lapham paused with her hand on the creamjug why what in the land did he want did he say he wanted you  thats what he said  and then he wouldnt stay  well then ill tell you just what it is silas lapham  he came hereshe looked about the room and lowered her voiceto see you about irene and then he hadnt the courage  i guess hes got courage enough to do pretty much what he wants to said lapham glumly  all i know is he was here  you better ask pen about it if she ever gets down  i guess i shant wait for her said mrs lapham and as her husband closed the front door after him she opened that of her daughters room and entered abruptly  the girl sat at the window fully dressed and as if she had been sitting there a long time  without rising she turned her face towards her mother  it merely showed black against the light and revealed nothing till her mother came close to her with successive questions why how long have you been up pen why dont you come to your breakfast did you see mr corey when he called last night why whats the matter with you what have you been crying about  have i been crying  yes your cheeks are all wet  i thought they were on fire  well ill tell you whats happened she rose and then fell back in her chair  lock the door she ordered and her mother mechanically obeyed  i dont want irene in here  theres nothing the matter  only mr corey offered himself to me last night  her mother remained looking at her helpless not so much with amaze perhaps as dismay  oh im not a ghost i wish i was you had better sit down mother  you have got to know all about it  mrs lapham dropped nervelessly into the chair at the other window and while the girl went slowly but briefly on touching only the vital points of the story and breaking at times into a bitter drollery she sat as if without the power to speak or stir  well thats all mother  i should say i had dreamt it if i had slept any last night but i guess it really happened  the mother glanced round at the bed and said glad to occupy herself delayingly with the minor care why you have been sitting up all night you will kill yourself  i dont know about killing myself but ive been sitting up all night answered the girl  then seeing that her mother remained blankly silent again she demanded why dont you blame me mother why dont you say that i led him on and tried to get him away from her  dont you believe i did  her mother made her no answer as if these ravings of selfaccusal needed none  do you think she asked simply that he got the idea you cared for him  he knew it how could i keep it from him i said i didntat first  it was no use sighed the mother  you might as well said you did it couldnt help irene any if you didnt  i always tried to help her with him even when i  yes i know  but she never was equal to him  i saw that from the start but i tried to blind myself to it  and when he kept coming  you never thought of me cried the girl with a bitterness that reached her mothers heart  i was nobody i couldnt feel no one could care for me the turmoil of despair of triumph of remorse and resentment which filled her soul tried to express itself in the words  no said the mother humbly  i didnt think of you  or i didnt think of you enough  it did come across me sometimes that may bebut it didnt seem as ifand your going on so for irene  you let me go on  you made me always go and talk with him for her and you didnt think i would talk to him for myself  well i didnt  im punished for it  when did youbegin to care for him  how do i know what difference does it make its all over now no matter when it began  he wont come here any more unless i let him she could not help betraying her pride in this authority of hers but she went on anxiously enough what will you say to irene shes safe as far as im concerned but if he dont care for her what will you do  i dont know what to do said mrs lapham  she sat in an apathy from which she apparently could not rouse herself  i dont see as anything can be done  penelope laughed in a pitying derision  well let things go on then  but they wont go on  no they wont go on echoed her mother  shes pretty enough and shes capable and your fathers got the moneyi dont know what im saying she aint equal to him and she never was  i kept feeling it all the time and yet i kept blinding myself  if he had ever cared for her said penelope it wouldnt have mattered whether she was equal to him or not  im not equal to him either  her mother went on i might have thought it was you but i had got setwell i can see it all clear enough now its too late  i dont know what to do  and what do you expect me to do demanded the girl  do you want me to go to irene and tell her that ive got him away from her  o good lord cried mrs lapham  what shall i do what do you want i should do pen  nothing for me said penelope  ive had it out with myself  now do the best you can for irene  i couldnt say you had done wrong if you was to marry him today  mother  no i couldnt i couldnt say but what you had been good and faithfull all through and you had a perfect right to do it  there aint any one to blame  hes behaved like a gentleman and i can see now that he never thought of her and that it was you all the while well marry him then hes got the right and so have you  what about irene i dont want you to talk about me  i can take care of myself  shes nothing but a child  its only a fancy with her  shell get over it  she haint really got her heart set on him  shes got her heart set on him mother  shes got her whole life set on him  you know that  yes thats so said the mother as promptly as if she had been arguing to that rather than the contrary effect  if i could give him to her i would  but he isnt mine to give she added in a burst of despair he isnt mine to keep  well said mrs lapham she has got to bear it  i dont know whats to come of it all  but shes got to bear her share of it she rose and went toward the door  penelope ran after her in a sort of terror  youre not going to tell irene she gasped seizing her mother by either shoulder  yes i am said mrs lapham  if shes a woman grown she can bear a womans burden  i cant let you tell irene said the girl letting fall her face on her mothers neck  not irene she moaned  im afraid to let you how can i ever look at her again  why you havent done anything pen said her mother soothingly  i wanted to yes i must have done something  how could i help it i did care for him from the first and i must have tried to make him like me  do you think i did no no you mustnt tell irene not notyet mother yes i did try to get him from her she cried lifting her head and suddenly looking her mother in the face with those large dim eyes of hers  what do you think even last night it was the first time i ever had him all to myself for myself and i know now that i tried to make him think that i was pretty andfunny and i didnt try to make him think of her  i knew that i pleased him and i tried to please him more  perhaps i could have kept him from saying that he cared for me but when i saw he didi must have seen iti couldnt  i had never had him to myself and for myself before  i neednt have seen him at all but i wanted to see him and when i was sitting there alone with him how do i know what i did to let him feel that i cared for him now will you tell irene i never thought he did care for me and never expected him to  but i liked him  yesi did like him tell her that or else i will  if it was to tell her he was dead began mrs lapham absently  how easy it would be cried the girl in selfmockery  but hes worse than dead to her and so am i ive turned it over a million ways mother ive looked at it in every light you can put it in and i cant make anything but misery out of it  you can see the misery at the first glance and you cant see more or less if you spend your life looking at it she laughed again as if the hopelessness of the thing amused her  then she flew to the extreme of selfassertion well i have a right to him and he has a right to me  if hes never done anything to make her think he cared for herand i know he hasnt its all been our doing then hes free and im free  we cant make her happy whatever we do and why shouldnt ino that wont do i reached that point before she broke again into her desperate laugh you may try now mother  id best speak to your father first  penelope smiled a little more forlornly than she had laughed  well yes the colonel will have to know  it isnt a trouble that i can keep to myself exactly  it seems to belong to too many other people  her mother took a crazy encouragement from her return to her old way of saying things  perhaps he can think of something  oh i dont doubt but the colonel will know just what to do  you mustnt be too downhearted about it  ititll all come right  you tell irene that mother  mrs lapham had put her hand on the doorkey she dropped it and looked at the girl with a sort of beseeching appeal for the comfort she could not imagine herself  dont look at me mother said penelope shaking her head  you know that if irene were to die without knowing it it wouldnt come right for me  pen  ive read of cases where a girl gives up the man that loves her so as to make some other girl happy that the man doesnt love  that might be done  your father would think you were a fool said mrs lapham finding a sort of refuge in her strong disgust for the pseudo heroism  no if theres to be any giving up let it be by the one that shant make anybody but herself suffer  theres trouble and sorrow enough in the world without making it on purpose  she unlocked the door but penelope slipped round and set herself against it  irene shall not give up  i will see your father about it said the mother  let me out now  dont let irene come here  no i will tell her that you havent slept  go to bed now and try to get some rest  she isnt up herself yet  you must have some breakfast  no let me sleep if i can  i can get something when i wake up  ill come down if i cant sleep  life has got to go on  it does when theres a death in the house and this is only a little worse  dont you talk nonsense cried mrs lapham with angry authority  well a little better then said penelope with meek concession  mrs lapham attempted to say something and could not  she went out and opened irenes door  the girl lifted her head drowsily from her pillow dont disturb your sister when you get up irene  she hasnt slept well  please dont talk im almost dead with sleep returned irene  do go mamma i shant disturb her she turned her face down in the pillow and pulled the covering up over her ears  the mother slowly closed the door and went downstairs feeling bewildered and baffled almost beyond the power to move  the time had been when she would have tried to find out why this judgment had been sent upon her  but now she could not feel that the innocent suffering of others was inflicted for her fault she shrank instinctively from that cruel and egotistic misinterpretation of the mystery of pain and loss  she saw her two children equally if differently dear to her destined to trouble that nothing could avert and she could not blame either of them she could not blame the means of this misery to them he was as innocent as they and though her heart was sore against him in this first moment she could still be just to him in it  she was a woman who had been used to seek the light by striving she had hitherto literally worked to it  but it is the curse of prosperity that it takes work away from us and shuts that door to hope and health of spirit  in this house where everything had come to be done for her she had no tasks to interpose between her and her despair  she sat down in her own room and let her hands fall in her lapthe hands that had once been so helpful and busyand tried to think it all out  she had never heard of the fate that was once supposed to appoint the sorrows of men irrespective of their blamelessness or blame before the time when it came to be believed that sorrows were penalties but in her simple way she recognised something like that mythic power when she rose from her struggle with the problem and said aloud to herself well the witch is in it turn which way she would she saw no escape from the misery to comethe misery which had come already to penelope and herself and that must come to irene and her father  she started when she definitely thought of her husband and thought with what violence it would work in every fibre of his rude strength  she feared that and she feared something worsethe effect which his pride and ambition might seek to give it and it was with terror of this as well as the natural trust with which a woman must turn to her husband in any anxiety at last that she felt she could not wait for evening to take counsel with him  when she considered how wrongly he might take it all it seemed as if it were already known to him and she was impatient to prevent his error  she sent out for a messenger whom she despatched with a note to his place of business silas i should like to ride with you this afternoon  cant you come home early persis and she was at dinner with irene evading her questions about penelope when answer came that he would be at the house with the buggy at halfpast two  it is easy to put off a girl who has but one thing in her head but though mrs lapham could escape without telling anything of penelope she could not escape seeing how wholly irene was engrossed with hopes now turned so vain and impossible  she was still talking of that dinner of nothing but that dinner and begging for flattery of herself and praise of him which her mother had till now been so ready to give  seems to me you dont take very much interest mamma she said laughing and blushing at one point  yesyes i do protested mrs lapham and then the girl prattled on  i guess i shall get one of those pins that nanny corey had in her hair  i think it would become me dont you yes but irenei dont like to have you go on so tillunless hes said something to showyou oughtnt to give yourself up to thinking but at this the girl turned so white and looked such reproach at her that she added frantically yes get the pin  it is just the thing for you but dont disturb penelope  let her alone till i get back  im going out to ride with your father  hell be here in half an hour  are you through ring then  get yourself that fan you saw the other day your father wont say anything he likes to have you look well  i could see his eyes on you half the time the other night  i should have liked to have pen go with me said irene restored to her normal state of innocent selfishness by these flatteries  dont you suppose shell be up in time whats the matter with her that she didnt sleep  i dont know  better let her alone  well submitted irene    xviii   mrs  lapham went away to put on her bonnet and cloak and she was waiting at the window when her husband drove up  she opened the door and ran down the steps  dont get out i can help myself in and she clambered to his side while he kept the fidgeting mare still with voice and touch  where do you want i should go he asked turning the buggy  oh i dont care  out brookline way i guess  i wish you hadnt brought this fool of a horse she gave way petulantly  i wanted to have a talk  when i cant drive this mare and talk too ill sell out altogether said lapham  shell be quiet enough when shes had her spin  well said his wife and while they were making their way across the city to the milldam she answered certain questions he asked about some points in the new house  i should have liked to have you stop there he began but she answered so quickly not today that he gave it up and turned his horses head westward when they struck beacon street  he let the mare out and he did not pull her in till he left the brighton road and struck off under the low boughs that met above one of the quiet streets of brookline where the stone cottages with here and there a patch of determined ivy on their northern walls did what they could to look english amid the glare of the autumnal foliage  the smooth earthen track under the mares hoofs was scattered with flakes of the red and yellow gold that made the air luminous around them and the perspective was gay with innumerable tints and tones  pretty sightly said lapham with a long sign letting the reins lie loose in his vigilant hand to which he seemed to relegate the whole charge of the mare  i want to talk with you about rogers persis hes been getting in deeper and deeper with me and last night he pestered me half to death to go in with him in one of his schemes  i aint going to blame anybody but i haint got very much confidence in rogers  and i told him so last night  oh dont talk to me about rogers his wife broke in  theres something a good deal more important than rogers in the world and more important than your business  it seems as if you couldnt think of anything elsethat and the new house  did you suppose i wanted to ride so as to talk rogers with you she demanded yielding to the necessity a wife feels of making her husband pay for her suffering even if he has not inflicted it  i declare  well hold on now said lapham  what do you want to talk about im listening  his wife began why its just this silas lapham and then she broke off to say well you may wait nowstarting me wrong when its hard enough anyway  lapham silently turned his whip over and over in his hand and waited  did you suppose she asked at last that that young corey had been coming to see irene  i dont know what i supposed replied lapham sullenly  you always said so he looked sharply at her under his lowering brows  well he hasnt said mrs lapham and she replied to the frown that blackened on her husbands face  and i can tell you what if you take it in that way i shant speak another word  whos takin it what way retorted lapham savagely  what are you drivin at  i want you should promise that youll hear me out quietly  ill hear you out if youll give me a chance  i havent said a word yet  well im not going to have you flying into forty furies and looking like a perfect thundercloud at the very start  ive had to bear it and youve got to bear it too  well let me have a chance at it then  its nothing to blame anybody about as i can see and the only question is whats the best thing to do about it  theres only one thing we can do for if he dont care for the child nobody wants to make him  if he hasnt been coming to see her he hasnt and thats all there is to it  no it aint exclaimed lapham  there protested his wife  if he hasnt been coming to see her what has he been coming for  hes been coming to see pen cried the wife  now are you satisfied her tone implied that he had brought it all upon them but at the sight of the swift passions working in his face to a perfect comprehension of the whole trouble she fell to trembling and her broken voice lost all the spurious indignation she had put into it  o silas what are we going to do about it im afraid itll kill irene  lapham pulled off the loose drivingglove from his right hand with the fingers of his left in which the reins lay  he passed it over his forehead and then flicked from it the moisture it had gathered there he caught his breath once or twice like a man who meditates a struggle with superior force and then remains passive in its grasp  his wife felt the need of comforting him as she had felt the need of afflicting him  i dont say but what it can be made to come out all right in the end  all i say is i dont see my way clear yet  what makes you think he likes pen he asked quietly  he told her so last night and she told me this morning  was he at the office today  yes he was there  i havent been there much myself  he didnt say anything to me  does irene know  no i left her getting ready to go out shopping  she wants to get a pin like the one nanny corey had on o my lord groaned lapham  its been pen from the start i guess or almost from the start  i dont say but what he was attracted some by irene at the very first but i guess its been pen ever since he saw her and weve taken up with a notion and blinded ourselves with it  time and again ive had my doubts whether he cared for irene any but i declare to goodness when he kept coming i never hardly thought of pen and i couldnt help believing at last he did care for irene  did it ever strike you he might be after pen  no i took what you said  i supposed you knew  do you blame me silas she asked timidly  no whats the use of blaming we dont either of us want anything but the childrens good  whats it all of it for if it aint for that thats what weve both slaved for all our lives  yes i know  plenty of people lose their children she suggested  yes but that dont comfort me any  i never was one to feel good because another man felt bad  how would you have liked it if some one had taken comfort because his boy lived when ours died no i cant do it  and this is worse than death someways  that comes and it goes but this looks as if it was one of those things that had come to stay the way i look at it there aint any hope for anybody  suppose we dont want pen to have him will that help irene any if he dont want her suppose we dont want to let him have either does that help either  you talk exclaimed mrs lapham as if our say was going to settle it  do you suppose that penelope lapham is a girl to take up with a fellow that her sister is in love with and that she always thought was in love with her sister and go off and be happy with him  dont you believe but what it would come back to her as long as she breathed the breath of life how shed teased her about him as ive heard pen tease irene and helped to make her think he was in love with her by showing that she thought so herself its ridiculous  lapham seemed quite beaten down by this argument  his huge head hung forward over his breast the reins lay loose in his moveless hand the mare took her own way  at last he lifted his face and shut his heavy jaws  well quavered his wife  well he answered if he wants her and she wants him i dont see what thats got to do with it he looked straight forward and not at his wife  she laid her hands on the reins  now you stop right here silas lapham if i thought thatif i really believed you could be willing to break that poor childs heart and let pen disgrace herself by marrying a man that had as good as killed her sister just because you wanted bromfield coreys son for a soninlaw  lapham turned his face now and gave her a look  you had better not believe that persis get up he called to the mare without glancing at her and she sprang forward  i see youve got past being any use to yourself on this subject  hello shouted a voice in front of him  where the devil you goin to  do you want to kill somebody shrieked his wife  there was a light crash and the mare recoiled her length and separated their wheels from those of the open buggy in front which lapham had driven into  he made his excuses to the occupant and the accident relieved the tension of their feelings and left them far from the point of mutual injury which they had reached in their common trouble and their unselfish will for their childrens good  it was lapham who resumed the talk  im afraid we cant either of us see this thing in the right light  were too near to it  i wish to the lord there was somebody to talk to about it  yes said his wife but there aint anybody  well i dunno suggested lapham after a moment why not talk to the minister of your church may be he could see some way out of it  mrs lapham shook her head hopelessly  it wouldnt do  ive never taken up my connection with the church and i dont feel as if id got any claim on him  if hes anything of a man or anything of a preacher you have got a claim on him urged lapham and he spoiled his argument by adding ive contributed enough money to his church  oh thats nothing said mrs lapham  i aint well enough acquainted with dr langworthy or else im too well  no if i was to ask any one i should want to ask a total stranger  but whats the use si nobody could make us see it any different from what it is and i dont know as i should want they should  it blotted out the tender beauty of the day and weighed down their hearts ever more heavily within them  they ceased to talk of it a hundred times and still came back to it  they drove on and on  it began to be late  i guess we better go back si said his wife and as he turned without speaking she pulled her veil down and began to cry softly behind it with low little broken sobs  lapham started the mare up and drove swiftly homeward  at last his wife stopped crying and began trying to find her pocket  here take mine persis he said kindly offering her his handkerchief and she took it and dried her eyes with it  there was one of those fellows there the other night he spoke again when his wife leaned back against the cushions in peaceful despair that i liked the looks of about as well as any man i ever saw  i guess he was a pretty good man it was that mr sewell  he looked at his wife but she did not say anything  persis he resumed i cant bear to go back with nothing settled in our minds  i cant bear to let you  we must si returned his wife with gentle gratitude  lapham groaned  where does he live she asked  on bolingbroke street  he gave me his number  well it wouldnt do any good  what could he say to us  oh i dont know as he could say anything said lapham hopelessly and neither of them said anything more till they crossed the milldam and found themselves between the rows of city houses  dont drive past the new house si pleaded his wife  i couldnt bear to see it  drivedrive up bolingbroke street  we might as well see where he does live  well said lapham  he drove along slowly  thats the place he said finally stopping the mare and pointing with his whip  it wouldnt do any good said his wife in a tone which he understood as well as he understood her words  he turned the mare up to the curbstone  you take the reins a minute he said handing them to his wife  he got down and rang the bell and waited till the door opened then he came back and lifted his wife out  hes in he said  he got the hitchingweight from under the buggyseat and made it fast to the mares bit  do you think shell stand with that asked mrs lapham  i guess so  if she dont no matter  aint you afraid shell take cold she persisted trying to make delay  let her said lapham  he took his wifes trembling hand under his arm and drew her to the door  hell think were crazy she murmured in her broken pride  well we are said lapham  tell him wed like to see him alone a while he said to the girl who was holding the door ajar for him and she showed him into the receptionroom which had been the protestant confessional for many burdened souls before their time coming as they did with the belief that they were bowed down with the only misery like theirs in the universe for each one of us must suffer long to himself before he can learn that he is but one in a great community of wretchedness which has been pitilessly repeating itself from the foundation of the world  they were as loath to touch their trouble when the minister came in as if it were their disgrace but lapham did so at last and with a simple dignity which he had wanted in his bungling and apologetic approaches he laid the affair clearly before the ministers compassionate and reverent eye  he spared coreys name but he did not pretend that it was not himself and his wife and their daughters who were concerned  i dont know as ive got any right to trouble you with this thing he said in the moment while sewell sat pondering the case and i dont know as ive got any warrant for doing it  but as i told my wife here there was something about youi dont know whether it was anything you said exactlythat made me feel as if you could help us i guess i didnt say so much as that to her but thats the way i felt and here we are  and if it aint all right  surely said sewell its all right  i thank you for comingfor trusting your trouble to me  a time comes to every one of us when we cant help ourselves and then we must get others to help us  if people turn to me at such a time i feel sure that i was put into the world for somethingif nothing more than to give my pity my sympathy  the brotherly words so plain so sincere had a welcome in them that these poor outcasts of sorrow could not doubt  yes said lapham huskily and his wife began to wipe the tears again under her veil  sewell remained silent and they waited till he should speak  we can be of use to one another here because we can always be wiser for some one else than we can for ourselves  we can see anothers sins and errors in a more merciful lightand that is always a fairer lightthan we can our own and we can look more sanely at others afflictions he had addressed these words to lapham now he turned to his wife  if some one had come to you mrs lapham in just this perplexity what would you have thought  i dont know as i understand you faltered mrs lapham  sewell repeated his words and added i mean what do you think some one else ought to do in your place  was there ever any poor creatures in such a strait before she asked with pathetic incredulity  theres no new trouble under the sun said the minister  oh if it was any one else i should sayi should saywhy of course i should say that their duty was to let she paused  one suffer instead of three if none is to blame suggested sewell thats sense and thats justice  its the economy of pain which naturally suggests itself and which would insist upon itself if we were not all perverted by traditions which are the figment of the shallowest sentimentality  tell me mrs lapham didnt this come into your mind when you first learned how matters stood  why yes it flashed across me  but i didnt think it could be right  and how was it with you mr lapham  why thats what i thought of course  but i didnt see my way  no cried the minister we are all blinded we are all weakened by a false ideal of selfsacrifice it wraps us round with its meshes and we cant fight our way out of it  mrs lapham what made you feel that it might be better for three to suffer than one  why she did herself  i know she would die sooner than take him away from her  i supposed so cried the minister bitterly  and yet she is a sensible girl your daughter  she has more commonsense  of course but in such a case we somehow think it must be wrong to use our commonsense i dont know where this false ideal comes from unless it comes from the novels that befool and debauch almost every intelligence in some degree  it certainly doesnt come from christianity which instantly repudiates it when confronted with it your daughter believes in spite of her commonsense that she ought to make herself and the man who loves her unhappy in order to assure the lifelong wretchedness of her sister whom he doesnt love simply because her sister saw him and fancied him first and im sorry to say that ninetynine young people out of a hundredoh nine hundred and ninetynine out of a thousandwould consider that noble and beautiful and heroic whereas you know at the bottom of your hearts that it would be foolish and cruel and revolting  you know what marriage is and what it must be without love on both sides  the minister had grown quite heated and red in the face  i lose all patience he went on vehemently  this poor child of yours has somehow been brought to believe that it will kill her sister if her sister does not have what does not belong to her and what it is not in the power of all the world or any soul in the world to give her  her sister will sufferyes keenlyin heart and in pride but she will not die  you will suffer too in your tenderness for her but you must do your duty  you must help her to give up  you would be guilty if you did less  keep clearly in mind that you are doing right and the only possible good  and god be with you    xix   he talked sense persis said lapham gently as he mounted to his wifes side in the buggy and drove slowly homeward through the dusk  yes he talked sense she admitted  but she added bitterly i guess if he had it to do oh hes right and its got to be done there aint any other way for it  its sense and yes its justice they walked to their door after they left the horse at the livery stable around the corner where lapham kept it  i want you should send irene up to our room as soon as we get in silas  why aint you going to have any supper first faltered lapham with his latchkey in the lock  no i cant lose a minute  if i do i shant do it at all  look here persis said her husband tenderly let me do this thing  oh you said his wife with a womans compassionate scorn for a mans helplessness in such a case  send her right up  and i shall feel she stopped to spare him  then she opened the door and ran up to her room without waiting to speak to irene who had come into the hall at the sound of her fathers key in the door  i guess your mother wants to see you upstairs said lapham looking away  her mother turned round and faced the girls wondering look as irene entered the chamber so close upon her that she had not yet had time to lay off her bonnet she stood with her wraps still on her arm  irene she said harshly there is something you have got to bear its a mistake weve all made  he dont care anything for you  he never did  he told pen so last night  he cares for her  the sentences had fallen like blows  but the girl had taken them without flinching  she stood up immovable but the delicate roselight of her complexion went out and left her colourless  she did not offer to speak  why dont you say something cried her mother  do you want to kill me irene  why should i want to hurt you mamma the girl replied steadily but in an alien voice  theres nothing to say  i want to see pen a minute  she turned and left the room  as she mounted the stairs that led to her own and her sisters rooms on the floor above her mother helplessly followed  irene went first to her own room at the front of the house and then came out leaving the door open and the gas flaring behind her  the mother could see that she had tumbled many things out of the drawers of her bureau upon the marble top  she passed her mother where she stood in the entry  you can come too if you want to mamma she said  she opened penelopes door without knocking and went in  penelope sat at the window as in the morning  irene did not go to her but she went and laid a gold hairpin on her bureau and said without looking at her theres a pin that i got today because it was like his sisters it wont become a dark person so well but you can have it  she stuck a scrap of paper in the side of penelopes mirror  theres that account of mr stantons ranch  youll want to read it i presume  she laid a withered boutonniere on the bureau beside the pin  theres his buttonhole bouquet  he left it by his plate and i stole it  she had a pineshaving fantastically tied up with a knot of ribbon in her hand  she held it a moment then looking deliberately at penelope she went up to her and dropped it in her lap without a word she turned and advancing a few steps tottered and seemed about to fall  her mother sprang forward with an imploring cry o rene rene rene  irene recovered herself before her mother could reach her  dont touch me she said icily  mamma im going to put on my things  i want papa to walk with me  im choking here  ii cant let you go out irene child began her mother  youve got to replied the girl  tell papa ta hurry his supper  o poor soul he doesnt want any supper  he knows it too  i dont want to talk about that  tell him to get ready  she left them once more  mrs lapham turned a hapless glance upon penelope  go and tell him mother said the girl  i would if i could  if she can walk let her  its the only thing for her she sat still she did not even brush to the floor the fantastic thing that lay in her lap and that sent up faintly the odour of the sachet powder with which irene liked to perfume her boxes  lapham went out with the unhappy child and began to talk with her crazily incoherently enough  she mercifully stopped him  dont talk papa  i dont want any one should talk with me  he obeyed and they walked silently on and on  in their aimless course they reached the new house on the water side of beacon and she made him stop and stood looking up at it  the scaffolding which had so long defaced the front was gone and in the light of the gaslamp before it all the architectural beauty of the facade was suggested and much of the finely felt detail was revealed  seymour had pretty nearly satisfied himself in that rich facade certainly lapham had not stinted him of the means  well said the girl i shall never live in it and she began to walk on  laphams sore heart went down as he lumbered heavily after her  oh yes you will irene  youll have lots of good times there yet  no she answered and said nothing more about it  they had not talked of their trouble at all and they did not speak of it now lapham understood that she was trying to walk herself weary and he was glad to hold his peace and let her have her way  she halted him once more before the red and yellow lights of an apothecarys window  isnt there something they give you to make you sleep she asked vaguely  ive got to sleep tonight  lapham trembled  i guess you dont want anything irene  yes i do get me something she retorted wilfully  if you dont i shall die  i must sleep  they went in and lapham asked for something to make a nervous person sleep  irene stood poring over the showcase full of brushes and trinkets while the apothecary put up the bromide which he guessed would be about the best thing  she did not show any emotion her face was like a stone while her fathers expressed the anguish of his sympathy  he looked as if he had not slept for a week his fat eyelids drooped over his glassy eyes and his cheeks and throat hung flaccid he started as the apothecarys cat stole smoothly up and rubbed itself against his leg and it was to him that the man said you want to take a tablespoonful of that as long as youre awake  i guess it wont take a great many to fetch you all right said lapham and paid and went out  i dont know but i shall want some of it he said with a joyless laugh  irene came closer up to him and took his arm  he laid his heavy paw on her gloved fingers  after a while she said i want you should let me go up to lapham tomorrow  to lapham why tomorrows sunday irene you cant go tomorrow  well monday then  i can live through one day here  well said the father passively  he made no pretence of asking her why she wished to go nor any attempt to dissuade her  give me that bottle she said when he opened the door at home for her and she ran up to her own room  the next morning irene came to breakfast with her mother the colonel and penelope did not appear and mrs lapham looked sleepbroken and careworn  the girl glanced at her  dont you fret about me mamma she said i shall get along she seemed herself as steady and strong as rock  i dont like to see you keeping up so irene replied her mother itll be all the worse for you when you do break  better give way a little at the start  i shant break and ive given way all im going to  im going to lapham tomorrowi want you should go with me mammaand i guess i can keep up one day here  all about it is i dont want you should say anything or look anything  and whatever i do i dont want you should try to stop me  and the first thing im going to take her breakfast up to her  dont she cried intercepting the protest on her mothers lips  i shall not let it hurt pen if i can help it shes never done a thing nor thought a thing to wrong me  i had to fly out at her last night but thats all over now and i know just what ive got to bear  she had her way unmolested  she carried penelopes breakfast to her and omitted no care or attention that could make the sacrifice complete with an heroic pretence that she was performing no unusual service  they did not speak beyond her saying in a clear dry note heres your breakfast pen and her sisters answering hoarsely and tremulously oh thank you irene and though two or three times they turned their faces toward each other while irene remained in the room mechanically putting its confusion to rights their eyes did not meet  then irene descended upon the other rooms which she set in order and some of which she fiercely swept and dusted  she made the beds and she sent the two servants away to church as soon as they had eaten their breakfast telling them that she would wash their dishes throughout the morning her father and mother heard her about the work of getting dinner with certain silences which represented the moments when she stopped and stood stockstill and then readjusting her burden forced herself forward under it again  they sat alone in the family room out of which their two girls seemed to have died  lapham could not read his sunday papers and she had no heart to go to church as she would have done earlier in life when in trouble  just then she was obscurely feeling that the church was somehow to blame for that counsel of mr sewells on which they had acted  i should like to know she said having brought the matter up whether he would have thought it was such a light matter if it had been his own children  do you suppose hed have been so ready to act on his own advice if it had been  he told us the right thing to do persisthe only thing  we couldnt let it go on urged her husband gently  well it makes me despise pen irenes showing twice the character that she is this very minute  the mother said this so that the father might defend her daughter to her  he did not fail  irenes got the easiest part the way i look at it  and youll see that penll know how to behave when the time comes  what do you want she should do  i havent got so far as that yet  what are we going to do about irene  what do you want pen should do repeated mrs lapham when it comes to it  well i dont want she should take him for one thing said lapham  this seemed to satisfy mrs lapham as to her husband and she said in defence of corey why i dont see what hes done  its all been our doing  never mind that now  what about irene  she says shes going to lapham tomorrow she feels that shes got to get away somewhere  its natural she should  yes and i presume it will be about the best thing for her  shall you go with her  yes  well he comfortlessly took up a newspaper again and she rose with a sigh and went to her room to pack some things for the morrows journey  after dinner when irene had cleared away the last trace of it in kitchen and diningroom with unsparing punctilio she came downstairs dressed to go out and bade her father come to walk with her again  it was a repetition of the aimlessness of the last nights wanderings they came back and she got tea for them and after that they heard her stirring about in her own room as if she were busy about many things but they did not dare to look in upon her even after all the noises had ceased and they knew she had gone to bed  yes its a thing shes got to fight out by herself said mrs lapham  i guess shell get along said lapham  but i dont want you should misjudge pen either  shes all right too  she aint to blame  yes i know  but i cant work round to it all at once  i shant misjudge her but you cant expect me to get over it right away  mamma said irene when she was hurrying their departure the next morning what did she tell him when he asked her  tell him echoed the mother and after a while she added she didnt tell him anything  did she say anything about me  she said he mustnt come here any more  irene turned and went into her sisters room  goodbye pen she said kissing her with an effect of not seeing or touching her  i want you should tell him all about it  if hes half a man he wont give up till he knows why you wont have him and he has a right to know  it wouldnt make any difference  i couldnt have him after  thats for you to say  but if you dont tell him about me i will  rene yes you neednt say i cared for him  but you can say that you all thought hecared forme  o irene  dont irene escaped from the arms that tried to cast themselves about her  you are all right pen  you havent done anything youve helped me all you could  but i cantyet  she went out of the room and summoned mrs lapham with a sharp now mamma and went on putting the last things into her trunks  the colonel went to the station with them and put them on the train he got them a little compartment to themselves in the pullman car and as he stood leaning with his lifted hands against the sides of the doorway he tried to say something consoling and hopeful i guess youll have an easy ride irene  i dont believe itll be dusty any after the rain last night  dont you stay till the train starts papa returned the girl in rigid rejection of his futilities  get off now  well if you want i should he said glad to be able to please her in anything  he remained on the platform till the cars started  he saw irene bustling about in the compartment making her mother comfortable for the journey but mrs lapham did not lift her head  the train moved off and he went heavily back to his business  from time to time during the day when he caught a glimpse of him corey tried to make out from his face whether he knew what had taken place between him and penelope  when rogers came in about time of closing and shut himself up with lapham in his room the young man remained till the two came out together and parted in their salutationless fashion  lapham showed no surprise at seeing corey still there and merely answered well when the young man said that he wished to speak with him and led the way back to his room  corey shut the door behind them  i only wish to speak to you in case you know of the matter already for otherwise im bound by a promise  i guess i know what you mean  its about penelope  yes its about miss lapham  i am greatly attached to heryoull excuse my saying it i couldnt excuse myself if i were not  perfectly excusable said lapham  its all right  oh im glad to hear you say that cried the young fellow joyfully i want you to believe that this isnt a new thing or an unconsidered thing with methough it seemed so unexpected to her  lapham fetched a deep sigh  its all right as far as im concernedor her mother  weve both liked you firstrate  yes  but there seems to be something in penelopes mindi dont know the colonel consciously dropped his eyes  she referred to somethingi couldnt make out whatbut i hopedi hopedthat with your leave i might overcome itthe barrierwhatever it was  miss laphampenelopegave me the hopethat i waswasntindifferent to her  yes i guess thats so said lapham  he suddenly lifted his head and confronted the young fellows honest face with his own face so different in its honesty  sure you never made up to any one else at the same time  never who could imagine such a thing if thats all i can easily  i dont say thats all nor that thats it  i dont want you should go upon that idea  i just thought may beyou hadnt thought of it  no i certainly hadnt thought of it such a thing would have been so impossible to me that i couldnt have thought of it and its so shocking to me now that i dont know what to say to it  well dont take it too much to heart said lapham alarmed at the feeling he had excited i dont say she thought so  i was trying to guesstrying to  if there is anything i can say or do to convince you  oh it aint necessary to say anything  im all right  but miss lapham i may see her again i may try to convince her that  he stopped in distress and lapham afterwards told his wife that he kept seeing the face of irene as it looked when he parted with her in the car and whenever he was going to say yes he could not open his lips  at the same time he could not help feeling that penelope had a right to what was her own and sewells words came back to him besides they had already put irene to the worst suffering  lapham compromised as he imagined  you can come round tonight and see me if you want to he said and he bore grimly the gratitude that the young man poured out upon him  penelope came down to supper and took her mothers place at the head of the table  lapham sat silent in her presence as long as he could bear it  then he asked how do you feel tonight pen  oh like a thief said the girl  a thief that hasnt been arrested yet  lapham waited a while before he said well now your mother and i want you should hold up on that a while  it isnt for you to say  its something i cant hold up on  yes i guess you can  if i know whats happened then whats happened is a thing that nobody is to blame for  and we want you should make the best of it and not the worst  heigh it aint going to help irene any for you to hurt yourselfor anybody else and i dont want you should take up with any such crazy notion  as far as heard from you havent stolen anything and whatever youve got belongs to you  has he been speaking to you father  your mothers been speaking to me  has he been speaking to you  thats neither here nor there  then hes broken his word and i will never speak to him again  if he was any such fool as to promise that he wouldnt talk to me on a subjectlapham drew a deep breath and then made the plungethat i brought up  did you bring it up  the same as brought upthe quicker he broke his word the better and i want you should act upon that idea  recollect that its my business and your mothers business as well as yours and were going to have our say  he haint done anything wrong pen nor anything that hes going to be punished for  understand that  hes got to have a reason if youre not going to have him  i dont say youve got to have him i want you should feel perfectly free about that but i do say youve got to give him a reason  is he coming here  i dont know as youd call it coming  yes you do father said the girl in forlorn amusement at his shuffling  hes coming here to see me  whens he coming  i dont know but hes coming tonight  and you want i should see him  i dont know but youd better  all right  ill see him  lapham drew a long deep breath of suspicion inspired by this acquiescence  what you going to do he asked presently  i dont know yet answered the girl sadly  it depends a good deal upon what he does  well said lapham with the hungriness of unsatisfied anxiety in his tone  when coreys card was brought into the familyroom where he and penelope were sitting he went into the parlour to find him  i guess penelope wants to see you he said and indicating the familyroom he added shes in there and did not go back himself  corey made his way to the girls presence with open trepidation which was not allayed by her silence and languor  she sat in the chair where she had sat the other night but she was not playing with a fan now  he came toward her and then stood faltering  a faint smile quivered over her face at the spectacle of his subjection  sit down mr corey she said  theres no reason why we shouldnt talk it over quietly for i know you will think im right  im sure of that he answered hopefully  when i saw that your father knew of it today i asked him to let me see you again  im afraid that i broke my promise to youtechnically  it had to be broken he took more courage at her words  but ive only come to do whatever you say and not to be anannoyance to you  yes you have to know but i couldnt tell you before  now they all think i should  a tremor of anxiety passed over the young mans face on which she kept her eyes steadily fixed  we supposed itit wasirene  he remained blank a moment and then he said with a smile of relief of deprecation of protest of amazement of compassion  oh never never for an instant how could you think such a thing it was impossible i never thought of her  but i seei see i can explainno theres nothing to explain i have never knowingly done or said a thing from first to last to make you think that  i see how terrible it is he said but he still smiled as if he could not take it seriously  i admired her beautywho could help doing thatand i thought her very good and sensible  why last winter in texas i told stanton about our meeting in canada and we agreedi only tell you to show you how far i always was from what you thoughtthat he must come north and try to see her andandof course it all sounds very sillyand he sent her a newspaper with an account of his ranch in it  she thought it came from you  oh good heavens he didnt tell me till after hed done it  but he did it for a part of our foolish joke  and when i met your sister again i only admired her as before  i can see now how i must have seemed to be seeking her out but it was to talk of you with heri never talked of anything else if i could help it except when i changed the subject because i was ashamed to be always talking of you  i see how distressing it is for all of you  but tell me that you believe me  yes i must  its all been our mistake  it has indeed but theres no mistake about my loving you penelope he said and the oldfashioned name at which she had often mocked was sweet to her from his lips  that only makes it worse she answered  oh no he gently protested  it makes it better  it makes it right how is it worse how is it wrong  cant you see you must understand all now dont you see that if she believed so too and if she she could not go on  did shedid your sisterthink that too gasped corey  she used to talk with me about you and when you say you care for me now it makes me feel like the vilest hypocrite in the world  that day you gave her the list of books and she came down to nantasket and went on about you i helped her to flatter herselfoh i dont see how she can forgive me  but she knows i can never forgive myself thats the reason she can do it  i can see now she went on how i must have been trying to get you from her  i cant endure it the only way is for me never to see you or speak to you again she laughed forlornly  that would be pretty hard on you if you cared  i do careall the world  well then it would if you were going to keep on caring  you wont long if you stop coming now  is this all then is it the end  itswhatever it is  i cant get over the thought of her  once i thought i could but now i see that i cant it seems to grow worse sometimes i feel as if it would drive me crazy  he sat looking at her with lacklustre eyes  the light suddenly came back into them  do you think i could love you if you had been false to her i know you have been true to her and truer still to yourself i never tried to see her except with the hope of seeing you too  i supposed she must know that i was in love with you  from the first time i saw you there that afternoon you filled my fancy  do you think i was flirting with the child orno you dont think that we have not done wrong  we have not harmed any one knowingly  we have a right to each other  no no you must never speak to me of this again  if you do i shall know that you despise me  but how will that help her i dont love her  dont say that to me i have said that to myself too much  if you forbid me to love you it wont make me love her he persisted  she was about to speak but she caught her breath without doing so and merely stared at him  i must do what you say he continued  but what good will it do her you cant make her happy by making yourself unhappy  do you ask me to profit by a wrong  not for the world  but there is no wrong  there is somethingi dont know what  theres a wall between us  i shall dash myself against it as long as i live but that wont break it  oh he groaned  we have done no wrong  why should we suffer from anothers mistake as if it were our sin  i dont know  but we must suffer  well then i will not for my part and i will not let you  if you care for me  you had no right to know it  you make it my privilege to keep you from doing wrong for the rights sake  im sorry with all my heart and soul for this error but i cant blame myself and i wont deny myself the happiness i havent done anything to forfeit  i will never give you up  i will wait as long as you please for the time when you shall feel free from this mistake but you shall be mine at last  remember that  i might go away for monthsa year even but that seems a cowardly and guilty thing and im not afraid and im not guilty and im going to stay here and try to see you  she shook her head  it wont change anything dont you see that theres no hope for us  when is she coming back he asked  i dont know  mother wants father to come and take her out west for a while  shes up there in the country with your mother yet  yes  he was silent then he said desperately  penelope she is very young and perhapsperhaps she might meet  it would make no difference  it wouldnt change it for me  you are cruelcruel to yourself if you love me and cruel to me dont you remember that nightbefore i spokeyou were talking of that book and you said it was foolish and wicked to do as that girl did why is it different with you except that you give me nothing and can never give me anything when you take yourself away  if it were anybody else i am sure you would say  but it isnt anybody else and that makes it impossible  sometimes i think it might be if i would only say so to myself and then all that i said to her about you comes up  i will wait  it cant always come up  i wont urge you any longer now  but you will see it differentlymore clearly  goodbyeno good night i shall come again tomorrow it will surely come right and whatever happens you have done no wrong  try to keep that in mind  i am so happy in spite of all  he tried to take her hand but she put it behind her  no no i cant let youyet    xx   after a week mrs lapham returned leaving irene alone at the old homestead in vermont  shes comfortable thereas comfortable as she can be anywheres i guess she said to her husband as they drove together from the station where he had met her in obedience to her telegraphic summons  she keeps herself busy helping about the house and she goes round amongst the hands in their houses  theres sickness and you know how helpful she is where theres sickness  she dont complain any  i dont know as ive heard a word out of her mouth since we left home but im afraid itll wear on her silas  you dont look over and above well yourself persis said her husband kindly  oh dont talk about me  what i want to know is whether you cant get the time to run off with her somewhere  i wrote to you about dubuque shell work herself down im afraid and then i dont know as shell be over it  but if she could go off and be amusedsee new people  i could make the time said lapham if i had to  but as it happens ive got to go out west on businessill tell you about itand ill take irene along  good said his wife  thats about the best thing ive heard yet where you going  out dubuque way  anything the matter with bills folks  no its business  hows pen  i guess she aint much better than irene  he been about any  yes but i cant see as it helps matters much  tchk mrs lapham fell back against the carriage cushions  i declare to see her willing to take the man that we all thought wanted her sister i cant make it seem right  its right said lapham stoutly but i guess she aint willing i wish she was  but there dont seem to be any way out of the thing anywhere  its a perfect snarl  but i dont want you should be anyways hash with pen  mrs lapham answered nothing but when she met penelope she gave the girls wan face a sharp look and began to whimper on her neck  penelopes tears were all spent  well mother she said you come back almost as cheerful as you went away  i neednt ask if renes in good spirits  we all seem to be overflowing with them  i suppose this is one way of congratulating me  mrs corey hasnt been round to do it yet  are youare you engaged to him pen gasped her mother  judging by my feelings i should say not  i feel as if it was a last will and testament  but youd better ask him when he comes  i cant bear to look at him  i guess hes used to that  he dont seem to expect to be looked at well were all just where we started  i wonder how long it will keep up  mrs lapham reported to her husband when he came home at nighthe had left his business to go and meet her and then after a desolate dinner at the house had returned to the office againthat penelope was fully as bad as irene  and she dont know how to work it off  irene keeps doing but pen just sits in her room and mopes  she dont even read i went up this afternoon to scold her about the state the house was inyou can see that irenes away by the perfect mess but when i saw her through the crack of the door i hadnt the heart  she sat there with her hands in her lap just staring  and my goodness she jumped so when she saw me and then she fell back and began to laugh and said she i thought it was my ghost mother i felt as if i should give way  lapham listened jadedly and answered far from the point  i guess ive got to start out there pretty soon persis  how soon  well tomorrow morning  mrs lapham sat silent  then all right she said  ill get you ready  i shall run up to lapham for irene and then ill push on through canada  i can get there about as quick  is it anything you can tell me about silas  yes said lapham  but its a long story and i guess youve got your hands pretty full as it is  ive been throwing good money after badthe usual wayand now ive got to see if i can save the pieces  after a moment mrs lapham asked is itrogers  its rogers  i didnt want you should get in any deeper with him  no you didnt want i should press him either and i had to do one or the other  and so i got in deeper  silas said his wife im afraid i made you  its all right persis as far forth as that goes  i was glad to make it up with himi jumped at the chance  i guess rogers saw that he had a soft thing in me and hes worked it for all it was worth  but itll all come out right in the end  lapham said this as if he did not care to talk any more about it  he added casually pretty near everybody but the fellows that owe me seem to expect me to do a cash business all of a sudden  do you mean that youve got payments to make and that people are not paying you  lapham winced a little  something like that he said and he lighted a cigar  but when i tell you its all right i mean it persis  i aint going to let the grass grow under my feet thoughespecially while rogers digs the ground away from the roots  what are you going to do  if it has to come to that im going to squeeze him laphams countenance lighted up with greater joy than had yet visited it since the day they had driven out to brookline  milton k rogers is a rascal if you want to know or else all the signs fail  but i guess hell find hes got his comeuppance lapham shut his lips so that the short reddishgrey beard stuck straight out on them  whats he done  whats he done well now ill tell you what hes done persis since you think rogers is such a saint and that i used him so badly in getting him out of the business  hes been dabbling in every sort of fool thing you can lay your tongue towildcat stocks patentrights land speculations oil claimstill hes run through about everything but he did have a big milling property out on the line of the p y  xsawmills and gristmills and landsand for the last eight years hes been doing a landoffice business with embusiness that would have made anybody else rich  but you cant make milton k rogers rich any more than you can fat a hidebound colt  it aint in him  hed run through vanderbilt jay gould and tom scott rolled into one in less than six months give him a chance and come out and want to borrow money of you  well he wont borrow any more money of me and if he thinks i dont know as much about that milling property as he does hes mistaken  ive taken his mills but i guess ive got the inside track bills kept me posted and now im going out there to see how i can unload and i shant mind a great deal if rogers is under the load when its off once  i dont understand you silas  why its just this  the great lacustrine  polar railroad has leased the p y  x for ninetynine yearsbought it practicallyand its going to build carworks right by those mills and it may want them  and milton k rogers knew it when he turned em in on me  well if the road wants them dont that make the mills valuable you can get what you ask for them  can i the p y  x is the only road that runs within fifty miles of the mills and you cant get a foot of lumber nor a pound of flour to market any other way  as long as he had a little local road like the p y  x to deal with rogers could manage but when it come to a big through line like the g l  p he couldnt stand any chance at all if such a road as that took a fancy to his mills do you think it would pay what he asked no sir he would take what the road offered or else the road would tell him to carry his flour and lumber to market himself  and do you suppose he knew the g l  p wanted the mills when he turned them in on you asked mrs lapham aghast and falling helplessly into his alphabetical parlance  the colonel laughed scoffingly  well when milton k rogers dont know which side his breads buttered on i dont understand he added thoughtfully how hes always letting it fall on the buttered side but such a man as that is sure to have a screw loose in him somewhere mrs lapham sat discomfited  all that she could say was well i want you should ask yourself whether rogers would ever have gone wrong or got into these ways of his if it hadnt been for your forcing him out of the business when you did  i want you should think whether youre not responsible for everything hes done since  you go and get that bag of mine ready said lapham sullenly  i guess i can take care of myself  and milton k rogers too he added   that evening corey spent the time after dinner in his own room with restless excursions to the library where his mother sat with his father and sisters and showed no signs of leaving them  at last in coming down he encountered her on the stairs going up  they both stopped consciously  i would like to speak with you mother  i have been waiting to see you alone  come to my room she said  i have a feeling that you know what i want to say he began there  she looked up at him where he stood by the chimneypiece and tried to put a cheerful note into her questioning yes  yes and i have a feeling that you wont like itthat you wont approve of it  i wish you didi wish you could  im used to liking and approving everything you do tom  if i dont like this at once i shall try to like ityou know thatfor your sake whatever it is  id better be short he said with a quick sigh  its about miss lapham he hastened to add i hope it isnt surprising to you  id have told you before if i could  no it isnt surprising  i was afraidi suspected something of the kind  they were both silent in a painful silence  well mother he asked at last  if its something youve quite made up mind to  it is  and if youve already spoken to her  i had to do that first of course  there would be no use of my saying anything even if i disliked it  you do dislike it  nono i cant say that  of course i should have preferred it if you had chosen some nice girl among those that you had been brought up withsome friend or associate of your sisters whose people we had known  yes i understand that and i can assure you that i havent been indifferent to your feelings  i have tried to consider them from the first and it kept me hesitating in a way that im ashamed to think of for it wasnt quite right towardsothers but your feelings and my sisters have been in my mind and if i couldnt yield to what i supposed they must be entirely  even so good a son and brother as this when it came to his love affair appeared to think that he had yielded much in considering the feelings of his family at all  his mother hastened to comfort him  i knowi know  ive seen for some time that this might happen tom and i have prepared myself for it  i have talked it over with your father and we both agreed from the beginning that you were not to be hampered by our feeling stillit is a surprise  it must be  i know it  i can understand your feeling  but im sure that its one that will last only while you dont know her well  oh im sure of that tom  im sure that we shall all be fond of herfor your sake at first evenand i hope shell like us  i am quite certain of that said corey with that confidence which experience does not always confirm in such cases  and your taking it as you do lifts a tremendous load off me  but he sighed so heavily and looked so troubled that his mother said well now you mustnt think of that any more  we wish what is for your happiness my son and we will gladly reconcile ourselves to anything that might have been disagreeable  i suppose we neednt speak of the family  we must both think alike about them  they have theirdrawbacks but they are thoroughly good people and i satisfied myself the other night that they were not to be dreaded she rose and put her arm round his neck  and i wish you joy tom if shes half as good as you are you will both be very happy she was going to kiss him but something in his looks stopped heran absence a trouble which broke out in his words  i must tell you mother theres been a complicationa mistakethats a blight on me yet and that it sometimes seems as if we couldnt escape from  i wonder if you can help us they all thought i meantthe other sister  o tom but how could they  i dont know  it seemed so glaringly plaini was ashamed of making it so outright from the beginning  but they did  even she did herself  but where could they have thought your eyes wereyour taste it wouldnt be surprising if any one were taken with that wonderful beauty and im sure shes good too  but im astonished at them to think you could prefer that little black odd creature with her joking and  mother cried the young man turning a ghastly face of warning upon her  what do you mean tom  did youdiddid you think so toothat it was irene i meant  why of course  he stared at her hopelessly  o my son she said for all comment on the situation  dont reproach me mother i couldnt stand it  no i didnt mean to do that  but howhow could it happen  i dont know  when she first told me that they had understood it so i laughedalmostit was so far from me  but now when you seem to have had the same ideadid you all think so  yes  they remained looking at each other  then mrs corey began it did pass through my mind oncethat day i went to call upon themthat it might not be as we thought but i knew so little ofof  penelope corey mechanically supplied  is that her namei forgotthat i only thought of you in relation to her long enough to reject the idea and it was natural after our seeing something of the other one last year that i might suppose you had formed someattachment  yes thats what they thought too  but i never thought of her as anything but a pretty child  i was civil to her because you wished it and when i met her here again i only tried to see her so that i could talk with her about her sister  you neednt defend yourself to me tom said his mother proud to say it to him in his trouble  its a terrible business for them poor things she added  i dont know how they could get over it  but of course sensible people must see  they havent got over it  at least she hasnt since its happened theres been nothing that hasnt made me prouder and fonder of her at first i was charmed with hermy fancy was taken she delighted mei dont know how but she was simply the most fascinating person i ever saw  now i never think of that  i only think how good she ishow patient she is with me and how unsparing she is of herself  if she were concerned aloneif i were not concerned tooit would soon end shes never had a thought for anything but her sisters feeling and mine from the beginning  i go therei know that i oughtnt but i cant help itand she suffers it and tries not to let me see that she is suffering it  there never was any one like herso brave so true so noble  i wont give her upi cant but it breaks my heart when she accuses herself of what was all my doing  we spend our time trying to reason out of it but we always come back to it at last and i have to hear her morbidly blaming herself  oh  doubtless mrs corey imagined some reliefs to this suffering some qualifications of this sublimity in a girl she had disliked so distinctly but she saw none in her sons behaviour and she gave him her further sympathy  she tried to praise penelope and said that it was not to be expected that she could reconcile herself at once to everything  i shouldnt have liked it in her if she had  but time will bring it all right  and if she really cares for you  i extorted that from her  well then you must look at it in the best light you can  there is no blame anywhere and the mortification and pain is something that must be lived down  thats all  and dont let what i said grieve you tom  you know i scarcely knew her and ii shall be sure to like any one you like after all  yes i know said the young man drearily  will you tell father  if you wish  he must know  and i couldnt stand any more of this just yetany more mistake  i will tell him said mrs corey and it was naturally the next thing for a woman who dwelt so much on decencies to propose we must go to call on heryour sisters and i they have never seen her even and she mustnt be allowed to think were indifferent to her especially under the circumstances  oh no dont gonot yet cried corey with an instinctive perception that nothing could be worse for him  we must waitwe must be patient  im afraid it would be painful to her now  he turned away without speaking further and his mothers eyes followed him wistfully to the door  there were some questions that she would have liked to ask him but she had to content herself with trying to answer them when her husband put them to her  there was this comfort for her always in bromfield corey that he never was much surprised at anything however shocking or painful  his standpoint in regard to most matters was that of the sympathetic humorist who would be glad to have the victim of circumstance laugh with him but was not too much vexed when the victim could not  he laughed now when his wife with careful preparation got the facts of his sons predicament fully under his eye  really bromfield she said i dont see how you can laugh  do you see any way out of it  it seems to me that the way has been found already  tom has told his love to the right one and the wrong one knows it  time will do the rest  if i had so low an opinion of them all as that it would make me very unhappy  its shocking to think of it  it is upon the theory of ladies and all young people said her husband with a shrug feeling his way to the matches on the mantel and then dropping them with a sign as if recollecting that he must not smoke there  ive no doubt tom feels himself an awful sinner  but apparently hes resigned to his sin he isnt going to give her up  im glad to say for the sake of human nature that she isnt resignedlittle as i like her cried mrs corey  her husband shrugged again  oh there mustnt be any indecent haste she will instinctively observe the proprieties  but come now anna you mustnt pretend to me here in the sanctuary of home that practically the human affections dont reconcile themselves to any situation that the human sentiments condemn  suppose the wrong sister had died would the right one have had any scruple in marrying tom after they had both waited a proper time as the phrase is  bromfield youre shocking  not more shocking than reality  you may regard this as a second marriage he looked at her with twinkling eyes full of the triumph the spectator of his species feels in signal exhibitions of human nature  depend upon it the right sister will be reconciled the wrong one will be consoled and all will go merry as a marriage bella second marriage bell  why its quite like a romance here he laughed outright again  well sighed the wife i could almost wish the right one as you call her would reject tom i dislike her so much  ah now youre talking business anna said her husband with his hands spread behind the back he turned comfortably to the fire  the whole lapham tribe is distasteful to me  as i dont happen to have seen our daughterinlaw elect i have still the hopewhich youre disposed to forbid methat she may not be quite so unacceptable as the others  do you really feel so bromfield anxiously inquired his wife  yesi think i do and he sat down and stretched out his long legs toward the fire  but its very inconsistent of you to oppose the matter now when youve shown so much indifference up to this time  youve told me all along that it was of no use to oppose it  so i have  i was convinced of that at the beginning or my reason was  you know very well that i am equal to any trial any sacrifice day after tomorrow but when it comes today its another thing  as long as this crisis decently kept its distance i could look at it with an impartial eye but now that it seems at hand i find that while my reason is still acquiescent my nerves are disposed toexcuse the phrasekick i ask myself what have i done nothing for all my life and lived as a gentleman should upon the earnings of somebody else in the possession of every polite taste and feeling that adorns leisure if im to come to this at last and i find no satisfactory answer  i say to myself that i might as well have yielded to the pressure all round me and gone to work as tom has  mrs corey looked at him forlornly divining the core of real repugnance that existed in his selfsatire  i assure you my dear he continued that the recollection of what i suffered from the laphams at that dinner of yours is an anguish still it wasnt their behaviourthey behaved well enoughor ill enough but their conversation was terrible  mrs laphams range was strictly domestic and when the colonel got me in the library he poured mineral paint all over me till i could have been safely warranted not to crack or scale in any climate  i suppose we shall have to see a good deal of them  they will probably come here every sunday night to tea  its a perspective without a vanishingpoint  it may not be so bad after all said his wife and she suggested for his consolation that he knew very little about the laphams yet  he assented to the fact  i know very little about them and about my other fellowbeings i dare say that i should like the laphams better if i knew them better  but in any case i resign myself  and we must keep in view the fact that this is mainly toms affair and if his affections have regulated it to his satisfaction we must be content  oh yes sighed mrs corey  and perhaps it wont turn out so badly its a great comfort to know that you feel just as i do about it  i do said her husband and more too  it was she and her daughters who would be chiefly annoyed by the lapham connection she knew that  but she had to begin to bear the burden by helping her husband to bear his light share of it  to see him so depressed dismayed her and she might well have reproached him more sharply than she did for showing so much indifference when she was so anxious at first  but that would not have served any good end now she even answered him patiently when he asked her what did you say to tom when he told you it was the other one  what could i say i could do nothing but try to take back what i had said against her  yes you had quite enough to do i suppose  its an awkward business if it had been the pretty one her beauty would have been our excuse but the plain onewhat do you suppose attracted him in her  mrs corey sighed at the futility of the question  perhaps i did her injustice  i only saw her a few moments  perhaps i got a false impression  i dont think shes lacking in sense and thats a great thing  shell be quick to see that we dont mean unkindness and cant by anything we say or do when shes toms wife she pronounced the distasteful word with courage and went on the pretty one might not have been able to see that  she might have got it into her head that we were looking down on her and those insipid people are terribly stubborn  we can come to some understanding with this one im sure of that she ended by declaring that it was now their duty to help tom out of his terrible predicament  oh even the lapham cloud has a silver lining said corey  in fact it seems really to have all turned out for the best anna though its rather curious to find you the champion of the lapham side at last confess now that the right girl has secretly been your choice all along and that while you sympathise with the wrong one you rejoice in the tenacity with which the right one is clinging to her own he added with final seriousness its just that she should and so far as i understand the case i respect her for it  oh yes sighed mrs corey  its natural and its right but she added i suppose theyre glad of him on any terms  that is what i have been taught to believe said her husband  when shall we see our daughterinlaw elect i find myself rather impatient to have that part of it over  mrs corey hesitated  tom thinks we had better not call just yet  she has told him of your terrible behaviour when you called before  no bromfield she couldnt be so vulgar as that  but anything short of it    xxi   lapham was gone a fortnight  he was in a sullen humour when he came back and kept himself shut close within his own den at the office the first day  he entered it in the morning without a word to his clerks as he passed through the outer room and he made no sign throughout the forenoon except to strike savagely on his deskbell from time to time and send out to walker for some book of accounts or a letterfile his boy confidentially reported to walker that the old man seemed to have got a lot of papers round and at lunch the bookkeeper said to corey at the little table which they had taken in a corner together in default of seats at the counter well sir i guess theres a cold wave coming  corey looked up innocently and said i havent read the weather report  yes sir walker continued its coming  areas of rain along the whole coast and increased pressure in the region of the private office  stormsignals up at the old mans door now  corey perceived that he was speaking figuratively and that his meteorology was entirely personal to lapham  what do you mean he asked without vivid interest in the allegory his mind being full of his own tragicomedy  why just this i guess the old mans takin in sail  and i guess hes got to  as i told you the first time we talked about him there dont any one know onequarter as much about the old mans business as the old man does himself and i aint betraying any confidence when i say that i guess that old partner of his has got pretty deep into his books  i guess hes over head and ears in em and the old mans gone in after him and hes got a drownin mans grip round his neck  there seems to be a kind of a lullkind of a dead calm i call itin the paint market just now and then again a tenhundredthousanddollar man dont build a hundredthousanddollar house without feeling the drain unless theres a regular boom  and just now there aint any boom at all  oh i dont say but what the old mans got anchors to windward guess he has but if hes goin to leave me his money i wish hed left it six weeks ago  yes sir i guess theres a cold wave comin but you cant generally most always tell as a usual thing where the old mans concerned and its only a guess walker began to feed in his breaded chop with the same nervous excitement with which he abandoned himself to the slangy and figurative excesses of his talks  corey had listened with a miserable curiosity and compassion up to a certain moment when a broad light of hope flashed upon him  it came from laphams potential ruin and the way out of the labyrinth that had hitherto seemed so hopeless was clear enough if anothers disaster would befriend him and give him the opportunity to prove the unselfishness of his constancy  he thought of the sum of money that was his own and that he might offer to lend or practically give if the time came and with his crude hopes and purposes formlessly exulting in his heart he kept on listening with an unchanged countenance  walker could not rest till he had developed the whole situation so far as he knew it  look at the stock weve got on hand  theres going to be an awful shrinkage on that now and when everybody is shutting down or running halftime the works up at lapham are going full chip just the same as ever  well its his pride  i dont say but what its a good sort of pride but he likes to make his brags that the fires never been out in the works since they started and that no mans work or wages has ever been cut down yet at lapham it dont matter what the times are  of course explained walker i shouldnt talk so to everybody dont know as i should talk so to anybody but you mr corey  of course assented corey  little off your feed today said walker glancing at coreys plate  i got up with a headache  well sir if youre like me youll carry it round all day then  i dont know a much meaner thing than a headacheunless its earache or toothache or some other kind of ache im pretty hard to suit when it comes to diseases  notice how yellow the old man looked when he came in this morning i dont like to see a man of his build look yellowmuch about the middle of the afternoon the dustcoloured face of rogers now familiar to laphams clerks showed itself among them has colonel lapham returned yet he asked in his dry wooden tones of laphams boy  yes hes in his office said the boy and as rogers advanced he rose and added i dont know as you can see him today his orders are not to let anybody in  oh indeed said rogers i think he will see me and he pressed forward  well ill have to ask returned the boy and hastily preceding rogers he put his head in at laphams door and then withdrew it please to sit down he said hell see you pretty soon and with an air of some surprise rogers obeyed  his sere dullbrown whiskers and the moustache closing over both lips were incongruously and illogically clerical in effect and the effect was heightened for no reason by the parchment texture of his skin the baldness extending to the crown of his head was like a baldness made up for the stage  what his face expressed chiefly was a bland and beneficent caution  here you must have said to yourself is a man of just sober and prudent views fixed purposes and the good citizenship that avoids debt and hazard of every kind  what do you want asked lapham wheeling round in his swivelchair as rogers entered his room and pushing the door shut with his foot without rising  rogers took the chair that was not offered him and sat with his hatbrim on his knees and its crown pointed towards lapham  i want to know what you are going to do he answered with sufficient selfpossession  ill tell you first what ive done said lapham  ive been to dubuque and ive found out all about that milling property you turned in on me  did you know that the g l  p had leased the p y  x  i some suspected that it might  did you know it when you turned the property in on me  did you know that the g l  p wanted to buy the mills  i presumed the road would give a fair price for them said rogers winking his eyes in outward expression of inwardly blinking the point  you lie said lapham as quietly as if correcting him in a slight error and rogers took the word with equal sang froid  you knew the road wouldnt give a fair price for the mills  you knew it would give what it chose and that i couldnt help myself when you let me take them  youre a thief milton k rogers and you stole money i lent you rogers sat listening as if respectfully considering the statements  you knew how i felt about that old matteror my wife did and that i wanted to make it up to you if you felt anyway badly used  and you took advantage of it  youve got money out of me in the first place on securities that want worth thirtyfive cents on the dollar and youve let me in for this thing and that thing and youve bled me every time  and all ive got to show for it is a milling property on a line of road that can squeeze me whenever it wants to as dry as it pleases  and you want to know what im going to do im going to squeeze you  im going to sell these collaterals of yourshe touched a bundle of papers among others that littered his deskand im going to let the mills go for what theyll fetch  i aint going to fight the g l  p  lapham wheeled about in his chair and turned his burly back on his visitor who sat wholly unmoved  there are some parties he began with a dry tranquillity ignoring laphams words as if they had been an outburst against some third person who probably merited them but in whom he was so little interested that he had been obliged to use patience in listening to his condemnationthere are some english parties who have been making inquiries in regard to those mills  i guess youre lying rogers said lapham without looking round  well all that i have to ask is that you will not act hastily  i see you dont think im in earnest cried lapham facing fiercely about  you think im fooling do you he struck his bell and william he ordered the boy who answered it and who stood waiting while he dashed off a note to the brokers and enclosed it with the bundle of securities in a large envelope take these down to gallop  paddocks in state street right away  now go he said to rogers when the boy had closed the door after him and he turned once more to his desk  rogers rose from his chair and stood with his hat in his hand  he was not merely dispassionate in his attitude and expression he was impartial  he wore the air of a man who was ready to return to business whenever the wayward mood of his interlocutor permitted then i understand he said that you will take no action in regard to the mills till i have seen the parties i speak of  lapham faced about once more and sat looking up into the visage of rogers in silence  i wonder what youre up to he said at last i should like to know but as rogers made no sign of gratifying his curiosity and treated this last remark of laphams as of the irrelevance of all the rest he said frowning you bring me a party that will give me enough for those mills to clear me of you and ill talk to you  but dont you come here with any man of straw  and ill give you just twentyfour hours to prove yourself a swindler again  once more lapham turned his back and rogers after looking thoughtfully into his hat a moment cleared his throat and quietly withdrew maintaining to the last his unprejudiced demeanour  lapham was not again heard from as walker phrased it during the afternoon except when the last mail was taken in to him then the sound of rending envelopes mixed with that of what seemed suppressed swearing penetrated to the outer office  somewhat earlier than the usual hour for closing he appeared there with his hat on and his overcoat buttoned about him  he said briefly to his boy william i shant be back again this afternoon and then went to miss dewey and left a number of letters on her table to be copied and went out nothing had been said but a sense of trouble subtly diffused itself through those who saw him go out  that evening as he sat down with his wife alone at tea he asked aint pen coming to supper  no she aint said his wife  i dont know as i like the way shes going on any too well  im afraid if she keeps on shell be down sick  shes got deeper feelings than irene  lapham said nothing but having helped himself to the abundance of his table in his usual fashion he sat and looked at his plate with an indifference that did not escape the notice of his wife  whats the matter with you she asked  nothing i havent got any appetite  whats the matter she persisted  troubles the matter bad luck and lots of its the matter said lapham  i havent ever hid anything from you persis well you asked me and its too late to begin now  im in a fix  ill tell you what kind of a fix if you think itll do you any good but i guess youll be satisfied to know that its a fix  how much of a one she asked with a look of grave steady courage in her eyes  well i dont know as i can tell just yet said lapham avoiding this look  things have been dull all the fall but i thought theyd brisk up come winter  they havent  there have been a lot of failures and some of em owed me and some of em had me on their paper and lapham stopped  and what prompted his wife  he hesitated before he added and thenrogers  im to blame for that said mrs lapham  i forced you to it  no i was as willing to go into it as what you were answered lapham i dont want to blame anybody  mrs lapham had a womans passion for fixing responsibility she could not help saying as soon as acquitted i warned you against him silas  i told you not to let him get in any deeper with you  oh yes  i had to help him to try to get my money back  i might as well poured water into a sieve  and now lapham stopped  dont be afraid to speak out to me silas lapham  if it comes to the worst i want to know itive got to know it  what did i ever care for the money ive had a happy home with you ever since we were married and i guess i shall have as long as you live whether we go on to the back bay or go back to the old house at lapham  i know whos to blame and i blame myself  it was my forcing rogers on to you she came back to this with her helpless longing inbred in all puritan souls to have some one specifically suffer for the evil in the world even if it must be herself  it hasnt come to the worst yet persis said her husband  but i shall have to hold up on the new house a little while till i can see where i am  i shouldnt care if we had to sell it cried his wife in passionate selfcondemnation i should be glad if we had to as far as im concerned  i shouldnt said lapham  i know said his wife and she remembered ruefully how his heart was set on it  he sat musing  well i guess its going to come out all right in the end  or if it aint he sighed we cant help it  may be pen neednt worry so much about corey after all he continued with a bitter irony new to him  its an ill wind that blows nobody good and theres a chance he ended with a still bitterer laugh that rogers will come to time after all  i dont believe it exclaimed mrs lapham with a gleam of hope in her eyes  what chance  one in ten million said lapham and her face fell again  he says there are some english parties after him to buy these mills  well  well i gave him twentyfour hours to prove himself a liar  you dont believe there are any such parties  not in this world  but if there were  well if there were persisbut pshaw  no no she pleaded eagerly  it dont seem as if he could be such a villain  what would be the use of his pretending if he brought the parties to you  well said lapham scornfully id let them have the mills at the price rogers turned em in on me at  i dont want to make anything on em but guess i shall hear from the g l  p first  and when they make their offer i guess ill have to accept it whatever it is  i dont think theyll have a great many competitors  mrs lapham could not give up her hope  if you could get your price from those english parties before they knew that the g l  p wanted to buy the mills would it let you out with rogers  just about said lapham  then i know hell move heaven and earth to bring it about  i know you wont be allowed to suffer for doing him a kindness silas  he cant be so ungrateful why why should he pretend to have any such parties in view when he hasnt dont you be downhearted si  youll see that hell be round with them tomorrow  lapham laughed but she urged so many reasons for her belief in rogers that lapham began to rekindle his own faith a little  he ended by asking for a hot cup of tea and mrs lapham sent the pot out and had a fresh one steeped for him  after that he made a hearty supper in the revulsion from his entire despair and they fell asleep that night talking hopefully of his affairs which he laid before her fully as he used to do when he first started in business  that brought the old times back and he said if this had happened then i shouldnt have cared much  i was young then and i wasnt afraid of anything  but i noticed that after i passed fifty i began to get scared easier  i dont believe i could pick up now from a regular knockdown  pshaw you scared silas lapham cried his wife proudly  i should like to see the thing that ever scared you or the knockdown that you couldnt pick up from  is that so persis he asked with the joy her courage gave him  in the middle of the night she called to him in a voice which the darkness rendered still more deeply troubled are you awake silas  yes im awake  ive been thinking about those english parties si  sove i  and i cant make it out but what youd be just as bad as rogers every bit and grain if you were to let them have the mills  and not tell em what the chances were with the g l  p i thought of that and you neednt be afraid  she began to bewail herself and to sob convulsively o silas o silas heaven knows in what measure the passion of her soul was mired with pride in her husbands honesty relief from an apprehended struggle and pity for him  hush hush persis he besought her  youll wake pen if you keep on that way  dont cry any more you mustnt  oh let me cry silas itll help me  i shall be all right in a minute  dont you mind she sobbed herself quiet  it does seem too hard she said when she could speak again that you have to give up this chance when providence had fairly raised it up for you  i guess it want providence raised it up said lapham  any rate its got to go  most likely rogers was lyin and there aint any such parties but if there were they couldnt have the mills from me without the whole story  dont you be troubled persis  im going to pull through all right oh i aint afraid  i dont suppose but what theres plenty would help you if they knew you needed it si  they would if they knew i didnt need it said lapham sardonically  did you tell bill how you stood  no i couldnt bear to  ive been the rich one so long that i couldnt bring myself to own up that i was in danger  yes  besides it didnt look so ugly till today but i guess we shant let ugly looks scare us  no    xxii   the morning postman brought mrs lapham a letter from irene which was chiefly significant because it made no reference whatever to the writer or her state of mind  it gave the news of her uncles family it told of their kindness to her her cousin will was going to take her and his sisters iceboating on the river when it froze  by the time this letter came lapham had gone to his business and the mother carried it to penelope to talk over  what do you make out of it she asked and without waiting to be answered she said i dont know as i believe in cousins marrying a great deal but if irene and will were to fix it up between em she looked vaguely at penelope  it wouldnt make any difference as far as i was concerned replied the girl listlessly  mrs lapham lost her patience  well then ill tell you what penelope she exclaimed  perhaps itll make a difference to you if you know that your fathers in real trouble  hes harassed to death and he was awake half the night talking about it  that abominable rogers has got a lot of money away from him and hes lost by others that hes helpedmrs lapham put it in this way because she had no time to be explicitand i want you should come out of your room now and try to be of some help and comfort to him when he comes home tonight  i guess irene wouldnt mope round much if she was here she could not help adding  the girl lifted herself on her elbow  whats that you say about father she demanded eagerly  is he in trouble is he going to lose his money shall we have to stay in this house  we may be very glad to stay in this house said mrs lapham half angry with herself for having given cause for the girls conjectures and half with the habit of prosperity in her child which could conceive no better of what adversity was  and i want you should get up and show that youve got some feeling for somebody in the world besides yourself  oh ill get up said the girl promptly almost cheerfully  i dont say its as bad now as it looked a little while ago said her mother conscientiously hedging a little from the statement which she had based rather upon her feelings than her facts  your father thinks hell pull through all right and i dont know but what he will  but i want you should see if you cant do something to cheer him up and keep him from getting so perfectly downhearted as he seems to get under the load hes got to carry  and stop thinking about yourself a while and behave yourself like a sensible girl  yes yes said the girl i will  you neednt be troubled about me any more  before she left her room she wrote a note and when she came down she was dressed to go outofdoors and post it herself  the note was to corey  do not come to see me any more till you hear from me  i have a reason which i cannot give you now and you must not ask what it is  all day she went about in a buoyant desperation and she came down to meet her father at supper  well persis he said scornfully as he sat down we might as well saved our good resolutions till they were wanted  i guess those english parties have gone back on rogers  do you mean he didnt come  he hadnt come up to halfpast five said lapham  tchk uttered his wife  but i guess i shall pull through without mr rogers continued lapham  a firm that i didnt think could weather it is still afloat and so far forth as the danger goes of being dragged under with it im all right penelope came in  hello pen cried her father  it aint often i meet you nowadays he put up his hand as she passed his chair and pulled her down and kissed her  no she said but i thought id come down tonight and cheer you up a little  i shall not talk the sight of me will be enough  her father laughed out  mother been telling you well i was pretty blue last night but i guess i was more scared than hurt  howd you like to go to the theatre tonight  sellers at the park  heigh  well i dont know  dont you think they could get along without me there  no couldnt work it at all cried the colonel  lets all go unless he added inquiringly theres somebody coming here  theres nobody coming said penelope  good then well go  mother dont you be late now  oh i shant keep you waiting said mrs lapham  she had thought of telling what a cheerful letter she had got from irene but upon the whole it seemed better not to speak of irene at all just then  after they returned from the theatre where the colonel roared through the comedy with continual reference of his pleasure to penelope to make sure that she was enjoying it too his wife said as if the whole affair had been for the girls distraction rather than his i dont believe but what its going to come out all right about the children and then she told him of the letter and the hopes she had founded upon it  well perhaps youre right persis he consented  i havent seen pen so much like herself since it happened  i declare when i see the way she came out tonight just to please you i dont know as i want you should get over all your troubles right away  i guess therell be enough to keep pen going for a while yet said the colonel winding up his watch  but for a time there was a relief which walker noted in the atmosphere at the office and then came another cold wave slighter than the first but distinctly felt there and succeeded by another relief  it was like the winter which was wearing on to the end of the year with alternations of freezing weather and mild days stretching to weeks in which the snow and ice wholly disappeared  it was none the less winter and none the less harassing for these fluctuations and lapham showed in his face and temper the effect of like fluctuations in his affairs  he grew thin and old and both at home and at his office he was irascible to the point of offence  in these days penelope shared with her mother the burden of their troubled home and united with her in supporting the silence or the petulance of the gloomy secret man who replaced the presence of jolly prosperity there lapham had now ceased to talk of his troubles and savagely resented his wifes interference  you mind your own business persis he said one day if youve got any and after that she left him mainly to penelope who did not think of asking him questions  its pretty hard on you pen she said  that makes it easier for me returned the girl who did not otherwise refer to her own trouble  in her heart she had wondered a little at the absolute obedience of corey who had made no sign since receiving her note  she would have liked to ask her father if corey was sick she would have liked him to ask her why corey did not come any more  her mother went on  i dont believe your father knows where he stands  he works away at those papers he brings home here at night as if he didnt half know what he was about  he always did have that close streak in him and i dont suppose but what hes been going into things he dont want anybody else to know about and hes kept these accounts of his own  sometimes he gave penelope figures to work at which he would not submit to his wifes nimbler arithmetic  then she went to bed and left them sitting up till midnight struggling with problems in which they were both weak  but she could see that the girl was a comfort to her father and that his troubles were a defence and shelter to her  some nights she could hear them going out together and then she lay awake for their return from their long walk  when the hour or day of respite came again the home felt it first  lapham wanted to know what the news from irene was he joined his wife in all her cheerful speculations and tried to make her amends for his sullen reticence and irritability  irene was staying on at dubuque  there came a letter from her saying that her uncles people wanted her to spend the winter there  well let her said lapham  itll be the best thing for her  lapham himself had letters from his brother at frequent intervals  his brother was watching the g l  p which as yet had made no offer for the mills  once when one of these letters came he submitted to his wife whether in the absence of any positive information that the road wanted the property he might not with a good conscience dispose of it to the best advantage to anybody who came along  she looked wistfully at him it was on the rise from a season of deep depression with him  no si she said i dont see how you could do that  he did not assent and submit as he had done at first but began to rail at the unpracticality of women and then he shut some papers he had been looking over into his desk and flung out of the room  one of the papers had slipped through the crevice of the lid and lay upon the floor  mrs lapham kept on at her sewing but after a while she picked the paper up to lay it on the desk  then she glanced at it and saw that it was a long column of dates and figures recording successive sums never large ones paid regularly to wm m the dates covered a year and the sum amounted at least to several hundreds  mrs lapham laid the paper down on the desk and then she took it up again and put it into her workbasket meaning to give it to him  when he came in she saw him looking absentmindedly about for something and then going to work upon his papers apparently without it  she thought she would wait till he missed it definitely and then give him the scrap she had picked up  it lay in her basket and after some days it found its way under the work in it and she forgot it    xxiii   since new years there had scarcely been a mild day and the streets were full of snow growing foul under the city feet and hoofs and renewing its purity from the skies with repeated falls which in turn lost their whiteness beaten down and beaten black and hard into a solid bed like iron  the sleighing was incomparable and the air was full of the din of bells but laphams turnout was not of those that thronged the brighton road every afternoon the man at the liverystable sent him word that the mares legs were swelling  he and corey had little to do with each other  he did not know how penelope had arranged it with corey his wife said she knew no more than he did and he did not like to ask the girl herself especially as corey no longer came to the house  he saw that she was cheerfuller than she had been and helpfuller with him and her mother  now and then lapham opened his troubled soul to her a little letting his thought break into speech without preamble or conclusion  once he said  pen i presume you know im in trouble  we all seem to be there said the girl  yes but theres a difference between being there by your own fault and being there by somebody elses  i dont call it his fault she said  i call it mine said the colonel  the girl laughed  her thought was of her own care and her fathers wholly of his  she must come to his ground  what have you been doing wrong  i dont know as youd call it wrong  its what people do all the time  but i wish id let stocks alone  its what i always promised your mother i would do  but theres no use cryin over spilt milk or watered stock either  i dont think theres much use crying about anything  if it could have been cried straight it would have been all right from the start said the girl going back to her own affair and if lapham had not been so deeply engrossed in his he might have seen how little she cared for all that money could do or undo  he did not observe her enough to see how variable her moods were in those days and how often she sank from some wild gaiety into abject melancholy how at times she was fiercely defiant of nothing at all and at others inexplicably humble and patient  but no doubt none of these signs had passed unnoticed by his wife to whom lapham said one day when he came home persis whats the reason pen dont marry corey  you know as well as i do silas said mrs lapham with an inquiring look at him for what lay behind his words  well i think its all tomfoolery the way shes going on  there aint any rhyme nor reason to it he stopped and his wife waited if she said the word i could have some help from them he hung his head and would not meet his wifes eye  i guess youre in a pretty bad way si she said pityingly or you wouldnt have come to that  im in a hole said lapham and i dont know where to turn  you wont let me do anything about those mills  yes ill let you said his wife sadly  he gave a miserable cry  you know i cant do anything if you do  o my lord  she had not seen him so low as that before  she did not know what to say  she was frightened and could only ask has it come to the worst  the new house has got to go he answered evasively  she did not say anything  she knew that the work on the house had been stopped since the beginning of the year  lapham had told the architect that he preferred to leave it unfinished till the spring as there was no prospect of their being able to get into it that winter and the architect had agreed with him that it would not hurt it to stand  her heart was heavy for him though she could not say so  they sat together at the table where she had come to be with him at his belated meal  she saw that he did not eat and she waited for him to speak again without urging him to take anything  they were past that  and ive sent orders to shut down at the works he added  shut down at the works she echoed with dismay  she could not take it in  the fire at the works had never been out before since it was first kindled  she knew how he had prided himself upon that how he had bragged of it to every listener and had always lugged the fact in as the last expression of his sense of success  o silas  whats the use he retorted  i saw it was coming a month ago there are some fellows out in west virginia that have been running the paint as hard as they could  they couldnt do much they used to put it on the market raw  but lately they got to baking it and now theyve struck a vein of natural gas right by their works and they pay ten cents for fuel where i pay a dollar and they make as good a paint  anybody can see where its going to end  besides the markets overstocked  its glutted  there want anything to do but to shut down and ive shut down  i dont know whats going to become of the hands in the middle of the winter this way said mrs lapham laying hold of one definite thought which she could grasp in the turmoil of ruin that whirled before her eyes  i dont care what becomes of the hands cried lapham  theyve shared my luck now let em share the other thing  and if youre so very sorry for the hands i wish youd keep a little of your pity for me  dont you know what shutting down the works means  yes indeed i do silas said his wife tenderly  well then he rose leaving his supper untasted and went into the sittingroom where she presently found him with that everlasting confusion of papers before him on the desk  that made her think of the paper in her workbasket and she decided not to make the careworn distracted man ask her for it after all  she brought it to him  he glanced blankly at it and then caught it from her turning red and looking foolish  whered you get that  you dropped it on the floor the other night and i picked it up  who is wm m  wm m he repeated looking confusedly at her and then at the paper  ohits nothing he tore the paper into small pieces and went and dropped them into the fire  when mrs lapham came into the room in the morning before he was down she found a scrap of the paper which must have fluttered to the hearth and glancing at it she saw that the words were mrs m she wondered what dealings with a woman her husband could have and she remembered the confusion he had shown about the paper and which she had thought was because she had surprised one of his business secrets  she was still thinking of it when he came down to breakfast heavyeyed tremulous with deep seams and wrinkles in his face  after a silence which he did not seem inclined to break silas she asked who is mrs m  he stared at her  i dont know what youre talking about  dont you she returned mockingly  when you do you tell me  do you want any more coffee  no  well then you can ring for alice when youve finished  ive got some things to attend to she rose abruptly and left the room lapham looked after her in a dull way and then went on with his breakfast  while he still sat at his coffee she flung into the room again and dashed some papers down beside his plate  here are some more things of yours and ill thank you to lock them up in your desk and not litter my room with them if you please now he saw that she was angry and it must be with him  it enraged him that in such a time of trouble she should fly out at him in that way  he left the house without trying to speak to her  that day corey came just before closing and knocking at laphams door asked if he could speak with him a few moments  yes said lapham wheeling round in his swivelchair and kicking another towards corey  sit down  i want to talk to you  id ought to tell you youre wasting your time here  i spoke the other day about your placin yourself better and i can help you to do it yet  there aint going to be the outcome for the paint in the foreign markets that we expected and i guess you better give it up  i dont wish to give it up said the young fellow setting his lips ive as much faith in it as ever and i want to propose now what i hinted at in the first place  i want to put some money into the business  some money lapham leaned towards him and frowned as if he had not quite understood while he clutched the arms of his chair  ive got about thirty thousand dollars that i could put in and if you dont want to consider me a partneri remember that you objected to a partneryou can let me regard it as an investment  but i think i see the way to doing something at once in mexico and i should like to feel that i had something more than a drummers interest in the venture  the men sat looking into each others eyes  then lapham leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hand hard and slowly over his face  his features were still twisted with some strong emotion when he took it away  your family know about this  my uncle james knows  he thinks it would be a good plan for you  he thought that by this time i ought to be able to trust my own judgment  do you suppose i could see your uncle at his office  i imagine hes there  well i want to have a talk with him one of these days he sat pondering a while and then rose and went with corey to his door  i guess i shant change my mind about taking you into the business in that way he said coldly  if there was any reason why i shouldnt at first theres more now  very well sir answered the young man and went to close his desk the outer office was empty but while corey was putting his papers in order it was suddenly invaded by two women who pushed by the protesting porter on the stairs and made their way towards laphams room  one of them was miss dewey the typewriter girl and the other was a woman whom she would resemble in face and figure twenty years hence if she led a life of hard work varied by paroxysms of hard drinking  that his room zrilla asked this woman pointing towards laphams door with a hand that had not freed itself from the fringe of dirty shawl under which it had hung  she went forward without waiting for the answer but before she could reach it the door opened and lapham stood filling its space  look here colonel lapham began the woman in a high key of challenge  i want to know if this is the way youre goin back on me and zrilla  what do you want asked lapham  what do i want what do you spose i want i want the money to pay my months rent there aint a bite to eat in the house and i want some money to market  lapham bent a frown on the woman under which she shrank back a step youve taken the wrong way to get it  clear out  i wont clear out said the woman beginning to whimper  corey said lapham in the peremptory voice of a masterhe had seemed so indifferent to coreys presence that the young man thought he must have forgotten he was thereis dennis anywhere round  yissor said dennis answering for himself from the head of the stairs and appearing in the wareroom  lapham spoke to the woman again  do you want i should call a hack or do you want i should call an officer  the woman began to cry into an end of her shawl  i dont know what were goin to do  youre going to clear out said lapham  call a hack dennis  if you ever come here again ill have you arrested  mind that zerrilla i shall want you early tomorrow morning  yes sir said the girl meekly she and her mother shrank out after the porter  lapham shut his door without a word  at lunch the next day walker made himself amends for coreys reticence by talking a great deal  he talked about lapham who seemed to have more than ever since his apparent difficulties began the fascination of an enigma for his bookkeeper and he ended by asking did you see that little circus last night  what little circus asked corey in his turn  those two women and the old man  dennis told me about it  i told him if he liked his place hed better keep his mouth shut  that was very good advice said corey  oh all right if you dont want to talk  dont know as i should in your place returned walker in the easy security he had long felt that corey had no intention of putting on airs with him  but ill tell you what the old man cant expect it of everybody  if he keeps this thing up much longer its going to be talked about  you cant have a woman walking into your place of business and trying to bulldoze you before your porter without setting your porter to thinking  and the last thing you want a porter to do is to think for when a porter thinks he thinks wrong  i dont see why even a porter couldnt think right about that affair replied corey  i dont know who the woman was though i believe she was miss deweys mother but i couldnt see that colonel lapham showed anything but a natural resentment of her coming to him in that way  i should have said she was some rather worthless person whom hed been befriending and that she had presumed upon his kindness  is that so what do you think of his never letting miss deweys name go on the books  that its another proof its a sort of charity of his  thats the only way to look at it  oh im all right walker lighted a cigar and began to smoke with his eyes closed to a fine straight line  it wont do for a bookkeeper to think wrong any more than a porter i suppose  but i guess you and i dont think very different about this thing  not if you think as i do replied corey steadily and i know you would do that if you had seen the circus yourself  a man doesnt treat people who have a disgraceful hold upon him as he treated them  it depends upon who he is said walker taking his cigar from his mouth  i never said the old man was afraid of anything  and character continued corey disdaining to touch the matter further except in generalities must go for something  if its to be the prey of mere accident and appearance then it goes for nothing  accidents will happen in the best regulated families said walker with vulgar goodhumoured obtuseness that filled corey with indignation  nothing perhaps removed his matteroffact nature further from the commonplace than a certain generosity of instinct which i should not be ready to say was always infallible  that evening it was miss deweys turn to wait for speech with lapham after the others were gone  he opened his door at her knock and stood looking at her with a worried air  well what do you want zerrilla he asked with a sort of rough kindness  i want to know what im going to do about hen  hes back again and he and mother have made it up and they both got to drinking last night after i went home and carried on so that the neighbours came in  lapham passed his hand over his red and heated face  i dont know what im going to do  youre twice the trouble that my own family is now  but i know what id do mighty quick if it wasnt for you zerrilla he went on relentingly  id shut your mother up somewheres and if i could get that fellow off for a three years voyage  i declare said miss dewey beginning to whimper it seems as if he came back just so often to spite me  hes never gone more than a year at the furthest and you cant make it out habitual drunkenness either when its just sprees  im at my wits end  oh well you mustnt cry around here said lapham soothingly  i know it said miss dewey  if i could get rid of hen i could manage well enough with mother  mr wemmel would marry me if i could get the divorce  hes said so over and over again  i dont know as i like that very well said lapham frowning  i dont know as i want you should get married in any hurry again  i dont know as i like your going with anybody else just yet  oh you neednt be afraid but what itll be all right  itll be the best thing all round if i can marry him  well said lapham impatiently i cant think about it now  i suppose theyve cleaned everything out again  yes they have said zerrilla there isnt a cent left  youre a pretty expensive lot said lapham  well here he took out his pocketbook and gave her a note  ill be round tonight and see what can be done  he shut himself into his room again and zerrilla dried her tears put the note into her bosom and went her way  lapham kept the porter nearly an hour later  it was then six oclock the hour at which the laphams usually had tea but all custom had been broken up with him during the past months and he did not go home now he determined perhaps in the extremity in which a man finds relief in combating one care with another to keep his promise to miss dewey and at the moment when he might otherwise have been sitting down at his own table he was climbing the stairs to her lodging in the oldfashioned dwelling which had been portioned off into flats  it was in a region of depots and of the cheap hotels and ladies and gents diningrooms and restaurants with bars which abound near depots and lapham followed to miss deweys door a waiter from one of these who bore on a salver before him a supper covered with a napkin  zerrilla had admitted them and at her greeting a young fellow in the shabby shoresuit of a sailor buttoning imperfectly over the nautical blue flannel of his shirt got up from where he had been sitting on one side of the stove and stood infirmly on his feet in token of receiving the visitor  the woman who sat on the other side did not rise but began a shrill defiant apology  well i dont suppose but what youll think were livin on the fat o the land right straight along all the while  but its just like this  when that child came in from her work she didnt seem to have the spirit to go to cookin anything and i had such a bad night last night i was feelin all broke up and sd i whats the use anyway by the time the butchers heaved in a lot o bone and made you pay for the suet he cuts away it comes to the same thing and why not git it from the restrant first off and save the cost o your fire sd i  what have you got there under your apron a bottle demanded lapham who stood with his hat on and his hands in his pockets indifferent alike to the ineffective reception of the sailor and the chair zerrilla had set him  well yes its a bottle said the woman with an assumption of virtuous frankness  its whisky i got to have something to rub my rheumatism with  humph grumbled lapham  youve been rubbing his rheumatism too i see  he twisted his head in the direction of the sailor now softly and rhythmically waving to and fro on his feet  he haint had a drop today in this house cried the woman  what are you doing around here said lapham turning fiercely upon him  youve got no business ashore  wheres your ship do you think im going to let you come here and eat your wife out of house and home and then give money to keep the concern going  just the very words i said when he first showed his face here yistday didnt i zrilla said the woman eagerly joining in the rebuke of her late boon companion  you got no business here hen sd i you cant come here to live on me and zrilla sd i you want to go back to your ship sd i thats what i said  the sailor mumbled with a smile of tipsy amiability for lapham something about the crew being discharged  yes the woman broke in thats always the way with these coasters why dont you go off on some them long vyges sd i its pretty hard when mr wemmel stands ready to marry zrilla and provide a comfortable home for us bothi haint got a great many years more to live and i should like to get some satisfaction out of em and not be beholden and dependent all my daysto have hen here blockin the way  i tell him thered be more money for him in the end but he cant seem to make up his mind to it  well now look here said lapham  i dont care anything about all that  its your own business and im not going to meddle with it but its my business who lives off me and so i tell you all three im willing to take care of zerrilla and im willing to take care of her mother  i guess if it hadnt been for that childs father the mother interpolated you wouldnt been here to tell the tale colonel lapham  i know all about that said lapham  but ill tell you what mr dewey im not going to support you  i dont see what hens done said the old woman impartially  he hasnt done anything and im going to stop it  hes got to get a ship and hes got to get out of this  and zerrilla neednt come back to work till he does  im done with you all  well i vow said the mother if i ever heard anything like it didnt that childs father lay down his life for you haint you said it yourself a hundred times  and dont she work for her money and slave for it mornin noon and night you talk as if we was beholden to you for the very bread in our mouths  i guess if it hadnt been for jim you wouldnt been here crowin over us  you mind what i say  i mean business this time said lapham turning to the door  the woman rose and followed him with her bottle in her hand  say colonel what should you advise zrilla to do about mr wemmel i tell her there aint any use goin to the trouble to git a divorce without shes sure about him  dont you think wed ought to git him to sign a paper or something that hell marry her if she gits it i dont like to have things going at loose ends the way they are  it aint sense it aint right  lapham made no answer to the mother anxious for her childs future and concerned for the moral questions involved  he went out and down the stairs and on the pavement at the lower door he almost struck against rogers who had a bag in his hand and seemed to be hurrying towards one of the depots  he halted a little as if to speak to lapham but lapham turned his back abruptly upon him and took the other direction  the days were going by in a monotony of adversity to him from which he could no longer escape even at home  he attempted once or twice to talk of his troubles to his wife but she repulsed him sharply she seemed to despise and hate him but he set himself doggedly to make a confession to her and he stopped her one night as she came into the room where he sathastily upon some errand that was to take her directly away again  persis theres something ive got to tell you  she stood still as if fixed against her will to listen  i guess you know something about it already and i guess it set you against me  oh i guess not colonel lapham  you go your way and i go mine thats all  she waited for him to speak listening with a cold hard smile on her face  i dont say it to make favour with you because i dont want you to spare me and i dont ask you but i got into it through milton k rogers  oh said mrs lapham contemptuously  i always felt the way i said about itthat it want any better than gambling and i say so now  its like betting on the turn of a card and i give you my word of honour persis that i never was in it at all till that scoundrel began to load me up with those wildcat securities of his  then it seemed to me as if i ought to try to do something to get somewhere even  i know its no excuse but watching the market to see what the infernal things were worth from day to day and seeing it go up and seeing it go down was too much for me and to make a long story short i began to buy and sell on a marginjust what i told you i never would do  i seemed to make somethingi did make something and id have stopped i do believe if i could have reached the figure id set in my own mind to start with but i couldnt fetch it  i began to lose and then i began to throw good money after bad just as i always did with everything that rogers ever came within a mile of well whats the use i lost the money that would have carried me out of this and i shouldnt have had to shut down the works or sell the house or  lapham stopped  his wife who at first had listened with mystification and then dawning incredulity changing into a look of relief that was almost triumph lapsed again into severity  silas lapham if you was to die the next minute is this what you started to tell me  why of course it is  what did you suppose i started to tell you  andlook me in the eyesyou havent got anything else on your mind now  no theres trouble enough the lord knows but theres nothing else to tell you  i suppose pen gave you a hint about it  i dropped something to her  ive been feeling bad about it persis a good while but i haint had the heart to speak of it  i cant expect you to say you like it  ive been a fool ill allow and ive been something worse if you choose to say so but thats all  i havent hurt anybody but myselfand you and the children  mrs lapham rose and said with her face from him as she turned towards the door its all right silas  i shant ever bring it up against you  she fled out of the room but all that evening she was very sweet with him and seemed to wish in all tacit ways to atone for her past unkindness  she made him talk of his business and he told her of coreys offer and what he had done about it  she did not seem to care for his part in it however at which lapham was silently disappointed a little for he would have liked her to praise him  he did it on account of pen  well he didnt insist upon it anyway said lapham who must have obscurely expected that corey would recognise his own magnanimity by repeating his offer  if the doubt that follows a selfdevoted actionthe question whether it was not after all a needless follyis mixed as it was in laphams case with the vague belief that we might have done ourselves a good turn without great risk of hurting any one else by being a little less unselfish it becomes a regret that is hard to bear  since corey spoke to him some things had happened that gave lapham hope again  im going to tell her about it said his wife and she showed herself impatient to make up for the time she had lost  why didnt you tell me before silas  i didnt know we were on speaking terms before said lapham sadly  yes thats true she admitted with a conscious flush  i hope he wont think pens known about it all this while    xxiv   that evening james bellingham came to see corey after dinner and went to find him in his own room  ive come at the instance of colonel lapham said the uncle  he was at my office today and i had a long talk with him  did you know that he was in difficulties  i fancied that he was in some sort of trouble  and i had the bookkeepers conjectureshe doesnt really know much about it  well he thinks it timeon all accountsthat you should know how he stands and why he declined that proposition of yours  i must say he has behaved very welllike a gentleman  im not surprised  i am  its hard to behave like a gentleman where your interest is vitally concerned  and lapham doesnt strike me as a man whos in the habit of acting from the best in him always  do any of us asked corey  not all of us at any rate said bellingham  it must have cost him something to say no to you for hes just in that state when he believes that this or that chance however small would save him  corey was silent  is he really in such a bad way  its hard to tell just where he stands  i suspect that a hopeful temperament and fondness for round numbers have always caused him to set his figures beyond his actual worth  i dont say that hes been dishonest about it but hes had a loose way of estimating his assets hes reckoned his wealth on the basis of his capital and some of his capital is borrowed  hes lost heavily by some of the recent failures and theres been a terrible shrinkage in his values  i dont mean merely in the stock of paint on hand but in a kind of competition which has become very threatening  you know about that west virginian paint  corey nodded  well he tells me that theyve struck a vein of natural gas out there which will enable them to make as good a paint as his own at a cost of manufacturing so low that they can undersell him everywhere  if this proves to be the case it will not only drive his paint out of the market but will reduce the value of his worksthe whole plantat lapham to a merely nominal figure  i see said corey dejectedly  ive understood that he had put a great deal of money into his works  yes and he estimated his mine there at a high figure  of course it will be worth little or nothing if the west virginia paint drives his out  then besides lapham has been into several things outside of his own business and like a good many other men who try outside things hes kept account of them himself and hes all mixed up about them hes asked me to look into his affairs with him and ive promised to do so  whether he can be tided over his difficulties remains to be seen  im afraid it will take a good deal of money to do ita great deal more than he thinks at least  he believes comparatively little would do it  i think differently  i think that anything less than a great deal would be thrown away on him  if it were merely a question of a certain sumeven a large sumto keep him going it might be managed but its much more complicated  and as i say it must have been a trial to him to refuse your offer  this did not seem to be the way in which bellingham had meant to conclude  but he said no more and corey made him no response  he remained pondering the case now hopefully now doubtfully and wondering whatever his mood was whether penelope knew anything of the fact with which her mother went nearly at the same moment to acquaint her  of course hes done it on your account mrs lapham could not help saying  then he was very silly  does he think i would let him give father money and if father lost it for him does he suppose it would make it any easier for me i think father acted twice as well  it was very silly  in repeating the censure her look was not so severe as her tone she even smiled a little and her mother reported to her father that she acted more like herself than she had yet since coreys offer  i think if he was to repeat his offer she would have him now said mrs lapham  well ill let her know if he does said the colonel  i guess he wont do it to you she cried  who else will he do it to he demanded  they perceived that they had each been talking of a different offer  after lapham went to his business in the morning the postman brought another letter from irene which was full of pleasant things that were happening to her there was a great deal about her cousin will as she called him  at the end she had written tell pen i dont want she should be foolish there said mrs lapham  i guess its going to come out right all round and it seemed as if even the colonels difficulties were past  when your father gets through this pen she asked impulsively what shall you do  what have you been telling irene about me  nothing much  what should you do  it would be a good deal easier to say what i should do if father didnt said the girl  i know you think it was nice in him to make your father that offer urged the mother  it was nice yes but it was silly said the girl  most nice things are silly i suppose she added  she went to her room and wrote a letter  it was very long and very carefully written and when she read it over she tore it into small pieces  she wrote another one short and hurried and tore that up too  then she went back to her mother in the family room and asked to see irenes letter and read it over to herself  yes she seems to be having a good time she sighed  mother do you think i ought to let mr corey know that i know about it  well i should think it would be a pleasure to him said mrs lapham judicially  im not so sure of that the way i should have to tell him  i should begin by giving him a scolding  of course he meant well by it but cant you see that it wasnt very flattering how did he expect it would change me  i dont believe he ever thought of that  dont you why  because you can see that he isnt one of that kind  he might want to please you without wanting to change you by what he did  yes he must have known that nothing would change meat least nothing that he could do  i thought of that  i shouldnt like him to feel that i couldnt appreciate it even if i did think it was silly should you write to him  i dont see why not  it would be too pointed  no i shall just let it go  i wish he hadnt done it  well he has done it and ive tried to write to him about ittwo letters one so humble and grateful that it couldnt stand up on its edge and the other so pert and flippant  mother i wish you could have seen those two letters i wish i had kept them to look at if i ever got to thinking i had any sense again  they would take the conceit out of me  whats the reason he dont come here any more  doesnt he come asked penelope in turn as if it were something she had not noticed particularly  youd ought to know  yes she sat silent a while  if he doesnt come i suppose its because hes offended at something i did  what did you do  nothing iwrote to hima little while ago  i suppose it was very blunt but i didnt believe he would be angry at it  but thisthis that hes done shows he was angry and that he wasnt just seizing the first chance to get out of it  what have you done pen demanded her mother sharply  oh i dont know  all the mischief in the world i suppose  ill tell you  when you first told me that father was in trouble with his business i wrote to him not to come any more till i let him  i said i couldnt tell him why and he hasnt been here since  im sure i dont know what it means  her mother looked at her with angry severity  well penelope lapham for a sensible child you are the greatest goose i ever saw  did you think he would come here and see if you wouldnt let him come  he might have written urged the girl  her mother made that despairing tchk with her tongue and fell back in her chair  i should have despised him if he had written  hes acted just exactly right and youyouve actedi dont know how youve acted  im ashamed of you  a girl that could be so sensible for her sister and always say and do just the right thing and then when it comes to herself to be such a disgusting simpleton  i thought i ought to break with him at once and not let him suppose that there was any hope for him or me if father was poor  it was my one chance in this whole business to do anything heroic and i jumped at it  you mustnt think because i can laugh at it now that i wasnt in earnest mother i wasdead but the colonel has gone to ruin so gradually that hes spoilt everything  i expected that he would be bankrupt the next day and that then he would understand what i meant but to have it drag along for a fortnight seems to take all the heroism out of it and leave it as flat she looked at her mother with a smile that shone through her tears and a pathos that quivered round her jesting lips  its easy enough to be sensible for other people  but when it comes to myself there i am especially when i want to do what i oughtnt so much that it seems as if doing what i didnt want to do must be doing what i ought but its been a great success one way mother  its helped me to keep up before the colonel  if it hadnt been for mr coreys staying away and my feeling so indignant with him for having been badly treated by me i shouldnt have been worth anything at all  the tears started down her cheeks but her mother said well now go along and write to him  it dont matter what you say much and dont be so very particular  her third attempt at a letter pleased her scarcely better than the rest but she sent it though it seemed so blunt and awkward  she wrote   dear friendi expected when i sent you that note that you would understand almost the next day why i could not see you any more  you must know now and you must not think that if anything happened to my father i should wish you to help him  but that is no reason why i should not thank you and i do thank you for offering  it was like you i will say that  yours sincerely penelope lapham   she posted her letter and he sent his reply in the evening by hand   dearestwhat i did was nothing till you praised it  everything i have and am is yours  wont you send a line by the bearer to say that i may come to see you i know how you feel but i am sure that i can make you think differently  you must consider that i loved you without a thought of your fathers circumstances and always shall  t c   the generous words were blurred to her eyes by the tears that sprang into them  but she could only write in answer   please do not come i have made up my mind  as long as this trouble is hanging over us i cannot see you  and if father is unfortunate all is over between us   she brought his letter to her mother and told her what she had written in reply  her mother was thoughtful a while before she said with a sigh well i hope youve begun as you can carry out pen  oh i shall not have to carry out at all  i shall not have to do anything  thats one comfortthe only comfort she went away to her own room and when mrs lapham told her husband of the affair he was silent at first as she had been  then he said i dont know as i should have wanted her to done differently i dont know as she could if i ever come right again she wont have anything to feel meeching about and if i dont i dont want she should be beholden to anybody and i guess thats the way she feels  the coreys in their turn sat in judgment on the fact which their son felt bound to bring to their knowledge  she has behaved very well said mrs corey to whom her son had spoken  my dear said her husband with his laugh she has behaved too well if she had studied the whole situation with the most artful eye to its mastery she could not possibly have behaved better  the process of laphams financial disintegration was like the course of some chronic disorder which has fastened itself upon the constitution but advances with continual reliefs with apparent amelioration and at times seems not to advance at all when it gives hope of final recovery not only to the sufferer but to the eye of science itself  there were moments when james bellingham seeing lapham pass this crisis and that began to fancy that he might pull through altogether and at these moments when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and probability to the evidence of the fact lapham was buoyant with courage and imparted his hopefulness to his household  our theory of disaster of sorrow of affliction borrowed from the poets and novelists is that it is incessant but every passage in our own lives and in the lives of others so far as we have witnessed them teaches us that this is false  the house of mourning is decorously darkened to the world but within itself it is also the house of laughing  bursts of gaiety as heartfelt as its grief relieve the gloom and the stricken survivors have their jests together in which the thought of the dead is tenderly involved and a fond sense not crazier than many others of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence justifies the sunnier mood before sorrow rushes back deploring and despairing and making it all up again with the conventional fitness of things laphams adversity had this quality in common with bereavement  it was not always like the adversity we figure in allegory it had its moments of being like prosperity and if upon the whole it was continual it was not incessant  sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses when he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his hopefulness and then days came of negative result or slight success when he was full of his jokes at the teatable and wanted to go to the theatre or to do something to cheer penelope up  in some miraculous way by some enormous stroke of success which should eclipse the brightest of his past prosperity he expected to do what would reconcile all difficulties not only in his own affairs but in hers too  youll see he said to his wife its going to come out all right  irenell fix it up with bills boy and then shell be off pens mind and if things go on as theyve been going for the last two days im going to be in a position to do the favours myself and pen can feel that shes makin a sacrifice and then i guess may be shell do it  if things turn out as i expect now and times ever do get any better generally i can show corey that i appreciate his offer  i can offer him the partnership myself then  even in the other moods which came when everything had been going wrong and there seemed no way out of the net there were points of consolation to lapham and his wife  they rejoiced that irene was safe beyond the range of their anxieties and they had a proud satisfaction that there had been no engagement between corey and penelope and that it was she who had forbidden it  in the closeness of interest and sympathy in which their troubles had reunited them they confessed to each other that nothing would have been more galling to their pride than the idea that lapham should not have been able to do everything for his daughter that the coreys might have expected  whatever happened now the coreys could not have it to say that the laphams had tried to bring any such thing about  bellingham had lately suggested an assignment to lapham as the best way out of his difficulties  it was evident that he had not the money to meet his liabilities at present and that he could not raise it without ruinous sacrifices that might still end in ruin after all  if he made the assignment bellingham argued he could gain time and make terms the state of things generally would probably improve since it could not be worse and the market which he had glutted with his paint might recover and he could start again  lapham had not agreed with him  when his reverses first began it had seemed easy for him to give up everything to let the people he owed take all so only they would let him go out with clean hands and he had dramatised this feeling in his talk with his wife when they spoke together of the mills on the g l  p but ever since then it had been growing harder and he could not consent even to seem to do it now in the proposed assignment  he had not found other men so very liberal or faithful with him a good many of them appeared to have combined to hunt him down a sense of enmity towards all his creditors asserted itself in him he asked himself why they should not suffer a little too  above all he shrank from the publicity of the assignment  it was open confession that he had been a fool in some way he could not bear to have his familyhis brother the judge especially to whom he had always appeared the soul of business wisdomthink him imprudent or stupid  he would make any sacrifice before it came to that  he determined in parting with bellingham to make the sacrifice which he had oftenest in his mind because it was the hardest and to sell his new house  that would cause the least comment  most people would simply think that he had got a splendid offer and with his usual luck had made a very good thing of it others who knew a little more about him would say that he was hauling in his horns but they could not blame him a great many other men were doing the same in those hard timesthe shrewdest and safest men it might even have a good effect he went straight from bellinghams office to the realestate broker in whose hands he meant to put his house for he was not the sort of man to shillyshally when he had once made up his mind  but he found it hard to get his voice up out of his throat when he said he guessed he would get the broker to sell that new house of his on the water side of beacon  the broker answered cheerfully yes he supposed colonel lapham knew it was a pretty dull time in real estate  and lapham said yes he knew that but he should not sell at a sacrifice and he did not care to have the broker name him or describe the house definitely unless parties meant business  again the broker said yes and he added as a joke lapham would appreciate that he had half a dozen houses on the water side of beacon on the same terms that nobody wanted to be named or to have his property described  it did in fact comfort lapham a little to find himself in the same boat with so many others he smiled grimly and said in his turn yes he guessed that was about the size of it with a good many people  but he had not the heart to tell his wife what he had done and he sat taciturn that whole evening without even going over his accounts and went early to bed where he lay tossing half the night before he fell asleep  he slept at last only upon the promise he made himself that he would withdraw the house from the brokers hands but he went heavily to his own business in the morning without doing so  there was no such rush anyhow he reflected bitterly there would be time to do that a month later probably  it struck him with a sort of dismay when a boy came with a note from a broker saying that a party who had been over the house in the fall had come to him to know whether it could be bought and was willing to pay the cost of the house up to the time he had seen it  lapham took refuge in trying to think who the party could be he concluded that it must have been somebody who had gone over it with the architect and he did not like that but he was aware that this was not an answer to the broker and he wrote that he would give him an answer in the morning  now that it had come to the point it did not seem to him that he could part with the house  so much of his hope for himself and his children had gone into it that the thought of selling it made him tremulous and sick  he could not keep about his work steadily and with his nerves shaken by want of sleep and the shock of this sudden and unexpected question he left his office early and went over to look at the house and try to bring himself to some conclusion here  the long procession of lamps on the beautiful street was flaring in the clear red of the sunset towards which it marched and lapham with a lump in his throat stopped in front of his house and looked at their multitude  they were not merely a part of the landscape they were a part of his pride and glory his success his triumphant lifes work which was fading into failure in his helpless hands  he ground his teeth to keep down that lump but the moisture in his eyes blurred the lamps and the keen pale crimson against which it made them flicker  he turned and looked up as he had so often done at the windowspaces neatly glazed for the winter with white linen and recalled the night when he had stopped with irene before the house and she had said that she should never live there and he had tried to coax her into courage about it  there was no such facade as that on the whole street to his thinking through his long talks with the architect he had come to feel almost as intimately and fondly as the architect himself the satisfying simplicity of the whole design and the delicacy of its detail  it appealed to him as an exquisite bit of harmony appeals to the unlearned ear and he recognised the difference between this fine work and the obstreperous pretentiousness of the many overloaded housefronts which seymour had made him notice for his instruction elsewhere on the back bay  now in the depths of his gloom he tried to think what italian city it was where seymour said he had first got the notion of treating brickwork in that way  he unlocked the temporary door with the key he always carried so that he could let himself in and out whenever he liked and entered the house dim and very cold with the accumulated frigidity of the whole winter in it and looking as if the arrest of work upon it had taken place a thousand years before  it smelt of the unpainted woods and the clean hard surfaces of the plaster where the experiments in decoration had left it untouched and mingled with these odours was that of some rank pigments and metallic compositions which seymour had used in trying to realise a certain daring novelty of finish which had not proved successful  above all lapham detected the peculiar odour of his own paint with which the architect had been greatly interested one day when lapham showed it to him at the office  he had asked lapham to let him try the persis brand in realising a little idea he had for the finish of mrs laphams room  if it succeeded they could tell her what it was for a surprise  lapham glanced at the baywindow in the receptionroom where he sat with his girls on the trestles when corey first came by and then he explored the whole house to the attic in the light faintly admitted through the linen sashes  the floors were strewn with shavings and chips which the carpenters had left and in the musicroom these had been blown into long irregular windrows by the draughts through a wide rent in the linen sash  lapham tried to pin it up but failed and stood looking out of it over the water  the ice had left the river and the low tide lay smooth and red in the light of the sunset  the cambridge flats showed the sad sodden yellow of meadows stripped bare after a long sleep under snow the hills the naked trees the spires and roofs had a black outline as if they were objects in a landscape of the french school  the whim seized lapham to test the chimney in the musicroom it had been tried in the diningroom below and in his girls fireplaces above but here the hearth was still clean  he gathered some shavings and blocks together and kindled them and as the flame mounted gaily from them he pulled up a nailkeg which he found there and sat down to watch it  nothing could have been better the chimney was a perfect success and as lapham glanced out of the torn linen sash he said to himself that that party whoever he was who had offered to buy his house might go to the devil he would never sell it as long as he had a dollar  he said that he should pull through yet and it suddenly came into his mind that if he could raise the money to buy out those west virginia fellows he should be all right and would have the whole game in his own hand  he slapped himself on the thigh and wondered that he had never thought of that before and then lighting a cigar with a splinter from the fire he sat down again to work the scheme out in his own mind  he did not hear the feet heavily stamping up the stairs and coming towards the room where he sat and the policeman to whom the feet belonged had to call out to him smoking at his chimneycorner with his back turned to the door hello what are you doing here  whats that to you retorted lapham wheeling half round on his nailkeg  ill show you said the officer advancing upon him and then stopping short as he recognised him  why colonel lapham i thought it was some tramp got in here  have a cigar said lapham hospitably  sorry there aint another nailkeg  the officer took the cigar  ill smoke it outside  ive just come on and i cant stop  tryin your chimney  yes i thought id see how it would draw in here  it seems to go firstrate  the policeman looked about him with an eye of inspection  you want to get that linen window there mended up  yes ill speak to the builder about that  it can go for one night  the policeman went to the window and failed to pin the linen together where lapham had failed before  i cant fix it he looked round once more and saying well good night went out and down the stairs  lapham remained by the fire till he had smoked his cigar then he rose and stamped upon the embers that still burned with his heavy boots and went home  he was very cheerful at supper  he told his wife that he guessed he had a sure thing of it now and in another twentyfour hours he should tell her just how  he made penelope go to the theatre with him and when they came out after the play the night was so fine that he said they must walk round by the new house and take a look at it in the starlight  he said he had been there before he came home and tried seymours chimney in the musicroom and it worked like a charm  as they drew near beacon street they were aware of unwonted stir and tumult and presently the still air transmitted a turmoil of sound through which a powerful and incessant throbbing made itself felt  the sky had reddened above them and turning the corner at the public garden they saw a black mass of people obstructing the perspective of the brightlylighted street and out of this mass a halfdozen engines whose strong heartbeats had already reached them sent up volumes of firetinged smoke and steam from their funnels  ladders were planted against the facade of a building from the roof of which a mass of flame burnt smoothly upward except where here and there it seemed to pull contemptuously away from the heavy streams of water which the firemen clinging like great beetles to their ladders poured in upon it  lapham had no need to walk down through the crowd gazing and gossiping with shouts and cries and hysterical laughter before the burning house to make sure that it was his  i guess i done it pen was all he said  among the people who were looking at it were a party who seemed to have run out from dinner in some neighbouring house the ladies were fantastically wrapped up as if they had flung on the first things they could seize  isnt it perfectly magnificent cried a pretty girl  i wouldnt have missed it on any account  thank you so much mr symington for bringing us out  ah i thought youd like it said this mr symington who must have been the host and you can enjoy it without the least compunction miss delano for i happen to know that the house belongs to a man who could afford to burn one up for you once a year  oh do you think he would if i came again  i havent the least doubt of it  we dont do things by halves in boston  he ought to have had a coat of his noncombustible paint on it said another gentleman of the party  penelope pulled her father away toward the first carriage she could reach of a number that had driven up  here father get into this  no no i couldnt ride he answered heavily and he walked home in silence  he greeted his wife with well persis our house is gone and i guess i set it on fire myself and while he rummaged among the papers in his desk still with his coat and hat on his wife got the facts as she could from penelope  she did not reproach him  here was a case in which his selfreproach must be sufficiently sharp without any edge from her  besides her mind was full of a terrible thought  o silas she faltered theyll think you set it on fire to get the insurance  lapham was staring at a paper which he held in his hand  i had a builders risk on it but it expired last week  its a dead loss  oh thank the merciful lord cried his wife  merciful said lapham  well its a queer way of showing it  he went to bed and fell into the deep sleep which sometimes follows a great moral shock  it was perhaps rather a torpor than a sleep    xxv   lapham awoke confused and in a kind of remoteness from the loss of the night before through which it loomed mistily  but before he lifted his head from the pillow it gathered substance and weight against which it needed all his will to bear up and live  in that moment he wished that he had not wakened that he might never have wakened but he rose and faced the day and its cares  the morning papers brought the report of the fire and the conjectured loss  the reporters somehow had found out the fact that the loss fell entirely upon lapham they lighted up the hackneyed character of their statements with the picturesque interest of the coincidence that the policy had expired only the week before heaven knows how they knew it they said that nothing remained of the building but the walls and lapham on his way to business walked up past the smokestained shell the windows looked like the eyesockets of a skull down upon the blackened and trampled snow of the street the pavement was a sheet of ice and the water from the engines had frozen like streams of tears down the face of the house and hung in icy tags from the windowsills and copings  he gathered himself up as well as he could and went on to his office the chance of retrieval that had flashed upon him as he sat smoking by that ruined hearth the evening before stood him in such stead now as a sole hope may and he said to himself that having resolved not to sell his house he was no more crippled by its loss than he would have been by letting his money lie idle in it what he might have raised by mortgage on it could be made up in some other way and if they would sell he could still buy out the whole business of that west virginia company mines plant stock on hand goodwill and everything and unite it with his own  he went early in the afternoon to see bellingham whose expressions of condolence for his loss he cut short with as much politeness as he knew how to throw into his impatience bellingham seemed at first a little dazzled with the splendid courage of his scheme it was certainly fine in its way but then he began to have his misgivings  i happen to know that they havent got much money behind them urged lapham  theyll jump at an offer  bellingham shook his head  if they can show profit on the old manufacture and prove they can make their paint still cheaper and better hereafter they can have all the money they want  and it will be very difficult for you to raise it if youre threatened by them with that competition you know what your plant at lapham would be worth and what the shrinkage on your manufactured stock would be better sell out to them he concluded if they will buy  there aint money enough in this country to buy out my paint said lapham buttoning up his coat in a quiver of resentment  good afternoon sir men are but grownup boys after all  bellingham watched this perversely proud and obstinate child fling petulantly out of his door and felt a sympathy for him which was as truly kind as it was helpless  but lapham was beginning to see through bellingham as he believed bellingham was in his way part of that conspiracy by which laphams creditors were trying to drive him to the wall  more than ever now he was glad that he had nothing to do with that coldhearted selfconceited race and that the favours so far were all from his side  he was more than ever determined to show them every one of them high and low that he and his children could get along without them and prosper and triumph without them  he said to himself that if penelope were engaged to corey that very minute he would make her break with him  he knew what he should do now and he was going to do it without loss of time  he was going on to new york to see those west virginia people they had their principal office there and he intended to get at their ideas and then he intended to make them an offer  he managed this business better than could possibly have been expected of a man in his impassioned mood  but when it came really to business his practical instincts alert and wary came to his aid against the passions that lay in wait to betray after they ceased to dominate him he found the west virginians full of zeal and hope but in ten minutes he knew that they had not yet tested their strength in the money market and had not ascertained how much or how little capital they could command  lapham himself if he had had so much would not have hesitated to put a million dollars into their business  he saw as they did not see that they had the game in their own hands and that if they could raise the money to extend their business they could ruin him  it was only a question of time and he was on the ground first he frankly proposed a union of their interests  he admitted that they had a good thing and that he should have to fight them hard but he meant to fight them to the death unless they could come to some sort of terms  now the question was whether they had better go on and make a heavy loss for both sides by competition or whether they had better form a partnership to run both paints and command the whole market lapham made them three propositions each of which was fair and open to sell out to them altogether to buy them out altogether to join facilities and forces with them and go on in an invulnerable alliance let them name a figure at which they would buy a figure at which they would sell a figure at which they would combineor in other words the amount of capital they needed  they talked all day going out to lunch together at the astor house and sitting with their knees against the counter on a row of stools before it for fifteen minutes of reflection and deglutition with their hats on and then returning to the basement from which they emerged the west virginia companys name was lettered in gilt on the wide low window and its paint in the form of ore burnt and mixed formed a display on the window shelf lapham examined it and praised it from time to time they all recurred to it together they sent out for some of laphams paint and compared it the west virginians admitting its former superiority  they were young fellows and country persons like lapham by origin and they looked out with the same amused undaunted provincial eyes at the myriad metropolitan legs passing on the pavement above the level of their window  he got on well with them  at last they said what they would do  they said it was nonsense to talk of buying lapham out for they had not the money and as for selling out they would not do it for they knew they had a big thing  but they would as soon use his capital to develop it as anybody elses and if he could put in a certain sum for this purpose they would go in with him  he should run the works at lapham and manage the business in boston and they would run the works at kanawha falls and manage the business in new york  the two brothers with whom lapham talked named their figure subject to the approval of another brother at kanawha falls to whom they would write and who would telegraph his answer so that lapham could have it inside of three days  but they felt perfectly sure that he would approve and lapham started back on the eleven oclock train with an elation that gradually left him as he drew near boston where the difficulties of raising this sum were to be over come  it seemed to him then that those fellows had put it up on him pretty steep but he owned to himself that they had a sure thing and that they were right in believing they could raise the same sum elsewhere it would take all of it he admitted to make their paint pay on the scale they had the right to expect  at their age he would not have done differently but when he emerged old sore and sleepbroken from the sleepingcar in the albany depot at boston he wished with a pathetic selfpity that they knew how a man felt at his age  a year ago six months ago he would have laughed at the notion that it would be hard to raise the money  but he thought ruefully of that immense stock of paint on hand which was now a drug in the market of his losses by rogers and by the failures of other men of the fire that had licked up so many thousands in a few hours he thought with bitterness of the tens of thousands that he had gambled away in stocks and of the commissions that the brokers had pocketed whether he won or lost and he could not think of any securities on which he could borrow except his house in nankeen square or the mine and works at lapham  he set his teeth in helpless rage when he thought of that property out on the g l  p that ought to be worth so much and was worth so little if the road chose to say so  he did not go home but spent most of the day shining round as he would have expressed it and trying to see if he could raise the money but he found that people of whom he hoped to get it were in the conspiracy which had been formed to drive him to the wall  somehow there seemed a sense of his embarrassments abroad  nobody wanted to lend money on the plant at lapham without taking time to look into the state of the business but lapham had no time to give and he knew that the state of the business would not bear looking into  he could raise fifteen thousand on his nankeen square house and another fifteen on his beacon street lot and this was all that a man who was worth a million by rights could do he said a million and he said it in defiance of bellingham who had subjected his figures to an analysis which wounded lapham more than he chose to show at the time for it proved that he was not so rich and not so wise as he had seemed  his hurt vanity forbade him to go to bellingham now for help or advice and if he could have brought himself to ask his brothers for money it would have been useless they were simply welltodo western people but not capitalists on the scale he required  lapham stood in the isolation to which adversity so often seems to bring men  when its test was applied practically or theoretically to all those who had seemed his friends there was none who bore it and he thought with bitter selfcontempt of the people whom he had befriended in their time of need  he said to himself that he had been a fool for that and he scorned himself for certain acts of scrupulosity by which he had lost money in the past  seeing the moral forces all arrayed against him lapham said that he would like to have the chance offered him to get even with them again he thought he should know how to look out for himself  as he understood it he had several days to turn about in and he did not let one days failure dishearten him  the morning after his return he had in fact a gleam of luck that gave him the greatest encouragement for the moment  a man came in to inquire about one of rogerss wildcat patents as lapham called them and ended by buying it  he got it of course for less than lapham took it for but lapham was glad to be rid of it for something when he had thought it worth nothing and when the transaction was closed he asked the purchaser rather eagerly if he knew where rogers was it was laphams secret belief that rogers had found there was money in the thing and had sent the man to buy it but it appeared that this was a mistake the man had not come from rogers but had heard of the patent in another way and lapham was astonished in the afternoon when his boy came to tell him that rogers was in the outer office and wished to speak with him  all right said lapham and he could not command at once the severity for the reception of rogers which he would have liked to use  he found himself in fact so much relaxed towards him by the mornings touch of prosperity that he asked him to sit down gruffly of course but distinctly and when rogers said in his lifeless way and with the effect of keeping his appointment of a month before those english parties are in town and would like to talk with you in reference to the mills lapham did not turn him outofdoors  he sat looking at him and trying to make out what rogers was after for he did not believe that the english parties if they existed had any notion of buying his mills  what if they are not for sale he asked  you know that ive been expecting an offer from the g l  p  ive kept watch of that  they havent made you any offer said rogers quietly  and did you think demanded lapham firing up that i would turn them in on somebody else as you turned them in on me when the chances are that they wont be worth ten cents on the dollar six months from now  i didnt know what you would do said rogers noncommittally  ive come here to tell you that these parties stand ready to take the mills off your hands at a fair valuationat the value i put upon them when i turned them in  i dont believe you cried lapham brutally but a wild predatory hope made his heart leap so that it seemed to turn over in his breast  i dont believe there are any such parties to begin with and in the next place i dont believe they would buy at any such figure unlessunless youve lied to them as youve lied to me  did you tell them about the g l  p  rogers looked compassionately at him but he answered with unvaried dryness i did not think that necessary  lapham had expected this answer and he had expected or intended to break out in furious denunciation of rogers when he got it but he only found himself saying in a sort of baffled gasp i wonder what your game is  rogers did not reply categorically but he answered with his impartial calm and as if lapham had said nothing to indicate that he differed at all with him as to disposing of the property in the way he had suggested if we should succeed in selling i should be able to repay you your loans and should have a little capital for a scheme that i think of going into  and do you think that i am going to steal these mens money to help you plunder somebody in a new scheme answered lapham  the sneer was on behalf of virtue but it was still a sneer  i suppose the money would be useful to you too just now  why  because i know that you have been trying to borrow  at this proof of wicked omniscience in rogers the question whether he had better not regard the affair as a fatality and yield to his destiny flashed upon lapham but he answered i shall want money a great deal worse than ive ever wanted it yet before i go into such rascally business with you  dont you know that we might as well knock these parties down on the street and take the money out of their pockets  they have come on answered rogers from portland to see you  i expected them some weeks ago but they disappointed me  they arrived on the circassian last night they expected to have got in five days ago but the passage was very stormy  where are they asked lapham with helpless irrelevance and feeling himself somehow drifted from his moorings by rogerss shipping intelligence  they are at youngs i told them we would call upon them after dinner this evening they dine late  oh you did did you asked lapham trying to drop another anchor for a fresh clutch on his underlying principles  well now you go and tell them that i said i wouldnt come  their stay is limited remarked rogers  i mentioned this evening because they were not certain they could remain over another night but if tomorrow would suit you better  tell em i shant come at all roared lapham as much in terror as defiance for he felt his anchor dragging  tell em i shant come at all do you understand that  i dont see why you should stickle as to the matter of going to them said rogers but if you think it will be better to have them approach you i suppose i can bring them to you  no you cant i shant let you i shant see them i shant have anything to do with them  now do you understand  i inferred from our last interview persisted rogers unmoved by all this violent demonstration of laphams that you wished to meet these parties  you told me that you would give me time to produce them and i have promised them that you would meet them i have committed myself  it was true that lapham had defied rogers to bring on his men and had implied his willingness to negotiate with them  that was before he had talked the matter over with his wife and perceived his moral responsibility in it even she had not seen this at once  he could not enter into this explanation with rogers he could only say i said id give you twentyfour hours to prove yourself a liar and you did it  i didnt say twentyfour days  i dont see the difference returned rogers  the parties are here now and that proves that i was acting in good faith at the time there has been no change in the posture of affairs  you dont know now any more than you knew then that the g l  p is going to want the property  if theres any difference its in favour of the roads having changed its mind  there was some sense in this and lapham felt itfelt it only too eagerly as he recognised the next instant  rogers went on quietly youre not obliged to sell to these parties when you meet them but youve allowed me to commit myself to them by the promise that you would talk with them  twant a promise said lapham  it was the same thing they have come out from england on my guaranty that there was such and such an opening for their capital and now what am i to say to them  it places me in a ridiculous position rogers urged his grievance calmly almost impersonally making his appeal to laphams sense of justice  i cant go back to those parties and tell them you wont see them  its no answer to make  theyve got a right to know why you wont see them  very well then cried lapham ill come and tell them why  who shall i ask for when shall i be there  at eight oclock please said rogers rising without apparent alarm at his threat if it was a threat  and ask for me ive taken a room at the hotel for the present  i wont keep you five minutes when i get there said lapham but he did not come away till ten oclock  it appeared to him as if the very devil was in it  the englishmen treated his downright refusal to sell as a piece of bluff and talked on as though it were merely the opening of the negotiation  when he became plain with them in his anger and told them why he would not sell they seemed to have been prepared for this as a stroke of business and were ready to meet it  has this fellow he demanded twisting his head in the direction of rogers but disdaining to notice him otherwise been telling you that its part of my game to say this well sir i can tell you on my side that there isnt a slipperier rascal unhung in america than milton k rogers  the englishmen treated this as a piece of genuine american humour and returned to the charge with unabated courage  they owned now that a person interested with them had been out to look at the property and that they were satisfied with the appearance of things  they developed further the fact that they were not acting solely or even principally in their own behalf but were the agents of people in england who had projected the colonisation of a sort of community on the spot somewhat after the plan of other english dreamers and that they were satisfied from a careful inspection that the resources and facilities were those best calculated to develop the energy and enterprise of the proposed community  they were prepared to meet mr laphamcolonel they begged his pardon at the instance of rogersat any reasonable figure and were quite willing to assume the risks he had pointed out  something in the eyes of these men something that lurked at an infinite depth below their speech and was not really in their eyes when lapham looked again had flashed through him a sense of treachery in them  he had thought them the dupes of rogers but in that brief instant he had seen themor thought he had seen themhis accomplices ready to betray the interests of which they went on to speak with a certain comfortable jocosity and a certain incredulous slight of his show of integrity it was a deeper game than lapham was used to and he sat looking with a sort of admiration from one englishman to the other and then to rogers who maintained an exterior of modest neutrality and whose air said i have brought you gentlemen together as the friend of all parties and i now leave you to settle it among yourselves  i ask nothing and expect nothing except the small sum which shall accrue to me after the discharge of my obligations to colonel lapham  while rogerss presence expressed this one of the englishmen was saying and if you have any scruple in allowin us to assume this risk colonel lapham perhaps you can console yourself with the fact that the loss if there is to be any will fall upon people who are able to bear itupon an association of rich and charitable people but were quite satisfied there will be no loss he added savingly all you have to do is to name your price and we will do our best to meet it  there was nothing in the englishmans sophistry very shocking to lapham  it addressed itself in him to that easygoing not evilly intentioned potential immorality which regards common property as common prey and gives us the most corrupt municipal governments under the sunwhich makes the poorest voter when he has tricked into place as unscrupulous in regard to others money as an hereditary prince lapham met the englishmans eye and with difficulty kept himself from winking  then he looked away and tried to find out where he stood or what he wanted to do  he could hardly tell  he had expected to come into that room and unmask rogers and have it over  but he had unmasked rogers without any effect whatever and the play had only begun  he had a whimsical and sarcastic sense of its being very different from the plays at the theatre  he could not get up and go away in silent contempt he could not tell the englishmen that he believed them a pair of scoundrels and should have nothing to do with them he could no longer treat them as innocent dupes  he remained baffled and perplexed and the one who had not spoken hitherto remarked  of course we shant aggle about a few pound more or less  if colonel laphams figure should be a little larger than ours ive no doubt ell not be too ard upon us in the end  lapham appreciated all the intent of this subtle suggestion and understood as plainly as if it had been said in so many words that if they paid him a larger price it was to be expected that a certain portion of the purchasemoney was to return to their own hands  still he could not move and it seemed to him that he could not speak  ring that bell mr rogers said the englishman who had last spoken glancing at the annunciator button in the wall near rogerss head and ave up something of cant you i should like to wet me wistle as you say ere and colonel lapham seems to find it rather dry work  lapham jumped to his feet and buttoned his overcoat about him  he remembered with terror the dinner at coreys where he had disgraced and betrayed himself and if he went into this thing at all he was going into it sober  i cant stop he said i must be going  but you havent given us an answer yet mr lapham said the first englishman with a successful show of dignified surprise  the only answer i can give you now is no said lapham  if you want another you must let me have time to think it over  but ow much time said the other englishman  were pressed for time ourselves and we hoped for an answeroped for a hanswer he corrected himself at once  that was our understandin with mr rogers  i cant let you know till morning anyway said lapham and he went out as his custom often was without any parting salutation  he thought rogers might try to detain him but rogers had remained seated when the others got to their feet and paid no attention to his departure  he walked out into the night air every pulse throbbing with the strong temptation  he knew very well those men would wait and gladly wait till the morning and that the whole affair was in his hands  it made him groan in spirit to think that it was  if he had hoped that some chance might take the decision from him there was no such chance in the present or future that he could see  it was for him alone to commit this rascalityif it was a rascalityor not  he walked all the way home letting one car after another pass him on the street now so empty of other passing and it was almost eleven oclock when he reached home  a carriage stood before his house and when he let himself in with his key he heard talking in the familyroom it came into his head that irene had got back unexpectedly and that the sight of her was somehow going to make it harder for him then he thought it might be corey come upon some desperate pretext to see penelope but when he opened the door he saw with a certain absence of surprise that it was rogers  he was standing with his back to the fireplace talking to mrs lapham and he had been shedding tears dry tears they seemed and they had left a sort of sandy glistening trace on his cheeks  apparently he was not ashamed of them for the expression with which he met lapham was that of a man making a desperate appeal in his own cause which was identical with that of humanity if not that of justice  i some expected began rogers to find you here  no you didnt interrupted lapham you wanted to come here and make a poor mouth to mrs lapham before i got home  i knew that mrs lapham would know what was going on said rogers more candidly but not more virtuously for that he could not and i wished her to understand a point that i hadnt put to you at the hotel and that i want you should consider  and i want you should consider me a little in this business too youre not the only one thats concerned i tell you and ive been telling mrs lapham that its my one chance that if you dont meet me on it my wife and children will be reduced to beggary  so will mine said lapham or the next thing to it  well then i want you to give me this chance to get on my feet again youve no right to deprive me of it its unchristian  in our dealings with each other we should be guided by the golden rule as i was saying to mrs lapham before you came in  i told her that if i knew myself i should in your place consider the circumstances of a man in mine who had honourably endeavoured to discharge his obligations to me and had patiently borne my undeserved suspicions  i should consider that mans family i told mrs lapham  did you tell her that if i went in with you and those fellows i should be robbing the people who trusted them  i dont see what youve got to do with the people that sent them here they are rich people and could bear it if it came to the worst  but theres no likelihood now that it will come to the worst you can see yourself that the road has changed its mind about buying  and here am i without a cent in the world and my wife is an invalid  she needs comforts she needs little luxuries and she hasnt even the necessaries and you want to sacrifice her to a mere idea you dont know in the first place that the road will ever want to buy and if it does the probability is that with a colony like that planted on its line it would make very different terms from what it would with you or me  these agents are not afraid and their principals are rich people and if there was any loss it would be divided up amongst them so that they wouldnt any of them feel it  lapham stole a troubled glance at his wife and saw that there was no help in her  whether she was daunted and confused in her own conscience by the outcome so evil and disastrous of the reparation to rogers which she had forced her husband to make or whether her perceptions had been blunted and darkened by the appeals which rogers had now used it would be difficult to say  probably there was a mixture of both causes in the effect which her husband felt in her and from which he turned girding himself anew to rogers  i have no wish to recur to the past continued rogers with growing superiority  you have shown a proper spirit in regard to that and you have done what you could to wipe it out  i should think i had said lapham  ive used up about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars trying  some of my enterprises rogers admitted have been unfortunate seemingly but i have hopes that they will yet turn out wellin time i cant understand why you should be so mindful of others now when you showed so little regard for me then  i had come to your aid at a time when you needed help and when you got on your feet you kicked me out of the business  i dont complain but that is the fact and i had to begin again after i had supposed myself settled in life and establish myself elsewhere  lapham glanced again at his wife her head had fallen he could see that she was so rooted in her old remorse for that questionable act of his amply and more than fully atoned for since that she was helpless now in the crucial moment when he had the utmost need of her insight he had counted upon her he perceived now that when he had thought it was for him alone to decide he had counted upon her just spirit to stay his own in its struggle to be just  he had not forgotten how she held out against him only a little while ago when he asked her whether he might not rightfully sell in some such contingency as this and it was not now that she said or even looked anything in favour of rogers but that she was silent against him which dismayed lapham  he swallowed the lump that rose in his throat the selfpity the pity for her the despair and said gently i guess you better go to bed persis  its pretty late  she turned towards the door when rogers said with the obvious intention of detaining her through her curiosity  but i let that pass  and i dont ask now that you should sell to these men  mrs lapham paused irresolute  what are you making this bother for then demanded lapham  what do you want  what ive been telling your wife here  i want you should sell to me i dont say what im going to do with the property and you will not have an iota of responsibility whatever happens  lapham was staggered and he saw his wifes face light up with eager question  i want that property continued rogers and ive got the money to buy it  what will you take for it if its the price youre standing out for  persis said lapham go to bed and he gave her a look that meant obedience for her  she went out of the door and left him with his tempter  if you think im going to help you whip the devil round the stump youre mistaken in your man milton rogers said lapham lighting a cigar  as soon as i sold to you you would sell to that other pair of rascals  i smelt em out in half a minute  they are christian gentlemen said rogers  but i dont purpose defending them and i dont purpose telling you what i shall or shall not do with the property when it is in my hands again  the question is will you sell and if so what is your figure you have got nothing whatever to do with it after youve sold  it was perfectly true  any lawyer would have told him the same  he could not help admiring rogers for his ingenuity and every selfish interest of his nature joined with many obvious duties to urge him to consent  he did not see why he should refuse  there was no longer a reason  he was standing out alone for nothing any one else would say he smoked on as if rogers were not there and rogers remained before the fire as patient as the clock ticking behind his head on the mantel and showing the gleam of its pendulum beyond his face on either side but at last he said well  well answered lapham you cant expect me to give you an answer tonight any more than before  you know that what youve said now hasnt changed the thing a bit  i wish it had  the lord knows i want to be rid of the property fast enough then why dont you sell to me cant you see that you will not be responsible for what happens after you have sold  no i cant see that but if i can by morning ill sell  why do you expect to know any better by morning  youre wasting time for nothing cried rogers in his disappointment  why are you so particular when you drove me out of the business you were not so very particular  lapham winced  it was certainly ridiculous for man who had once so selfishly consulted his own interests to be stickling now about the rights of others  i guess nothings going to happen overnight he answered sullenly anyway i shant say what i shall do till morning  what time can i see you in the morning  halfpast nine  rogers buttoned his coat and went out of the room without another word  lapham followed him to close the streetdoor after him  his wife called down to him from above as he approached the room again well  ive told him id let him know in the morning  want i should come down and talk with you  no answered lapham in the proud bitterness which his isolation brought you couldnt do any good he went in and shut the door and by and by his wife heard him begin walking up and down and then the rest of the night she lay awake and listened to him walking up and down  but when the first light whitened the window the words of the scripture came into her mind and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and he said let me go for the day breaketh  and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me  she could not ask him anything when they met but he raised his dull eyes after the first silence and said i dont know what im going to say to rogers  she could not speak she did not know what to say and she saw her husband when she followed him with her eyes from the window drag heavily down toward the corner where he was to take the horsecar  he arrived rather later than usual at his office and he found his letters already on his table  there was one long and officiallooking with a printed letterheading on the outside and lapham had no need to open it in order to know that it was the offer of the great lacustrine  polar railroad for his mills  but he went mechanically through the verification of his prophetic fear which was also his sole hope and then sat looking blankly at it  rogers came promptly at the appointed time and lapham handed him the letter  he must have taken it all in at a glance and seen the impossibility of negotiating any further now even with victims so pliant and willing as those englishmen  youve ruined me rogers broke out  i havent a cent left in the world god help my poor wife  he went out and lapham remained staring at the door which closed upon him  this was his reward for standing firm for right and justice to his own destruction to feel like a thief and a murderer    xxvi   later in the forenoon came the despatch from the west virginians in new york saying their brother assented to their agreement and it now remained for lapham to fulfil his part of it  he was ludicrously far from able to do this and unless he could get some extension of time from them he must lose this chance his only chance to retrieve himself  he spent the time in a desperate endeavour to raise the money but he had not raised the half of it when the banks closed with shame in his heart he went to bellingham from whom he had parted so haughtily and laid his plan before him  he could not bring himself to ask bellinghams help but he told him what he proposed to do bellingham pointed out that the whole thing was an experiment and that the price asked was enormous unless a great success were morally certain  he advised delay he advised prudence he insisted that lapham ought at least to go out to kanawha falls and see the mines and works before he put any such sum into the development of the enterprise  thats all well enough cried lapham but if i dont clinch this offer within twentyfour hours theyll withdraw it and go into the market and then where am i  go on and see them again said bellingham  they cant be so peremptory as that with you  they must give you time to look at what they want to sell  if it turns out what you hope thenill see what can be done  but look into it thoroughly  well cried lapham helplessly submitting  he took out his watch and saw that he had forty minutes to catch the four oclock train  he hurried back to his office and put together some papers preparatory to going and despatched a note by his boy to mrs lapham saying that he was starting for new york and did not know just when he should get back  the early spring day was raw and cold  as he went out through the office he saw the clerks at work with their streetcoats and hats on miss dewey had her jacket dragged up on her shoulders and looked particularly comfortless as she operated her machine with her red fingers  whats up asked lapham stopping a moment  seems to be something the matter with the steam she answered with the air of unmerited wrong habitual with so many pretty women who have to work for a living  well take your writer into my room  theres a fire in the stove there said lapham passing out  half an hour later his wife came into the outer office  she had passed the day in a passion of selfreproach gradually mounting from the mental numbness in which he had left her and now she could wait no longer to tell him that she saw how she had forsaken him in his hour of trial and left him to bear it alone  she wondered at herself in shame and dismay she wondered that she could have been so confused as to the real point by that old wretch of a rogers that she could have let him hoodwink her so even for a moment  it astounded her that such a thing should have happened for if there was any virtue upon which this good woman prided herself in which she thought herself superior to her husband it was her instant and steadfast perception of right and wrong and the ability to choose the right to her own hurt  but she had now to confess as each of us has had likewise to confess in his own case that the very virtue on which she had prided herself was the thing that had played her false that she had kept her mind so long upon that old wrong which she believed her husband had done this man that she could not detach it but clung to the thought of reparation for it when she ought to have seen that he was proposing a piece of roguery as the means  the suffering which lapham must inflict on him if he decided against him had been more to her apprehension than the harm he might do if he decided for him  but now she owned her limitations to herself and above everything in the world she wished the man whom her conscience had roused and driven on whither her intelligence had not followed to do right to do what he felt to be right and nothing else  she admired and revered him for going beyond her and she wished to tell him that she did not know what he had determined to do about rogers but that she knew it was right and would gladly abide the consequences with him whatever they were  she had not been near his place of business for nearly a year and her heart smote her tenderly as she looked about her there and thought of the early days when she knew as much about the paint as he did she wished that those days were back again  she saw corey at his desk and she could not bear to speak to him she dropped her veil that she need not recognise him and pushed on to laphams room and opening the door without knocking shut it behind her  then she became aware with intolerable disappointment that her husband was not there  instead a very pretty girl sat at his desk operating a typewriter  she seemed quite at home and she paid mrs lapham the scant attention which such young women often bestow upon people not personally interesting to them  it vexed the wife that any one else should seem to be helping her husband about business that she had once been so intimate with and she did not at all like the girls indifference to her presence  her hat and sack hung on a nail in one corner and laphams office coat looking intensely like him to his wifes familiar eye hung on a nail in the other corner and mrs lapham liked even less than the girls good looks this domestication of her garments in her husbands office  she began to ask herself excitedly why he should be away from his office when she happened to come and she had not the strength at the moment to reason herself out of her unreasonableness  when will colonel lapham be in do you suppose she sharply asked of the girl  i couldnt say exactly replied the girl without looking round  has he been out long  i dont know as i noticed said the girl looking up at the clock without looking at mrs lapham  she went on working her machine  well i cant wait any longer said the wife abruptly  when colonel lapham comes in you please tell him mrs lapham wants to see him  the girl started to her feet and turned toward mrs lapham with a red and startled face which she did not lift to confront her yesyesi will she faltered  the wife went home with a sense of defeat mixed with an irritation about this girl which she could not quell or account for  she found her husbands message and it seemed intolerable that he should have gone to new york without seeing her she asked herself in vain what the mysterious business could be that took him away so suddenly  she said to herself that he was neglecting her he was leaving her out a little too much and in demanding of herself why he had never mentioned that girl there in his office she forgot how much she had left herself out of his business life  that was another curse of their prosperity well she was glad the prosperity was going it had never been happiness  after this she was going to know everything as she used  she tried to dismiss the whole matter till lapham returned and if there had been anything for her to do in that miserable house as she called it in her thought she might have succeeded  but again the curse was on her there was nothing to do and the looks of that girl kept coming back to her vacancy her disoccupation  she tried to make herself something to do but that beauty which she had not liked followed her amid the work of overhauling the summer clothing which irene had seen to putting away in the fall  who was the thing anyway it was very strange her being there why did she jump up in that frightened way when mrs lapham had named herself  after dark that evening when the question had worn away its poignancy from mere iteration a note for mrs lapham was left at the door by a messenger who said there was no answer  a note for me she said staring at the unknown and somehow artificiallooking handwriting of the superscription  then she opened it and read ask your husband about his lady copyingclerk  a friend and wellwisher who signed the note gave no other name  mrs lapham sat helpless with it in her hand  her brain reeled she tried to fight the madness off but before lapham came back the second morning it had become with lessening intervals of sanity and release a demoniacal possession  she passed the night without sleep without rest in the frenzy of the cruellest of the passions which covers with shame the unhappy soul it possesses and murderously lusts for the misery of its object  if she had known where to find her husband in new york she would have followed him she waited his return in an ecstasy of impatience  in the morning he came back looking spent and haggard  she saw him drive up to the door and she ran to let him in herself  who is that girl youve got in your office silas lapham she demanded when her husband entered  girl in my office  yes who is she what is she doing there  why what have you heard about her  never you mind what ive heard  who is she is it mrs m that you gave that money to i want to know who she is i want to know what a respectable man with grownup girls of his own is doing with such a looking thing as that in his office i want to know how long shes been there i want to know what shes there at all for  he had mechanically pushed her before him into the long darkened parlour and he shut himself in there with her now to keep the household from hearing her lifted voice  for a while he stood bewildered and could not have answered if he would and then he would not  he merely asked have i ever accused you of anything wrong persis  you no need to she answered furiously placing herself against the closed door  did you ever know me to do anything out of the way  that isnt what i asked you  well i guess you may find out about that girl yourself  get away from the door  i wont get away from the door  she felt herself set lightly aside and her husband opened the door and went out  i will find out about her she screamed after him  ill find out and ill disgrace you  ill teach you how to treat me  the air blackened round her she reeled to the sofa and then she found herself waking from a faint  she did not know how long she had lain there she did not care  in a moment her madness came whirling back upon her  she rushed up to his room it was empty the closetdoors stood ajar and the drawers were open he must have packed a bag hastily and fled  she went out and wandered crazily up and down till she found a hack  she gave the driver her husbands business address and told him to drive there as fast as he could and three times she lowered the window to put her head out and ask him if he could not hurry  a thousand things thronged into her mind to support her in her evil will she remembered how glad and proud that man had been to marry her and how everybody said she was marrying beneath her when she took him  she remembered how good she had always been to him how perfectly devoted slaving early and late to advance him and looking out for his interests in all things and sparing herself in nothing  if it had not been for her he might have been driving stage yet and since their troubles had begun the troubles which his own folly and imprudence had brought on them her conduct had been that of a true and faithful wife was he the sort of man to be allowed to play her false with impunity she set her teeth and drew her breath sharply through them when she thought how willingly she had let him befool her and delude her about that memorandum of payments to mrs m because she loved him so much and pitied him for his cares and anxieties  she recalled his confusion his guilty looks  she plunged out of the carriage so hastily when she reached the office that she did not think of paying the driver and he had to call after her when she had got halfway up the stairs  then she went straight to laphams room with outrage in her heart  there was again no one there but that typewriter girl she jumped to her feet in a fright as mrs lapham dashed the door to behind her and flung up her veil  the two women confronted each other  why the good land cried mrs lapham aint you zerrilla millon  iim married faltered the girl my names dewey now  youre jim millons daughter anyway  how long have you been here  i havent been here regularly ive been here off and on ever since last may  wheres your mother  shes herein boston  mrs lapham kept her eyes on the girl but she dropped trembling into her husbands chair and a sort of amaze and curiosity were in her voice instead of the fury she had meant to put there  the colonel continued zerrilla hes been helping us and hes got me a typewriter so that i can help myself a little  mothers doing pretty well now and when hen isnt around we can get along  that your husband  i never wanted to marry him but he promised to try to get something to do on shore and mother was all for it because he had a little property then and i thought may be id better  but its turned out just as i said and if he dont stay away long enough this time to let me get the divorcehes agreed to it time and againi dont know what were going to do zerrillas voice fell and the trouble which she could keep out of her face usually when she was comfortably warmed and fed and prettily dressed clouded it in the presence of a sympathetic listener  i saw it was you when you came in the other day she went on but you didnt seem to know me  i suppose the colonels told you that theres a gentleman going to marry memr wemmels his nameas soon as i get the divorce but sometimes im completely discouraged it dont seem as if i ever could get it  mrs lapham would not let her know that she was ignorant of the fact attributed to her knowledge  she remained listening to zerrilla and piecing out the whole history of her presence there from the facts of the past and the traits of her husbands character  one of the things she had always had to fight him about was that idea of his that he was bound to take care of jim millons worthless wife and her child because millon had got the bullet that was meant for him  it was a perfect superstition of his she could not beat it out of him but she had made him promise the last time he had done anything for that woman that it should be the last time  he had then got her a little house in one of the fishing ports where she could take the sailors to board and wash for and earn an honest living if she would keep straight  that was five or six years ago and mrs lapham had heard nothing of mrs millon since she had heard quite enough of her before and had known her idle and baddish ever since she was the worst little girl at school in lumberville and all through her shameful girlhood and the married days which she had made so miserable to the poor fellow who had given her his decent name and a chance to behave herself  mrs lapham had no mercy on moll millon and she had quarrelled often enough with her husband for befriending her  as for the child if the mother would put zerrilla out with some respectable family that would be one thing but as long as she kept zerrilla with her she was against letting her husband do anything for either of them  he had done ten times as much for them now as he had any need to and she had made him give her his solemn word that he would do no more  she saw now that she was wrong to make him give it and that he must have broken it again and again for the reason that he had given when she once scolded him for throwing away his money on that hussy  when i think of jim millon ive got to thats all  she recalled now that whenever she had brought up the subject of mrs millon and her daughter he had seemed shy of it and had dropped it with some guess that they were getting along now  she wondered that she had not thought at once of mrs millon when she saw that memorandum about mrs m but the woman had passed so entirely out of her life that she had never dreamt of her in connection with it  her husband had deceived her yet her heart was no longer hot against him but rather tenderly grateful that his deceit was in this sort and not in that other  all cruel and shameful doubt of him went out of it  she looked at this beautiful girl who had blossomed out of her knowledge since she saw her last and she knew that she was only a blossomed weed of the same worthless root as her mother and saved if saved from the same evil destiny by the good of her father in her but so far as the girl and her mother were concerned mrs lapham knew that her husband was to blame for nothing but his wilful wrongheaded kindheartedness which her own exactions had turned into deceit  she remained a while questioning the girl quietly about herself and her mother and then with a better mind towards zerrilla at least than she had ever had before she rose up and went out  there must have been some outer hint of the exhaustion in which the subsidence of her excitement had left her within for before she had reached the head of the stairs corey came towards her  can i be of any use to you mrs lapham the colonel was here just before you came in on his way to the train  yesyes i didnt knowi thought perhaps i could catch him here but it dont matter  i wish you would let some one go with me to get a carriage she begged feebly  ill go with you myself said the young fellow ignoring the strangeness in her manner  he offered her his arm in the twilight of the staircase and she was glad to put her trembling hand through it and keep it there till he helped her into a hack which he found for her  he gave the driver her direction and stood looking a little anxiously at her  i thank you i am all right now she said and he bade the man drive on  when she reached home she went to bed spent with the tumult of her emotions and sick with shame and selfreproach  she understood now as clearly as if he had told her in as many words that if he had befriended those worthless jadesthe millons characterised themselves so even to mrs laphams remorsesecretly and in defiance of her it was because he dreaded her blame which was so sharp and bitter for what he could not help doing  it consoled her that he had defied her deceived her when he came back she should tell him that and then it flashed upon her that she did not know where he was gone or whether he would ever come again  if he never came it would be no more than she deserved but she sent for penelope and tried to give herself hopes of escape from this just penalty  lapham had not told his daughter where he was going she had heard him packing his bag and had offered to help him but he had said he could do it best and had gone off as he usually did without taking leave of any one  what were you talking about so loud down in the parlour she asked her mother just before he came up is there any new trouble  no it was nothing  i couldnt tell  once i thought you were laughing she went about closing the curtains on account of her mothers headache and doing awkwardly and imperfectly the things that irene would have done so skilfully for her comfort  the day wore away to nightfall and then mrs lapham said she must know  penelope said there was no one to ask the clerks would all be gone home and her mother said yes there was mr corey they could send and ask him he would know  the girl hesitated  very well she said then scarcely above a whisper and she presently laughed huskily  mr corey seems fated to come in somewhere  i guess its a providence mother  she sent off a note inquiring whether he could tell her just where her father had expected to be that night and the answer came quickly back that corey did not know but would look up the bookkeeper and inquire this office brought him in person an hour later to tell penelope that the colonel was to be at lapham that night and next day  he came in from new york in a great hurry and rushed off as soon as he could pack his bag penelope explained and we hadnt a chance to ask him where he was to be tonight and mother wasnt very well and  i thought she wasnt looking well when she was at the office today and so i thought i would come rather than send corey explained in his turn  oh thank you  if there is anything i can dotelegraph colonel lapham or anything  oh no thank you mothers better now  she merely wanted to be sure where he was  he did not offer to go upon this conclusion of his business but hoped he was not keeping her from her mother  she thanked him once again and said no that her mother was much better since she had had a cup of tea and then they looked at each other and without any apparent exchange of intelligence he remained and at eleven oclock he was still there  he was honest in saying he did not know it was so late but he made no pretence of being sorry and she took the blame to herself  i oughtnt to have let you stay she said  but with father gone and all that trouble hanging over us  she was allowing him to hold her hand a moment at the door to which she had followed him  im so glad you could let me he said and i want to ask you now when i may come again  but if you need me youll  a sharp pull at the doorbell outside made them start asunder and at a sign from penelope who knew that the maids were abed by this time he opened it  why irene shrieked the girl  irene entered with the hackman who had driven her unheard to the door following with her small bags and kissed her sister with resolute composure  thats all she said to the hackman  i gave my checks to the expressman she explained to penelope  corey stood helpless  irene turned upon him and gave him her hand how do you do mr corey she said with a courage that sent a thrill of admiring gratitude through him  wheres mamma pen papa gone to bed  penelope faltered out some reply embodying the facts and irene ran up the stairs to her mothers room  mrs lapham started up in bed at her apparition  irene lapham  uncle william thought he ought to tell me the trouble papa was in and did you think i was going to stay off there junketing while you were going through all this at home and pen acting so silly too you ought to have been ashamed to let me stay so long i started just as soon as i could pack  did you get my despatch i telegraphed from springfield but it dont matter now  here i am  and i dont think i need have hurried on pens account she added with an accent prophetic of the sort of old maid she would become if she happened not to marry  did you see him asked her mother  its the first time hes been here since she told him he mustnt come  i guess it isnt the last time by the looks said irene and before she took off her bonnet she began to undo some of penelopes mistaken arrangements of the room  at breakfast where corey and his mother met the next morning before his father and sisters came down he told her with embarrassment which told much more that he wished now that she would go and call upon the laphams  mrs corey turned a little pale but shut her lips tight and mourned in silence whatever hopes she had lately permitted herself  she answered with roman fortitude of course if theres anything between you and miss lapham your family ought to recognise it  yes said corey  you were reluctant to have me call at first but now if the affair is going on  it is i hopeyes it is  then i ought to go and see her with your sisters and she ought to come here andwe ought all to see her and make the matter public  we cant do so too soon  it will seem as if we were ashamed if we dont  yes you are quite right mother said the young man gratefully and i feel how kind and good you are  i have tried to consider you in this matter though i dont seem to have done so i know what your rights are and i wish with all my heart that i were meeting even your tastes perfectly  but i know you will like her when you come to know her its been very hard for her every wayabout her sisterand shes made a great sacrifice for me  shes acted nobly  mrs corey whose thoughts cannot always be reported said she was sure of it and that all she desired was her sons happiness  shes been very unwilling to consider it an engagement on that account and on account of colonel laphams difficulties  i should like to have you go now for that very reason  i dont know just how serious the trouble is but it isnt a time when we can seem indifferent  the logic of this was not perhaps so apparent to the glasses of fifty as to the eyes of twentysix but mrs corey however she viewed it could not allow herself to blench before the son whom she had taught that to want magnanimity was to be less than gentlemanly  she answered with what composure she could i will take your sisters and then she made some natural inquiries about laphams affairs  oh i hope it will come out all right corey said with a lovers vague smile and left her  when his father came down rubbing his long hands together and looking aloof from all the cares of the practical world in an artistic withdrawal from which his eye ranged over the breakfasttable before he sat down mrs corey told him what she and their son had been saying  he laughed with a delicate impersonal appreciation of the predicament well anna you cant say but if you ever were guilty of supposing yourself porcelain this is a just punishment of your arrogance  here you are bound by the very quality on which youve prided yourself to behave well to a bit of earthenware who is apparently in danger of losing the gilding that rendered her tolerable  we never cared for the money said mrs corey  you know that  no and now we cant seem to care for the loss of it  that would be still worse  either horn of the dilemma gores us  well we still have the comfort we had in the beginning we cant help ourselves and we should only make bad worse by trying  unless we can look to toms inamorata herself for help  mrs corey shook her head so gloomily that her husband broke off with another laugh  but at the continued trouble of her face he said sympathetically my dear i know its a very disagreeable affair and i dont think either of us has failed to see that it was so from the beginning  i have had my way of expressing my sense of it and you yours but we have always been of the same mind about it  we would both have preferred to have tom marry in his own set the laphams are about the last set we could have wished him to marry into  they are uncultivated people and so far as i have seen them im not able to believe that poverty will improve them  still it may  let us hope for the best and let us behave as well as we know how  im sure you will behave well and i shall try  im going with you to call on miss lapham  this is a thing that cant be done by halves  he cut his orange in the neapolitan manner and ate it in quarters    xxvii   irene did not leave her mother in any illusion concerning her cousin will and herself  she said they had all been as nice to her as they could be and when mrs lapham hinted at what had been in her thoughtsor her hopes ratherirene severely snubbed the notion she said that he was as good as engaged to a girl out there and that he had never dreamt of her  her mother wondered at her severity in these few months the girl had toughened and hardened she had lost all her babyish dependence and pliability she was like iron and here and there she was sharpened to a cutting edge  it had been a life and death struggle with her she had conquered but she had also necessarily lost much  perhaps what she had lost was not worth keeping but at any rate she had lost it  she required from her mother a strict and accurate account of her fathers affairs so far as mrs lapham knew them and she showed a businesslike quickness in comprehending them that penelope had never pretended to  with her sister she ignored the past as completely as it was possible to do and she treated both corey and penelope with the justice which their innocence of voluntary offence deserved  it was a difficult part and she kept away from them as much as she could  she had been easily excused on a plea of fatigue from her journey when mr and mrs corey had called the day after her arrival and mrs lapham being still unwell penelope received them alone  the girl had instinctively judged best that they should know the worst at once and she let them have the full brunt of the drawingroom while she was screwing her courage up to come down and see them  she was afterwardsmonths afterwardsable to report to corey that when she entered the room his father was sitting with his hat on his knees a little tilted away from the emancipation group as if he expected the lincoln to hit him with that lifted hand of benediction and that mrs corey looked as if she were not sure but the eagle pecked  but for the time being penelope was as nearly crazed as might be by the complications of her position and received her visitors with a piteous distraction which could not fail of touching bromfield coreys italianised sympatheticism  he was very polite and tender with her at first and ended by making a joke with her to which penelope responded in her sort  he said he hoped they parted friends if not quite acquaintances and she said she hoped they would be able to recognise each other if they ever met again  that is what i meant by her pertness said mrs corey when they were driving away  was it very pert he queried  the child had to answer something  i would much rather she had answered nothing under the circumstances said mrs corey  however she added hopelessly oh shes a merry little grig you can see that and theres no harm in her  i can understand a little why a formal fellow like tom should be taken with her  she hasnt the least reverence i suppose and joked with the young man from the beginning  you must remember anna that there was a time when you liked my joking  it was a very different thing  but that drawingroom pursued corey really i dont see how tom stands that  anna a terrible thought occurs to me fancy tom being married in front of that group with a floral horseshoe in tuberoses coming down on either side of it  bromfield cried his wife you are unmerciful  no no my dear he argued merely imaginative  and i can even imagine that little thing finding tom just the least bit slow at times if it were not for his goodness  tom is so kind that im convinced he sometimes feels your joke in his heart when his head isnt quite clear about it  well we will not despond my dear  your father seemed actually to like her mrs corey reported to her daughters very much shaken in her own prejudices by the fact  if the girl were not so offensive to his fastidiousness there might be some hope that she was not so offensive as mrs corey had thought  i wonder how she will strike you she concluded looking from one daughter to another as if trying to decide which of them would like penelope least  irenes return and the visit of the coreys formed a distraction for the laphams in which their impending troubles seemed to hang further aloof but it was only one of those reliefs which mark the course of adversity and it was not one of the cheerful reliefs  at any other time either incident would have been an anxiety and care for mrs lapham which she would have found hard to bear but now she almost welcomed them  at the end of three days lapham returned and his wife met him as if nothing unusual had marked their parting she reserved her atonement for a fitter time he would know now from the way she acted that she felt all right towards him  he took very little note of her manner but met his family with an austere quiet that puzzled her and a sort of pensive dignity that refined his rudeness to an effect that sometimes comes to such natures after long sickness when the animal strength has been taxed and lowered  he sat silent with her at the table after their girls had left them alone and seeing that he did not mean to speak she began to explain why irene had come home and to praise her  yes she done right said lapham  it was time for her to come he added gently  then he was silent again and his wife told him of coreys having been there and of his fathers and mothers calling  i guess pens concluded to make it up she said  well well see about that said lapham and now she could no longer forbear to ask him about his affairs  i dont know as ive got any right to know anything about it she said humbly with remote allusion to her treatment of him  but i cant help wanting to know  how are things going si  bad he said pushing his plate from him and tilting himself back in his chair  or they aint going at all  theyve stopped  what do you mean si she persisted tenderly  ive got to the end of my string  tomorrow i shall call a meeting of my creditors and put myself in their hands  if theres enough left to satisfy them im satisfied his voice dropped in his throat he swallowed once or twice and then did not speak  do you mean that its all over with you she asked fearfully  he bowed his big head wrinkled and grizzled and after awhile he said its hard to realise it but i guess there aint any doubt about it he drew a long breath and then he explained to her about the west virginia people and how he had got an extension of the first time they had given him and had got a man to go up to lapham with him and look at the worksa man that had turned up in new york and wanted to put money in the business  his money would have enabled lapham to close with the west virginians  the devil was in it right straight along said lapham  all i had to do was to keep quiet about that other company  it was rogers and his property right over again  he liked the look of things and he wanted to go into the business and he had the moneyplenty it would have saved me with those west virginia folks  but i had to tell him how i stood  i had to tell him all about it and what i wanted to do  he began to back water in a minute and the next morning i saw that it was up with him  hes gone back to new york  ive lost my last chance  now all ive got to do is to save the pieces  willwilleverything go she asked  i cant tell yet  but they shall have a chance at everythingevery dollar every cent  im sorry for you persisand the girls  oh dont talk of us she was trying to realise that the simple rude soul to which her heart clove in her youth but which she had put to such cruel proof with her unsparing conscience and her unsparing tongue had been equal to its ordeals and had come out unscathed and unstained  he was able in his talk to make so little of them he hardly seemed to see what they were he was apparently not proud of them and certainly not glad if they were victories of any sort he bore them with the patience of defeat  his wife wished to praise him but she did not know how so she offered him a little reproach in which alone she touched the cause of her behaviour at parting silas she asked after a long gaze at him why didnt you tell me you had jim millons girl there  i didnt suppose youd like it persis he answered  i did intend to tell you at first but then i puti put it off  i thought youd come round some day and find it out for yourself  im punished said his wife for not taking enough interest in your business to even come near it  if were brought back to the day of small things i guess its a lesson for me silas  oh i dont know about the lesson he said wearily  that night she showed him the anonymous scrawl which had kindled her fury against him  he turned it listlessly over in his hand  i guess i know who its from he said giving it back to her and i guess you do too persis  but howhow could he  mebbe he believed it said lapham with patience that cut her more keenly than any reproach  you did  perhaps because the process of his ruin had been so gradual perhaps because the excitement of preceding events had exhausted their capacity for emotion the actual consummation of his bankruptcy brought a relief a repose to lapham and his family rather than a fresh sensation of calamity  in the shadow of his disaster they returned to something like their old united life they were at least all together again and it will be intelligible to those whom life has blessed with vicissitude that lapham should come home the evening after he had given up everything to his creditors and should sit down to his supper so cheerful that penelope could joke him in the old way and tell him that she thought from his looks they had concluded to pay him a hundred cents on every dollar he owed them  as james bellingham had taken so much interest in his troubles from the first lapham thought he ought to tell him before taking the final step just how things stood with him and what ho meant to do bellingham made some futile inquiries about his negotiations with the west virginians and lapham told him they had come to nothing  he spoke of the new york man and the chance that he might have sold out half his business to him  but of course i had to let him know how it was about those fellows  of course said bellingham not seeing till afterwards the full significance of laphams action  lapham said nothing about rogers and the englishmen  he believed that he had acted right in that matter and he was satisfied but he did not care to have bellingham or anybody perhaps think he had been a fool  all those who were concerned in his affairs said he behaved well and even more than well when it came to the worst  the prudence the good sense which he had shown in the first years of his success and of which his great prosperity seemed to have bereft him came back and these qualities used in his own behalf commended him as much to his creditors as the anxiety he showed that no one should suffer by him this even made some of them doubtful of his sincerity  they gave him time and there would have been no trouble in his resuming on the old basis if the ground had not been cut from under him by the competition of the west virginia company  he saw himself that it was useless to try to go on in the old way and he preferred to go back and begin the world anew where he had first begun it in the hills at lapham  he put the house at nankeen square with everything else he had into the payment of his debts and mrs lapham found it easier to leave it for the old farmstead in vermont than it would have been to go from that home of many years to the new house on the water side of beacon  this thing and that is embittered to us so that we may be willing to relinquish it the world life itself is embittered to most of us so that we are glad to have done with them at last and this home was haunted with such memories to each of those who abandoned it that to go was less exile than escape  mrs lapham could not look into irenes room without seeing the girl there before her glass tearing the poor little keepsakes of her hapless fancy from their hidingplaces to take them and fling them in passionate renunciation upon her sister she could not come into the sittingroom where her little ones had grown up without starting at the thought of her husband sitting so many weary nights at his desk there trying to fight his way back to hope out of the ruin into which he was slipping  when she remembered that night when rogers came she hated the place  irene accepted her release from the house eagerly and was glad to go before and prepare for the family at lapham  penelope was always ashamed of her engagement there it must seem better somewhere else and she was glad to go too  no one but lapham in fact felt the pang of parting in all its keenness  whatever regret the others had was softened to them by the likeness of their flitting to many of those removals for the summer which they made in the late spring when they left nankeen square they were going directly into the country instead of to the seaside first but lapham who usually remained in town long after they had gone knew all the difference  for his nerves there was no mechanical sense of coming back this was as much the end of his proud prosperous life as death itself could have been  he was returning to begin life anew but he knew as well as he knew that he should not find his vanished youth in his native hills that it could never again be the triumph that it had been  that was impossible not only in his stiffened and weakened forces but in the very nature of things  he was going back by grace of the man whom he owed money to make what he could out of the one chance which his successful rivals had left him  in one phase his paint had held its own against bad times and ruinous competition and it was with the hope of doing still more with the persis brand that he now set himself to work  the west virginia people confessed that they could not produce those fine grades and they willingly left the field to him  a strange not ignoble friendliness existed between lapham and the three brothers they had used him fairly it was their facilities that had conquered him not their illwill and he recognised in them without enmity the necessity to which he had yielded  if he succeeded in his efforts to develop his paint in this direction it must be for a long time on a small scale compared with his former business which it could never equal and he brought to them the flagging energies of an elderly man  he was more broken than he knew by his failure it did not kill as it often does but it weakened the spring once so strong and elastic  he lapsed more and more into acquiescence with his changed condition and that bragging note of his was rarely sounded  he worked faithfully enough in his enterprise but sometimes he failed to seize occasions that in his younger days he would have turned to golden account  his wife saw in him a daunted look that made her heart ache for him  one result of his friendly relations with the west virginia people was that corey went in with them and the fact that he did so solely upon laphams advice and by means of his recommendation was perhaps the colonels proudest consolation  corey knew the business thoroughly and after half a year at kanawha falls and in the office at new york he went out to mexico and central america to see what could be done for them upon the ground which he had theoretically studied with lapham  before he went he came up to vermont and urged penelope to go with him  he was to be first in the city of mexico and if his mission was successful he was to be kept there and in south america several years watching the new railroad enterprises and the development of mechanical agriculture and whatever other undertakings offered an opening for the introduction of the paint  they were all young men together and corey who had put his money into the company had a proprietary interest in the success which they were eager to achieve  theres no more reason now and no less than ever there was mused penelope in counsel with her mother why i should say yes or why i should say no everything else changes but this is just where it was a year ago  it dont go backward and it dont go forward  mother i believe i shall take the bit in my teethif anybody will put it there  it isnt the same as it was suggested her mother  you can see that irenes all over it  thats no credit to me said penelope  i ought to be just as much ashamed as ever  you no need ever to be ashamed  thats true too said the girl  and i can sneak off to mexico with a good conscience if i could make up my mind to it  she laughed well if i could be sentenced to be married or somebody would up and forbid the banns i dont know what to do about it  her mother left her to carry her hesitation back to corey and she said now they had better go all over it and try to reason it out  and i hope that whatever i do it wont be for my own sake but forothers  corey said he was sure of that and looked at her with eyes of patient tenderness  i dont say it is wrong she proceeded rather aimlessly but i cant make it seem right  i dont know whether i can make you understand but the idea of being happy when everybody else is so miserable is more than i can endure  it makes me wretched  then perhaps thats your share of the common suffering suggested corey smiling  oh you know it isnt you know its nothing  oh one of the reasons is what i told you once before that as long as father is in trouble i cant let you think of me  now that hes lost everything she bent her eyes inquiringly upon him as if for the effect of this argument  i dont think thats a very good reason he answered seriously but smiling still  do you believe me when i tell you that i love you  why i suppose i must she said dropping her eyes  then why shouldnt i think all the more of you on account of your fathers loss you didnt suppose i cared for you because he was prosperous  there was a shade of reproach ever so delicate and gentle in his smiling question which she felt  no i couldnt think such a thing of you  ii dont know what i meant  i meant that she could not go on and say that she had felt herself more worthy of him because of her fathers money it would not have been true yet there was no other explanation  she stopped and cast a helpless glance at him  he came to her aid  i understand why you shouldnt wish me to suffer by your fathers misfortunes  yes that was it and there is too great a difference every way  we ought to look at that again  you mustnt pretend that you dont know it for that wouldnt be true  your mother will never like me and perhapsperhaps i shall not like her  well said corey a little daunted you wont have to marry my family  ah that isnt the point  i know it he admitted  i wont pretend that i dont see what you mean but im sure that all the differences would disappear when you came to know my family better  im not afraid but you and my mother will like each othershe cant help it he exclaimed less judicially than he had hitherto spoken and he went on to urge some points of doubtful tenability  we have our ways and you have yours and while i dont say but what you and my mother and sisters would be a little strange together at first it would soon wear off on both sides there cant be anything hopelessly different in you all and if there were it wouldnt be any difference to me  do you think it would be pleasant to have you on my side against your mother  there wont be any sides  tell me just what it is youre afraid of  afraid  thinking of then  i dont know  it isnt anything they say or do she explained with her eyes intent on his  its what they are  i couldnt be natural with them and if i cant be natural with people im disagreeable  can you be natural with me  oh im not afraid of you  i never was  that was the trouble from the beginning  well then thats all thats necessary  and it never was the least trouble to me  it made me untrue to irene  you mustnt say that you were always true to her  she cared for you first  well but i never cared for her at all he besought her  she thought you did  that was nobodys fault and i cant let you make it yours  my dear  wait we must understand each other said penelope rising from her seat to prevent an advance he was making from his i want you to realise the whole affair  should you want a girl who hadnt a cent in the world and felt different in your mothers company and had cheated and betrayed her own sister  i want you  very well then you cant have me  i should always despise myself i ought to give you up for all these reasons  yes i must she looked at him intently and there was a tentative quality in her affirmations  is this your answer he said  i must submit  if i asked too much of you i was wrong  andgoodbye  he held out his hand and she put hers in it  you think im capricious and fickle she said  i cant help iti dont know myself  i cant keep to one thing for half a day at a time  but its right for us to partyes it must be  it must be she repeated and i shall try to remember that  goodbye i will try to keep that in my mind and you will tooyou wont care very soon i didnt mean thatno i know how true you are but you will soon look at me differently and see that even if there hadnt been this about irene i was not the one for you  you do think so dont you she pleaded clinging to his hand  i am not at all what they would likeyour family i felt that  i am little and black and homely and they dont understand my way of talking and now that weve lost everythingno im not fit  goodbye youre quite right not to have patience with me any longer  ive tried you enough  i ought to be willing to marry you against their wishes if you want me to but i cant make the sacrificeim too selfish for that all at once she flung herself on his breast  i cant even give you up i shall never dare look any one in the face again  go go but take me with you i tried to do without you i gave it a fair trial and it was a dead failure  o poor irene how could she give you up  corey went back to boston immediately and left penelope as he must to tell her sister that they were to be married  she was spared from the first advance toward this by an accident or a misunderstanding irene came straight to her after corey was gone and demanded penelope lapham have you been such a ninny as to send that man away on my account  penelope recoiled from this terrible courage she did not answer directly and irene went on because if you did ill thank you to bring him back again  im not going to have him thinking that im dying for a man that never cared for me  its insulting and im not going to stand it  now you just send for him  oh i will rene gasped penelope  and then she added shamed out of her prevarication by irenes haughty magnanimity i have  that ishes coming back  irene looked at her a moment and then whatever thought was in her mind said fiercely well and left her to her dismayher dismay and her relief for they both knew that this was the last time they should ever speak of that again  the marriage came after so much sorrow and trouble and the fact was received with so much misgiving for the past and future that it brought lapham none of the triumph in which he had once exulted at the thought of an alliance with the coreys  adversity had so far been his friend that it had taken from him all hope of the social success for which people crawl and truckle and restored him through failure and doubt and heartache the manhood which his prosperity had so nearly stolen from him  neither he nor his wife thought now that their daughter was marrying a corey they thought only that she was giving herself to the man who loved her and their acquiescence was sobered still further by the presence of irene  their hearts were far more with her  again and again mrs lapham said she did not see how she could go through it  i cant make it seem right she said  it is right steadily answered the colonel  yes i know  but it dont seem so   it would be easy to point out traits in penelopes character which finally reconciled all her husbands family and endeared her to them these things continually happen in novels and the coreys as they had always promised themselves to do made the best and not the worst of toms marriage  they were people who could value laphams behaviour as tom reported it to them  they were proud of him and bromfield corey who found a delicate aesthetic pleasure in the heroism with which lapham had withstood rogers and his temptationssomething finely dramatic and unconsciously effectivewrote him a letter which would once have flattered the rough soul almost to ecstasy though now he affected to slight it in showing it  its all right if it makes it more comfortable for pen he said to his wife  but the differences remained uneffaced if not uneffaceable between the coreys and tom coreys wife  if he had only married the colonel subtly suggested nanny corey  there was a brief season of civility and forbearance on both sides when he brought her home before starting for mexico and her fatherinlaw made a sympathetic feint of liking penelopes way of talking but it is questionable if even he found it so delightful as her husband did  lily corey made a little ineffectual sketch of her which she put by with other studies to finish up sometime and found her rather picturesque in some ways  nanny got on with her better than the rest and saw possibilities for her in the country to which she was going  as shes quite unformed socially she explained to her mother there is a chance that she will form herself on the spanish manner if she stays there long enough and that when she comes back she will have the charm of not olives perhaps but tortillas whatever they are something strange and foreign even if its borrowed  im glad shes going to mexico  at that distance we cancorrespond  her mother sighed and said bravely that she was sure they all got on very pleasantly as it was and that she was perfectly satisfied if tom was  there was in fact much truth in what she said of their harmony with penelope  having resolved from the beginning to make the best of the worst it might almost be said that they were supported and consoled in their good intentions by a higher power  this marriage had not thanks to an overruling providence brought the succession of lapham teas upon bromfield corey which he had dreaded the laphams were far off in their native fastnesses and neither lily nor nanny corey was obliged to sacrifice herself to the conversation of irene they were not even called upon to make a social demonstration for penelope at a time when most people being still out of town it would have been so easy she and tom had both begged that there might be nothing of that kind and though none of the coreys learned to know her very well in the week she spent with them they did not find it hard to get on with her  there were even moments when nanny corey like her father had glimpses of what tom had called her humour but it was perhaps too unlike their own to be easily recognisable  whether penelope on her side found it more difficult to harmonise i cannot say  she had much more of the harmonising to do since they were four to one but then she had gone through so much greater trials before  when the door of their carriage closed and it drove off with her and her husband to the station she fetched a long sigh  what is it asked corey who ought to have known better  oh nothing  i dont think i shall feel strange amongst the mexicans now  he looked at her with a puzzled smile which grew a little graver and then he put his arm round her and drew her closer to him  this made her cry on his shoulder  i only meant that i should have you all to myself there is no proof that she meant more but it is certain that our manners and customs go for more in life than our qualities  the price that we pay for civilisation is the fine yet impassable differentiation of these  perhaps we pay too much but it will not be possible to persuade those who have the difference in their favour that this is so  they may be right and at any rate the blank misgiving the recurring sense of disappointment to which the young peoples departure left the coreys is to be considered  that was the end of their son and brother for them they felt that and they were not mean or unamiable people  he remained three years away  some changes took place in that time one of these was the purchase by the kanawha falls company of the mines and works at lapham  the transfer relieved lapham of the load of debt which he was still labouring under and gave him an interest in the vaster enterprise of the younger men which he had once vainly hoped to grasp all in his own hand  he began to tell of this coincidence as something very striking and pushing on more actively the special branch of the business left to him he bragged quite in his old way of its enormous extension  his soninlaw he said was pushing it in mexico and central america an idea that they had originally had in common  well young blood was what was wanted in a thing of that kind now those fellows out in west virginia all young and a perfect team  for himself he owned that he had made mistakes he could see just where the mistakes wereput his finger right on them  but one thing he could say he had been no mans enemy but his own every dollar every cent had gone to pay his debts he had come out with clean hands he said all this and much more to mr sewell the summer after he sold out when the minister and his wife stopped at lapham on their way across from the white mountains to lake champlain lapham had found them on the cars and pressed them to stop off  there were times when mrs lapham had as great pride in the cleanhandedness with which lapham had come out as he had himself but her satisfaction was not so constant  at those times knowing the temptations he had resisted she thought him the noblest and grandest of men but no woman could endure to live in the same house with a perfect hero and there were other times when she reminded him that if he had kept his word to her about speculating in stocks and had looked after the insurance of his property half as carefully as he had looked after a couple of worthless women who had no earthly claim on him they would not be where they were now  he humbly admitted it all and left her to think of rogers herself  she did not fail to do so and the thought did not fail to restore him to her tenderness again   i do not know how it is that clergymen and physicians keep from telling their wives the secrets confided to them perhaps they can trust their wives to find them out for themselves whenever they wish  sewell had laid before his wife the case of the laphams after they came to consult with him about coreys proposal to penelope for he wished to be confirmed in his belief that he had advised them soundly but he had not given her their names and he had not known coreys himself  now he had no compunctions in talking the affair over with her without the veil of ignorance which she had hitherto assumed for she declared that as soon as she heard of coreys engagement to penelope the whole thing had flashed upon her  and that night at dinner i could have told the child that he was in love with her sister by the way he talked about her i heard him and if she had not been so blindly in love with him herself she would have known it too  i must say i cant help feeling a sort of contempt for her sister  oh but you must not cried sewell  that is wrong cruelly wrong im sure thats out of your novelreading my dear and not out of your heart  come it grieves me to hear you say such a thing as that  oh i dare say this pretty thing has got over ithow much character she has gotand i suppose shell see somebody else  sewell had to content himself with this partial concession  as a matter of fact unless it was the young west virginian who had come on to arrange the purchase of the works irene had not yet seen any one and whether there was ever anything between them is a fact that would need a separate inquiry  it is certain that at the end of five years after the disappointment which she met so bravely she was still unmarried  but she was even then still very young and her life at lapham had been varied by visits to the west  it had also been varied by an invitation made with the politest resolution by mrs corey to visit in boston which the girl was equal to refusing in the same spirit  sewell was intensely interested in the moral spectacle which lapham presented under his changed conditions  the colonel who was more the colonel in those hills than he could ever have been on the back bay kept him and mrs sewell over night at his house and he showed the minister minutely round the works and drove him all over his farm  for this expedition he employed a lively colt which had not yet come of age and an open buggy long past its prime and was no more ashamed of his turnout than of the finest he had ever driven on the milldam  he was rather shabby and slovenly in dress and he had fallen unkempt after the country fashion as to his hair and beard and boots  the house was plain and was furnished with the simpler moveables out of the house in nankeen square  there were certainly all the necessaries but no luxuries unless the statues of prayer and faith might be so considered  the laphams now burned kerosene of course and they had no furnace in the winter these were the only hardships the colonel complained of but he said that as soon as the company got to paying dividends againhe was evidently proud of the outlays that for the present prevented thishe should put in steam heat and naphthagas he spoke freely of his failure and with a confidence that seemed inspired by his former trust in sewell whom indeed he treated like an intimate friend rather than an acquaintance of two or three meetings  he went back to his first connection with rogers and he put before sewell hypothetically his own conclusions in regard to the matter  sometimes he said i get to thinking it all over and it seems to me i done wrong about rogers in the first place that the whole trouble came from that  it was just like starting a row of bricks  i tried to catch up and stop em from going but they all tumbled one after another  it want in the nature of things that they could be stopped till the last brick went  i dont talk much with my wife any more about it but i should like to know how it strikes you  we can trace the operation of evil in the physical world replied the minister but im more and more puzzled about it in the moral world there its course is often so very obscure and often it seems to involve so far as we can see no penalty whatever  and in your own case as i understand you dont admityou dont feel surethat you ever actually did wrong this man  well no i dont that is to say  he did not continue and after a while sewell said with that subtle kindness of his i should be inclined to thinknothing can be thrown quite away and it cant be that our sins only weaken usthat your fear of having possibly behaved selfishly toward this man kept you on your guard and strengthened you when you were brought face to face with a greaterhe was going to say temptation but he saved laphams pride and saidemergency  do you think so  i think that there may be truth in what i suggest  well i dont know what it was said lapham all i know is that when it came to the point although i could see that id got to go under unless i did itthat i couldnt sell out to those englishmen and i couldnt let that man put his money into my business without i told him just how things stood
