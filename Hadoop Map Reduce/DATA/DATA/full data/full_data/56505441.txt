56505441	bonnie prince charlie a tale of fontenoy and culloden by g a henty    chapter i the return of a prodigal   it was a dull evening in the month of september 1728 the apprentices had closed and barred the shutters and the days work was over supper was laid in the long room over the shop the viands were on the table and round it were standing bailie anderson and his wife his foreman john gillespie and his two apprentices the latter were furtively eying the eatables and wondering how much longer the grace which their master was delivering would be suddenly there was a knock at the door below no one stirred until the bailie had finished his grace before which time the knock had been twice repeated  elspeth woman the bailie said when he had brought the grace to an end go down below and see who knocks so impatiently look through the grille before you open the door these are nor times when one opens to the first stranger who knocks  the old servant who had been standing behind her mistress went downstairs the door was opened and they heard an exclamation of surprise at the answer to her question who is it thats knocking as if the house belonged to him  those gathered up stairs heard the bolts withdrawn there was a confused sound of talking and then a heavy step was heard ascending the stairs and without introduction a tall man wrapped in a cloak and carrying a child of some two years old strode into the room he threw his hat on to a settle and advanced straight towards the bailie who looked in surprise at this unceremonious entry  dont you know me andrew  heaven preserve us the bailie exclaimed why its malcolm  malcolm himself the visitor repeated sound in wind and limb  the lord be praised the bailie exclaimed as he grasped the others hand and wrung it warmly i had thought you dead years and years ago janet this is my brother malcolm of whom you have often heard me speak  and of whom you can have heard little good mistress if my brother has spoken the truth concerning me i was ever a neer do well while andrew struck hard and fast to our fathers trade  my husband has ever spoken with affection of you janet anderson said the bailie is not given to speak ill of any much less of his own flesh and blood  and now sit down malcolm supper is waiting and you are i doubt not ready for it it is ill talking to a fasting man when you have done you shall tell me what you have been doing for the last fifteen years and how it comes that you thus suddenly come back among us with your boy  he is no boy of mine malcolm said but i will tell you all about it presently first let me lay him down on that settle for the poor little chap is fast asleep and dead tired out elspeth roll up my cloak and make a pillow for him thats right he will do nicely now you are changed less than any of us elspeth just as hard to look at and i doubt not just as soft at heart as you used to be when you tried to shield me when i got into scrapes and now to supper  little was said during the meal fortunately the table was bounteously spread for the newcomers appetite was prodigious but at last he was satisfied and after a long drink at the horn beside him which elspeth had kept filled with ale he said  theres nothing like a scottish meal after all andrew french living is well enough for a time but one tires of it and many a time when i have been lying down supperless on the sod after marching and fighting the whole day i have longed for a bowl of porridge and a platter well filled with oatmeal cakes  supper over john and the apprentices retired elspeth went off to prepare the guests chamber and to make up a little bed for the child  now brother let us hear your story but first of all perhaps you want to light your pipe  that do i malcolm replied if mistress janet has no objection thereto  she is accustomed to it the bailie said answering for her i smoke myself i deem that tobacco like other things was given for our use and methinks that with a pipe between the lips mens brains work more easily and that it leadeth to pleasant converse  janet went to a cupboard brought out two long pipes and a jar of tobacco placed two tumblers a flat bottle and a jug of water on the table  that is right the bailie said i do not often touch strong waters the habit as i see too plainly is a harmful one and in this good city of glasgow there are many even of those so placed that they should be an example to their fellows who are given nightly to drink more than is good for them but on an occasion like the present i deem it no harm to take a glass  i should think not malcolm said heartily it is long since i tasted a glass of real scotch spirit and i never need an excuse for taking a glass of whatever it be that comes in my way not mistress janet that i am a toper i dont say that at the sack of a town or at times when liquor is running so to speak to waste i am more backward than the rest but my hand wouldnt be as steady as it is if i had been one of those who are never so happy as when they are filling themselves with liquor and now andrew to my story you know that when i saw you last  just when the troubles in 15 began  in spite of all your warnings to the contrary i must needs throw myself into the thick of them you like a wise man stuck to your shop and here you are now a bailie of glasgow while i who have been wandering over the face of the earth fighting for the cause of france and risking my life a thousand times in a matter which concerned me in no way have returned just as penniless as i set out  it is said brother malcolm janet said mildly that a rolling stone gathers no moss  that is true enough malcolm assented and yet do you know there are few rolling stones who if their time were to come over again would remain fixed in their bed of course we have not the pleasures of home of wives and children but the life of adventure has its own joys which i for one would not change for the others however brother as you know i threw myself heart and soul into that business  the last time i saw you was just as i was starting with a score of others to make our way to join the earl of mars army at perth i have seen many an army since but never did i see sixteen thousand finer fighting men than were there assembled the laird of mackintosh brought five hundred clansmen from inverness shire the marquis of huntly had five hundred horse and two thousand foot and the earl marischal had a thousand men the laird of glenlyon brought five hundred campbells and the marquis of tullibardine fourteen hundred and a score of other chiefs of less power were there with their clansmen there were enough men there to have done anything had they been properly armed and led but though arms and ammunition had been promised from france none came and the earl of mar had so little decision that he would have wrecked the finest army that ever marched  the army lay doing nothing for weeks and just before we were expecting a movement the company i belonged to was sent with a force of highlanders under mackintosh to join the army under the lords derwentwater kenmure and nithsdale lord derwentwater had risen with a number of other gentlemen and with their attendants and friends had marched against newcastle they had done nothing there but remained idle near hexham till joined by a force raised in the lowlands of scotland by the earls of nithsdale carnwath and wintoun the united army marched north again to kelso where we joined them  we scots soon saw that we had gained nothing by the change of commanders lord derwentwater was ignorant of military affairs and he was greatly swayed by a mr forster who was somehow at the head of the business and who was not only incompetent but proved to be a coward if not as most folks believed a traitor so dissension soon broke out and four hundred highlanders marched away north after a long delay it was resolved to move south where it was said we should be joined by great numbers in lancashire but by this time all had greatly lost spirit and hope in the enterprise we crossed the border and marched down through penrith appleby and kendal to lancaster and then on to preston  i was little more than a lad andrew but even to me it seemed madness thus to march into england with only two thousand men of these twelve hundred were foot commanded by brigadier mackintosh the others were horse there were two troops of stanhopes dragoons quartered in preston but these retired when we neared the town and we entered without opposition next day which was i remember the 10th of november the chevalier was proclaimed king and some country gentlemen with their tenants came in and joined us  i suppose it would have come to the same thing in the end but never were things so badly managed as they were by mr forster  preston was a strong natural position an enemy coming from the south could only reach it by crossing a narrow bridge over the river ribble a mile and a half away and this could have been held by a company against an army from the bridge to the town the road was so narrow that in several places two men could not ride abreast it ran between two high and steep banks and it was here that cromwell was nearly killed when he attacked charless troops  well all these places where we might certainly have defended ourselves were neglected and we were all kept in the town where we formed four main posts one was in the churchyard and this was commanded by brigadier mackintosh in support of this was the volunteer horse under derwentwater and the three other lords lord charles murray was in command at a barricade at a little distance from the churchyard colonel mackintosh had charge of a post at a windmill and the fourth was in the centre of the town  lord derwentwater was a poor general but he was a brave man he and his two brothers the ratcliffs rode about everywhere setting an example of coolness animating the soldiers and seeing to the work on the barriers two days after we reached the town we heard that general wilde was approaching colonel farquharson was sent forward with a portion of mackintoshs battalion to hold the bridge and the pass but mr forster who went out on horseback no sooner saw the enemy approaching than he gave orders to farquharson and his men to retreat to the town if i had been in farquharsons place i would have put a bullet through the cowards head and would have defended the bridge till the last  after that everything was confusion the highlanders came back into the town furious and disheartened the garrison prepared to receive the enemy mr forster was seen no more and in fact he went straight back to the house where he was lodging and took his bed where he remained till all was over the enemy came on slowly they could not understand why strong posts should be left undefended and feared falling in an ambuscade i was at the post commanded by brigadier mackintosh i had joined a company commanded by leslie of glenlyon who had brought with him some twenty men and had made up his company with men who like myself came up without a leader his company was attached to mackintoshs regiment  presently the english came in sight and as soon as they ascertained that we were still there which they had begun to doubt they attacked us we beat them back handsomely and derwentwater with his cavalry charged their dragoons so fiercely that he drove them out of the town it was late in the afternoon when the fight began and all night the struggle went on at each of our posts we beat them back over and over again the town was on fire in half a dozen places but luckily the night was still and the flames did not spread we knew that it was a hopeless fight we were making for from some prisoners we learned that three regiments of dragoons were also coming up against us and had already arrived at clitheroe from some inhabitants i suppose the enemy learned that the street leading to wigan had nor been barricaded and lord forrester brought up prestons regiment by this way and suddenly fell on the flank of our barrier it was a tough fight but we held our own till the news came that forster had agreed to capitulate  i dont say that our case wasnt hopeless we were outnumbered and had no leader sooner or later we must have been overpowered still no capitulation should have been made except on the terms of mercy to all concerned but forster no doubt felt safe about himself and that was all he cared for and the end showed that he knew what he was about for while all the brave young noblemen and numbers of others were either executed or punished in other ways forster who had been the leading spirit who had persuaded them to rise and led them into this strait was after a short imprisonment suffered to go free i tell you brother andrew if i were to meet him now even if it were in a church i would drive my dagger into his heart  however there we were so furious were we that it was with difficulty the officers could prevent us from sallying out sword in hand and trying to cut our way through the enemy as to forster if he had appeared in the streets he would have been hewn to pieces however it was useless to resist now the english troops marched in and we laid down our arms and our battalions marched into a church and were guarded as prisoners it was not a great army they had taken for there were but one thousand four hundred and ninety captured including noblemen gentlemen and officers  many of us were wounded more or less i had got a slice on the shoulder from a dragoons sword this i gained when rushing out to rescue leslie who had been knocked down and would have been slain by three dragoons had i not stood over him till some of our men rushed out and carried him in he was not badly hurt the sword having turned as it cut through his bonnet my action won his regard and from that time until a month since we have never been separated under a strong escort of soldiers we were marched south in most places the country people mocked us as we passed but here and there we saw among the crowds who gathered in the streets of the towns through which we passed faces which we passed faces which expressed pity and sympathy  we were not badly treated on the march by our guard and had little to complain of when we reached barnet we fell out as usual when the march was over and i went up to the door of a house and asked a woman who looked pityingly at us for a drink of water she brought me some and while i drank she said  we are catholics and well wishers of the chevalier if you can manage to slip in here after it is dark we will furnish you with a disguise and will direct you to friends who will pass you on until you can escape  can you give me disguises for two i asked i will not go without my captain  yes she said for two but no more  i will steal away after dark i said as i gave her back the jug  i told leslie what had happened and he agreed to join me in time to escape for there was no saying what fate might befall us in london and indeed the very next morning severities commenced the whole of the troops being obliged to suffer the indignity of having their arms tied behind them and so being marched into london  after it was dark leslie and i managed to steal away from our guards who were not very watchful for our uniform would at once have betrayed us and the country people would have seized and handed us over the woman was on the watch and as soon as we neared the door she opened it her husband was with her and received us kindly he at once furnished us with the attire of two countrymen and letting us out by a back way started with us across the country  after walking twenty miles he brought us to the house of another adherent of the chevalier where we remained all day so we were passed on until we reached the coast where we lay hid for some days until an arrangement was made with the captain of a fishing boat to take us to sea and either to land us at calais or to put us on board a french fishing boat so we got over without trouble  long before that as you know the business had virtually come to an end here the earl of mars army lay week after week at perth till at last it met the enemy under argyle at sheriffmuir  you know how that went the highland clans in the right and centre carried all before them and drove the enemy from the field but on the left they beat us badly so both parties claimed the victory but victory or defeat it was fatal to the cause of the chevalier half the highland clans went off to their homes that night and mar had to fall back to perth  well that was really the end of it the chevalier landed and for a while our hopes rose he did nothing and our hopes fell at last he took ship and went away and the affair was over except for the hangings and slaughterings  leslie like most of the scottish gentlemen who succeeded in reaching france took service with the french king and of course i did the same it would have done your heart good to see how the scottish regiments fought on many a field the very best troops of france were never before us and many a tough field was decided by our charge leslie was a cornet he was about my age and you know i was but twenty when sheriffmuir was fought he rose to be a colonel and would have given me a pair of colours over and over again if i would have taken them but i felt more comfortable among our troopers than i should have done among the officers who were almost all men of good highland family so i remained leslies right hand  a braver soldier never swung a leg over saddle but he was always in some love affair or another why he didnt marry i couldnt make out i suppose he could never stick long enough to one woman however some four years ago he got into an affair more serious than any he had been in before and this time he stuck to it in right earnest of course she was precisely one of the women he oughtnt to have fallen in love with though i for one couldnt blame him for a prettier creature wasnt to be found in france unfortunately she was the only daughter of the marquis de recambours one of the wealthiest and most powerful of french nobles and there was no more chance of his giving his consent to her throwing herself away upon a scottish soldier of fortune than to her going into a nunnery less in fact however she was as much in love with leslie as he was with her and so they got secretly married two years ago this child was born but she managed somehow to keep it from her father who was all this time urging her to marry the duke de chateaurouge  at last as ill luck would have it he shut her up in a convent just a week before she had arranged to fly with leslie to germany where he intended to take service until her father came round leslie would have got her out somehow but his regiment was ordered to the frontier and it was eighteen months before we returned to paris where the child had been in keeping with some people with whom he had placed it the very evening of his return i was cleaning his arms when he rushed into the room  all is discovered he said here is my signet ring go at once and get the child and make your way with it to scotland take all the money in the escritoire quick  i heard feet approaching and dashed to the bureau and transferred the bag of louis there to my pocket an official with two followers entered  colonel leslie he said it is my duty to arrest you by order of his gracious majesty and he held out an order signed by the king  i am unconscious of having done any wrong sir to his majesty whom i have served for the last sixteen years however it is not for me to dispute his orders thereupon he unbuckled his sword and handed it to the officers you will look after the things till i return malcolm as i am sure i can clear myself of any charge that may be brought against me i trust to be speedily back again  your trooper need not trouble himself the officer said the official with me will take charge of everything and will at once affix my seal to all your effects  i went down stairs and saw the colonel enter a carriage with the two officials then i went straight to the major colonel leslie has been arrested sir on what charge i know not he has intrusted a commission to me therefore if you find i am absent from parade in the morning you will understand i am carrying out his orders  the major was thunderstruck at the news but told me to do as the colonel had ordered me whatever it might be i mounted the colonels horse at once and rode to the house where the child was in keeping the people knew me well as i had often been there with messages from the colonel when i showed them the signet ring and told them that i had orders to take the child to his father they made no opposition i said i would return for him as soon as it was dusk i then went and purchased a suit of civilian clothes and returning to the house attired myself in these and taking the child on the saddle before me rode for the frontier  following unfrequented roads travelling only at night and passing a day in a wood i passed the frontier unmolested and made my way to ostend where i sold the horse and took passage in the first ship sailing for leith i arrived there two days ago and have walked here with an occasional lift in a cart and here i am brother andrew to ask you for hospitality for a while for myself and leslies boy i have a hundred louis but these of course belong to the child as for myself i confess i have nothing saving has never been in my line  you are heartily welcome malcolm as long as you choose to stop but i trust that ere long you will hear of colonel leslie  i trust so malcolm said but if you knew the court of france as well as i do you would not feel very sanguine about it it is easier to get into a prison than out of one  but the colonel has committed no crime the bailie said  his chance would be a great deal better if he had malcolm laughed a colonel of one of his majestys scottish regiments can do a good deal in the way of crime without much harm befalling him but when it comes to marrying the daughter of a nobleman who is a great personage at court without his consent it is a different affair altogether i can tell you leslie has powerful friends and his brother officers will do what they can for him but i can tell you services at the court of france go for very little influence is everything and as the nobleman the marquis intended to be the husband of his daughter is also a great personage at court and a friend of louiss there is no saying how serious a matter they may make of it men have been kept prisoners for life for a far less serious business than this  but supposing he is released does he know where to communicate with you  i am afraid he doesnt malcolm said ruefully he knows that i come from glasgow but that is all still when he is freed no doubt he will come over himself to look for his son and i am sure to hear of his being here  you might do and you might not the bailie said still we must hope for the best malcolm at any rate i am in no haste for the colonel to come now i have got you home again after all these years i do not wish to lose you again in a hurry  malcolm only remained for a few weeks at his brothers house the restraint of life at the bailies was too much for him andrews was a well ordered household the bailie was methodical and regular a leading figure in the kirk far stricter than were most men of his time as to undue consumption of liquor strong in exhortation in season and out of season his wife was kindly but precise and as outspoken as andrew himself for the first day or two the real affection which andrew had for his younger brother and the pleasure he felt at his return shielded malcolm from comment or rebuke but after the very first day the bailies wife had declared to herself that it was impossible that malcolm could long remain an inmate of the house she was not inhospitable and would have made great sacrifices in some directions for the long missing brother of her husband but his conduct outraged all the best feelings of a good scotch housewife  even on that first day he did not come punctually to his meals he was away about the town looking up old acquaintance came in at dinner and again at supper after the meal had already begun and dropped into his place and began to eat without saying a word of grace he stamped about the house as if he had cavalry spurs still on his heels talked in a voice that could be heard from attic to basement used french and flemish oaths which horrified the good lady although she did not understand them smoked at all hours of the day whereas andrew always confined himself to his after supper pipe and in spite of his assertions on the previous evening consumed an amount of liquor which horrified the good woman  at his meals he talked loudly kept the two apprentices in a titter with his stories of campaigning spoke slightingly of the city authorities and joked the bailie with a freedom and roughness which scandalized her andrew was slow to notice the incongruity of his brothers demeanour and bearing with the atmosphere of the house although he soon became dimly conscious that there was a jarring element in the air at the end of a week malcolm broached the subject to him  andrew he said you are a good fellow though you are a bailie and an elder of the kirk and i thank you for the hearty welcome you have given me and for your invitation to stay for a long time with you but it will not do janet is a good woman and a kindly but i can see that i keep her perpetually on thorns in good truth fifteen years of campaigning are but an indifferent preparation for a man as an inmate of a respectable household i did not quite know myself how thoroughly i had become a devil may care trooper until i came back to my old life here the ways of your house would soon be as intolerable to me as my ways are to your good wife and therefore it is better by far that before any words have passed between you and me and while we are as good friends as on the evening when i returned i should get out of this i met an old friend today one of the lads who went with me from glasgow to join the earl of mar at perth he is well to do now and trades in cattle taking them in droves down into england for the sake of old times he has offered me employment and methinks it will suit me as well as any other  but you cannot surely be going as a drover malcolm  why not the life is as good as any other i would not sit down after these years of roving to an indoor life i must either do that or cross the water again and take service abroad i am only six and thirty yet and am good for another fifteen years of soldiering and right gladly would i go back if leslie were again at the head of his regiment but i have been spoiled by him he ever treated me as a companion and as a friend rather than as a trooper in his regiment and i should miss him sorely did i enter any other service then too i would fain be here to be ready to join him again if he sends for me or comes and i should wish to keep an eye always on his boy you will continue to take charge of him wont you andrew he is still a little strange but he takes to elspeth and will give little trouble when he once learns the language  i dont like it at all malcolm the bailie said  no andrew but you must feel it is best i doubt not that ere this your wife has told you her troubles concerning me  as the bailie on the preceding night had listened to a long string of complaints and remonstrances on the part of his wife as to his brothers general conduct he could not deny the truth of malcolms supposition  just so andrew malcolm went on i knew that it must be so mistress janet has kept her lips closed firm to me but i could see how difficult it was for her sometimes to do so it could not be otherwise i am as much out of place here as a wolf in a sheepfold as to the droving i shall not mention to all i meet that i am brother to one of the bailies of glasgow i shall like the life the rough pony i shall ride will differ in his paces from my old charger but at least it will be life in the saddle i shall be earning an honest living if i take more than is good for me i may get a broken head and none be the wiser whereas if i remain here and fall foul of the city watch it would be grief and pain for you  the bailie was silenced he had already begun to perceive that malcolms ways and manners were incompatible with the peace and quiet of a respectable household and that janets complaints were not altogether unreasonable he had seen many of his acquaintances lift their eyebrows in disapprobation at the roystering talk of his brother and had foreseen that it was probable trouble would come  at the same rime he felt a repugnance to the thought that after so many years of absence his brother should so soon quit his house it seemed a reflection alike on his affection and hospitality  you will take charge of the child wont you malcolm pleaded there is a purse of a hundred louis which will i should say pay for any expense to which he may put you for some years  as if i would take the bairns money andrew exclaimed angrily what do you take me for malcolm assuredly i will take the child janet and i have no bairn of our own and its good for a house to have a child in it i look upon it as if it were yours for it is like enough you will never hear of its father again it will have a hearty welcome it is a bright little fellow and in time i doubt not that janet will take greatly to it the charge of a child is a serious matter and we cannot hope that we shall not have trouble with it but there is trouble in all things at any rate malcolm we will do our best and if at the end of a year i find that janet has not taken to it we will see about some other arrangement and malcolm i do trust that you will stay with us for another week or two it would seem to me as if i had turned you out of my house were you to leave me so soon  so malcolm made a three weeks stay at his brothers and then started upon his new occupation of driving highland cattle down into lancashire once every two or three months he came to glasgow for a week or two between his trips in spite of andrews entreaties he refused on these occasions to take up his abode with him but took a lodging not far off coming in the evening for an hour to smoke a pipe with his brother and never failing of a morning to come in and take the child for a long walk with him carrying him upon his shoulder and keeping up a steady talk with him in his native french which he was anxious that the boy should nor forget as at some time or other he might again return to france  some weeks after malcolms return to scotland he wrote to colonel leslie briefly giving his address at glasgow but making no allusion to the child as if the colonel were still in prison the letter would be sure to be opened by the authorities he also wrote to the major giving him his address and begging him to communicate it to colonel leslie whenever he should see him that done there was nothing for it but to wait quietly the post was so uncertain in those days that he had but slight hope that either of his letters would ever reach their destination no answer came to either of his letters  four years later malcolm went over to paris and cautiously made inquiries but no one had heard anything of colonel leslie from the day he had been arrested the regiment was away fighting in the low countries and the only thing malcolm could do was to call upon the people who had had charge of the child to give them his address in case the colonel should ever appear to inquire of them he found however the house tenanted by other people he learned that the last occupants had left years before the neighbors remembered that one morning early some officers of the law had come to the house and the man had been seized and carried away he had been released some months later only to find that his wife had died of grief and anxiety and he had then sold off his goods and gone no one knew whither malcolm therefore returned to glasgow with the feeling that he had gained nothing by his journey    chapter ii the jacobite agent   so twelve years passed ronald leslie grew up a sturdy lad full of fun and mischief in spite of the sober atmosphere of the bailies house and neither flogging at school nor lecturing at home appeared to have the slightest effect in reducing him to that state of sober tranquillity which was in mrs andersons eyes the thing to be most desired in boys andrew was less deeply shocked than his wife at the discovery of ronalds various delinquencies but his sense of order and punctuality was constantly outraged he was however really fond of the lad and even mrs anderson greatly as the boys ways constantly disturbed and ruffled her was at heart as fond of him as was her husband she considered and not altogether wrongly that his wilderness as she called it was in no slight degree due to his association with her husbands brother  ronald looked forward to the periodical visits of the drover with intense longing he was sure of a sympathetic listener in malcolm who listened with approval to the tales of the various scrapes into which he had got since his last visit of how instead of going to school he had played truant and with another boy his own age had embarked in a fishermans boat and gone down the river and had not been able to get back until next day how he had played tricks upon his dominie and had conquered in single combat the son of councillor duff the butcher who had spoken scoffing words at the stuarts malcolm was in fact delighted to find that in spite of repression and lectures his young charge was growing up a lad of spirit he still hoped that some day leslie might return and he knew how horrified he would be were he to find that his son was becoming a smug and well conducted citizen no small portion of his time on each of his visits to glasgow malcolm spent in training the boy in the use of arms  your father was a gentleman he would say to him and it is fitting that you should know how to handle a gentlemans arms clubs are well enough for citizens apprentices but i would have you handle rapier and broadsword as well as any of the young lairds when you get old enough ronald you and i will cross the seas and together we will try and get to the bottom of the mystery of your fathers fate and if we find that the worst has come to the worst we will seek our your mother she will most likely have married again they will be sure to have forced her into it but even if she dare not acknowledge you as her son her influence may obtain for you a commission in one of the kings regiments and even if they think im too old for a trooper i will go as your follower there are plenty of occasions at the court of france when a sharp sword and a stout arm even if it be somewhat stiffened by age can do good service  the lessons began as soon as ronald was old enough to hold a light blade and as between the pauses of exercise malcolm was always ready to tell stories of his adventures in the wars of france the days were full of delight to ronald when the latter reached the age of fourteen malcolm was not satisfied with the amount of proficiency which the lad was able to gain during his occasional visits and therefore took him for further instruction to a comrade who had like himself served in france and had returned and settled down in glasgow where he opened a fencing school having been a maitre darmes among the scotch regiments  the arrangement was however kept a profound secret from andrew and his wife but on half holidays and on any other days when he could manage to slip away for an hour ronald went to his instructor and worked hard and steadily with the rapier had mrs anderson had an idea of the manner in which he spent his time she would have been horrified and would certainly have spared her encomiums on his improved conduct and the absence of the unsatisfactory reports which had before been so common  the cloud of uncertainty which hung over his fathers fate could not but have an influence upon the boys character and the happy carelessness and gaiety which were its natural characteristics were modified by the thought that his father might be languishing in a dungeon sometimes he would refuse to accompany his school fellows on their rambles or fishing expeditions and would sit for hours thinking over all sorts of wild plans by which he might penetrate to him and aid him to escape he was never tired of questioning malcolm anderson as to the prisons in which if still alive his father would be likely to be confined he would ask as to their appearance the height of their walls whether they were moated or not and whether other houses abutted closely upon them one day malcolm asked him the reason of these questions and he replied of course i want to see how it will be possible to get my father out and although malcolm tried to impress upon him that it would be an almost impossible task even to discover in which prison his father was kept he would not allow himself to be discouraged  there must be some way of finding out malcolm you tell me that prisoners are not even known by their name to the warders but only under a number still someone must know  there must be lists kept of those in prison and i shall trust to my mother to find out for me a great lady as she is must be able to get at people if she sets about it and as certainly she must have loved my father very very much or she never would have married him secretly and got into such trouble for it i am sure she will do her best when she finds that you and i have come over to get him out when we know that i think we ought to be able to manage you could get employment as a warder or i could go disguised as a woman or as a priest or somehow i feel sure we shall succeed if we do but find out that he is alive and where he is  malcolm knew too much about the strong and well guarded prisons of france to share in the boys sanguine hopes but he did not try to discourage him he thought that with such an object in life before him the boy would devote himself all the more eagerly to exercises which would strengthen his arm increase his skill with weapons and render him a brave and gallant officer and in this he was right as the time went on ronald became more and more serious he took no part whatever in the school boy games and frolics in which he had been once a leader he worked hard at his school tasks the sooner to be done with them and above all devoted himself to acquiring a mastery of the sword with a perseverance and enthusiasm which quite surprised his instructor  i tell you malcolm man he said one day to his old comrade after ronald had been for upwards of two years his pupil if i had known when you first asked me to teach the lad to handle a sword how much of my time he was going to occupy i should have laughed in your face for ten times the sum you agreed to pay me would not have been enough but having begun it for your sake i have gone on for the lads it has been a pleasure to teach him so eager was he to learn  so ready to work heart and soul to improve the boys wrist is as strong as mine and his eye as quick i have long since taught him all i know and it is practice now and not teaching that we have every day i tell you i have work to hold my own with him he knows every trick and turn as well as i do and is quicker with his lunge and riposte were it not that i have my extra length of arm in my favour i could not hold my own as you know i have many of the officers of the garrison among my pupils and some of them have learned in good schools but there is not one of them could defend himself for a minute against that boy if it were not that the matter has to be kept secret i would set him in front of some of them and you would see what short work he would make of them have you heard the rumours malcolm that the young chevalier is likely to follow the example of his father thirty years back and to make a landing in scotland  i have heard some such rumours malcolm replied though whether there be aught in them i know not i hope that if he does so he will at any rate follow the example of his father no further as you know i hold to the stuarts but i must own they are but poor hands at fighting charles the first ruined his cause james the second threw away the crown of ireland by galloping away from the battle of the boyne the chevalier showed here in 15 that he was no leader of men and unless this lad is made of very different stuff to his forefathers he had best stay in france  but if he should come malcolm i suppose you will join him i am afraid i shall be fool enough to do so even with my fifty years on my head and you  i suppose i shall be a fool too malcolm said the stuarts are scotch you see and with all their faults i would rather a thousand times have a scottish king than these germans who govern us from london if the english like them let them keep them and let us have a king of our own however nought may come of it it may be but a rumour it is a card which louis has threatened to play a score of times whenever he wishes to annoy england it is more than likely that it will come to nought as it has so often done before  but they tell me that there are agents travelling about among the highland clans and that this time something is really to be done  they have said so over and over again and nothing has come of it for my part i dont care which way it goes after the muddle that was made of it thirty years ago it does not seem to me more likely that we shall get rid of the hanoverians now besides the hangings and slaughterings then would i should think make the nobles and the heads of clans think twice ere they risked everything again  that is true but when mens blood is up they do not count the cost besides the highland clans are always ready to fight if prince charles comes you will see there will not be much hanging back whatever the consequences may be well you and i have not much to lose except our lives  that is true enough old friend and i would rather die that way than any other still to tell you the truth i would rather keep my head on my shoulders for a few years if i can  well nothing may come of it but if it does i shall strike a blow again for the old cause  at home ronald heard nothing but expressions of loyalty to the crown the mere fact that the highlanders espoused the cause of the stuarts was sufficient in itself to make the lowlanders take the opposite side the religious feeling which had always counted for so much in the lowlands and had caused scotland to side with the parliament against king charles had not lost its force the leanings of the stuarts were it was known still strongly in favour of the catholic religion and although prince charles edward was reported to be more protestant in feelings than the rest of his race this was not sufficient to counterbalance the effect of the hereditary catholic tendency otherwise there was no feeling of active loyalty towards the reigning king in scotland the first and second georges had none of the attributes which attract loyal affection the first could with difficulty speak the language of the people over whom he ruled their feelings and sympathies were hanoverian rather than english and all court favours were bestowed as fast as possible upon their countrymen they had neither the bearing nor manner which men associate with royalty nor the graces and power of attraction which distinguished the stuarts commonplace and homely in manner in figure and in bearing they were not men whom their fellows could look up to or respect their very vices were coarse and the hanoverian men and women they gathered round them were hated by the english people  thus neither in england nor scotland was there any warm feeling of loyalty for the reigning house and though it was possible that but few would adventure life and property in the cause of the stuarts it was equally certain that outside the army there were still fewer who would draw sword for the hanoverian king among the people of the lowland cities of scotland the loyalty which existed was religious rather than civil and rested upon the fact that their forefathers had fought against the stuarts while the highlanders had always supported their cause thus although in the household and in kirk ronald had heard king george prayed for regularly he had heard no word concerning him calculated to waken a boyish feeling of loyalty still less of enthusiasm upon the other hand he knew that his father had fought and suffered for the stuarts and was an exile in their cause and that hanoverians had handed over the estate of which he himself would now be the heir to one of their adherents  it is no use talking of these matters to andrew malcolm impressed upon him it would do no good when he was a young man he took the side of the hanoverians and he wont change now while did mistress janet guess that your heart was with the stuarts she would say that i was ruining you and should bring you to a gallows she is not fond of me now though she does her best to be civil to her husbands brother but did she know that you had become a jacobite like enough she would move andrew to put a stop to your being with me and there would be all sorts of trouble  but they could nor prevent my being with you ronald said indignantly my father gave me into your charge not into theirs  thats true enough laddie but it is they who have cared for you and brought you up when you are a man you can no doubt go which way it pleases you but till then you owe your duty and respect to them and not to me who have done nought for you but just carry you over here in my cloak  i know they have done everything for me ronald said penitently they have been very good and kind and i love them both but for all that it is only natural that my father should be first and that my heart should be in the cause that he fought for  that is right enough ronald and i would not have it otherwise and i have striven to do my best to make you as he would like to see you did he never come back again i should be sorry indeed to see colonel leslies son growing up a glasgow tradesman as my brother no doubt intends you to be for i know he has long since given up any thought of hearing from your father but in that you and i will have a say when the time comes until then you must treat andrew as your natural guardian and there is no need to anger him by letting him know that your heart is with the king over the water any more than that you can wield a sword like a gentleman let us have peace as long as we can you are getting on for sixteen now another two years and we will think about going to paris together i am off again tomorrow ronald it will not be a long trip this time but maybe before i get back we shall have news from france which will set the land on fire  a short time after this conversation as ronald on his return from college for he was now entered at the university passed through the shop the bailie was in conversation with one of the city magistrates and ronald caught the words  he is somewhere in the city he came down from the highlands where he has been going to and fro two days since i have a warrant out against him and the constables are on the lookout i hope to have him in jail before tonight these pestilent rogues are a curse to the land though i cannot think the clans would be fools enough to rise again even though charles stuart did come  ronald went straight up to his room and for a few minutes sat in thought the man of whom they spoke was doubtless an emissary of prince charles and his arrest might have serious consequences perhaps bring ruin on all with whom he had been in communication who he was or what he was like ronald knew not but he determined at any rate to endeavour to defeat the intentions of the magistrate to lay hands on him accordingly a few minutes later while the magistrate was still talking with andrew he again went out  ronald waited about outside the door till he left and then followed him at a short distance the magistrate spoke to several acquaintances on the way and then went to the council chamber waiting outside ronald saw two or three of the magistrates enter an hour later the magistrate he was watching came out but he had gone but a few paces when a man hurrying up approached him they talked earnestly for a minute or two the magistrate then reentered the building remained there a few minutes and then joined the man who was waiting outside ronald had stolen up and taken his stand close by  it is all arranged the magistrate said as soon as night has fallen a party will go down surround the house and arrest him it is better not to do it in daylight i shall lead the party which will come round to my house so if the men you have left on watch bring you news that he has changed his hiding place let me know at once  the magistrate walked on ronald stood irresolute he had obtained no clue as to the residence of the person of whom they were in search and after a moments thought he determined to keep an eye upon the constable who would most likely join his comrade on the watch this however he did not do immediately he had probably been for some time at work and now took the opportunity of going home for a meal for he at once made his way to a quiet part of the city and entered a small house  it was half an hour before he came out again and ronald fidgeted with impatience for it was already growing dusk when he issued out ronald saw that he was armed with a heavy cudgel he walked quickly now and ronald following at a distance passed nearly across the town and down a quiet street which terminated against the old wall running from the castle port to a small tower when he got near the bottom of the street a man came out from an archway and the two spoke together from their gestures ronald felt sure that it was the last house on the left hand side of the street that was being watched he had not ventured to follow far down the street for as there was no thoroughfare he would at once be regarded with suspicion the question now was how to warn the man of his danger he knew several men were on the watch and as only one was in the street doubtless the others were behind the house if anything was to be done there was no time to be lost for the darkness was fast closing in  after a minutes thought he went quickly up the street and then started at a run and then came down upon a place where he could ascend the wall which was at many points in bad repair with some difficulty he climbed up and found that he was exactly opposite the house he wished to reach it was dark now even in the principal streets the town was only lit by oil lamps here and there and there was no attempt at illumination in the quiet quarters persons who went abroad after nightfall always carrying a lantern with them there was still sufficient light to show ronald that the house stood at a distance of some fourteen feet from the wall the roof sloped too steeply for him to maintain his holding upon it but halfway along the house was a dormer window about three feet above the gutter it was unglazed and doubtless gave light to a granary or store room  ronald saw that his only chance was to alight on the roof close enough to this window to be able to grasp the woodwork at any other moment he would have hesitated before attempting such a leap the wall was only a few feet wide and he could therefore get but little run for a spring his blood was however up and having taken his resolution he did not hesitate drawing back as far as he could he took three steps and then sprang for the window its sill was some three feet higher than the edge of the wall from which he sprang  the leap was successful his feet struck just upon the gutter and the impetus threw forward his body and his hands grasped the woodwork of the window in a moment he had dragged himself inside it was quite dark within the room he moved carefully for the floor was piled with disused furniture boxes sacking and rubbish he was some time finding the door but although he moved as carefully as he could he knocked over a heavy chest which was placed on a rickety chair the two falling with a crash on the floor at last he found the door and opened it as he did so a light met his eyes and he saw ascending the staircase a man with a drawn sword and a woman holding a light above her head following closely the man uttered an exclamation on seeing ronald appear  a thief he said surrender or i will run you through at once  i am no thief ronald replied my name is ronald leslie and i am a student at the university i have come here to warn someone whom i know not in this house that it is watched and that in a few minutes at the outside a band of the city watch will be here to capture him  the man dropped the point of his sword and taking the light from the woman held it closer to ronalds face  how came you here he asked how did you learn this news  the house is watched both sides below ronald said and i leapt from the wall through the dormer window i heard a magistrate arranging with one of the constables for a capture and gathered that he of whom they were in search was a jacobite and as i come of a stock which has always been faithful to the stuarts i hastened to warn him  the woman uttered a cry of alarm  i thank you with all my heart young sir i am he for whom they are in search and if i get free you will render a service indeed to our cause but there is no time to talk now if what you tell me be true you say the house is watched from both sides  yes there are two men in the lane below one or more i know not how many behind  there is no escape behind the man said the walls are high and other houses abut upon them i will sally out and fight through the men in front  i can handle the sword ronald put in and if you will provide me with a weapon i will do my best by your side  you are a brave lad the man said and i accept your aid  he led the way down stairs and entered a room took down a sword from over the fireplace and gave it to ronald  as he took it in his hand there was a loud knocking at the door  too late the man exclaimed quick the light mary at any rate i must burn my papers  he drew some letters from his pocket lit them at the lamp and threw them on the hearth then opening a cabinet he drew forth a number of other papers and crumpling them up added them to the blaze  thank god that is safe he said the worst evil is averted  can you not escape by the way by which i came hither ronald said the distance is too great to leap but if you have got a plank or can pull up a board from the floor you could put it across to the wall and make your escape that way i will try to hold the stairs till you are away  i will try at least the man said mary bring the light and aid me while our brave friend does his best to give us time  so saying he sprang upstairs while ronald made his way down to the door  who is making such a noise at the door of a quiet house at this time of night he shouted  open in the kings name was the reply we have a warrant to arrest one who is concealed here  there is no one concealed here ronald replied and i doubt that you are as you say officers of the peace but if so pass your warrant through the grill and if it be signed and in due form i will open to you  i will show my warrant when need be the voice answered once more open the door or we will break it in  do it at your peril ronald replied how can i tell you are not thieves who seek to ransack the house and that your warrant is a pretence i warn you that the first who enters i will run him through the body  the reply was a shower of blows on the door and a similar attack was begun by a party behind the house the door was strong and after a minute or two the hammering ceased and then there was a creaking straining noise and ronald knew they were applying a crowbar to force it open he retreated to a landing halfway up the stairs placed a lamp behind him so that it would show its light full on the faces of those ascending the stairs and waited a minute later there was a crash the lock had yielded but the bar still held the door in its place then the blows redoubled mingled with the crashing of wood then there was the sound of a heavy fall and a body of men burst in  there was a rush at the stairs but the foremost halted at the sight of ronald with his drawn sword  keep back he shouted or beware the watch will be here in a few minutes and then you will all be laid by the heels  fools we are the watch one of the men exclaimed and dashing up the stairs aimed a blow at ronald he guarded it and ran the man through the shoulder he dropped his sword and fell back with a curse  at this moment the woman ran down stairs from above and nodded to ronald to signify that the fugitive had escaped  you see i hold to my word ronald said in a loud voice if ye be the watch which i doubt show me the warrant or if ye have one in authority with you let him proclaim himself  here is the warrant and here am i james mwhirtle a magistrate of this city  why did you not say so before ronald exclaimed lowering his sword if it be truly the worshipful mr mwhirtle let him show himself for surely i know him well having seen him often in the house of my guardian bailie anderson  mr mwhirtle who had been keeping well in the rear now came forward  it is himself ronald said why did you not say you were here at once mr mwhirtle instead of setting your men to break down the door as if they were highland caterans on a foray  we bade you open in the kings name the magistrate said and you withstood us and it will be hanging matter for you for you have aided the kings enemies  the kings enemies ronald said in a tone of surprise how can there be any enemies of the king here seeing there are only myself and the good woman up stairs you will find no others  search the house the magistrate said furiously and take this malapert lad into custody on the charge of assisting the kings enemies of impeding the course of justice of withstanding by force of arms the issue of a lawful writ and with grievously wounding one of the city watch  ronald laughed  it is a grievous list worshipful sir but mark you as soon as you showed your warrant and declared yourself i gave way to you i only resisted so long as it seemed to me you were evildoers breaking into a peaceful house  two of the watch remained as guard over ronald one of the others searched the house from top to bottom no signs of the fugitive were discovered  he must be here somewhere the magistrate said since he was seen to enter and the house has been closely watched ever since see there are a pile of ashes on the hearth as if papers had been recently burned sound the floors and the walls  the investigation was particularly sharp in the attic for a board was here found to be loose and there were signs of its being recently wrenched out of its place but as the room below was unceiled this discovery led to nothing at last the magistrate was convinced that the fugitive was not concealed in the house and after placing his seals on the doors of all the rooms and leaving four men in charge he left the place ronald under the charge of four men accompanying him  on the arrival at the city tolbooth ronald was thrust into a cell and there left until morning he was then brought before mr mwhirtle and two other of the city magistrates andrew anderson was in attendance having been notified the night before of what had befallen ronald the bailie and his wife had at first been unable to credit the news and were convinced that some mistake had been made andrew had tried to obtain his release on his promise to bring him up in the morning but mr mwhirtle and his colleagues who had been hastily summoned together would not hear of it  its a case of treason man treason against his gracious majesty aiding and abetting one of the kings enemies to say nought of brawling and assaulting the city watch  the woman found in the house had also been brought up but no precise charge was made against her the court was crowded for andrew in his wrath at being unable to obtain ronalds release had not been backward in publishing his grievance and many of his neighbours were present to hear this strange charge against ronald leslie  the wounded constable and another first gave their evidence  i myself can confirm what has been said mr mwhirtle remarked seeing that i was present with the watch to see the arrest of a person against whom a warrant had been issued  who is that person ronald asked seeing that i am charged with aiding and abetting his escape it seems to me that i have a right to know who he is  the magistrates looked astounded at the effrontery of the question but after a moments consultation together mr mwhirtle said that in the interest of justice it was unadvisable at the present moment to state the name of the person concerned  what have you to say prisoner to the charge made against you in consideration of our good friend bailie anderson known to be a worthy citizen and loyal subject of his majesty we would be glad to hear what you have to say anent this charge  i have nothing to say ronald replied quietly being in the house when it was attacked with as much noise as if a band of border ruffians were at the gate i stood on the defence i demanded to see what warrant they had for forcing an entry and as they would show me none i did my best to protect the house but the moment mr mwhirtle proclaimed who he was i lowered my sword and gave them passage  there was a smile in the court at the boys coolness  but how came ye there young sir how came ye to be in the house at all if ye were there for a good motive  that i decline to say ronald answered it seems to me that any one may be in a house by the consent of its owners without having to give his reasons therefor  it will be the worse for you if you defy the court i ask you again how came you there  i have no objection to tell you how i came there ronald said i was walking on the old wall which as you know runs close by the house when i saw an ill looking loon hiding himself as if watching the house looking behind i saw another ruffianly looking man there two gasps of indignation were heard from the porch at the back of the court thinking that there was mischief on hand i leapt from the wall to the dormer window to warn the people of the house that there were ill doers who had designs upon the place and then remained to see what came of it that is the simple fact  there was an exclamation of incredulity from the magistrates  if you doubt me ronald said you can send a man to the wall i felt my feet loosen a tile and it slid down into the gutter  one of the magistrates gave an order and two of the watch left the court  and who did you find in the house  i found this good woman and sorely frightened she was when i told her what kind of folk were lurking outside  and was there anyone else there  there was a man there ronald said quietly and he seemed alarmed too  what became of him  i cannot say for certain ronald replied but if you ask my opinion i should say that having no stomach for meeting people outside he just went out the way i came in especially as i heard the worshipful magistrate say that a board in the attic had been lifted  the magistrates looked at each other in astonishment the mode of escape had not occurred to any and the disappearance of the fugitive was now explained  i never heard such a tale one of the magistrates said after a pause it passes belief that a lad belonging to the family of a worthy and respectable citizen a bailie of the city and one who stands well with his fellow townsmen should take a desperate leap from the wall through a window of a house where a traitor was in hiding warn him that the house was watched and give him time to escape while he defended the stairs such a tale sure was never told in a court what say you bailie  i can say nought andrew said the boy is a good boy and a quiet one given to mischief like other boys of his age doubtless but always amenable what can have possessed him to behave in such a wild manner i cannot conceive but it seems to me that it was but a boys freak  it was no freak when he ran his sword through peter muirs shoulder mr mwhirtle said ye will allow that neighbour anderson  the man must have run against the sword the bailie said seeing the boy scarce knows one end of a weapon from another  you are wrong there bailie one of the constables said for i have seen him many a time going into the school of james macklewain and i have heard a comrade say who knows james that the lad can handle a sword with the best of them  i will admit at once ronald said that i have gone to macklewains school and learned fencing of him my father colonel leslie of glenlyon was a gentleman and it was right that i should wield a sword and james macklewain who had fought in the french wars and knew my father was good enough to teach me i may say that my guardian knew nothing of this  no indeed andrew said i never so much as dreamt of it if i had done so he and i would have talked together to a purpose  leslie of glenlyon was concerned in the 15 was he not mr mwhirtle said and had to fly the country and his son seems to be treading in his steps bailie i doubt ye have been nourishing a viper in your bosom  at this moment the two constables returned and reported that certainly a tile was loose as the prisoner had described and there were scratches as if of the feet of someone entering the window but the leap was one that very few men would undertake  your story is so far confirmed prisoner but it does not seem to us that even had you seen two men watching a house it would be reasonable that you would risk your neck in this way without cause clearly you have aided and abetted a traitor to escape justice and you will be remanded i hope before you are brought before us again you will make up your mind to make a clean breast of it and throw yourself on the kings mercy  ronald was accordingly led back to the cell the bailie being too much overwhelmed with surprise at what he had heard to utter any remonstrance    chapter iii free   after ronald had been removed from the court the woman was questioned she asserted that her master was away and was she believed in france and that in his absence she often let lodgings to strangers that two days before a man whom she knew not came and hired a room for a few days that on the evening before hearing a noise in the attic she went up with him and met ronald coming down stairs that when ronald said there were strange men outside the house and when immediately afterwards there was a great knocking at the door the man drew his sword and ordered her to come up stairs with him that he then made her assist him to pull up a plank and thrust it from the attic to the wall and ordered her to replace it when he had gone she supposed he was a thief flying from justice but was afraid to refuse to do his bidding  and why did you not tell us all this woman when we came in mr mwhirtle asked sternly had ye told us we might have overtaken him  i was too much frightened the woman answered there were swords out and blood running and men using words contrary both to the law and scripture i was frighted enough before and i just put my apron over my head and sat down till the hubbub was over and then as no one asked me any questions and i feared i might have done wrong in aiding a thief to escape i just held my tongue  no cross questioning could elicit anything further from the woman who indeed seemed frightened almost out of her senses and the magistrate at last ordered her to return to the house and remain there under the supervision of the constable until again sent for  andrew anderson returned home sorely disturbed in his mind hitherto he had told none even of his intimates that the boy living in his house was the son of colonel leslie but had spoken of him as the child of an old acquaintance who had left him to his care the open announcement of ronald that he was the son of one of the leaders in the last rebellion coming just as it did when the air was thick with rumours of another rising troubled him greatly and there was the fact that the boy had unknown to him been learning fencing and lastly this interference which had enabled a notorious emissary of the pretender to escape arrest  the boys story may be true as far as it goes he said to his wife when relating to her the circumstances for i have never known him to tell a lie but i cannot think it was all the truth a boy does not take such a dreadful leap as that and risk breaking his neck simply because he sees two men near the house he must somehow have known that man was there and went to give him warning now i think of it he passed through the shop when peter mwhirtle was talking to me about it though indeed he did not know then where the loon was in hiding the boy went out soon afterwards and must somehow have learned if indeed he did not know before janet i fear that you and i have been like two blind owls with regard to the boy and i dread sorely that my brother malcolm is at the bottom of all this mischief  this mrs anderson was ready enough to credit but she was too much bewildered and horrified to do more than to shake her head and weep  will they cut off his head andrew she asked at last  no theres no fear of that but they may imprison him for a bit and perhaps give him a good flogging  the young rascal but there dont fret over it janet i will do all i can for him and in truth i think malcolm is more to blame than he is and we have been to blame too for letting the lad be so much with him seeing that we might be sure he would put all sorts of notions in the boys head  but what is to be done andrew we cannot let the poor lad remain in prison  we have no choice in the matter janet in prison he is and in prison he has to remain until he is let out and i see no chance of that if it had only been a brawl with the watch it could have been got over easily enough but this is an affair of high treason  aiding and abetting the kings enemies and the rest of it if it were in the old times they would put the thumb screws on him to find out all he knew about it for they will never believe he risked his life in the plot and the fact that his father before him was in arms for the chevalier tells that way i should not be surprised if an order comes for him to be sent to london to be examined by the kings councillors but i will go round now and ask the justices what they think of the matter  his tidings when he returned were not encouraging the general opinion of the magistrates being that ronald was certainly mixed up in the jacobite plot that the matter was altogether too serious to be disposed of by them being of the nature of high treason and that nothing could be done until instructions were received from london no clue had been obtained as to the whereabouts of the man who had escaped and it was thought probable that he had at once dropped beyond the walls and made for the west  malcolm arrived ten days later from a journey in lancashire and there was a serious quarrel between him and andrew on his presenting himself at the house  it is not only that you led the lad into mischief malcolm but that you taught him to do it behind my back  you may look at it in that way if you will andrew and its natural enough from your point of view but i take no blame to myself you treated the boy as if he had been your son and i thank you with all my heart for your kindness to him but i could not forget leslie of glenlyon and i do not blame myself that i have kept the same alive in his mind also it was my duty to see that the young eagle was not turned into a barn door fowl but i never thought he was going to use his beak and his claws so soon  a nice thing you will have to tell his father that owing to your teachings his son is a prisoner in the tower maybe for life but there  theres no fear of that you will never have to render that account for theres no more chance of your ever hearing more of him than there is of my becoming king of scotland its bad enough that you have always been a neer do well yourself without training that unfortunate boy to his ruin  well well andrew i will not argue with you and i dont blame you at being sore and angry over the matter nor do i deny what you have said about myself its true enough and you might say worse things against me without my quarreling with ye over it however the less said the better i will take myself off and think over whats to be done  you had better come up and have your supper with us andrew said mollified by his brothers humility  not for twenty golden guineas andrew would i face mistress janet she has borne with me well though i know in her heart she disapproves of me altogether but after this scrape into which i have got the boy i darent face her she might not say much but to eat with her eye upon me would choke me  malcolm proceeded at once to the establishment of his friend macklewain  this is a nice kettle of fish malcolm about young leslie i have had the justices down here asking me all sorts of questions and they have got into their minds that i taught him not only swordplay but treason and they have been threatening to put me in the stocks as a vagabond but i snapped my fingers in their faces saying i earned my money as honestly as they did and that i concern myself in no way in politics but teach english officers and the sons of glasgow tradesmen as well as those of highland gentlemen they were nicely put out i can tell you but i didnt care for that for i knew i was in the right of it but what on earth made the young cock meddle in this matter how came he to be mixed up in a jacobite plot have you got your finger in it  not i james and how it happens that he is concerned in it is more than i can guess i know of course his heart is with the king over the water but how he came to get his hand into the pie is altogether beyond me  the people here are well nigh mad about it i know not who the gallant who has escaped is but it is certain that his capture was considered a very important one and that the justices here expected to have gained no small credit by his arrest whereas now they will be regarded as fools for letting him slip through their fingers  i cannot for the life of me make out how he came to be mixed up in such a matter no one but you and i could have known that he was a lad of mettle who might be trusted in such a business it can hardly be that they would have confided any secrets to him still the fact that he was in the house with the man they are in search of and that he drew and risked his life and certain imprisonment to secure his escape shows that he must have been heart and soul in the plot  and what do you think of doing malcolm  i shall get him out somehow i can lay hands on a score or two or more of our old comrades here in glasgow and i doubt not that they will all strike a blow with me for leslies son to say nothing of his being a follower of the stuarts  you are not thinking man of attacking the jail that would be a serious matter the doors are strong and you would have the soldiers to say nought of the town guard and the citizens upon you before you had reached him  no no james i am thinking of no such foolishness i guess that they will not be trying him for withstanding the watch thats but a small matter they will be sending him south for the kings ministers to get out of him what he knows about the jacobite plot and the names of all concerned and its upon the road that we must get him out of their hands like enough they will only send four troopers with him and we can easily master them somewhere in the dales  its more like malcolm they will send him by ship they will know well enough that if the lad knows aught there will be plenty whose interest it is to get him out of their hands i think they will take the safer way of putting him on board ship  like enough they will malcolm agreed and in that case it will be a harder job than i deemed it but at any rate i mean to try ronalds not the lad to turn traitor he will say nothing whatever they do to him you may be sure and he may lie for years in an english prison if we do not get him out of their hands before he gets there at any rate what we have got to do now is to mark every ship in the port sailing for london and to find out whether passages are taken for a prisoner and his guard in any of them i will make that my business and between times get a score of trusty fellows together in readiness to start if they should send him by land but i doubt not that you are right and that he will be taken off by ship  the days of waiting passed slowly to ronald and andrew anderson once or twice obtained permission to see him the bailie wisely abstained from any reproaches and sought only to persuade him to make a clean breast of the business and to tell all he knew about a plot which could but end in failure and ruin to all concerned although his belief in ronalds truthfulness was great he could not credit that the story which he had told contained all the facts of the matter to the bailie it seemed incredible that merely from an abstract feeling in favour of the stuarts ronald would have risked his life and liberty in aiding the escape of a jacobite agent unless he was in some way deeply involved in the plot and he regarded ronalds assurances to the contrary as the outcome of what he considered an entirely mistaken sense of loyalty to the stuart cause  its all very well ronald he said shaking his head sadly but when they get you to london they will find means to make you open your mouth they have done away with the thumb screws and the rack but there are other ways of making a prisoner speak and it would be far better for you to make a clean breast of it at once janet is grieving for you as if you were her own son and i cannot myself attend to my business who would have thought that so young a lad should have got himself mixed up in such sair trouble  i have really told you all bailie though you will not believe me and i am sorry indeed for the trouble i have brought upon you and my aunt  for ronald had from the first been taught to address the bailie and his wife as if malcolm anderson had been his real father anyhow i wish they would settle it i would rather know the worst than go on from day to day expecting something that never happens  you have to wait ronald till word comes from london if they write from there that your case can be dealt with merely for the assault upon the watch i can promise you that a few weeks in jail are all that you are like to have but i fear that there is little chance of that they are sure to send for you to london and whether you will ever come back alive the gude lord only knows we know what came of treason thirty years ago and like enough they will be even more severe now seeing that they will hold that folks have all the less right to try and disturb matters so long settled  have you seen malcolm ronald asked to change the conversation  ay lad i have seen him and the meeting was not altogether a pleasant one for either of us  i hope you have not quarrelled with him on my account ronald said eagerly  we have not exactly quarrelled but we have had words i could not but tell him my opinion as to his learning you to take such courses but we parted friends but i doubt it will be long before janet can see him with patience  the jailer who was present at the interview here notified that the bailies time was up  i shall see you again ronald before they take you south i would that i could do more to help you besides just coming to see you  i know you cannot uncle i have got into the scrape and must take the consequences but if i were placed in the same position i should do it again  a few days afterwards as he was eating his ration of prison bread ronald found in it a small pellet of paper and on opening it read the words keep up your courage friends are at work for you you will hear more yet of m a  ronald was glad to know that his old friend was thinking of him but knowing how strong was the prison he had little hopes that malcolm would be able to effect anything to help him still the note gave him comfort  three days later andrew called again to bid him goodbye telling him that orders had been received from london that he was to be sent thither by ship  i should like to have seen malcolm before i went if i could ronald said  i have not seen him for several days the bailie said i have sent down several times to the house where he lodges but he is always away but whether or no there would be no chance of your seeing him i myself had difficulty in getting leave to see you though a bailie and known to be a loyal citizen but malcolm knows that there would be no chance of one with such a character as his getting to see you and that it would draw attention to him even to ask such a thing which if he has a hand in this mad brain plot he would not wish  malcolm would not mind a straw whether they kept a watch on him or not ronald said will you tell him when you see him next that i got his message  what message i have given you no message that i know of  he will know what i mean tell him whether aught comes of it or not i thank him and for all his kindness to me as i do you and aunt janet  at the same time with the order that ronald should be sent to london the authorities of glasgow received an intimation that the ministers felt great surprise at the lukewarmness which had been shown in allowing so notorious and important an enemy of his majesty to escape and that the king himself had expressed marked displeasure at the conduct of the city authorities in the matter greatly mortified at the upshot of an affair from which they had hoped to obtain much credit from government and believing it certain that there were many greatly interested in getting ronald out of the hands of his captors the authorities took every precaution to prevent it he was taken down to the river side under a strong escort and in addition to the four warders who were to be in charge of the prisoner as far as london they put on board twelve men of the city guard these were to remain with the ship until she was well out at sea and then to return in a boat which the vessel was to row behind her  ronald could not but smile when he saw all these formidable preparations for his safety at the same time he felt that any hope he had entertained that malcolm might as the message hinted make an attempt at rescue were blighted the vessel dropped down with the tide the orders of the justices had been so strict and urgent that the whole of the men placed on board kept a vigilant watch  just as they were abreast of dumbarton the sound of oars was heard and presently a boat was seen approaching as it got nearer two men were seen to be rowing and two others seated in the stern but as the craft was a large one there was room for others to be lying in the bottom the constable in charge shouted to the boat to keep them off  stop rowing he cried and come no nearer if you do we fire and as i dont want to shed your blood i warn you that i have sixteen armed men here  as his words were emphasized by the row of men who with levelled muskets ranged themselves along at the side of the ship the boat ceased rowing  what are you afraid of one of the men in the stern shouted cannot a fishermans boat row out without being threatened with shooting what are you and your sixteen armed men doing on board are you expecting a french fleet off the coast and do you think you will beat them off if they board you how long have the glasgow traders taken to man their ships with fighting men  ronald was in the cabin under the poop it opened on to the waist and received its light from an opening in the door at which two armed men had stationed themselves when the boat was heard approaching had the cabin possessed a porthole through which he could have squeezed himself he would long before have jumped overboard and tried to make his escape by swimming under cover of the darkness he now strove to force the door open for he recognized malcolms voice and doubted not that his friend had spoken in order to let him know that he was there that he might if possible leap over and swim to the boat but it was fastened strongly without and the guards outside shouted that they would fire unless he remained quiet  no reply was made to the taunts of the man in the boat and slowly for the wind was but just filling her sails the vessel dropped down the river and the boat was presently lost sight of  in the morning the breeze freshened it was not till the ship was eight miles beyond the mouth of the river that the boat was pulled up alongside and the guard taking their places on board hoisted sail and started on their return to glasgow  once fairly at sea ronald was allowed to leave his cabin now that he was enjoying the fresh air his spirits soon recovered the tone which they had lost somewhat during his three weeks confinement in prison and he thoroughly enjoyed his voyage the man who was in charge of the guard had at first wished to place some restriction on his going about on board as he chose but the crew sided with the young prisoner and threw such ridicule on the idea that four warders and a head constable were afraid even for a moment to lose sight of a boy on board a ship at sea that he gave way and allowed ronald free liberty of action although he warned his subordinates that they must nor relax their caution for a moment  the crew are all with him they think it a shame that a lad like this should be hauled to london as a prisoner charged with treasonable practices and sailors when they once get an idea into their head are as obstinate as highland cattle i have told them that he drew a sword and held the staircase against us all while a noted traitor made his escape and that he ran one of us through the shoulder and they only shouted with laughter and said he was a brave young cock like as not if they had a chance these men would aid him to escape and then we should have to answer for it and heavily too loss of place and imprisonment would be the least of what we might expect so though while at sea and in full daylight he can do as he pleases we must be doubly vigilant at night or in port if the vessel should have to put in  accordingly to the great disgust of the sailors the watch by turns stood sentry outside ronalds door at night thereby defeating a plan which the sailors had formed of lowering a boat the first night they passed near land and letting ronald make his escape to shore  the wind was favourable until the vessel rounded the lands end after that it became baffling and fickle and it was more than three weeks after the date of her sailing from glasgow that the vessel entered the mouth of the thames by this time ronalds boyish spirits had allayed all suspicion on the part of his guards he joked with the sailors climbed about the rigging like a cat and was so little affected by his position that the guards were convinced that he was free from the burden of any state secret and that no apprehension of any serious consequence to himself was weighing upon him  poor lad the head warder said he will need all his spirits he will have hard work to make the kings council believe that he interfered in such a matter as this from pure love of adventure he will have many a weary month to pass in prison before they free him i reckon it goes against my heart to hand over such a mere laddie as a prisoner still it is no matter of mine i have my duty to do and its not for me to question the orders i have received or to argue whether a prisoner is innocent or guilty  as the vessel anchored off gravesend to wait for the turn of the tide to take her up a boat rowed by a waterman and with a man sitting in the stern passed close by the ship the head warder had now redoubled his vigilance and one of the guards with loaded musket was standing on the deck not far from ronald who was standing on the taffrail as the boat passed some twenty yards astern of the ship the man who was not rowing turned round for a moment and looked up at ronald it was but a momentary glance that the lad caught of his face and he suppressed with difficulty a cry of surprise for he recognized malcolm anderson the rower continued steadily to ply his oars and continued his course towards another ship anchored lower down the river ronald stood watching the boat and saw that after making a wide sweep it was rowed back again to gravesend  ronald had no doubt that malcolm had come south in hopes of effecting his escape and guessed that he had taken up his post at gravesend with the intention of examining every ship as she passed up until the one in which he knew he had sailed made its appearance what his next step would be he could not tell but he determined to keep a vigilant lookout and to avail himself instantly of any opportunity which might offer  as the captain did nor care about proceeding up the river after dark it was not until the tide turned just as morning broke that the anchor was weighed there was a light breeze which just sufficed to give the vessel steerage way and a mist hung on the water ronald took his favourite seat on the taffrail and kept a vigilant watch upon every craft which seemed likely to come near the vessel  greenwich was passed and the vessel presently approached the crowded part of the pool it was near high tide now and the captain was congratulating himself that he should just reach a berth opposite the tower before it turned presently a boat with two rowers shot out from behind a tier of vessels and passed close under the stern of the glasgow lass a man was steering whom ronald instantly recognized  jump he cried and ronald without a moments hesitation leaped from the taffrail  he came up close to the boat and was instantly hauled on board by malcolm just at that moment the guard who had stood stupefied by ronalds sudden action gave a shout of alarm and discharged his piece the ball struck the boat close to ronald it was already in motion the men bent to their oars and the boat glided towards the surrey side of the river loud shouts arose from on board the vessel and four bullets cut the water round the boar but before the muskets could be reloaded malcolm had steered the boat through a tier of vessels whose crews attracted by the firing cheered the fugitives lustily  a minute later they had reached some landing steps malcolm tossed some money to the rowers and then sprang ashore with ronald and handed the latter a long coat which would reach to his heels and conceal the drenched state of his clothing from notice  we have tricked them nicely dear boy he said we are safe now long before they can lower a boat and get here we shall be safe in shelter and our five glasgow bodies will have something to do to look for us here  moderating his pace so as to avoid attracting attention malcolm proceeded along several streets and lanes and presently stopped at the door of a little shop  i am lodging here he said and have told the people of the house that i am expecting a nephew back from a cruise in the mediterranean  as he passed through the shop he said to the woman behind the counter  here he is safe and sound hes been some days longer than i expected but i was nor so very far wrong in my calculations the young scamp has had enough of the sea and has agreed to go back again with me to his own people  thats right the woman said my own boy ran away two years ago and i hope he will have come to his senses by the time he gets back again  when they were together in their room up stairs malcolm threw his arms round ronalds neck  thank god my dear boy i have got you our of the clutches of the law you do not know how i have been fretting since i heard you were caught and thought that if ill came to you it would be all my fault and now tell me how you got into this scrape for it has been puzzling me ever since i heard it surely when i saw you last you knew nothing about any jacobite goings on  ronald related the whole particulars of his adventure and said that even now he was absolutely ignorant who was the man whom he had aided to escape  i know no more than you do ronald but they must have thought his capture an important one by the fuss they made over his escape and now to think that you have slipped out of their hands too and malcolm broke into a loud laugh i would give a months earnings to see the faces of the guard as they make their report that they have arrived empty handed i was right glad when i saw you i was afraid you might have given them the slip on the way and then there would have been no saying when we might have found each other again  the sailors would have lowered a boat at night and let me make for the land ronald said but there was a good guard kept over me the door was locked and a sentry always on watch and i had quite given up all hope until i saw you at gravesend and now what do you intend to do make our way back to scotland  no no lad that would never do there will be a hue and cry after you and all the northern routes will be watched no i shall make a bargain with some dutch skipper to take us across the water and then we will make our way to paris  but have you got money malcolm  i have got your purse lad i went to andrew and said that i wanted it for you but that he was to ask no questions so that whatever came of it he could say that he knew nothing he gave it me at once saying only  remember malcolm you have done the boy some harm already with your teaching see that you do him no further harm i guess you are bent on some hare brained plan but whatever it be i wish you success    chapter iv in france   the next day malcolm went out alone and on his return told ronald that there were placards on the walls offering a reward of a hundred pounds for his apprehension  you dont think the people below have any suspicion malcolm  not they malcolm replied i was telling them last night after you had gone to bed all about the places you have been voyaging to and how anxious your father a snug farmer near newcastle was to have you back again i had spoken to them before so as to prepare them for your coming and the old woman takes quite an interest in you because her son at sea is a lad just about your age i have brought you in a suit of sailor clothes we will go down and have a chat with them after the shop is closed of a night you will remember newcastle and the farm and can tell them of your escape from greek pirates and how nearly you were taken by a french frigate near the straits  the consternation of the watch at ronalds escape was extreme the shot which the man on guard had fired was their first intimation of the event and seizing their muskets they had hastily discharged them in the direction of the fugitive and had then shouted for a boat to be lowered but never was a boat longer getting into the water than was that of the glasgow lass upon this occasion the captain gave his orders in a leisurely way and the crew were even slower in executing them then somehow the fall stuck and the boat wouldnt lower when at last she was in the water it was found that the thole pins were missing these being found she was rowed across the river the five constables undergoing a running fire of jokes and hilarity from the sailors of the ships they passed near in answer to their inquiries where the fugitives landed some of the sailors shouted that she had pulled up the river behind the tier of vessels others insisted that she had sunk with all hands close by  completely bewildered the chief of the party told the sailors to put them ashore at the first landing when the party gained the streets they inquired eagerly of all they met whether they had seen aught of the fugitives few of those they questioned understood the broad scotch in which the question was asked others laughed in their faces and asked how they were to know the man and boy they wanted from any others and after vainly looking about for some time they returned to the stairs only to find that the boat had returned to the ship  a watermans boat was now hired and the rower who had heard what had happened demanded a sum for putting them on board which horrified them but at last after much bargaining they were conveyed back to the ship an hour later the chief of the party went ashore and repairing to the tower where he had been ordered to conduct the prisoner reported his escape he was at once taken into custody on the charge of permitting the escape of his prisoner and it was not until three days later upon the evidence of his men and of the captain and officers of the ship that he was released  his four men were put on board a ship returning to glasgow next day while he himself was kept to identify the fugitive should he be caught  a week later malcolm told ronald that he had made arrangements with the captain of a dutch vessel to take them over to holland  we are to go on board at gravesend he said for they are searching all ships bound for foreign ports it is not for you especially but there are supposed to be many jacobites going to and fro and they will lay hands on anyone who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself so it is just as well for us to avoid questioning  accordingly the next day they walked down to gravesend and taking boat there boarded the dutch vessel when she came along on the following day the dutch captain received them civilly he had been told by malcolm that they wished to leave the country privately and guessed that they were in some way fugitives from the law but as he was to be well paid this gave him no concern there were no other passengers and a roomy cabin was placed at their disposal they passed down the river without impediment and anchored that night off sheerness  these dutch traders are but slow craft malcolm said as he walked impatiently up and down the deck next morning watching the slow progress which they made past the shore i wish we could have got a passage direct to france but of course that is impossible now the two nations are at war  what is the war about malcolm i heard at home that they were fighting but yet that somehow the two countries were not at war  no i dont know how that comes about malcolm said england has a minister still at paris but for all that king george is at the head of a number of british troops in germany fighting against the french there  but what is it about malcolm  well it is a matter which concerns hanover more than england in fact england has no interest in the matter at all as far as i can see except that as france takes one side she takes the other because she is afraid of france getting too strong however it is a german business and england is mixed up in it only because her present king is a hanoverian and not an englishman this is the matter as far as i can make it out charles vi emperor of germany died in october 1740 it had been arranged by a sort of general agreement called the pragmatic sanction   what an extraordinary name malcolm what does it mean  i have not the least idea in the world lad however that is what it is called it was signed by a lot of powers of whom england was one and by it all parties agreed that charless daughter maria theresa was to become empress of austria however when the emperor was dead the elector of bavaria claimed to be emperor and he was supported by france by spain and by frederick of prussia and they marched to vienna enthroned the elector as duke of austria and drove maria theresa to take refuge in hungary where she was warmly supported  the english parliament voted a large sum to enable the empress to carry on the war and last year sixteen thousand men under the earl of stair crossed the seas to cooperate with the dutch who were warm supporters of the empress and were joined by six thousand hessians and sixteen thousand hanoverians in british pay but after all nothing was done last year for as in the last war the dutch were not ready to begin and the english army were in consequence kept idle  then it seems that everyone was against the empress except england and these three little states  that is pretty nearly so malcolm said but at present the empress has bought off the prussians whose king joined in the affair solely for his own advantage by giving him the province of silesia so that in fact at present it is england and hanover which is all the same thing with the dutch and hessians against france and bavaria for i dont think that at present spain has sent any troops  well it seems to me a downright shame ronald said indignantly and though i have no great love for the english and hate their hanoverian george and his people i shouldnt like to fight with one of the scotch regiments in the french service in such a quarrel  malcolm laughed  my dear lad if every soldier were to discuss the merits of the quarrel in which he is ordered to fight there would be an end of all discipline  yes i see that ronald agreed if one is once a soldier he has only to obey orders but one need not become a soldier just at the time when he would be called upon to fight for a cause which he considers unjust  that is so ronald and its fortunate if your feelings are in favour of maria theresa that we are not thinking of enlisting just at present for you would be puzzled which side to take if you fought for her you would have to fight under the hanoverian if you fight against the hanoverian you are fighting against maria theresa  well we dont want to fight at all ronald said what we want to do is to find out something about my father i wish the voyage was at an end and that we had our faces towards paris  it will not be so easy to cross from holland into france malcolm said i wish our voyage was at an end for another reason for unless i mistake there is a storm brewing up  malcolms prediction as to the weather was speedily verified the wind rose rapidly ragged clouds hurried across the sky and the waves got up fast and by nightfall the sea had become really heavy dashing in sheets high in the air every time the bluff bowed craft plunged into it long before this ronald had gone below prostrate with seasickness  its just like the obstinacy of these dutchmen malcolm muttered to himself as he held on by a shroud and watched the labouring ship it must have been clear to anyone before we were well out of the river that we were going to have a gale and as the wind then was nearly due south we could have run back again and anchored in shelter till it was over now it has backed round nearly into our teeth with every sign of its getting into the north and then we shall have the french coast on our lee its not very serious yet but if the wind goes on rising as it has done for the last four or five hours we shall have a gale to remember before the morning  before the daylight indeed a tremendous sea was running and the wind was blowing with terrible force from the north although under but a rag of canvas the brig was pressed down gunwale deep and each wave as it struck her broadside seemed to heave her bodily to leeward malcolm on coming on deck made his way aft and glanced at the compass and then took a long look over the foaming water towards where he knew the french coast must lie the wind was two or three points east of north and as the clumsy craft would not sail within several points of the wind she was heading nearly east  she is making a foot to leeward for every one she forges ahead he said to himself if she has been at this work all night we cannot be far from the coast  so the dutch skipper appeared to think for a few minutes afterwards he gave orders to bring her about on the other tack three times they tried and failed each time the vessel slowly came up into the wind but the heavy waves forced her head off again before the headsails filled then the skipper gave orders to wear her her head payed off to the wind until she was nearly before it two or three great seas struck her stern and buried her head deeply but at last the boom swung over and her head came up on the other tack during the course of these manoeuvres she had made fully two miles leeway and when she was fairly under sail with her head to the west malcolm took another long look towards the south  just as i thought he said there is white water there and a dark line behind it that is the french coast sure enough  it would have been useless to speak but he touched the arm of the skipper and pointed to leeward the skipper looked in this direction for a minute and then gave the order for more sail to be put on the ship to endeavour to beat out in the teeth of the gale but even when pressed to the utmost it was evident to malcolm that the force of the waves was driving her faster towards the coast than she could make off it and he went below and told ronald to come on deck  i would rather lie here ronald said  nonsense lad the wind and spray will soon knock the sickness out of you and you will want all your wits about you for it wont be many hours before we are bumping on the sands and stoutly built as the craft is she wont hold together long in such a sea as this  do you really mean it malcolm or are you only trying to get me on deck  i mean it lad we are drifting fast upon the french coast and there is no hope of her clawing off in the teeth of such a gale as this  the news aroused ronald effectually he had not suffered at all on the voyage down from glasgow and he was already beginning to feel better when malcolm went down to call him he was soon on deck holding on by the bulwark  there it is that long low black line it looks a long way off because the air is full of spray and the coast is low but its not more than three or four miles look at that broad belt of foam  for some hours the dutch skipper did his best to beat to windward but in vain the vessel drove nearer and nearer towards the shore the anchors were got in readiness and when within a quarter of a mile of the line of breakers the vessels head was brought up into the wind and the lashings of the two anchors cut simultaneously  will they hold her do you think ronald asked  not a chance of it ronald of course the captain is right to try but no cables were ever made would hold such a bluff bowed craft as this in the teeth of such a wind and sea  the cables ran out to the bitts just as they tightened a great sea rolled in on the bow two dull reports were heard and then her head payed off the jib was run up instantly to help her round and under this sail the brig was headed directly towards the shore the sea was breaking round them now but the brig was almost flat bottomed and drew but little water all on board hung on to the shrouds and bulwarks momentarily expecting a crash but she drove on through the surf until within a hundred yards of the shore then as she went down in the trough of a wave there was a mighty crash the next wave swept her forward her own length  then there was another crash even more tremendous than the first and her masts simultaneously went over the side the next wave moved her but a few feet the one which followed finding her immovable piled itself higher over her and swept in a cataract down her sloping deck her stern had swung round after the first shot and she now lay broadside to the waves the dutch skipper and his crew behaved with the greatest calmness the ship lay over at such an angle that it was impossible to stand on the deck but the captain managed to get on the upper rail and although frequently almost washed off by the seas contrived to cut the shrouds and ropes that still attached the masts to the ship there then he joined the crew who were standing breast high in the water on the lee side the floating masts were pulled in until within a few yards of the vessel and such of the crew as could swim made towards them  the skipper cut the last rope that bound them and then plunged in and joined his men the distance was little over fifty yards to the shore and the wreck formed a partial shelter a crowd of people were assembled at the edge of the beach with ropes in readiness to give any assistance in their power malcolm and ronald were among those who had swum to the masts but when within a short distance of the shore the former shouted in the latters ear  swim off lad the masts might crush us  as soon as they neared the shore a number of ropes were thrown most of the sailors seeing the danger of being crushed followed the example of malcolm and left the masts malcolm and ronald swam just outside the point where the waves broke until a line fell in the water close to them they grasped it at once  give it a twist round your arm malcolm shouted or the backwash will tear you from it  the sailors on shore watched their opportunity and the instant a wave passed beneath the two swimmers ran up the beach at full speed with the rope there was a crash ronald felt himself shot forward with great rapidity then as he touched the ground with his feet they were swept from under him and so great was the strain that he felt as if his arm was being pulled from the socket a few seconds later he was lying at full length upon the sands and before the next wave reached him a dozen men had rushed down and seized him and malcolm and carried them beyond its influence for a minute or two ronald felt too bruised and out of breath to move then he heard malcolms voice  are you hurt ronald  no i think not malcolm he replied making an effort to sit up are you  no lad bruised a bit but no worse  one by one the sailors were brought ashore one with both legs broken from the force with which he was dashed down by the surf and one man who stuck to the mast was crushed to death as it was rolled over and over on to the beach the captain and three sailors were like malcolm and ronald unhurt there still remained four men on the wreck fortunately she had struck just at high tide and so stoutly was she built that she held together in spite of the tremendous seas and in an hour the four sailors were able to wade breast high to the shore  they found that the spot where the vessel had struck was half a mile west of gravelines they were taken to the town and were hospitably entertained a small body of soldiers were quartered there and the officer in command told the dutch skipper that as the two nations were at war he and his crew must be detained until he received orders respecting them on learning from malcolm that he and ronald were passengers and were scotsmen making their way from england to escape imprisonment as friends of the stuarts and that he had for twelve years served in one of the scotch regiments of louis and was now bound for paris the officer said that they were free to continue their journey at once  it was two or three days before they started for they found the next morning that they were both too severely bruised to set out at once on the journey as malcolm had taken care to keep the purse containing ronalds money securely fastened to a belt under his clothes they had no lack of funds but as time was no object they started for paris on foot ronald greatly enjoyed the journey bright weather had set in after the storm it was now the middle of may all nature was bright and cheerful the dresses of the peasantry the style of architecture so different to that to which he was accustomed in scotland and everything else were new and strange to him malcolm spoke french as fluently as his own language and they had therefore no difficulty or trouble on the way  they arrived at paris without any adventure malcolm went to a cabaret which had at the time when he was in the french service been much frequented by scotch soldiers being kept by a countryman of their own an exsergeant in one of the scottish regiments  ah sandy macgregor malcolm exclaimed as the proprietor of the place approached to take their order so you are still in the flesh man right glad am i to see you again  i know your face sandy replied but i canna just say what your name might be  malcolm anderson of leslies scotch regiment its fourteen years since i left them now but i was here again four years later if you can remember when i came over to try and find out if aught had been heard of the colonel  ay ay sandy said grasping malcolms outstretched hand warmly it all comes back to me now right glad am i to see you and who is the lad ye have brought with you a scot by his face and bearing i will be bound but young yet for the service if that be what he is thinking of  he is the colonels son sandy you will remember i told you i had carried him back to scotland with me but i need not tell ye that this is betwixt ourselves for those who have so badly treated his father might well have a grudge against the son and all the more that he is the rightful heir to many a broad acre here in france  i give you a hearty welcome young sir sandy said many a time i have seen your brave father riding at the head of his regiment and have spoken to him too for he and his officers would drop in here and crack a cup together in a room i keep upstairs for the quality well well and to think that you are his son but what malcolm said is true and it were best that none knew who ye are for they have an unco quick way here of putting inconvenient people out of the way  have you ever heard aught of my father since ronald asked eagerly  not a word sandy replied i have heard it talked over scores of times by men who were in the regiment that was once his and none doubted that if he were still alive he was lying in the bastille or vincennes or one of the other cages where they keep those whose presence the king or his favourites find inconvenient its just a stroke of the pen without question or trial and they are gone and even their best friends darena ask a question concerning them in most cases none know why they have been put away but there is no doubt why leslie was seized three or four of his fellow officers were in the secret of his marriage and when he had disappeared these talked loudly about it and there was sair grief and anger among the scottish regiment at leslies seizure but what was to be done it was just the kings pleasure and that is enough in france leslie had committed the grave offence of thwarting the wishes of two of the kings favourites great nobles too with broad lands and grand connections what were the likings of a scottish soldier of fortune and a headstrong girl in comparison in scotland in the old times a gallant who had carried off a daughter of a douglas or one of our powerful nobles would have made his wife a widow ere many weeks were over and it is the same thing here now it wouldna have been an easy thing for his enemies to kill leslie with his regiment at his back and so they got an order from the king and as surely got rid of him as if they had taken his life  you have never heard whether my mother has married again ronald asked  i have never heard her name mentioned her father is still at court but his daughter has never been seen since or i should have heard of it but more than that i cannot say  that gives me hopes that my father is still alive ronald said had he been dead they might have forced her into some other marriage  they might so but she was plainly a lassie who had a will of her own and may have held out  but why did they not kill him instead of putting him in prison if he was in their way  they might as i said have done it at once but once in prison he was beyond their reach the king may grant a lettre de cachet as these orders are called to a favourite but even in france men are not put to death without some sort of trial and even chateaurouge and de recambours could not ask louis to have a man murdered in prison to gratify their private spite especially when that man was a brave scottish officer whose fate had already excited much discontent among his compatriots in the kings service then again much would depend upon who was the governor of the prison these men differ like others some of them are honourable gentlemen to whom even louis himself would not venture to hint that he wanted a prisoner put out of the way but there are others who to gratify a powerful nobleman would think nothing of telling a jailer to forget a fortnight to give food to a prisoner so you see we cannot judge from this and now what are you thinking of doing malcolm and why are you over here  in the first place we are over here because young leslie took after his father and aided a jacobite whom georges men were in search of to escape and drew his sword on a worshipful justice of glasgow and the city watch  he has begun early sandy said laughing and how did he get away  they brought him down a prisoner to london to interrogate him as to the plot i had a boat in the thames and he jumped over and swam for it so here we are there are rumours in scotland that king louis is helping prince charlie and that an army is soon going to sail for scotland  it is talked of here but so far nothing is settled but as king george is interfering in louiss affairs and is fighting him in germany i think it more than likely that king louis is going to stir up a coil in scotland to give george something to do at home  then if theres nothing to be done here i shall find out the old regiment there will be many officers in it still who have fought under leslie and some of them may know more about him than you do and will surely be able to tell me what has become of the lads mither  that may well be so but keep a quiet tongue malcolm as to leslies son save to those on whose discretion you can rely i tell you if it were known that he is alive and in france his life would not be worth a weeks purchase they would not take the trouble to get a lettre de cachet for him as they did for his father it would be just a pistol bullet or a stab on a dark night or in a lonely place there would be no question asked about the fate of an unknown scotch laddie  i will be careful sandy and silent the first thing is to find out where the old regiment is lying  that i can tell you at once it is on the frontier with the duc de noailles and they say that there is like to be a great battle with english george and his army  well as we have nothing else to do we will set out and find them malcolm said but as time is not pressing we will stop a few days here in paris and i will show the lad the sights i suppose you can put us up  that can i times are dull at present after 15 paris swarmed with scotsmen who had fled to save their heads but of late years but few have come over and the scotch regiments have difficulty in keeping up their numbers since the last of them marched for the frontier i have been looking after empty benches and it will be good news for me when i hear that the war is over and they are on their way back  for some days malcolm and ronald wandered about the narrow streets of paris ronald was somewhat disappointed in the city of which he had heard so much the streets were ill paved and worse lighted and were narrow and winding in the neighbourhood of the louvre there were signs of wealth and opulence the rich dresses of the nobles contrasted strongly indeed with the sombre attire of the glasgow citizens and the appearance and uniform of the royal guards filled him with admiration but beyond the fashionable quarter it did not appear to him that paris possessed many advantages over glasgow and the poorer class were squalid and poverty stricken to a far greater degree than anything he had seen in scotland but the chief points of attraction to him were the prisons the bastille the chatelet and the temple were points to which he was continually turning the two former especially since if he were in paris it was in one of these that his father was most probably lying  the various plans he had so often thought over by which in some way or other he might communicate with his father and aid his escape were roughly shattered at the sight of these buildings he had reckoned on their resembling in some respect the prison in glasgow and at the sight of these formidable fortresses with their lofty walls and flanking towers their moats and vigilant sentries his hopes fell to zero it would he saw at once be absolutely impossible to open communication with a prisoner of whose whereabouts he was wholly ignorant and of whose very existence he was doubtful the narrow slits which lighted the cell in which he was confined might look into an inner court or the cell itself might be below the surface of the soil the legend of the troubadour who discovered king richard of englands place of captivity by singing without the walls had always been present in his mind but no such plan would be practicable here he knew no song which his father and his father only would recognize and even did he know such a song the appearance of anyone loitering in the open space outside the moat round the bastille singing at intervals at different points would have instantly attracted the attention of the sentries on the walls nor even did he discover that his father was lying a prisoner in one of the cells facing outwards in the fortress did he see any possibility of compassing his escape the slits were wide enough only for the passage of a ray of light or the flight of an arrow no human being could squeeze himself through them and even if he could do so he would need a long rope to descend into the moat  one day ronald talked over his ideas with malcolm who declared at once that they were impossible of execution  there is scarcely a case on record he said of an escape from either the bastille or the chatelet and yet there have been scores of prisoners confined in them with friends of great influence and abundant means if these have been unable by bribing jailers or by other strategy to free their friends how could a stranger without either connection influence or wealth hope to effect the escape of a captive were he certain that he was within the walls do not waste your thought on such fancies ronald if your father is still in prison it is by influence only and influence exerted upon the king and exceeding that of your fathers enemies that his release can be obtained  such influence there is no possibility of our exerting your fathers comrades and countrymen his position and services availed nothing when he was first imprisoned and in the time which has elapsed the number of those who know him and would venture to risk the kings displeasure by pleading his cause must have lessened considerably the only possibility mind i say possibility of success lies in your mother  so far it is clear that she has been powerless but we know not under what circumstances she has been placed she may all this time have been shut up a prisoner in a convent she may be dead but it is possible that if she is free she may have powerful connections on her mothers side who might be induced to take up her cause and to plead with the king for your fathers liberty she may have been told that your father is dead she is no doubt in ignorance of what has become of you or whether you are still alive if she believes you are both dead she would have had no motive for exerting any family influence she may have and may be living a broken hearted woman firm only in the resolution to accept no other husband  yes that is possible ronald agreed at any rate malcolm let us lose no further time but set out tomorrow for the frontier and try to find out from my fathers old comrades what has become of my mother    chapter v dettingen   after walking two or three miles malcolm and ronald came upon the rear of a train of waggons which had set out from paris an hour earlier entering into conversation with one of the drivers they found that the convoy was bound for the frontier with ammunition and supplies for the army  this is fortunate malcolm said for to tell you the truth ronald i have looked forward to our meeting with a good many difficulties by the way we have no passes or permits to travel and should be suspected of being either deserters or thieves we came down from the north easy enough but there they are more accustomed to the passage of travellers to or from the coast going east our appearance if alone would be sure to incite comment and suspicion it is hard if among the soldiers with the convoy i do not know someone who has friends in the old regiment at any rate we can offer to make ourselves useful in case of any of the drivers falling ill or deserting by the way  as they walked along towards the head of the long line of waggons malcolm closely scrutinized the troopers who formed the escort but most of them were young soldiers and he therefore went on without accosting them until he reached the head of the column here two officers were riding together a captain and a young lieutenant malcolm saluted the former  i am an old soldier of the 2d regiment of scottish calvary and am going with my young friend here who has relations in the regiment to join them will you permit us sir to journey with your convoy we are ready if needs be to make ourselves useful in case any of your drivers are missing no uncommon thing as i know on a long journey  the officer asked a few questions about his services and said what have you been doing since you left as you say fourteen years ago  i have been in scotland sir i took this lad who was then an infant home to my people having had enough of soldiering while my brother his father remained with the regiment we do not know whether he is alive or dead but if the former the lad wants to join as a trumpeter and when old enough to fight in the ranks  very well the officer said you can march along with us and if any of these fellows desert you shall take their places and of course draw their pay  it was a short time indeed before malcolms services were called into requisition for the very first night several of the drivers who had been pressed into the service managed to elude the vigilance of the guard and slipped away  the next morning malcolm with ronald as his assistant took charge of one of the heavy waggons loaded with ammunition and drawn by twelve horses  this is better than walking after all ronald in the first place it saves the legs and in the second one is partly out of the dust  but i think we should get on faster walking malcolm  yes if we had no stoppages but then you see as we have no papers we might be detained for weeks by some pig headed official in a little country town besides we are sure to push on as fast as we can for they will want the ammunition before a battle is fought and after all a few days wont make much difference to us the weather is fine and the journey will not be unpleasant  in fact ronald enjoyed the next three weeks greatly as the train of waggons made its way across the plains of champagne and then on through the valleys of lorraine and alsace until it reached strasbourg malcolm had speedily made friends with some of the soldiers of the escort and of an evening when the days work was over he and ronald sat with them by the fires they made by the roadside and malcolm told tales of the campaigns in which he had been engaged and the soldiers sang songs and chatted over the probabilities of the events of the war none of them had served before having been but a few months taken from their homes in various parts of france but although doubtless many had at first regretted bitterly being dragged away to the wars they were now all reconciled to their lot and looked forward eagerly to joining their regiment which was at the front when the duty of looking after the convoy would be at an end  little was known in paris as to the position of the contending armies beyond the fact that lord stair who commanded the english army sixteen thousand strong which had for the last year been lying inactive in flanders had marched down with his hanoverian allies towards the maine and that the duc de noailles with sixty thousand men was lying beyond the rhine but at strasbourg they learned that the french army had marched north to give battle to lord stair who had at present with him but twentyeight thousand men and was waiting to be joined by twelve thousand hanoverians and hessians who were on their way  the convoy continued its journey pushing forward with all speed and on the 26th of july joined the army of de noailles the french were on the south side of the river but having arrived on its banks before the english they had possession of the bridges as soon as the waggons had joined the army malcolm obtained from the officer commanding the escort a discharge saying that he and ronald had fulfilled their engagement as drivers with the waggons to the front and were now at liberty to return to france  now we are our own masters again ronald malcolm said i have taken part in a good many battles but have never yet had the opportunity of looking on at one comfortably de noailles should lose no time in attacking so as to destroy the english before they receive their reinforcements as he holds the bridges he can bring on the battle when he likes and i think that tomorrow or next day the fight will take place  it was known in the camp that evening that the english had established their chief magazines at hanau and were marching up the river towards aschaffenburg in the early morning a portion of the french troops crossed the river at that town and took up a strong position there ronald and malcolm climbed a hill looking down upon the river from the south side and thence commanded the view of the ground across which the english were marching on the eastern side of the river spurs of the spessart mountains came down close to its bank inclosing a narrow flat between aschaffenburg and dettingen at the latter place the heights approached so closely to the river as to render it difficult for an army to pass between them while posting a strong force at aschaffenburg to hold the passage across a stream running into the maine there de noailles marched his main force down the river these movements were hidden by the nature of the ground from the english who were advancing unconscious of their danger towards dettingen  de noailles will have them in a trap malcolm said for from their position on the hill they could see the whole ground on the further bank hanau lying some seven miles beyond dettingen which was itself less than seven miles from aschaffenburg  i am afraid so ronald said  afraid malcolm repeated why you should rejoice ronald  i cant do that ronald replied i should like to see the stuarts instead of the hanoverians reigning over us but after all malcolm england and scotland are one nation  but there are scotch regiments with the french army and a brigade of irish  that may be ronald said scotchmen who have got into political trouble at home may enter the service of france and may fight heartily against the germans or the flemings or other enemies of france but i know that i should feel very reluctant to fight against the english army except of course at home for the stuarts  it will benefit the stuarts cause if the english are defeated here malcolm said  that may be or it may not ronald replied you yourself told me that louis cared nothing for the stuarts and would only aid them in order to cripple the english strength at home therefore if he destroys the english army here he will have less cause to fear england and so less motive for helping the chevalier  that is true enough malcolm agreed you are fast becoming a politician ronald well i will look on as a neutral then because although the english are certainly more nearly my countrymen than are the french you must remember that for twelve years i fought under the french flag however there can be no doubt what is going to take place see the dark mass of the english army are passing through the defile of dettingen and the french have begun to cross at seligenstadt in their rear see they are throwing three or four bridges across the river there  in utter ignorance of their danger the english marched on along the narrow plain by the river bank towards aschaffenburg  look at their cavalry scouting ahead of them malcolm said there the french are opening fire and as he spoke puffs of musketry rose up from the line of the stream held by the french  the english cavalry galloped back but the columns of infantry still advanced until within half a mile of the french position and were there halted while some guns from the french lines opened fire the bridges at seligenstadt were now completed and masses of troops could be seen pouring over king george and the duke of cumberland had joined the earl of stair just as the army passed through dettingen and were riding at the head of the column when the french fire opened a short time was spent in reconnoitring the position of the enemy in front the english believed that the entire french army was there opposed to them and that the advance of the army into franconia which was its main objective was therefore barred after a short consultation it was resolved to fall back at once upon the magazines at hanau which from their ignorance of the near proximity of the french had been left but weakly guarded believing that as they fell back they would be hotly pursued by the french army the king took the command of the rear as the post of danger and the columns facing about marched towards dettingen  but the french had been beforehand with them de noailles had sent 23000 men under his nephew the duke de grammont across the river to occupy dettingen he himself with his main army remained on the south side with his artillery placed so as to fire across the river upon the flank of the english as they approached dettingen while he could march up and cross at aschaffenburg should the english after being beaten back at dettingen try to retreat up the river  de grammonts position was a very strong one behind a swamp and a deep ravine hollowed out by a stream from the hill there seemed no possibility of escape for the english army who were as yet absolutely in ignorance of the position of the french as the head of the column approached dettingen grammonts artillery opened upon them in front while that of de noailles smote them in flank as soon as the king found that his retreat was cut off he galloped from the rear of the column to its head his horse alarmed by the fire of the artillery and whistling of balls ran away with him and was with difficulty stopped just as he reached the head of the column he at once dismounted and announced his intention of leading his troops on foot  there was a hasty council held between him lord stair and the duke of cumberland and it was agreed that the only escape from entire destruction was by fighting their way through the force now in front of them this would indeed have been impossible had de grammont held his position but when that officer saw the english troops halt he believed he had only the advanced guard in front of him and resolving to overwhelm these before their main body arrived he abandoned his strong position led the troops across the swamp and charged the english in front  de noailles from the opposite bank seeing the error his nephew had made hurried his troops towards the bridges in order to cross the river and render him assistance but it was too late  the english infantry headed by the king in person hurled themselves upon the troops of de grammont  every man felt that the only hope of escape from this trap into which they had fallen lay in cutting their way through the enemy and so furiously did they fight that de grammonts troops were utterly overthrown and were soon in full flight towards the bridges in the rear hotly pursued by the english before they could reach the bridges they left behind them on the field six thousand killed and wounded king george satisfied with his success and knowing that the french army was still greatly superior to his own wisely determined to get out of his dangerous position as soon as possible and pushed on that night to hanau  although malcolm and ronald were too far off to witness the incidents of the battle they made out the tide of war rolling away from them and saw the black masses of troops pressing on through dettingen in spite of the french artillery which thundered from the opposite bank of the river  they have won ronald said throwing up his cap hurrah malcolm where is the utter destruction of the english now see the plain beyond dettingen is covered by a confused mass of flying men the english have broken out of the trap and instead of being crushed have won a great victory  it looks like it certainly malcolm said i would not have believed it if i had not seen it their destruction seemed certain and now let us go round to the camp again  on their way down malcolm said  i think on the whole ronald that you are perhaps right and the french defeat will do good rather than harm to the stuart cause had they conquered louis would have been too intent on pushing forward his own schemes to care much for the stuarts he has no real interest in them and only uses them as cats paws to injure england if he had beaten the english and hanoverians he would not have needed their aid as it is it seems likely enough that he will try to create a diversion and keep the english busy at home by aiding the stuarts with men and money to make a landing in scotland  in that case malcolm we need not grieve over the defeat today you know my sympathies are with the brave empress of austria rather than with her enemies and this defeat should go far towards seating her securely on the throne now what will you do malcolm shall we try and find my fathers friends at once  nor for another few days malcolm said just after a defeat men are not in the best mood to discuss bygone matters let us wait and see what is done next  the next morning a portion of the french army which had not been engaged crossed the river and collected the french and english wounded for the latter had also been left behind they were treated by the french with the same care and kindness that was bestowed upon their own wounded de noailles was about to advance against the english at hanau when he received the news that the french army in bavaria had been beaten back by prince charles and had crossed the rhine into alsace as he would now be exposed to the whole brunt of the attack of the allies he decided to retreat at once  the next day the retreat recommenced many of the drivers had fled at the first news of the defeat and malcolm without question assumed the post of driver of one of the abandoned teams for another week the army retired and then crossing the rhine near worms were safe from pursuit  now ronald i will look up the old regiment and we will see what is to be done  the 2d scotch dragoons were posted in a little village a mile distant from the main camp which had now been formed malcolm did nor make any formal transfer of the waggon to the authorities thinking it by no means improbable that they would insist upon his continuing his self adopted avocation as driver but after seeing to the horses which were picketed with a long line of transport animals he and ronald walked quietly away without any ceremony of adieu  we must not come back again here he said for some of the teamsters would recognize me as having been driving lately and i should have hard work to prove that i was not a deserter we must take to the old regiment now as long as we are here  on reaching the village they found the street full of troopers who were busy engaged in cleaning their arms grooming their horses and removing all signs of weather and battle ronald felt a thrill of pleasure at hearing his native language spoken he had now so far improved the knowledge of french as to be able to converse without difficulty for malcolm had from his childhood tried to keep up his french and had lately always spoken in that language to him unless it was necessary to speak in english in order to make him understand  these occasions had become more and more rare and two months of constant conversation with malcolm and others had enabled ronald by this time to speak with some fluency in the french tongue none of the soldiers paid any attention to the newcomers whose dress differed in no way from that of frenchmen as after the shipwreck they had of course been obliged to rig themselves out afresh malcolm stopped before an old sergeant who was diligently polishing his sword hilt  and how fares it with you all these years angus graeme  the sergeant almost dropped his sword in his surprise at being so addressed in his own tongue by one whose appearance betokened him a frenchman  you dont know me angus malcolm went on with a smile and yet you ought to for if it hadnt been for me the sword of the german hussar who carved that ugly scar across your cheek would have followed it up by putting an end to your soldiering altogether  heart alive but its malcolm anderson eh man but i am glad to see you i thought you were dead years ago for i have heard nae mair of you since the day when you disappeared from among us like a spook the same day that puir colonel leslie was hauled off to the bastille a sair day was that for us a and where ha ye been all the time  back at home angus at least in body for my hearts been with the old regiment and who think you is this but you must keep a close mouth man for it must nor be talked of this is leslies son by his fathers last order i took him off to scotland with me to be out of reach of his foes and now i have brought him back again to try if between us we can gain any news of his father  you dont say so malcolm i never as much heard that the colonel had a son though there was some talk in the regiment that he had married a great lady and that it was for that that he had been hid away in prison and this is leslies boy only to think now well young sir there isnt a man in the regiment but wad do his best for your fathers son for those who have joined us since and in truth thats the great part of us have heard many a tale of colonel leslie though they may not have served under him and not a tale but was to his honour for a braver officer nor a kinder one never stepped the earth but come inside malcolm i have got a room to myself and a stoup of good wine lets talk over things fair and gentle and when i know what it is that you want you may be sure that i will do all i can for the sake baith of the colonel and of you auld comrade  the trio were soon seated in the cottage and malcolm then gave a short sketch of all that had taken place since he had left the regiment  well well the sergeant said when he had ended and so the lad young as he is has already drawn his sword for the stuarts and takes after his father in loyalty as well as in looks for now that i know who he is i can see his fathers face in his plain enough and now for your plans malcolm  our plans must be left to chance angus we came hither to see whether any of the colonels friends are still in the regiment and to learn from them whether they have any news whatever of him and secondly whether they can tell us aught of his mother  ay there are six or eight officers still in the regiment who served with him hume is our colonel now you will remember him malcolm well for he was captain of our troop and major macpherson was a captain too then there are oliphant and munroe and campbell and graham all of whom were young lieutenants in your time and are now old captains of troops  i will see the colonel and macpherson malcolm said if they do not know the younger men are not likely to will you go along with us angus and introduce me though hume is like enough to remember me seeing that i was so much with leslie  they will be dining in half an hour the sergeant said well go after they have done the meal its always a good time to talk with men when they are full and the colonel will have no business to disturb him then our own dinner will be ready directly i can smell a goose that i picked up as it might be by accident at the place where we halted last night there are four or five of us old soldiers who always mess together when we are not on duty with our troops and if i mistake not you will know every one of them and right glad they will be to see you but of course i shall say no word as to who the lad is save that he is a friend of yours  a few minutes later four other sergeants dropped in and there was a joyful greeting between them and malcolm as soon as they recognized his identity the meal was a jovial one as old jokes and old reminiscences were recalled after an hours sitting angus said  pass round the wine lads till we come back again i am taking anderson to the colonel who was captain of his troop we are not likely to be long and when we come back we will make a night of it in honour of old times or i am mistaken  on leaving the cottage they waited for a while until they saw the colonel and major rise from beside the fire round which with the other officers they had been taking their meal and walk to the cottage which they shared between them angus went up and saluted  what is it graeme the colonel asked  theres one here who would fain have a talk with you it is malcolm anderson whom you may remember as puir colonel leslies servant and as being in your own troop and he has brought one with him concerning whom he will speak to you himself  of course i remember anderson the colonel said he was devoted to leslie bring him in at once what can have brought him out here again after so many years been getting into some trouble at home i suppose he was always in some scrape or other when he was in the regiment for though he was a good soldier he was as wild and reckless a blade as any in the regiment you remember him macpherson  yes i remember him well the major said the colonel was very fond of him and regarded him almost as a brother  a minute later angus ushered malcolm and ronald into the presence of the two officers who had now taken seats in the room which served as kitchen and sitting room to the cottage which was much the largest in the village  well anderson i am glad to see you again colonel hume said rising and holding out his hand we have often spoken of you since the day you disappeared saying that you were going on a mission for the colonel and have wondered what the mission was and how it was that we never heard of you again  i came over to paris four years later colonel but the regiment was away in flanders and as i found out from others what i had come to learn there was no use in my following you as to the colonels mission it was this and he put his hand on ronalds shoulder  what do you mean anderson the colonel asked in surprise  this is colonel leslies son sir he bade me fetch him straight away from the folk with whom he was living and take him off to scotland so as to be out of reach of his foes who would doubtless have made even shorter work with him than they did with the colonel  good heavens the colonel exclaimed this is news indeed so poor leslie left a child and this is he my lad he said taking ronalds hand believe me that anything that i can do for you whatever it be shall be done for the sake of your dear father whom i loved as an elder brother  and i too the major said there was not one of us but would have fought to the death for leslie and now sit down my lad while anderson tells us your story  malcolm began at the account of the charge which colonel leslie had committed to him and the manner in which he had fulfilled it he told them how he had placed the child in the care of his brother he himself having no fixed home of his own and how the lad had received a solid education while he had seen to his learning the use of his sword so that he might be able to follow his fathers career he then told them the episode of the jacobite agent and the escape which had been effected in the thames  you have done well anderson the colonel said when he had concluded and if ever leslie should come to see his son he will have cause to thank you indeed for the way in which you have carried out the charge he committed to you and he may well be pleased at seeing him grown up such a manly young fellow as to leslie himself we know not whether he be alive or dead every interest was made at the time to assuage his majestys hostility but the influence of the marquis of recambours was too strong and the king at last peremptorily forbade leslies name being mentioned before him you see although the girls father was of course at liberty to bestow her hand on whomsoever he pleased he had with the toadyism of a courtier asked the kings approval of the match with chateaurouge which as a matter of course he received his majesty therefore chose to consider it as a personal offence against himself that this scottish soldier of fortune should carry off one of the richest heiresses of france whose hand he had himself granted to one of his peers at the same rime i cannot but think that leslie still lives for had he been dead we should assuredly have heard of the marriage of his widow with some one else the duke has of course long since married and report says that the pair are illmatched but another husband would speedily have been found for the widow  since the duke has married ronald said he should no longer be so bitter against my father and perhaps after so long an imprisonment the king might be moved to grant his release  as the dukes marriage is an unhappy one i fear that you cannot count upon his hostility to your father being in any way lessened as he would all the more regret the interference with his former plans  have you any idea where my mother is sir  none the colonel said but that i might find out for you i will give you a letter to the count de noyes who is on intimate terms with the archbishop of paris who would no doubt be able to tell him in which convent the lady is residing you must not be too sanguine my poor boy of seeing her for it is possible that she has already taken the veil indeed if your father has died and she has still refused to accept any suitor whom the marquis may have found for her you may be sure that she has been compelled to take the veil as her estates would then revert to the nearest kinsman this may for aught we know have happened years ago without a word of it being bruited abroad and the affair only known to those most concerned however we must look at the best side we shall be able doubtless to learn through the archbishop whether she is still merely detained in the convent or has taken the veil and you can then judge accordingly whether your father is likely to be alive or dead but as to your obtaining an interview with your mother i regard it as impossible in the one case as the other  at any rate it is of the highest importance that it should not be known that you are in france if it is proved that your father is dead and your mother is secluded for life we must then introduce you to her family and try and get them to bring all their influence to bear to have you acknowledged openly as the legitimate heir of the marquis and to obtain for you the succession to at least a portion of his estates  say to that of those which she brought him as her dowry in this you may be sure that i and every scottish gentleman in the army will give you all the aid and influence we can bring to bear  ronald warmly thanked colonel hume for his kindness and the next day having received the letter to the count de noyes set out for paris with malcolm on his arrival there he lost no time in calling upon the count and presenting his letter of introduction  the count read it through twice without speaking  my friend colonel hume he said at last tells me that you are the son born in lawful wedlock of colonel leslie and amelie de recambours i am aware of the circumstances of the case being distantly related to the ladys family and will do that which colonel hume asks me namely discover the convent in which she is living but i warn you young man that your position here is a dangerous one and that were it known that colonel leslies son is alive and in france i consider your life would not be worth a days purchase when powerful people are interested in the removal of anyone not favoured with powerful protection the matter is easily arranged there are hundreds of knives in paris whose use can be purchased for a few crowns of if seclusion be deemed better than removal a kings favourite can always obtain a lettredecachet and a man may linger a lifetime in prison without a soul outside the walls knowing of his existence there  you are an obstacle to the plans of a great noble and that is in france a fatal offence your wisest course young man would be to efface yourself to get your friend colonel hume to obtain for you a commission in his regiment and to forget for ever that you are the son of colonel leslie and amelie de recambours however in that you will doubtless choose for yourself but believe me my advice is good at any rate i will do what my friend colonel hume asks me and will obtain for you the name of the convent where your mother is living i do not see that you will be any the better off when you have it for assuredly you will nor be able to obtain permission to see her however that again is your affair if you will give me the address where you are staying in paris i will write to you as soon as i obtain the information do not be impatient the archbishop himself may be in ignorance on the point but i doubt not that to oblige me he will obtain the information from the right quarter  a week later ronald on returning one day to le soldat ecossais found a note awaiting him it contained only the words  she has not taken the veil she is at the convent of our lady at tours  the next morning ronald and malcolm set out on their journey to tours    chapter vi the convent of our lady   arrived at tours malcolm took a quiet lodging in a retired street colonel hume had furnished him with a regular discharge testifying that the bearer malcolm anderson had served his time in the 2d scotch dragoons and was now discharged as being past service and that he recommended him as a steady man for any employment for which he might be suited malcolm showed this document to his landlord in order that the latter might as required by law duly give notice to the police of the name and occupation of his lodger and at the same time mentioned that the relations of his wife lived near tours and that he hoped through them to be able to obtain some sort of employment  as soon as they were settled in their lodgings they went out and after a few inquiries found themselves in front of the convent of our lady it was a massive building in a narrow street near the river to which its grounds surrounded by a high wall extended none of the windows of the building looked towards the street upon which the massive gate with a small wicket entrance opened  what building is this malcolm in a careless tone asked a woman who was sitting knitting at her door nearly opposite the entrance i am a stranger in tours  that needs no telling the woman replied or you would have known that that is the convent of our lady one of the richest in touraine and they say in all france though what they do with their riches is more than i can tell seeing that the rules are of the strictest and that no one ever comes beyond the gates they have their own grounds down to the river and there is a walk along the wall there where they take the air of an evening when the weather is fine poor things i pity them from my soul  but i suppose they all came willingly malcolm said so there is no need for pity  i dont know about willingly the woman said i expect most of them took the veil rather than marry the men their fathers provided for them or because they were in the way of someone who wanted their lands or because their lovers had been killed in the war just as if grief for a lover was going to last ones life besides they are not all sisters they say theres many a lady of good family shut up there till she will do her fathers will well well i often says to myself they may have all the riches of france inside those walls but i would rather sit knitting at my door here than have a share of them  you are a wise woman malcolm said there is nothing like freedom give me a crust and a sod for my pillow rather than gold plates inside a prison i have been a soldier all my life and have had my share of hard knocks but i never grumbled so long as i was on a campaign though i often found it dull work enough when in garrison  oh you have been a soldier i have a brother in the regiment of touraine perhaps you know him  i know the regiment of touraine malcolm said and there are no braver set of men in the kings service what is his name  pierre pitou i have not heard of him for the last two years he is a tall man and broad with a scar over the left eye  to be sure to be sure malcolm said of course pierre pitou is one of my best friends and now i think of it madam i ought to know without asking so great is his resemblance to you why his last words to me were if you go to tours seek out my sister who lives in a house nearly opposite the entrance to the convent of our lady and to think i should have forgotten all about it till i saw you  malcolm remained for a quarter of an hour chatting with the woman about her brother and then promising to call again the next day in the evening to be introduced to her husband he rejoined ronald who had been waiting at the corner of the lane and had been fidgeting with impatience at the long interview between malcolm and the woman  what have you been talking about all this time malcolm and what could you have to say to a stranger  i have been telling her all about her brother pierre pitou of the touraine regiment and how he distinguished himself at dettingen and will surely be made a sergeant with a hope some day of getting to be a captain i have quite won her heart  but who is pierre pitou and when did you know him ronald asked surprised  he is a tall man with broad shoulders and a scar over his left eye malcolm said laughing and he then related the whole conversation  but why did you pretend to this poor woman that you knew her brother  because she may be very useful to us ronald and if you cant find a friend in court its just as well to have one near court she is a gossiping woman and like enough she may know some of the lay sisters who are in fact the servants of the convent and come out to buy supplies of food and other things and who distribute the alms among the poor i dont know what advantage will come of it yet ronald but i can see i have done a great stroke of business and feel quite an affection for my friend pierre pitou  malcolm followed up the acquaintance he had made and soon established himself as a friend of the family ronald did not accompany him on any of his visits for as the plan of proceeding was still undecided he and malcolm agreed that it was better that he should not show himself until some favourable opportunity offered  sometimes towards evening he and malcolm would take a boat and float down the stream past the convent walls and ronald would wonder which of the figures whose heads he could perceive as they walked upon the terrace was that of his mother it was not until malcolm had become quite at home with madame vipon that he again turned the conversation towards the convent he learned that she had often been inside the walls for before her marriage she had worked at a farm whence the convent drew a portion of its supplies milk butter and eggs and she had often carried baskets to the convent  of course i never went beyond the outer court she said but farmer mirons daughter  it was he owned the farm  is a lay sister there she was crossed in love poor girl she liked andre the son of a neighbouring farmer but it was but a small place by the side of that of miron and her father would not hear of it but wanted her to marry jacques dubois the rich miller who was old enough to be her father andre went to the wars and was killed and instead of changing when the news came as her father expected and taking up with the miller she hated him worse than ever and said that he was the cause of andres death so the long and short of it was she came as a lay sister to the convent here of course she never thought of taking the vows for to do that here one must be noble and be able to pay a heavy dowry to the convent  so she is just a lay sister a sort of servant you know but she is a favourite and often goes to market for them and when she does she generally drops in here for a few minutes for a talk for though she was only a child when i was at the farm we were great friends and she hears from me how all the people she used to know are getting on  i suppose she knows all the ladies who reside in the convent as well as the sisters  oh yes and much better than the sisters it is on them she waits she does not see much of the sisters who keep to their own side of the house and have very little to do with the visitors or as one might call them the prisoners for that is what most of them really are  now i think of it malcolm said one of the officers i served under had a relation a lady whom i have heard him say when he was talking to another officer is shut up here either because she wouldnt marry some one her father didnt want her to i forget exactly what it was now let me see what was her name elise  no that wasnt it amelie  amelie de recambours  yes that was it  oh yes i know the name i have heard jeanne speak of her jeanne said it was whispered among them that she had really married somebody against her fathers will at any rate she has been there ever so many years and they have not made her take the veil as they do most of them if they are obstinate and wont give way poor thing jeanne says she is very pretty still though she must be nearly forty now  that is very interesting malcolm said and if you will not mind madam vipon i will write to the officer of whom i spoke and tell him his cousin is alive and well i was his servant in the regiment and i know from what i have heard him say he was very much attached to her there can be no harm in that you know he said as madam vipon looked doubtful but if you would prefer it of course i will not say how i have heard  yes that will be better she agreed there is never any saying how things come round and though theres no harm in what i have told you still its ill gossiping about what takes place inside convent walls  i quite agree with you my dear madam vipon and admire your discretion it is singular how you take after your brother pierre pitou had the reputation of being the most discreet man in the regiment of touraine  ronald was very excited when he heard from malcolm that he had actually obtained news at second hand as to his mother and it was with difficulty that his friend persuaded him to allow matters to go on as he proposed  it will never do to hurry things now ronald everything is turning out beyond our expectations a fortnight ago it seemed absolutely hopeless that you should communicate with your mother now things are in a good train for it  accordingly malcolm made no further allusion to the subject to madame vipon until a fortnight had passed then he said on calling on her one day  do you know my dear madam vipon i have had a letter from the gentleman of whom i was speaking to you he is full of gratitude at the news i sent him i did not tell him from whom i had heard the news save that it was from one of the kindest of women the sister of an old comrade of mine he has sent me this  and he took out a small box which he opened and showed a pretty gold broach with earrings to match  and bid me to give it in his name to the person who had sent him this good news  that is beautiful madam vipon said clapping her hands and i have so often wished for a real gold broach wont my husband open his eyes when he sees them  i think if i might advise my dear madam malcolm said i should not give him the exact history of them he might take it into his head that you had been gossiping although there is no woman in the world less given to gossiping than you are still you know what husbands are therefore if i were you i would tell him that your brother pierre had sent them to you through me knowing you see that you could not have read a letter even if he could have written one  yes perhaps that would be the best madam vipon said but you had better write to pierre and tell him otherwise when he comes home and my husband thanks him for them he might say he had never sent them and there would be a nice affair  i will do so malcolm said but in any case i am sure your wit would have come to the rescue and you would have said that you had in fact bought them from your savings but that thinking your husband might grumble at your little economies you had thought it best to say that they came from your brother  oh fie monsieur i am afraid you are teaching me to tell stories  that is a very hard word my dear madam you know as well as i do that without a little management on both sides husbands and wives would never get on well together but now i want to tell you more not only does my old master write to say how glad he is to hear of his cousins welfare but he has told me a great deal more about the poor lady and knowing your kindness of heart i do not hesitate to communicate the contents of his letter to you the countess amelie de recambours was secretly married to a young officer a great friend of my late master and her father did not discover it until after the birth of a child  a boy then she was shut up here the father got the boy safely away to scotland but he has now come back to france i do not suppose the poor lady has ever heard of her little son since and it would be an act of kindness and mercy to let her know that he is alive and well  yes indeed poor creature madame vipon said sympathetically only to think of being separated from your husband and never hearing of your child for all these years  i knew your tender heart would sympathize with her malcolm said she is indeed to be pitied  and what became of her husband  i fancy he died years ago but my master says nothing about him he only writes of the boy who it seems is so delighted with the news about his mother that he is coming here to see if it is possible to have an interview with her  but it is not possible madam vipon exclaimed how can he see her shut up as she is in that convent  yes it is difficult malcolm agreed but nothing is impossible my dear madam when a woman of heart like yourself takes a matter in hand and i rely i can tell you greatly on your counsel as to your goodwill i am assured of that beforehand  but it is quite quite quite impossible i assure you my good monsieur anderson  well let us see now i know that you would suggest that the first measure to be taken is to open communication between mother and son and there i heartily agree with you  that would be the first thing of course monsieur but how is that to be done  now that is where i look to you madam your friend jeanne waits upon her you see and i know your quick wit will already have perceived that jeanne might deliver a message i am sure that she would never be your friend had she not a warm heart like your own and it will need very little persuasion on your part when you have told her this sad story to induce her to bring gladness to this unfortunate lady  yes but think of the consequences monsieur anderson think what would happen if it were found out  yes if there were any talk of the countess running away from the convent i would not on any condition ask you to assist in such a matter but what is this  merely to give a message a few harmless words  but you said an interview monsieur anderson  an interview only if it is possible my dear madam that is quite another matter and you know you said that it was quite impossible all that we want now is just a little message a message by word of mouth which not even the keenest eye can discover or prevent there can be no harm in that  no i dont think there can be much harm in that madam vipon agreed at any rate i will talk to jeanne it will be her day for going to market tomorrow i will tell her the story of the poor lady and i think i can answer beforehand that she will do everything she can  the following afternoon malcolm again saw madam vipon who told him that although she had not actually promised she had no doubt jeanne would deliver the message  she will be out again on saturday monsieur at nine in the morning and if you will be here with the boy if he has arrived by that time you shall speak to her  at the time appointed malcolm with ronald attired now as a young french gentleman arrived at the house of madam vipon who was warmly thanked by ronald for the interest she had taken in him  my friend here has spoken to me in the highest terms of you madam vipon and i am sure that all that he has said is no more than the truth  i am sure i will do all i can replied madam vipon who was greatly taken by ronalds appearance and manner its a cruel thing separating a mother from a son so many years and after all what i am doing is no hanging matter anyway  a few minutes later jeanne entered she was a pleasant looking woman of five or six and twenty and even her sombre attire as a lay sister failed to give a formal look to her merry face  so these are the gentlemen who want me to become a conspirator she said and to run the risk of all sorts of punishment and penalties for meddling in their business  not so much my business as the business of my mother ronald said you who have such true heart of your own for madam has told us something of your story will i am sure feel for that poor lady shut up for fifteen years and knowing not whether her child is dead or alive if we could but see each other for five minutes think what joy it would be to her what courage her poor heart would take  see each other jeanne repeated surprised you said nothing about that francoise you only said take a message how can they possibly see each other thats a different thing altogether  i want you to take a message first ronald said if nothing more can be done that will be very much but i cannot think but that you and my mother between you will be able to hit upon some plan by which we might meet  but how jeanne asked in perplexity how could it possibly be  for example ronald suggested could i not come in as a lay sister i am not much taller than you and could pass very well as a girl  jeanne burst our laughing  you do not know what you are saying monsieur it would be altogether impossible people do not get taken on as lay sisters in the convent of our lady unless they are known besides in other ways it would be altogether impossible and even if it were not it might be years before you could get to speak to the countess for there are only two or three of us who ever enter the visitors rooms and lastly if you were found out i dont know what would be done to both of us no that would never do at all  well in the next place i could climb on to the river terrace at night and perhaps she could come and speak to me there  that is more possible jeanne said thoughtfully but all the doors are locked up at night  but she might get out of a window ronald urged with a rope ladder she could get down and then return again and none be the wiser  jeanne sat silent for a minute and then she asked suddenly  are you telling me all monsieur or are you intending that the countess shall escape with you  no indeed on my honour ronald exclaimed i have nowhere where i could take my mother she would be pursued and brought back and her position would be far worse than it is now no i swear to you that i only want to see her and to speak to her and i have nothing else whatever in my mind  i believe you monsieur jeanne said gravely had it been otherwise i dare not have helped for my punishment if i was discovered to have aided in an escape from the convent would be terrible  terrible she repeated with a shudder as to the other i will risk it for a gentler and kinder lady i have never met and yet i am sure she must be very very brave to have remained firm for so many years at any rate i will give her your message  ronald took from a small leather bag which he wore round his neck a tiny gold chain with a little cross  i had this round my neck when i was taken away as a child to scotland no doubt she put it there and will recognize it say to her only he whom you have not seen since he was an infant is in tours longing above all things to speak to you that is all my message afterwards if you will you can tell her what we have said and how i long to see her how high is her room from the ground because if it is high it will be better that i should climb to her window than that she should descend and ascend again  jeanne shook her head  that could not be she said the visitors have all separate cells but the partitions do not go up to the ceiling and even if you entered not a word could be spoken without being overheard but fortunately she is on the first floor and i am sure she is not one to shrink from so little a matter as the descent of a ladder in order to have an interview with her son  that same afternoon as amelie de recambours was proceeding from the refectory to her cell following several of her fellow captives her attendant jeanne came out from one of the cells glancing behind to see that no one was following she put her finger on her lips and then whispered make some excuse not to go into the garden with the others this evening it is most important then she glided back into the room from which she had come  the countess followed the others in a state of almost bewilderment for sixteen years nothing had occurred to break the monotony of her existence at first occasional angry messages reached her from her father with orders to join an application to the pope for a divorce but when it had been found impossible to overcome her steady refusals the messages had at last ceased and for years no word from the outer world had reached her although she had learned from those who from time to time came to share her captivity what was passing outside whether her husband was alive or dead she knew not they had told her over and over again that he was dead but the fact that she had never had the option given her of accepting another husband or taking the final vows kept hope alive for she was convinced that if he was really dead efforts would be made to compel her to marry again  what then she wondered to herself could this communication so secretly given mean she regarded the lay sister who attended upon her as a happy looking young woman whose face was in strong contrast to most of those within the walls of the convent but she had exchanged but few words with her knowing that she would be but a short time about her for the policy of the abbess was to change the attendants upon the ladies in their charge frequently in order to prevent them from being tampered with or persuaded into conveying communications without the walls  you look pale amelie one of the other ladies said as they gathered in a group for a moment before proceeding to their respective apartments where they were supposed to pass the afternoon in working reading and meditation  it is the heat the countess said i have a headache  you look it the latter said it is not often that you have anything the matter with you you know we all say that you must have a constitution of iron and the courage of a roland to be sixteen years here and yet to have no wrinkle on your forehead no marks of weeping round your eyes  the countess smiled sadly  i wept the first six months almost without ceasing and then i told myself that if i would be strong and resist i must weep no more if a bird in a cage once takes to pining he is sure not to live long there are few of us here the news of whose death would not give pleasure to those who shut us up and i for one resolved that i would live in spite of all  well you must not get ill now amelie we should miss you terribly in the one hour of the day when we really live the hour when we walk and talk and laugh if we can on the river terrace  i dont think i shall be able to come this evening the countess said i shall lie down and keep myself quiet tomorrow i hope to be myself again it is a mere passing indisposition  the hours passed slowly as amelie lay on her couch and wondered over the coming interview there were so many things which she might hear  that her father was dead that her family had hopes at last of obtaining her restoration to the world that it could be a message from her husband she had no hope for so long as her father lived she was sure that his release would never be granted as to the child she scarce gave it a thought that it had somehow been removed and had escaped the search that had been made for it she was aware for attempts had been made to obtain from her some clue as to where it would most likely have been taken she was convinced that it had never been found for if it had she would have heard of it it would have been used as a lever to work upon her  at last the hour when she was accustomed to go into the garden arrived and as the convent bell struck seven she heard the doors of the other cells open the sound of feet in the corridor and then all became still in a few minutes a step approached and one of the sisters entered to inquire why she was not in the garden with the others  she repeated that her head ached  you look pale the sister said and your hand is hot and feverish i will send you up some tisane it is the heat no doubt i think that we are going to have thunder  in a few minutes a step was again heard approaching and jeanne entered with the medicament as she closed the door the countess started into a sitting position  what is it jeanne what is it that you have to say to me  calm yourself i pray you countess jeanne said for both our sakes i pray you to hear what i have to say calmly i expect sister felicia will be here directly when she heard you were unwell she said she would come up and see what you needed and now i will begin my message in the first place i was to hand you this and she placed in amelies hand the little necklet and cross  for a moment the countess looked at them wonderingly and then there flashed across her memory a sturdy child in its nurses arms and a tall man looking on with a loving smile as she fastened a tiny gold chain round the childs neck a low cry burst from her lips as she started to her feet  hush lady hush jeanne exclaimed this is my message he whom you have not seen since he was an infant is in tours longing above all things to speak to you  my child my child the countess cried alive and here my god i thank thee that thou hast remembered a friendless mother at last have you seen him jeanne what is he like oh tell me everything  he is a right proper young gentleman madam straight and comely and tall with brown waving hair and a bright pleasant face a son such as any mother might be proud of  the countess suddenly threw her arms around jeannes neck and burst into tears  you have made me so happy jeanne happy as i never thought to be again how can i thank you  the best way at present madam jeanne said with a smile will be by drinking up that tisane and lying down quietly sister felicia moves about as noiselessly as a cat and she may pop in at any moment do you lie down again and i will stand a little way off talking then if she comes upon us suddenly she will suspect nothing  the countess seized the bowl of tisane and drank it off and then threw herself on the couch  go on jeanne go on have pity on my impatience think how i am longing to hear of him did the message say he was longing to see me but that is not possible  it is not quite impossible madam though it would be dangerous very dangerous still it is not quite impossible  how then could it be done jeanne you know what our life is here how can i possibly see my boy  what he proposes madam is this that he should some night scale the river wall and await you on the terrace and that you should descend from your window by a rope ladder and so return after seeing him  oh yes that is possible the countess exclaimed i could knot my bed clothes and slide down it matters not about getting back again since we have no ladder  i can manage to bring in two light ropes jeanne said it would not do for you to be found in the garden for it would excite suspicion and you would never have a chance of doing it again but it is not an easy thing to climb up a rope ladder with no one to help you and you know i shall be at the other end of the house  that is nothing the countess said had i to climb ten times the height do you think i should hesitate for a moment when it was to see my son oh jeanne how good you are and when will it be  i will bring in the ropes next time i go out mind and place them in your bed you will know that that night at eleven oclock your son will be on the terrace awaiting you  as jeanne finished speaking she placed her finger on her lips for she thought she heard a slight noise without the countess closed her eyes and then lay down on her pillow while jeanne stood as if watching her the next instant the door opened noiselessly and sister felicia entered she moved with a noiseless step up to jeanne  is she asleep she whispered  oh no jeanne answered in a louder voice guessing that the sister would have heard the murmur of voices she has only just closed her eyes  the countess looked up  ah is it you sister i have taken the tisane sister angela sent up but my hands are burning and my head aches the heat in chapel was so great i thought i should have fainted  your hands are indeed burning the sister said convinced as soon as she touched them that the countess was really indisposed yes and your pulse is beating quicker than i can count yes you have a touch of fever i will mix you a draught and bring it up to you at once hark that is the first peal of thunder we are going to have a storm it will clear the air and do you even more good than my medicine i will leave you here for tonight if you are not better tomorrow we will move you into the infirmary  the next morning sister felicia found her patient much better though she still seemed languid and weak and was ordered to remain quietly in her apartment for a day or so which was just what she desired for she was so filled with her new born happiness that she feared that if she went about her daily tasks as usual she should not be able to conceal from the sharp eyes of the sisters the joyousness which was brimming over in her while had she laughed she would have astonished the inmates of the gloomy convent    chapter vii mother   when jeanne after accomplishing her errands the next time she went out entered madam vipons she found ronald and malcolm awaiting her  you have told my mother the former asked eagerly as she entered  yes i have told her and if i had been an angel from heaven with a special message to her the poor lady could not have looked more happy  and you have been like an angel to us ronald exclaimed taking her hand how can i thank you for your goodness  for shame sir jeanne said smiling and colouring as ronald in his delight threw his arms round her and kissed her remember i am a lay sister  i could not have helped it ronald said if you had been the lady superior and now he went on eagerly is all arranged see i have brought a ladder of silk rope light and thin but quite strong enough to bear her  you take all for granted then sir you know i said i would take your message but that i would not engage to meddle further in it  i know you said so but i was sure that having gone so far you would do the rest you will wont you jeanne  i suppose i must jeanne said for what with the countess on one side and you on the other i should get no peace if i said no well then it is all arranged at eleven oclock tonight you are to be on the terrace and you can expect her there if she does not come you will know that something has occurred to prevent her and she will come the following night at the same hour  jeanne took the silken cords and wound them round her under her lay sisters robe and then with a kindly nod at ronald and an injunction to be as noiseless as a mouse in climbing up the terrace and above all not to raise his voice in speaking to his mother she tripped away across the street to the convent  malcolm and ronald sallied out from tours before the city gates were closed at sunset and sat down on the slope which rises from the other side of the river and waited till it was time to carry the plan into operation gradually the lights disappeared from the various windows and the sounds which came across the water ceased and by ten oclock everything was profoundly still they had in the course of the afternoon hired a boat saying they were going out for a nights fishing this they had moored a short distance below the town on the side of the river where they now were they now made their way to it and rowed quietly across the stream then they left it and waded through the water which flowed knee deep at the foot of the walls  although tours was still a walled town the habit of keeping sentry in time of peace had long since died out and they had no fear at that hour of discovery there was no moon but the night was bright and clear and they had no difficulty in finding that part of the wall which now formed the terrace of the convent  they were provided with a rope knotted at every foot and with a grapnel attached to one end at the second attempt this caught on the parapet of the wall and ronald at once climbed it and stood on the terrace where a minute later he was joined by malcolm the convent itself could not be seen for a screen of trees at the foot of the wall shut it off from the view of people on the opposite bank of the river they waited quietly until a sudden peal of the bells of the numerous churches announced that it was the hour then they moved towards the steps leading down into the garden a minute later a figure was seen approaching malcolm fell back and ronald advanced towards it as the countess approached she held our her arms exclaiming  my boy my boy and with a cry of mother ronald sprang forward into her embrace  for a short time not a word was spoken and then the countess murmured  my god i thank thee for this great happiness and now my son she said recovering herself tell me everything first have you news of your father  alas no ronald said nothing has been heard of him since the fatal day when he was seized but i am convinced that he is still alive and since i have found you surely i shall be able to find him  who is that with you ronald  that is malcolm anderson it is to him i owe everything he carried me off and took me away with him to scotland the day my father was arrested he has been my best friend ever since and it is he who brought me here to you  the countess advanced to malcolm  my son has told me that we owe everything to you my brave malcolm she said holding out her hand i guessed that it was to you that my husband had confided the care of the child when i learned that it had disappeared i remember what confidence he had in your devotion and how he confided everything to you  he was like a brother to me madam malcolm replied and glad indeed am i that i have been able to befriend his son and to bring him back to you a gentleman who will be an honour even to his fathers name and yours  and now let us sit down here the countess said taking a seat upon a bench it gets light very early and you must not stay after two oclock and there is so much for me to hear  for the next two hours ronald sat holding his mothers hand while he told her the story of his life and now mother he said when he had concluded we have but an hour left for it has just struck one and we have not said a word yet about the principal thing of all how are we to obtain your freedom cannot you arrange to escape with us i do not of course mean tonight for we have nothing prepared and moreover i promised jeanne that there should be no attempt at escape but we can come again when everything is ready we shall of course need a disguise for you for there will be a hot pursuit when your escape is known but we might manage to reach the coast and cross over to england and so make our way north  no my son the countess said i have thought it over in every way since i knew you were here and i am resolved to remain here were i to fly the last hope that your father might be freed would be lost my father would be more than ever incensed against him and me and moreover although that is but a minor consideration there would be no hope whatever of your ever recovering the rank and estate to which you are entitled no i am resolved to wait here at any rate so long as my father lives at his death doubtless there will be some change for as heiress to his estates my existence must be in some way recognized and my family may be enabled to obtain my release when his powerful opposition is removed if not it will be time to take the idea of flight into consideration till then i remain here now that i have seen you now that i know you as you are for i can just make out your face by the light of the stars i shall be as near contentment and happiness as i can be till i meet your father again in the meantime your good friend here can advise you far better than i can as to what your course had better be if you can obtain any high influence use it for obtaining your fathers release if it be accompanied by a sentence of exile from france it matters not so that he is freed you can then return here and i will gladly fly with you to join him in scotland  malcolm now rose from his seat and left mother and son half an hour together when two oclock struck he returned to them  there is the signal the countess said rising and now we must part she had already refused to accede to ronalds entreaty that she would meet him there again  no my son we have been permitted to meet this once but we must not tempt fortune again sooner or later something would be sure to occur which would lead to discovery and bring ruin upon all our plans it is hard to say no and to refuse the chance of seeing you again now that we have come together but i am fully resolved that i will not risk it  we will see you safe up the ladder mother ronald said it is no easy matter to climb up a rope ladder swinging loosely  no i discovered that in descending the countess said but if you come with me you must take off your boots  the print of a mans footstep in the garden would ruin us all and mind not a word must be spoken when we have once left the terrace  taking off their boots they accompanied her through the garden there was a last passionate embrace at the foot of the ladder then the countess mounted it while they held it steady directly she entered the window she undid the fastening of the rope inside and let the ladder drop down to them five minutes later ronald descended the rope into the river malcolm shifted the grapnel so that it caught only on the edge of the parapet and could be shaken off from below when the strain on the rope was removed then he slid down to ronalds side a sharp jerk brought down the grapnel and they returned along the edge of the river as they had come crossed in the boat and waited for morning  they waited two days longer in tours in order that they might receive through jeanne from the countess a list of the noble families to which she was related with notes as to those persons of whom she had seen most before her marriage and who she believed would be most disposed to exert their influence on her behalf  jeanne ronald said i am troubled that i do not know what i can do to show you how grateful i am i should so like to give you some souvenir but what can i do  you could not wear brooches or earrings or trinkets  that i could not monsieur jeanne broke in with a smile and if i could i would not accept them from you i have done what i have done because i pitied your mother and you and i am content that if i have broken the rules i have done it with a good purpose  well jeanne ronald said you may not be a lay sister all your life you have taken no vows that will bind you for ever and i have no doubt that the lady superior can absolve you from your engagements should you at any time wish to go back to the world if so and if i am still in france i will come to dance at your wedding and will promise you as pretty a necklace and earrings as are to be found in touraine  very well that is a bargain jeanne said laughing and it is not impossible young sir that some day i may hold you to your promise for only last market day i met my father and he spoke more kindly to me than he used to and even said that he missed me and i hear that the miller has found someone who will put up with him for the sake of his money i shouldnt be surprised if when that comes off father wants me home again but i shant go directly he asks me you may be sure but shall bargain that if there be again any question of a husband it will be for me to decide and not him  the next day ronald and his companion started for paris they were highly gratified with the success which had attended them and ronald felt his whole life brightened now that he had found the mother who had been so long lost to him on arriving at paris they found that colonel humes regiment had returned to the capital it was not expected that there would at present be any further fighting on the frontier and two or three of the scotch regiments had been brought back ronald at once called on colonel hume and related to him the success which had attended the first portion of his undertaking  i congratulate you indeed colonel hume said i own that i thought your enterprise was a hopeless one for it seemed to me impossible that you should be able to obtain an interview with a lady closely imprisoned in a convent why anderson it is plain now that your talents have been lost and that you ought to have been a diplomatist instead of wasting your time as a soldier the way you carried out your plan was indeed admirable and i shall really begin to think that ronald will yet succeed and now my young friend what do you mean to do next  would it be possible sir to ascertain where my father is confined  i think not my lad the colonel said gravely in addition to the four or five prisons in paris there are a score of others in different parts of france the names of the prisoners in each are known only to the governors to all others within the walls they exist as numbers only the governors themselves are sworn to secrecy and even if we could get at one or two of them which would be difficult enough we could hope for no more nor would it be much satisfaction to you merely to know in which prison your father is lying for it is a very different matter to communicate with a prisoner in one of the royal fortresses to passing a message to a lady detained in a convent i can see nothing for you but to follow the example of your mother and to practise patience so conducting yourself as to gain friends and make a name and influence so that at your grandfathers death we may bring as strong a pressure as possible to bear upon the king  how old is my grandfather ronald asked  he is a man about sixty  why he may live twenty years yet ronald exclaimed bitterly  do not look at the worst side of the question colonel hume replied with a smile but he may live some years he went on more gravely and in the meantime you must think what you had better do i will tell you as a great secret that it has been finally resolved that an expedition shall sail this winter for scotland and fifteen thousand troops will assemble at dunkirk under marshal saxe nothing could be more opportune we are to form part of the expedition with several other scottish regiments you are too young as yet for me to ask for a commission for you but if you like i will enroll you as a gentleman volunteer in this way you may have an opportunity of distinguishing yourself i will introduce you to the chevalier and it may be that if he succeeds in gaining the crown of scotland if not of england he will himself ask king louis as a personal favour to release and restore to him colonel leslie of glenlyon who fought bravely with him in 15 if the expedition fails and we get back alive to france i will then obtain for you a commission in the regiment and we can carry out our plan as we arranged what do you say to that  i thank you greatly sir and accept your offer most gratefully i see that i am powerless to do anything for my father now and your plan gives at least a prospect of success in any case nothing will give me so much delight as to serve with the regiment he formerly commanded and under so kind a friend as yourself  that is settled then colonel hume said and now about outfit a gentleman volunteer wears the uniform of the officers of the regiment and indeed is one in all respects except that he draws no pay my purse will be at your disposal do not show any false modesty my lad about accepting help from me your father would have shared his last penny with me had i needed it  i thank you heartily colonel for your offer and should it be necessary i will avail myself of it but at present i have ample funds malcolm carried off with me a bag with a hundred louis and up to the day when i landed in france these had never been touched i have eighty of them still remaining which will provide my outfit and my maintenance for a long time to come  there is another advantage in your being a volunteer rather than on the list of officers ronald in that if it is necessary at any time you can after a word with me lay aside your uniform and go about your affairs as long as you choose without question which would be hard to do if you belonged regularly to the regiment  at the end of a week ronald had procured his uniform and was presented by the colonel to the officers of the regiment as ronald leslie the son of an old friend of his who was joining the regiment as a gentleman volunteer malcolm joined only in the capacity of ronalds servant it was painful to the lad that his old friend and protector should assume such a relation towards him but malcolm laughed at his scruples  my dear ronald he said i was your fathers servant and yet his friend why should i not act in the same capacity to you as to the duties they are so light that now i do not belong to the regiment my only difficulty will be to kill time there is nothing to do save to polish up your arms and your equipment your horse will be looked after by a trooper so long as you are with the regiment i shall call you in the morning get your cup of chocolate and prepare your dinner when you do not dine abroad carry your messages when you have any messages to send and escort you when you go about any business in which it is possible that a second sword would be of use to you as i have said the only trouble will be to know what to do with myself when you do not want me  it was now the end of august and for the next four months ronald worked hard at drill he soon became a general favourite with the officers the fact that his name was leslie and that he was accompanied by malcolm who was known to many of the old soldiers as being devoted to their former colonel and as having in some strange way disappeared from the regiment at the same time gave ground to a general surmise that leslie was the colonels son  malcolm himself when questioned neither denied nor acknowledged the fact but turned it off with a joke and a laugh he was soon as much at home in his old regiment as if he formed a part in it and when not required by ronald passed the greater part of his time with his former comrades as was natural the opinion entertained by the men as to leslies identity was shared by the officers the avoidance by ronald of any allusion to his family his declining when he first came among them to say to which branch of the leslies he belonged and the decided manner in which colonel hume the first time the question was broached in his hearing in ronalds absence said that he begged no inquiries would be made on that score all he could assure them was that leslies father was a gentleman of good family and a personal friend of his own  put a stop to all further questioning but strengthened the idea that had got abroad that the young volunteer was the son of colonel leslie  early in january the 2d scottish dragoons marched for dunkirk where twenty thousand men assembled while a large number of men of war and transports were gathered in the port one day when ronald was walking in the street with malcolm at his heels the latter stepped up to him and touched him  do you see that officer in the uniform of a colonel of the black musketeers in that group at the opposite corner look at him well for he is your fathers greatest enemy and would be yours if he knew who you are that is the duke de chateaurouge  ronald gazed at the man who had exercised so evil an influence upon the fate of his parents he was a tall dark man with a pointed moustache and of from forty to fortyfive years of age his features were regular and handsome but in his thin straight eyebrows the curl of his lips and a certain supercilious drooping of the eyelids ronald read the evil passions which rendered him so dangerous and implacable an enemy  so that is the duke ronald said when he had passed on i did not know he was a soldier  he is an honorary colonel of the regiment and only does duty when it is called on active service but he served in it for some years as a young man and had the reputation of being a good soldier though i know that he was considered a harsh and unfeeling officer by the men who served under him that is the man ronald and if you could get six inches of your sword between his ribs it would go a good long way towards obtaining your fathers release but i warn you he is said to be one of the best swordsmen in france  i care not how good a swordsmen he is ronald said hotly if i do but get a fair chance  dont do anything rash ronald i have no fear about your swordsmanship for i know in the last four months you have practised hard and that francois says that young as you are you could give a point to any officer in the regiment but at present it were madness to quarrel with the duke you have everything to lose and nothing to gain if he killed you there would be an end of you and your plans if you killed him you would have to fly the country for a court favourite is not to be slain with as much impunity as a bourgeois and equally would there be an end of all hope of obtaining your fathers release  no for the present you must be content to bide your time still it is as well for you to know your foe when you see him and in the meantime go on frequenting the various schools of arms and learn every trick of the sword that is to be taught look he went on as a group of mounted officers rode down the street that is marshal saxe one of the best soldiers in france if not the best and just as wild and reckless in private life as he is calm and prudent as a general  ronald looked with some surprise at the great general he had expected to see a dashing soldier he saw a man who looked worn and bent with disease and as if scarce strong enough to sit on his horse but there was still a fire in his eye and as he uttered a joke to an officer riding next to him and joined merrily in the laugh it was evident that his spirit was untouched by the disease which had made a wreck of his body  a few days later a messenger arrived with the news that the french fleet from brest had sailed and had met the english fleet which had gone off in pursuit of it and the coast of kent was in consequence unguarded orders were instantly given that the troops should embark on board the transports and as fast as these were filled they set sail the embarkation of the cavalry naturally took longer time than that of the infantry and before the scottish dragoons had got their horses on board a portion of the fleet was already out of sight  was there ever such luck malcolm exclaimed after assisting in getting the horses on board a by no means easy task as the vessel was rolling heavily at her mooring the wind is rising every moment and blowing straight into the harbour unless i mistake not there will be no sailing tonight  this was soon evident to all signals were made from ship to ship fresh anchors were let down and the topmast housed by midnight it was blowing a tremendous gale which continued for three days several of the transports dragged their anchors and were washed ashore and messages arrived from different parts of the coast telling of the wreck of many of those which had sailed before the storm set in  the portion of the fleet which had sailed had indeed been utterly dispersed by the gale many ships were lost and the rest shattered and dismantled arrived at intervals at the various french ports the blow was too heavy to be repaired the english fleet had again returned to the coast and were on the lookout to intercept the expedition and as this was now reduced to a little more than half of its original strength no surprise was felt when the plan was abandoned altogether  marshal saxe with a portion of the troops marched to join the army in flanders and the scotch dragoons were ordered to return to paris for the present  for a year ronald remained with the regiment in paris he had during that time been introduced by colonel hume to several members of his mothers family by some of these who had known her before her marriage he was kindly received but all told him that it would be hopeless to make any efforts for the release of his father as long as the marquis de recambours remained alive and high in favour at court and that any movement in that direction would be likely to do harm rather than good some of the others clearly intimated to him that they considered that the countess had by making a secret marriage and defying her fathers authority forfeited all right to the assistance or sympathy of her mothers family  twice ronald travelled to tours and sent messages to his mother through jeanne and received answers from the countess she had however refused to meet him again on the terrace saying that in spite of the love she had for him and her desire to see him again she was firmly resolved not to run the risk of danger to him and the failure of all their hopes by any rash step  at the end of the summer campaign in flanders marshal saxe returned to paris and colonel hume one day took ronald and introduced him to him having previously interested the marshal by relating his history to him the marshal asked ronald many questions and was much pleased with his frank manner and bearing  you shall have any protection i can give you the marshal said no man has loved adventures more than i nor had a fairer share of them and my sympathies are altogether with you besides i remember your father well and many a carouse have we had together in flanders but i am a soldier you know and though the king is glad enough to employ our swords in fighting his enemies we have but little influence at court i promise you however that after the first great victory i win i will ask the release of your father as a personal favour from the king on the ground that he was an old comrade of mine i can only hope for your sake that the marquis your grandfather may have departed this world before that takes place for he is one of the kings prime favourites and even the request of a victorious general would go for little as opposed to his influence the other way and now if you like i will give you a commission in colonel humes regiment you have served for a year as a volunteer now and younger men than you have received commissions  ronald thanked the marshal most heartily for his kind promise but said that at present he would rather remain as a volunteer because it gave him greater freedom of action  perhaps you are right the marshal said but at any rate you had better abstain from attempting any steps such as colonel hume tells me you once thought of for obtaining the release of your father success will be all but impossible and a failure would destroy altogether any hopes you may have of obtaining his release from the king  it seemed that some of his mothers family with whom he had communicated must have desired to gain the favour of the favourite of the king by relating the circumstances to him for a short time after ronalds interview with the marshal the marquis came up to colonel hume when he was on duty in the kings antechamber and in the presence of a number of courtiers said to him  so colonel hume i find that i have to thank you for harbouring in your regiment an imposter who claims to be my grandson i shall know sir how to repay the obligation  the gentleman in question is no imposter marquis as i have taken the pains to inform myself and i am not aware of any reason why i should not admit the son of a scottish gentleman into my regiment even though he happen to be a grandson of yours as to your threat sir as long as i do my duty to his majesty i fear the displeasure of no man  two nights later as ronald was returning from dining with colonel hume and some of his officers he was suddenly attacked in a narrow street by six men malcolm was with him for colonel hume had at once related to him the conversation he had had with the marquis and had warned him to take the greatest precautions  he is perfectly capable of having you suddenly put out of his way by a stab in the back ronald and if there were anywhere for you to go i should advise you to leave paris at once but nowhere in france would you be safe from him and it would upset all your plans to return to scotland at present however you cannot be too careful  ronald had related what had passed to malcolm who determined to watch more carefully than ever over his safety and never left his side when he was outside the barracks  the instant the six men rushed out from a lane at whose entrance a lantern was dimly burning malcolms sword was out and before the assailants had time to strike a blow he had run the foremost through the body  ronald instantly recovered from his surprise and also drew he was now nearly eighteen and although he had not yet gained his full height he was a match for most men in strength while his constant exercise in the school of arms had strengthened the muscle of his sword arm until in strength as well as in skill he could hold his own against the best swordsman in the regiment the men were for a moment checked by the fall of their leader but then seeing that they had opposed to them only one man and another whom they regarded as a lad scarcely to be taken into consideration they rushed upon them they were quickly undeceived ronald parried the first blow aimed at him and with his riposte stretched his opponent on the pavement and then springing forward after a few rapid thrusts and parries ran the next through the shoulder almost at the same moment that malcolm stretched another opponent on the ground  terrified at the downfall of three of their number while a fourth leaned against a door post disabled the two remaining ruffians took to their heels and fled at the top of their speed the whole affair having lasted scarce a minute  tell your employer ronald said to the wounded man that i am not to be disposed of so easily as he imagined i should be only giving you what you deserve if i were to pass my sword through your body but i disdain to kill such pitiful assassins except in self defence  the next morning ronald communicated to colonel hume what had happened  its just as well my young friend that you are going to leave paris i received orders half an hour ago for the regiment to march to the frontier at once that is the marquiss doing no doubt he thought to get rid of you last night and to punish me this morning but he has failed both ways you have defeated his cutthroats i shall be heartily glad to be at the front again for i am sick of this idle life in paris    chapter viii hidden foes   i am heartily glad to be out of paris ronald said to malcolm on their first halt after leaving the capital it is not pleasant to regard every man one meets after dark as a possible enemy and although i escaped scot free from the gang who attacked us the other night one cannot always expect such good fortune as that it was a constant weight on ones mind and i feel like a new man now that we are beyond the city walls  nevertheless ronald we must not omit any precautions your enemy has a long purse and can reach right across france that last affair is proof of his bitterness against you and it would be rash indeed were we to act as if having made one attempt and failed he would abandon his plans altogether he is clearly a man who nourishes a grudge for years and his first failure is only likely to add to his vindictive feeling i do not say that your danger is as great as it was in paris but that is simply because the opportunities of attacking you are fewer i should advise you to be as careful as before and to be on your guard against ambushes and surprises  well it may be so malcolm and of course i will be careful but till i have proof to the contrary i shall prefer to think that the marquis will trust to my being knocked on the head during the war and will make no further move against me until the regiment returns to paris  think what you like lad malcolm said so that you are cautious and guarded i shall sleep with one eye open i can tell you till we are fairly beyond the frontier  two days later the regiment encamped outside the town of st quentin they were usually quartered on the inhabitants but the town was already filled with troops and as the weather was fine colonel hume ordered his men to bivouac a short distance outside the walls ronald was seeing that his troop got their breakfast next morning when a sergeant came up with two men with a horse  this is monsieur leslie he said to them these men were asking for you sir  what do you want with me ronald said surprised  we heard sir one of the peasants said that you wanted to buy a horse we have a fine animal here and cheap  but i do not want to buy one ronald replied i am very well supplied with horses what made you think i wanted one  we asked one of the officers sir if anyone in the regiment would be likely to buy and he said that monsieur leslie wanted one he believed  no ronald said decidedly whoever told you was mistaken i have my full complement and though your horse looks a nice animal i could not take him if you offered him to me for nothing i dont think you will get anyone to buy him in the regiment i believe that every officer has his full complement of chargers  in the evening ronald happened to mention to malcolm the offer he had had in the morning  it was a nice looking beast he said and i had half a mind to ask them what they would take to exchange him with my roan but i did not want to dip further into my purse  i wish i had been beside you at the time malcolm said earnestly those two fellows wouldnt have gone out of the camp so easily  why what do you mean malcolm  mean malcolm repeated in a vexed tone this is what comes of your being watchful and cautious ronald why the matter is clear enough the marquis has set men on your track but of course they could do nothing until some of them knew you by sight so two of them are sent into camp with this cock and bull story about a horse and they come and have a good look at you and go quietly off it is too provoking had i been there i would have given them in charge of a file of men at once then we would have asked every officer in the regiment if he had sent them to you and when we found as we certainly should have found that none of them had done so we should have marched the men off to colonel hume and i am sure when he heard the circumstances of the case they would have been lashed up and flogged till he had got the truth of the matter out of them my great hope has been that they could not very well attempt your life because none of the men who might be engaged on the job would be likely to know your face and they would therefore have no means of singling you out for attack and now two of the ruffians will be able to follow you and watch their opportunity  oh nonsense malcolm you are too suspicious altogether i have no doubt the affair was just as they stated it to be what was more natural  well ronald you will meet all the other officers at supper in half an hour just ask if any of them sent two men wanting to sell a horse to you this morning if any of them say that they did so i will acknowledge i am wrong  accordingly ronald at supper put the question but none of the officers admitted they knew anything about the matter  you have two very good horses leslie why should anyone suppose that you wanted another the colonel asked  i dont know ronald said i only know that two men did come up with a horse to me this morning and said that one of the officers had told them that i wanted to buy one  it must have been one of the men the colonel said carelessly though i dont know why anyone should suppose that you wanted another charger still someone knowing that you are the last joined officer might think you had need for a second horse  the subject dropped and malcolm shook his head ominously when ronald acknowledged to him that his suspicions were so far right that none of the officers had sent the men to him the next day as the regiment was passing through a thick wood and ronald was riding with captain campbell behind his troop which happened to be in the rear in the regiment two shots were fired from among the trees the first struck ronalds horse in the neck causing him to swerve sharply round a movement which saved his riders life for the second shot which was fired almost instantly after the first grazed his body and passed between him and captain campbell  are you hit leslie the latter exclaimed for the sudden movement of his horse had almost unseated ronald  nothing serious i think the bullet has cut my coat and grazed my skin i think but nothing more  the captain shouted orders to his men and with a score of troopers dashed into the wood the trees grew thickly and there was a dense undergrowth and they had difficulty in making their way through them for half an hour they continued their search without success and then rejoined the regiment on its march  this is a curious affair colonel hume said when captain campbell reported at the next halt that an attempt at assassination had taken place  it looks like a premeditated attempt upon one or other of you you havent been getting into any scrape have you he asked with a smile kissing some peasants wife or offering to run away with his daughter but seriously this is a strange affair why should two men lie in wait for the regiment and fire at two of its officers the men have been behaving well as far as i have heard on the line of march and nothing has occurred which could explain such an outrage as this  it may be fancy on my part colonel ronald said but i cannot help thinking that it is a sequence of that affair i told you about in paris just before we started the first shot struck my horse and the second would certainly have killed me had it not been for the horses sudden swerve therefore it looks as if the shots were aimed at me i have some reason too for supposing that i have been followed if you remember my question last night at supper about the men who wanted to sell me a horse malcolm anderson is convinced that the whole thing was only a ruse to enable them to become acquainted with my face they wanted to be able to recognize me and so got up this story in order to have me pointed out to them and to have a talk with me none of the officers did send them to me as they said and they could hardly have hit upon a better excuse for speaking to me  it certainly looks like it colonel hume said gravely i would give a good deal if we had caught those two men in the wood if we had i would have given them the choice of being hung at once or telling me what was their motive in firing at you and who paid them to do it this is monstrous if we could get but a shadow of proof against your enemies i would lay a formal complaint before the king marquis or no marquis i am not going to have my officers assassinated with impunity however till we have something definite to go upon we can do nothing and until then leslie you had best keep your suspicion to yourself it were best to say nothing of what you think in this country it is dangerous even to whisper against a kings favourite let it be supposed that this attack in the woods was only the work of some malicious scoundrels who must have fired out of pure hatred of the kings troops  captain campbell and ronald quite agreed with the view taken by the colonel and answered all questions as to the affair that they had not the least idea who were the men who fired on them and that no one obtained as much as a glimpse of them  with most of the officers of the regiment indeed with all except one ronald was on excellent terms the exception was a lieutenant named crawford he was first on the list of his company and had indeed been twice passed over in consequence of his quarrelsome and domineering disposition he was a man of seven or eight and twenty he stood about the same height as ronald and was of much the same figure indeed the general resemblance between them had often been remarked  his dislike to ronald had arisen from the fact that previous to the latter joining the regiment crawford had been considered the best swordsman among the officers and ronalds superiority which had been proved over and over again in the fencing room had annoyed him greatly knowing that he would have no chance whatever with ronald in a duel he had carefully abstained from open war showing his dislike only by sneering remarks and sarcastic comments which frequently tried ronalds patience to the utmost and more than once called down a sharp rebuke from colonel hume or one or other of the majors he did not lose the opportunity afforded by the shots fired in the wood and was continually suggesting all sorts of motives which might have inspired the would be assassins  ronald who was the reverse of quarrelsome by disposition laughed good temperedly at the various suggestions but one or two of the senior officers remonstrated sharply with crawford as to the extent to which he carried his gibes  you are presuming too much on leslies good nature crawford captain campbell said one day if he were not one of the best tempered young fellows going he would resent your constant attacks upon him and you know well that good swordsman as you are you would have no chances whatever if he did so  i am quite capable of managing my own affairs crawford said sullenly and i do not want any advice from you or any other man  i am speaking to you as the captain of leslies troop captain campbell said sharply and i do not mean to quarrel with you you have had more quarrels than enough in the regiment already and you know colonel hume said on the last occasion that your next quarrel should be your last in the regiment i tell you frankly that if you continue your course of annoyance to young leslie i shall report the matter to the colonel i have noticed that you have the good sense to abstain from your remarks when he is present  three days later the regiment joined the army before namur  that evening having drunk more deeply than usual lieutenant crawford after the colonel had retired from the circle round the fire and to his tent recommenced his provocation to ronald and pushed matters so far that the latter felt that he could no longer treat it as a jest  mr crawford he said i warn you that you are pushing your remarks too far on many previous occasions you have chosen to make observations which i could if i had chosen have resented as insulting i did not choose for i hate brawling and consider that for me who have but lately joined the regiment to be engaged in a quarrel with an officer senior to myself would be in the highest degree unbecoming but i am sure that my fellow officers will bear me out in saying that i have shown fully as much patience as is becoming i therefore have to tell you that i will no longer be your butt and that i shall treat any further remark of the nature of those you have just made as a deliberate insult and shall take measures accordingly  a murmur of approval rose among the officers sitting round and those sitting near crawford endeavoured to quiet him the wine which he had taken had however excited his quarrelsome instinct too far for either counsel or prudence to prevail  i shall say what i choose he said rising to his feet i am not going to be dictated to by anyone much less a boy who has just joined the regiment and who calls himself leslie though no one knows whether he has any right to the name  very well sir leslie said in a quiet tone which was however heard distinctly throughout the circle for at this last outburst on the part of crawford a dead silence had fallen on the circle for only one termination could follow such an insult captain campbell will i hope act for me  certainly captain campbell said in a loud voice and will call upon any friend lieutenant crawford may name and make arrangements to settle this matter in the morning  macleod will you act for me crawford said to a lieutenant sitting next to him  i will act the young officer said coldly as your second in the matter but all here will understand that i do solely because it is necessary that some one should do so and that i disapprove absolutely and wholly of your conduct  well make what arrangements you like crawford said with an oath and rising he left the circle and walked away  when he had left there was an immediate discussion several of the officers were of opinion that the duel should not be allowed to proceed but that crawfords conduct should be reported to the colonel  i am entirely in your hands gentlemen ronald said i have no desire whatever to fight this affair has been forced upon me and i have no alternative but to take it up i am not boasting when i say that i am a far better swordsman than he and i have no need to shrink from meeting him but i have certainly no desire whatever to take his life he has drunk more than he ought to do and if this matter can be arranged and he can be persuaded in the morning to express his regret for what he has said i shall be very glad to accept his apology if it can be settled in this way without either fighting or reporting his conduct to the colonel which would probably result in his having to leave the regiment i should be truly glad  what is that he broke off as a loud cry rang through the air  the whole party sprang to their feet and snatching up their swords ran in the direction from which the cry had come the tents were at some little distance and just as they reached them they saw a man lying on the ground  good heavens it is crawford captain campbell said stooping over him see he has been stabbed in the back it is all over with him who can have done it  he questioned several of the soldiers who had now gathered round attracted like the officers by the cry none of them had seen the act or had noticed anyone running away but in so large a camp there were so many people about that an assassin could well have walked quietly away without attracting any attention  the colonel was speedily on the spot and instituted a rigid inquiry but entirely without success the attack had evidently been sudden and entirely unsuspected for crawford had not drawn his sword  it is singular he said as with the officers he walked slowly back to the fire crawford was not a popular man but i cannot guess at any reason for this murder strange that this should be the second attack made on my officers since we left paris  captain campbell now related what had taken place after he had left the circle  the matter should have been reported to me at once he said although as it has turned out it would have made no difference perhaps after all it is best as it is for a duel between two officers of the regiment would have done us no good and the man was no credit to the regiment but it is a very serious matter that we should be dogged by assassins leslie come up with me to my tent i am not going to blame you lad he said when they were together for you could not have acted otherwise than you have done indeed i have myself noticed several times that crawfords bearing towards you was the reverse of courteous have you any idea as to how he came by his death  i sir ronald said in surprise no i know no more than the others  it strikes me leslie that this is only the sequel of that attack in the wood and that your enemies have unwittingly done you a service crawford was very much your height and build and might easily have been mistaken for you in the dark i fancy that blow was meant for you  it is possible sir ronald said after a pause i had not thought of it but the likeness between him and myself has been frequently noticed it is quite possible that that blow was meant for me  i have very little doubt of it my lad if any of these men were hanging about and saw you as they believed coming away from the circle alone they may well have taken the opportunity let it be a lesson to you to be careful henceforth it is unlikely that the attempt will be repeated at present the men who did it will think that they have earned their money and by this time are probably on the way to paris to carry the news and claim their reward so that for a time at least it is not probable that there will be any repetition of the attempt after that you will have to be on your guard night and day  i wish to heaven we could obtain some clue that would enable me to take steps in the matter but at present we have nothing but our suspicions and i cannot go to the king and say three attempts have been made on the life of one of my officers and that i suspect his grandfather the marquis de recambours has been the author of them  when malcolm heard the events of the evening his opinion was exactly the same as that of the colonel and he expressed himself as convinced that crawford had fallen by a blow intended for ronald he agreed that for a while there was no fear of a renewal of the attempt  the fellows will take the news straight to paris that you have been put out of the way and some time will elapse before the employers know that a mistake has been made then as likely as not they will decide to wait until the campaign is over  the camp before namur was a large and brilliant one the king and dauphin had already arrived with the army all the household troops were there and a large contingent of the nobles of the court the english army was known to be approaching and was expected to fight a battle to relieve namur which the french were besieging vigorously the french confidently hoped that in the approaching battle they would wipe our the reverse which had befallen them at dettingen    chapter ix fontenoy   a fortnight after the scottish dragoons joined the army the king was present at an inspection of their regiment as the brilliant cortege passed along the line ronald saw among the gaily dressed throng of officers riding behind the king and marshal saxe the marquis de recambours and the duke de chateaurouge side by side ronald with two other gentlemen volunteers were in their places in the rear of the regiment it was drawn up in double line and as the royal party rode along for the second time ronald saw that the two noblemen were looking scrutinizingly through the line of troopers at himself and his two companions  that evening colonel hume on his return from a visit to marshal saxe told ronald that the general had inquired after him and had sent him word that if he won the battle he would not forget the promise he had made him he had requested colonel hume to place ronald at his disposal on the day of the battle  i shall want active officers to carry my messages he said and your young friend may have a greater opportunity of distinguishing himself than he would with the regiment i should in that case find it all the easier to bring his business before the king  the marshal is terribly ill colonel hume said as he reported the conversation to ronald so ill that he can only occasionally sit on his horse nothing but his indomitable courage sustains him he is drawn about in a light carriage made of basketwork and this serves him also for his bed  on the 7th of may the enemy were known to be close at hand and the french selected the position on which they would fight the village of fontenoy had already been occupied by a strong body of troops under marshal noailles and the rest of the army now moved forward to the posts allotted to them the english army were close at hand and it was certain that the battle would be fought on the morrow in the evening the king held a grand reception at which all the officers of rank were present when colonel hume returned to his camp his officers were still sitting round the fire  have you any news for us sir  no i believe everything stands as was arranged the king is in the highest spirits though i must say his majesty did not choose reminiscences of a nature to encourage those who heard him he remarked for instance that since the days of st louis the french had never gained a decisive success over the english and a few minutes later he observed that the last time a king of france with his son had fought at the head of the french army was at the battle of poictiers  there was a general laugh  certainly the king was not happy with his reminiscences major munro remarked but i think this time the tables are going to be turned in the first place we considerably outnumbered the enemy even after leaving 15000 men to continue the siege in the second place the position we have chosen is almost impregnable the scheldt covers our right with the fortified bridge securing our communication and the village of antoin resting on the river along our front from antoin to fontenoy is a narrow and difficult valley our left is covered by the wood of barre where a strong redoubt has been constructed and the whole of the position is fortified with breastworks and abattis as far as fontenoy between that village and barre the natural difficulties are so great that field works are unnecessary i cannot believe myself that they will attack us in such a position especially as nearly half their army are dutch who will count for little the english are the only troops which we shall find formidable  before daybreak the camp was astir and the troops took the positions assigned to them even now it was hardly believed that an attack would be made by the enemy so long as the french remained in their all but impregnable position but presently the columns of the enemy were seen advancing ronald had ridden up to the litter on which marshal saxe was placed and after saluting had taken up his position with a number of other officers in readiness to carry orders to different parts of the field  at a short distance from the marshal the king of france with the dauphin and the brilliant cortege of nobles had taken up his post from the position in which the marshal had caused himself to be placed a complete view of the enemys approaching ranks was obtained it could soon be seen that the dutch troops who on the english right were advancing to the attack were moving against the villages of antoin and fontenoy a strong force headed as was known afterwards by general ingoldsby moved towards the wood of barre while a solid column of english and hanoverians 10000 strong marched forward to the attack across the broken ground between fontenoy and the wood of barre  it was as yet but five oclock in the morning when the cannon broke out into a roar on both sides the dutch who were commanded by the prince of waldeck soon hesitated and in a short time fell back out of range of fire on the english right general ingoldsby penetrated some distance into the wood of barre and then fell back again as the dutch had done in an hour after the fighting had commenced the right and left of the allied army had ceased their attack there remained only the centre but this was advancing  under the command of the duke of cumberland the column crossed the ravine in front of fontenoy the ground was so broken that the troops were unable to deploy but moved forward in a solid mass with a front of only forty men  the french batteries from the right and left mowed them down in lines but as steadily as if on parade the places were filled up and unshaken and calm the great column moved forward the cannon which they dragged along by hand opened against fontenoy and the redoubts and as in spite of the hail of fire they pressed steadily on the french gunners were obliged to abandon their cannon and fly  the regiment of french guards officered almost entirely by the highest nobles met the english guards who composed the front lines of the column a tremendous volley flashed along the english line shattering the ranks of the french guard there was a moments fierce fighting and then the english column swept from before it the remains of the french guard and cleared the ravine which defended fontenoy  ronald felt his heart beat with excitement and a feeling of pride and admiration as he saw the english advancing unmoved through the storm of fire they advanced in the most perfect order the sergeants calmly raised or depressed the soldiers muskets to direct the fire each vacant place was filled quietly and regularly without hesitation or hurry and exclamations of surprise and admiration broke even from the french officers  regiment after regiment was brought up and hurled against the head of the column but with no more effect than waves against a rock each being dashed aside shattered and broken by the steady volleys and regular lines of bayonets ronald and other officers were sent off to bring up the cavalry but in vain did these strive to break the serried column one regiment after another charged down upon it but the english retaining their fire until they were within a few yards of their muzzles received them with such tremendous volleys that they recoiled in disorder  the french regiment of vaisseaux next advanced to the attack and fought with greater gallantry than any which had preceded it but at last when almost annihilated its survivors fell back and now it seemed as if this 10000 men were to be victorious over the whole french army marshal saxe begged the king to retire with the dauphin across the bridge of calonne while he did what he could to retrieve the battle but the king refused to leave the field there was a hurried council held round louis and it was agreed to make a great effort by calling up the whole of the troops between fontenoy and antoin as the positions they held were no longer threatened by the dutch  had the latter now advanced nothing could have saved the french army from utter defeat but they remained immovable at a distance from the field of battle the english now won the crown of the position had cut through the french centre and were moving forward towards the bridge of calonne when the whole of the french artillery which had by the advice of the duke of richelieu been brought up opened fire on the english column at the same moment the french regiments from antoin fell upon it while marshal saxe who had when the danger became imminent mounted his horse himself brought up the irish brigade who with a wild yell of hatred flung itself furiously upon the flank of the english  attacked thus on all sides mown down by a heavy fire of artillery unsupported amid an army of foes the column could do no more ten thousand men could not withstand fifty thousand their ranks were twice broken by the irish but twice their officers rallied them until at last when it became evident that no more could be done the column fell slowly back in an order as perfect and regular as that in which it had advanced  french historians have done ample justice to the extraordinary valour shown by the english troops on this occasion a valour never surpassed in the long annals of the british army had they received the slightest assistance from their cowardly allies the victory must have been theirs as it was although unsuccessful the glory and honour of the day rested with them rather than with the victorious army of france more than half the column had fallen in the desperate engagement but the loss of the victors was even greater and comprised many belonging to the noblest families of france  ronald had won the warm approval of marshal saxe for the manner in which he carried his orders across ground swept by a heavy fire and brought up the regiments to within close quarters of the english and after the battle was over marshal saxe presented to the king several of his staff who had most distinguished themselves and calling up ronald who was standing near for his horse had been shot under him as he rode by the side of the marshal with the irish brigade to the attack the marshal said  allow me to present to your majesty ronald leslie a young scottish gentleman of good family who is a volunteer in the scottish dragoons and has rendered great service today by the manner in which he has borne my orders through the thickest of the fire  i will bear you in mind young gentleman the king said graciously and i charge the marshal to bring your name before me on a future day  his duty as aide de camp over ronald rejoined his regiment they had lost nearly a third of their number in their charges upon the english column major munro had been killed the colonel severely wounded and a number of officers had fallen ronald went about among the men assisting to bind up wounds and supplying those who needed it with wine and other refreshments presently he was joined by malcolm  thank god you are safe ronald i tell you you have given me many a fright today as i watched you galloping along through the line of the english fire  where were you malcolm i did not see you  i had nothing to do malcolm said and i climbed a tree not fifty yards from the marshals litter and keeping the trunk in front of me to protect me from a stray bullet i had a good view of the whole proceedings at one time i was on the point of slipping down and making a bolt for it for i thought it was all over with us how that column did fight i have been in many a battle but i never saw anything like it it was grand and if it hadnt been for the irish brigade i think that they would have beaten the whole french army but if you go into a battle again i shant come to see you i have done my share of fighting and can take hard knocks as well as another but i would not go through the anxiety i have suffered today about you on any condition however this has been a great day for you  you mean about the marshal presenting me to the king yes that ought to help us  no i didnt mean that for i had not heard of it i mean about that old rascal your grandfather the marquis de recambours  what about him i have not heard  no malcolm exclaimed then i have good news for you a ball from one of the english field pieces struck him full in the chest and of course slew him instantly he was not thirty yards from the tree when i saw him knocked over he is quite dead i can assure you for when the others moved off i took the trouble to clamber down to assure myself so now the greatest obstacle to the release of your father and mother is out of the way  thank god for that ronald said i have no reason for feeling one spark of regret at what has befallen him he was the cruel persecutor of my parents and did his best to get me removed there is but one obstacle now to obtaining my fathers release and as he is neither a relation nor an old man i shall be able to deal with him myself  yes but you must be careful ronald remember the decree against duelling we must not make a false step now when fortune is at last favouring us there will be no more fighting i fancy the english will certainly not attack us again and tournay must fall and i dont think that on our part there will be any desire whatever to go out of our way to seek another engagement with them the king is sure to go back to paris at once where he will be received with enthusiasm marshal saxe will probably follow as soon as tournay has fallen i should advise you therefore to get leave from the colonel to be absent from the regiment for a time and we will make our way down to tours and let your mother know the marquis is dead and get her to write a memorial to the king requesting permission to leave the convent and then when the marshall arrives in paris we will get him to present it  ronald agreed to malcolms proposal and the next morning having obtained leave of absence from the colonel he and malcolm mounted and rode for tours  the message was duly conveyed to the countess by jeanne together with ronalds earnest request that his mother would again meet him she sent back by jeanne the memorial he had asked her to write to the king begging that she might be allowed to leave the convent but she refused to agree to his wishes to meet her bidding jeanne say that now it seemed there was really a hope of her release shortly she would less than ever risk any step which if discovered might prejudice their plans  although disappointed ronald could not deny that her decision was a wise one and therefore contented himself by sending word that he had obtained one very powerful friend and that he hoped that she would ere long receive good tidings after a short stay at tours ronald and malcolm returned to paris where a series of brilliant fetes in honour of the victory of fontenoy were in preparation tournay had surrendered a few days after the battle the governor of that town having accepted a heavy bribe to open the gates for the place could have resisted for months and the allied army were ready to recommence hostilities in order to relieve it  after its surrender they fell back and resumed a defensive attitude the king therefore returned at once to paris and marshal saxe handing over the command of the army to marshal de noailles followed him by easy stages delighted above all things at a success gained over the english who had for centuries been victorious in every battle in which england and france had met as enemies the citizens of paris organized a succession of brilliant fetes which were responded to by entertainments of all kinds at versailles the scottish dragoons were still at the front but colonel hume had been brought to paris as it would be some time ere he would be able again to take the command of the regiment ronald called at the house where the colonel lodged upon the day after his return from tours and found that he had arrived upon the previous day ronald was at once shown up on sending in his name the colonel was lying on the couch when he entered  how are you colonel  i am going on as well as possible ronald they found the ball and got it out the day before i left the regiment and i shall do well now i have been carried on a litter all the way by eight of our troopers and the good fellows were as gentle with me as if i had been a child and i scarce felt a jar the whole distance what i have got to do now is to lie quiet and the doctor promises me that in six weeks time i shall be fit to mount a horse again marshal saxe sent yesterday evening to inquire after me and i will send you to him to thank him for so sending and to inquire on my part how he himself is going on my message will be a good excuse for your presenting yourself  ronald found the antechamber of the marshal crowded with nobles and officers who had come to pay their respects to the victorious general who was next to the king himself at that moment the most popular man in france hitherto as a protestant and a foreigner maurice of saxony had been regarded by many with jealousy and dislike but the victory which he had won for the french arms had for the first time obliterated every feeling save admiration and gratitude  presently the marshal came out from the inner room with the dauphin who had called on the part of the king to inquire after his health he was now able to walk the excitement of the battle and the satisfaction of the victory having enabled him partially to shake off the disease which afflicted him after the dauphin had left the marshal made the tour of the apartment exchanging a few words with all present  ah you are there my young leslie he said familiarly when he came to ronald where have you been i have not seen you since the day when you galloped about with my messages through the english fire as if you had a charmed life  colonel hume gave me leave sir to travel on private business i am now the bearer of a message from him thanking you for the kind inquiries as to his wound he bids me say that he trusts that your own health is rapidly recovering  as you see leslie fontenoy has done wonders for me as well as for france but wait here i will speak with you again  in half an hour most of the callers took their departure then the marshal called ronald into an inner room  tomorrow he said i am going to pay my respects to the king at versailles i will take you with me have you your mothers memorial that is right as her father was killed at fontenoy there will i hope be the less difficulty over the matter but we must not be too sanguine for there will be a host of hungry competitors for the estates of the marquis and all these will unite against you however i do not think the king will be able to refuse my first request and when your mother is out we must put our heads together and see about getting your fathers release  ronald expressed his deep gratitude at the marshals kindness  say nothing about it my lad fortunately i want nothing for myself and it is no use being a victorious general if one cannot utilize it in some way so i am quite glad to have something to ask the king  the next day ronald presented himself at the hotel of marshal saxe and rode by the side of his carriage out to versailles the king surrounded by a brilliant train of courtiers received the marshal with the greatest warmth and after talking to him for some time retired with him into his private closet a few minutes later one of the royal pages came out into the audience chamber and said in a loud voice that the king desired the presence of monsieur ronald leslie  greatly embarrassed at finding himself the centre of observation not unmingled with envy at the summons ronald followed the page into the presence of the king who was alone with marshal saxe louis who was in high good humour gave ronald his hand to kiss saying  i told the marshal to recall your name to me and he has done so now he says that you have a boon to ask of me  yes sire the marshal said and please consider graciously that it is i who ask it as well as he your majesty has always been gracious to me and if you think me deserving of any mark of your favour after this success which your majesty and i have gained together i would now crave that you grant it  it is granted before you name it marshal the king said i give you my royal word that whatever be your boon provided that it be within the bounds of possibility it is yours  then sire i ask that an old comrade and fellow soldier of mine who fought bravely for your majesty but who fell under your majestys displeasure many years ago on account of a marriage which he made contrary to your pleasure may be released he has now been over sixteen years in prison and has therefore paid dearly for thwarting your will and his wife has all this time been confined in a convent they are the father and mother of this brave lad  colonel leslie who commanded your majestys regiment of scotch dragoons and his wife the countess amelie of recambours i ask your majesty as my boon that you will order this officer to be released and the lady to be allowed to leave the convent  peste marshal the king said good temperedly your request is one of which will get me into hot water with a score of people from the day the marquis was killed at fontenoy i have heard nothing but questions about his estates and i believe that no small portion of them have been already promised  i say nothing about the estates the marshal replied as to that your majestys sense of justice is too well known for it to be necessary for me to say a single word the countess has estates of her own which she inherited from her mother but even as to these i say nothing it is her liberty and that of her husband which i and this brave lad ask of your majesty  it is granted marshal and had your boon been a great one instead of a small one i would have granted it as freely and the king again held out his hand to ronald who bent on one knee to kiss it tears of joy flowing down his cheeks and preventing the utterance of any audible thanks for the boon which far surpassed his expectations for the marshal had said nothing as to his intention of asking his fathers freedom which indeed he only decided to do upon seeing in how favourable a disposition he had found the king  you see marshal louis went on marriages like this must be sternly discouraged or all order in our kingdom would be done away with wilful girls and headstrong soldiers cannot be permitted to arrange their affairs without reference to the plans of their parents and in this instance it happened that the fathers plans had received our approval the great estates of france cannot be handed over to the first comer who may perhaps be utterly unworthy of them i do not say that in the present case colonel leslie was in any way personally unworthy but the disposal of the hands of the great heiresses of france is in the kings gift and those who cross him are against his authority  the king touched a bell and bade the page who entered to order his secretary to attend at once  search the register of the state prisons he said and tell me where colonel leslie who was arrested by our orders sixteen years ago is confined and then make out an order to the governor of his prison for his release also draw up an order upon the lady superior of  and he paused  the convent of our lady at tours ronald ventured to put in  oh you have discovered that eh the king said with a smile and then turned again to the secretary  bidding her suffer the countess amelie de recambours to leave the convent and to proceed where she will  the secretary bowed and retired ronald seeing that his own presence was no longer required said a few words of deep gratitude to the king and retired to the audience room where he remained until ten minutes later the door of the kings closet opened and the king and marshal saxe again appeared the audience lasted for another half hour and then the marshal accompanied by many of the nobles made his way down to his carriage ronald again mounted and as soon as the carriage had left the great courtyard of the palace rode up alongside and poured out his gratitude to the marshal  it has been another fontenoy the marshal said smiling here are the two orders the one for tours the other for the governor of the royal castle at blois the king made light of it but i know his manner so well that i could see he would rather that i had asked for a dukedom for you it is not often that kings are thwarted and he regards your parents as being rebels against his authority however he was bound by his promise and there are the papers now only one word leslie do not indulge in any hopes that you will see your father more than a shadow of the stalwart soldier that he was sixteen years ago there are few men indeed whose constitution enable them to live through sixteen years confinement in a state prison therefore prepare yourself to find him a mere wreck i trust that freedom and your mothers care may do much for him but dont expect too much at first if you take my advice you will go first and fetch your mother in order that she may be at hand to receive your father when he leaves the fortress by the way i thought it just as well not to produce your mothers memorial as it seemed that we should be able to do without it for it might have struck the king to ask how you obtained it and he would probably have considered that your communication with your mother was a fresh act of defiance against his authority  malcolm was wild with joy when ronald returned with the account of his interview with the king and its successful result and had his not been a seasoned head the number of bumpers which he drank that night in honour of marshal saxe would have rendered him unfit for travel in the morning ronald had after acquainting him with the news gone to colonel hume whose pleasure at hearing that his former colonel and comrade was to regain his freedom was unbounded every preparation was made for an early start  be sure you look well to the priming of your pistols before you put them in your holsters tomorrow malcolm said  do you think it will be necessary  i am sure of it ronald news travels fast and you may be sure that by this time the fact that the king has granted an order for the release of your father and mother is known to the duke of chateaurouge if he did not hear it from the king himself which he would be most likely to do as louis would probably lose no time in explaining to him that he had only gone against his wishes because under the circumstances it was impossible for him to refuse the marshals request the secretary who drew out the document would no doubt let the duke know of it there are no secrets at court  but now that the orders for release have been granted ronald said the duke can have no motive in preventing them being delivered for fresh ones could of course be obtained  in the first place ronald the duke will be so furious at your success that he will stick at nothing to have his revenge in the second place he and the others for there are many interested in preventing your mother from coming into her fathers possessions will consider that the gain of time goes for a good deal you are the mover in the matter were you out of the way and the documents destroyed the matter might rest as it is for a long time the marshal is busy from morning till night and would be long before he missed you and would naturally suppose that you had after obtaining the release of your parents retired with them to some country retreat or even left the kingdom  this would give ample time for working upon louis besides the king might never inquire whether the prisoners had been released then the marshal might die or be sent away to the frontier therefore as you see time is everything i tell you ronald i consider the journey you are going to undertake tomorrow an affair of greater danger than going into a pitched battle you will have to doubt everyone you meet on the road the people at the inns you stop at  you may be attacked anywhere and everywhere as to our travelling by the direct road i look upon it as impossible our only chance is to throw them off the scent and as they know our destination that will be no easy matter  they were astir by daylight and malcolm soon brought the horses round to the door  its a comfort to know he said that the horses have passed the night in the barracks and that therefore they have not been tampered with look well to the buckles of your girths ronald see that everything is strong and in good order  that is not your own horse malcolm is it  no it is one of the troopers it is one of the best in the regiment and i persuaded the man to change with me for a week no one is likely to notice the difference as they are as nearly as possible the same colour your horse is good enough for anything but if i could not keep up with you its speed would be useless now i think we can keep together if we have to ride for it  what have you got in that valise malcolm one would think that you were going upon a campaign  i have got four bottles of good wine and bread and meat enough to last us for two days i do not mean if i can help it to enter a shop or stop at an inn till we arrive at tours we can make a shift to sleep for tonight in a wood it would be safer a thousand times than an inn for i will bet fifty to one that if we ventured to enter one we should find one or both of our horses lame on starting again  oh come malcolm thats too much the duke of chateaurouge is not ubiquitous he has not an army to scatter over all france  no he has not malcolm agreed but from what i know of him i doubt not that he can lay his hands on a number of men who will stick at nothing to carry out his orders and earn his money paris swarms with discharged soldiers and ruffians of all kinds and with plenty of gold to set the machine in motion there is no limit to the number of men who might be hired for any desperate deed  as they were talking they were making their way towards one of the southern gates they arrived there before it opened and had to wait a few minutes several other passengers on horseback and foot were gathered there  i could bet a crown piece malcolm said that some one among this crowd is on the watch for us and that before another half hour the duke of chateaurouge will know that we have started    chapter x a perilous journey   a number of peasants with market carts were waiting outside the gates and for the first few miles of their ride the road was dotted with people making their way to the city as they rode malcolm discussed the question of the best road to be taken ronald himself was still in favour of pushing straight forward for he was not so convinced as his follower that a serious attempt would be made to interrupt their journey he pointed out that the road as far as orleans at least was one of the most frequented in france and that in that city even the most reckless would hardly venture to assault them  i agree with you ronald that the road offers less opportunities for ambushes than most others for the country is flat and well cultivated but after all a dozen men with muskets could lie in ambush in a cornfield as well as a wood and the fact that people are going along the road counts for little one way or the other for not one in fifty would venture to interfere if they saw a fray going on but granting that so far as orleans the country is open and cultivated beyond that it is for the most part forest but above all  although they may regard it as possible that we may be on our guard and may travel by other roads  it is upon this direct line that they are sure to make the most preparations for us beyond that it can only be chance work we may go by one road or by another there may be one trap set on each road but once past that and we are safe  after riding for upwards of an hour they came at the turn of the road upon two carts one had apparently broken down and the other had stopped that those with it might give assistance in repairing it one cart was turned across the road and the other filled the rest of the space  stop malcolm exclaimed checking his horse suddenly  what is it ronald asked in surprise  turn back malcolm said sharply as he wheeled his horse round  ronald without a word did the same and they galloped a hundred yards down the road  we were nearly caught there malcolm said  why how do you mean  never mind now ronald turn sharp to the right here and make a detour through the fields you will soon see whether i was right  it is a shame riding through this ripe corn ronald said as without any further comment he leaped his horse over the bank and dashed off among the golden grain which stretched far and wide on both sides of the road  they had not gone fifty yards before they heard loud shouts and as they came abreast of where the carts were standing several shots were fired and ten or twelve men were seen running through the corn as if to cut them off but although they heard the whiz of the bullets they were too far off to be in much danger and the men on foot had no chance of cutting them off a fact which they speedily perceived as one by one they halted and fired a few hundred yards farther the two horsemen came round into the road again and pursued their journey  well what do you think of that ronald  it was an ambush no doubt malcolm but what on earth made you suspect it i saw nothing suspicious merely two carts in the road with three or four men doing something to one of the wheels  i am in a suspicious humour this morning ronald and it is lucky i am the sight of the two carts completely blocking the road brought me to a halt at once and as i checked my horse i saw a movement among the bushes on the right of the road and felt sure that it was an ambush it was a well laid one too and had we ridden on we should have been riddled with bullets no doubt there were men lying in the carts they would have jumped up as we came up to them and the fellows in the bushes would have taken us in the rear between their two fires our chances would have been small indeed no doubt they had a man on watch and directly they saw us coming they got their carts across the road and took up their positions it was a well contrived scheme and we have had a narrow escape  thanks to your quickness and watchfulness malcolm which has saved our lives i admit that you are right and i was wrong for i own that i did not share your apprehensions as to the dangers of our journey henceforth i will be as much on the lookout as you are and will look with suspicion at every beggar woman that may pass  and you will be right to do so malcolm said seriously but for the present i think that we are safe this no doubt was their main ambush and they may reasonably have felt certain of success however we may be sure that they did not rely solely upon it this no doubt is the unmounted portion of their gang they were to try and put a stop to our journey at its outset but mounted men will have ridden on ahead especially as they couldnt have been sure that we should follow this road we might have gone out by one of the other gates at the south side of the town and they will have watched all the roads now i propose that we take the next lane which branches off to the right and travel by byroads in future do not press your horse too fast we have a long journey before us and must always have something in hand in case it is necessary to press them to full speed  two miles further a road branched to the right as they approached it ronald was about to touch his horses rein when malcolm said shortly ride straight on  although surprised at this sudden change of plan ronald obeyed without question  what was that for he asked when he had passed the turning  did you not see that man lying down by the heap of stones at the corner  yes i saw him but what of that  i have no doubt he was on the lookout for us yes i thought so he went on as he stood up in his stirrups and looked back there do you see that horses head in that little thicket just this side of where the road separates i expected as much if we had turned off in another two minutes that fellow would have been galloping along this road to take the news to those ahead and they would have ridden to cut us off further along i have no doubt we shall find someone on watch at every turning between this and orleans  but this is a regular campaign malcolm  it is a campaign ronald the ruffians and thieves of paris form a sort of army they have heads whom they implicitly obey and those who have money enough to set this machine in motion can command the services of any number of men sharp fellows too many of them are and when they received orders to arrest our journey to tours at any cost they would not omit a single precaution which could ensure success their former attack upon you and its result will have showed them that we are not children and that the enterprise was one which demanded all their efforts  what is our next move now malcolm  we will turn off before we get to the next road they can see a long way across these level plains so we will dismount and lead our horses the corn is well nigh shoulder deep and if we choose a spot where the ground lies rather low neither that scoundrel behind nor the one at the next road is likely to see us  half a mile further there was a slight dip in the ground  this is a good spot malcolm said this depression extends far away on our right and although it is very slight and would not conceal us if the ground were bare it will do so now so let us take advantage of it  so saying he dismounted and leading his horse turned into the cornfield ronald followed him and for two miles they kept straight on through the corn then they came upon a narrow road connecting two villages they mounted and turned their horses heads to the south  it is as well that none of the peasants saw us making through their corn ronald said or we should have had them upon us with stone and flail like a swarm of angry bees  it could not be helped malcolm replied and we could easily have ridden away from them however it is just as well that we have had no bother with them now we will quicken our pace we are fairly between two of the main roads south and if we can contrive to make our way by these village tracks we shall at any rate for some time be free from all risk of molestation  i should think we should be free altogether ronald said when they find we do not come along the road they will suppose we have been killed at the first ambush  malcolm shook his head  do not build upon that ronald no doubt as soon as we had passed some of those fellows mounted the horses we saw in the carts and rode off in accordance with an agreed plan to give notice that we had passed them safely and were proceeding by that road in the next place the fellow we saw on watch would most likely after a time mount and follow us and when he got to the watcher at the next crossroad and found that we had not come along there would know that we must have turned off either to the right or left one of them is doubtless before this on his way to the next party with the news while the other has set to work to find out where we turned off which will be easy enough to discover still we have gained something and may fairly reckon that if we ride briskly there is no fear of those who were posted along the road we have left cutting us off  they rode all day at a steady pace stopping occasionally for a short time to allow the horses a rest and a feed the people in the quiet little villages looked in surprise at the young officer and his follower as they rode through their street or stopped for a quarter of an hour while the horses were fed for even malcolm agreed that such pauses were unattended by danger it was rarely indeed that a stranger passed along these bypaths and the peasants wondered among themselves what could induce them to travel by country byways instead of following the main roads  as they left the rich plains of the beauce the country was less carefully cultivated the fields of corn were no longer continuous and presently they came to tracts of uncultivated land with patches of wood they now left the little road they had been following and rode straight across country avoiding all villages they crossed several hills and late in the afternoon drew rein in a wide spreading forest they were malcolm thought quite as far south as orleans and by starting at daylight would arrive at tours by midday  here at least we are perfectly safe he said when we approach tours our perils will begin again when once they find that we have given them the slip they are not likely to try to intercept us anywhere along the route till we near the town for they will know that the chances are enormous against their doing so and the parties along the various roads will push on so as to meet us somewhere near that city the river can only be crossed at certain points and they will feel sure we shall go by one or other of them  and i suppose we shall ronald said  no ronald my idea is that we turn west and ride to le mans then take a wide detour and enter tours from the south side it will take us a day longer but that is of little consequence and i think that we shall in that way entirely outwit them the only precaution we shall have to take is to cross the main road on our right at some point remote from any town or village  i think that is a capital plan i do not mind a share of fair fighting but to be shot down suddenly in an ambush like that of this morning i own i have little fancy for it  hobbling their horses they turned them loose to pick up what they could in the forest and then sat down to enjoy a good meal from the ample supply malcolm had brought with him when night fell they unstrapped their cloaks from their saddles and rolled themselves in them and lay down to sleep an hour later they were roughly awakened each being seized by three men who before they could attempt to offer resistance bound their arms to their sides and then hurried them along through the forest  i have been a fool ronald malcolm said bitterly i ought to have kept watch  it was not your fault malcolm one could never have guessed that they would have found us in this forest somebody must have followed us at a distance and marked us down and brought the rest upon us but even had you kept watch it would have been no good for they would have shot us down before we could make any resistance  i wonder they didnt cut our throats at once malcolm said i dont know what they are troubling to make us prisoners for  presently they saw a light in the forest ahead of them and soon arrived at a spot where a number of men were sitting round a fire  you had no trouble with them pierre i suppose  no captain they slept as soundly as moles they have been speaking some strange language as we came along  thank god malcolm exclaimed fervently i think after all ronald we have only fallen in with a band of robbers and not with our enemies  unbind their hands the captain of the band said but first take away their swords and pistols gentlemen may i ask you to be seated and then perhaps you will inform us what you an officer in the scotch dragoons as i perceive by your uniform are doing here in the forest  ronald to whom the question was principally addressed replied frankly  we took to this forest i fancy for the same reason for which you use it namely for safety we are on our way to tours and there are some people who have interest in preventing our arriving there they made one attempt to stop us near paris fortunately that failed or we should not be now enjoying your society but as it was likely that another attempt would be made upon the road we thought it better to leave it altogether and take to the forest for the night  what interest could anyone have in preventing an officer of the king from arriving at tours the man asked doubtfully  it is rather a long story ronald said but if it is of interest to you i shall be happy to relate it and i may mention that there are three bottles of good wine in the valise of one of the saddles and a story is none the worse for such an accompaniment  a laugh went round the circle at ronalds coolness and a man stepped forward with the two saddles which he had carried from the spot when the captives had been seized the wine was taken out and opened  yes the captain of the band said after tasting it the wine is good now let us have your story  ronald gave them an outline of his history told them how his father and mother had been for many years imprisoned for marrying contrary to the kings pleasure and how he had at last obtained the royal order for their release and how the enemies of his parents were now trying to prevent him from having those orders carried out there are the orders ronald said as he concluded taking them from the inner pocket where he carried them you see they are addressed to the abbess of the convent of our lady at tours and to the governor of blois  the story you tell us is a singular one the captain replied and i doubt not its truth what was the name of your father  he was colonel leslie and commanded the same regiment to which i belong  i remember him one of the band said our regiments were quartered together nigh twenty years ago at flanders and i was in paris at the time when he was imprisoned we were in the next barracks to the scotchmen and i remember what a stir it made the regiment was very nigh mutinying  and i remember you too though i cannot recall your name malcolm said rising and looking hard at the speaker and if i mistake not we have cracked many a flask together and made many a raid on the hen roosts of the flemish farmers my name is malcolm anderson  i remember you well the other said rising and giving him his hand of course i met you scores of times for the regiments were generally brigaded together  that confirms your story altogether monsieur the captain of the band said from this moment do not consider yourself a prisoner any longer i may say that we had no expectation of booty in your case and you were captured rather from curiosity than from any other reason one of my men this afternoon happened to see you ride into the wood and then dismount and make preparations for passing the night there he reported the matter to me i know that gentlemen of your cloth  i may say of mine for i was once an officer of his majesty though i left the service somewhat hastily and he smiled on account of an unfortunate deficiency in the funds of the regiment in which i happened at the time to be acting as paymaster  are seldom burdened with spare cash but the incident seemed so strange that i determined to capture and question you if you happen to have more cash on you than you care about carrying we shall be glad to purchase a few bottles of wine equal to that which you have given us if not i can assure you that i do not press the matter  i am obliged to you for your courtesy ronald said and as at present i really happen to be somewhat flush of cash i am happy to contribute ten louis for the laudable purpose you mention  so saying he took out his purse counted out ten pieces and handed them to the captain  the action was received with a round of applause for the robbers had not from the first anticipated obtaining any booty worth speaking of and the turn affairs had taken had altogether driven any idea of gain from their minds  i thank you warmly sir the captain said and promise you that i will tomorrow despatch a messenger to orleans which is but ten miles away and will lay out the money in liquor with which we will tomorrow night drink your health and success in the enterprise nay more if you like a dozen of my men shall accompany you on your road to tours they have for various reasons which i need not enter into a marked objection to passing through towns but as far as blois they are at your service  i thank you for your offer ronald replied but will not accept it as we intend to ride tomorrow morning to le mans and then to enter tours from the south side by which we shall throw our enemies completely off the scent  but why do you not go to blois first the man asked it is on your way to tours  i wish my mother to be present at the release of my father so long a confinement may well have broken him down now that i see how obstinately bent our enemies are upon our destruction i will take with me two or three stout fellows from tours to act as an escort  what day will you be leaving there the man asked  today is tuesday ronald said on thursday we shall be at tours on friday morning we shall leave  very well the man replied we will be on the road it is no difference to us where we are and as well there as here i will have men scattered all along in the forest between blois and amboise and if i find that there are any suspicious parties along the road we will catch them and if you are attacked you will find that we are close at hand to help you you are a generous fellow and your story has interested me we gentlemen of the woods are obliged to live whatever the law says but if we can do a good action to anybody it pleases us as well as others  i am greatly obliged to you ronald said and can promise you anyhow that your time shall be not altogether thrown away  soon afterwards the whole band lay down round the fire and were sound asleep in the morning malcolm saddled the two horses and after a hearty adieu from the captain and his followers  all of whom were discharged soldiers who had been driven to take up this life from an inability to support themselves in any other way  they started for le mans which town they reached late in the afternoon without adventure  deeming it in the highest degree improbable that any watch would be set for them at a place so far from their line of travel they put up for the night at the principal inn in the morning they again started and after riding for some distance to the south made a wide sweep and crossing the river entered tours from the south late in the evening they again put up at the principal inn for although they doubted not that their arrival would be noticed by the emissaries of the enemy they had no fear of molestation in a town like tours and on the following morning ronald presented himself at the entrance to the convent  i wish to see the lady superior he said to the lay sister at the wicket i am the bearer of a communication to her from the king  he was left waiting for a few minutes outside the gate then the wicket door opened and the sister requested him to follow her not a soul was to be seen as he traversed the gloomy courts and passed through several corridors to the room where the abbess was waiting him in silence he handed to her the kings order the abbess opened and read it  his majestys commands shall be obeyed she said in an hour the countess will be in readiness to depart  a carriage shall be in waiting at the gate to receive her ronald said bowing and then without another word retired  malcolm was awaiting him outside and they at once went to the officer of the royal post and engaged a carriage and post horses to take them to blois  the carriage was at the door at the appointed time and a few minutes later the gate opened and the countess in travelling attire issued out and in a moment was clasped in her sons arms he at once handed her into the carriage and took his place beside her malcolm closed the door and leapt up on the box the postilion cracked his whip and the carriage moved off  can it be true ronald or am i dreaming it is but a week since you were here last and the news of my release came upon me with such a surprise that do you know i fainted am i really free is it possible that i have seen the last of those hateful walls it seems like a dream where are we going  we are going to blois  to a prison the countess exclaimed but no there are no guards or escorts are we going oh ronald are we going to see my husband  yes mother we are going not only to see him but to release him i have the kings order in my pocket  for some time the countess was unable to speak her joy was too great for words then tears came to her relief and she sobbed out exclamations of joy and gratitude ronald said nothing until she had somewhat recovered her calmness and then he told her the manner in which marshal saxe had obtained the two orders of release  i will pray for him night and morning to the last day of my life the countess said god is indeed good to me i had hoped from what you said that my term of imprisonment was drawing to an end but i had looked forward to a long struggle to endless efforts and petitions before i could obtain your fathers release with perhaps failure in the end not for one moment did i dream that such happiness as this awaited me  ronald now thought it wise to repeat the warning which the marshal had given him  mother dear he said you must be prepared to find that a total change will have taken place in my father his imprisonment has been a very different one to yours you have had companions and a certain amount of freedom and comfort you have had people to speak to and have known what is going on in the world he has been cut off altogether from mankind he cannot even know whether you are alive or whether you may not have yielded to the pressure that would be sure to be brought upon you and acquiesced in a divorce being obtained he has doubtless been kept in a narrow cell deprived almost of the air and light of heaven he will be greatly changed mother he will not be like you for it does not seem to me that you have changed much from what you were i could not see you much that night on the terrace but now i see you i can hardly believe that you are my mother so young do you look  i am nearly forty the countess said smiling i was past twentyone when i married had i not been of age they could have pronounced the marriage null and void but you are right ronald and i will prepare myself to find your father greatly changed it cannot be otherwise after all he has gone through but so that i have him again it is enough for me no matter how great the change that may have taken place in him but who are these men the countess exclaimed as a quarter of a mile outside the town four men on horseback took up their places two on each side of the carriage  do not be alarmed mother they are our escort malcolm hired them at le mans they are all old soldiers and can be relied on in case of necessity  but what need can there be for them ronald i have heard that bands of discharged soldiers and others make travelling insecure but i had no idea that it was necessary to have an armed escort  not absolutely necessary mother but a useful measure of precaution we heard of them as we came through from paris and malcolm and i agreed that as you would have with you any jewels and valuables that you took to the convent it would be just as well to be in a position to beat off any who might be disposed to trouble us as you see they have brought with them malcolms horse and mine and we shall now mount the less weight the horses have to draw the better i will get in and have a talk from time to time where the road happens to be good but to tell you the truth the jolting and shaking are neither pleasant nor good for talking  you are expecting to be attacked ronald the countess said i am sure you would not be wanting to get out and leave me so soon after we have met did you not anticipate some danger  frankly mother then i do think it is probable that an attempt may be made to stop us and that not by regular robbers but by your enemies they did their best to prevent me from reaching tours and will now most likely try to prevent our arriving at blois i will tell you all about it when we get there tonight here is the order for my fathers release will you hide it in your dress i had rather not have it about me and mother if we should be attacked do not be alarmed for i have reason to believe that if we should be outnumbered and hard pressed help will speedily be forthcoming  i am not in the least afraid for myself the countess said but be careful ronald remember i have only just found you and for my sake do not expose yourself unnecessarily  i will take care of myself mother he said you know i have always had to do so  malcolm had already mounted his horse and ronald was really glad when he took his place beside him a few yards ahead of the carriage the art both of road making and carriage building was still in its infancy when the weather was fine and the ground hard a fair rate of progress could be maintained but in wet weather the vehicles often sank almost up to their axles in mud holes and quagmires and the bumping and jolting were terrible  now we take up our work of looking out for ambushes again malcolm  it will not be quite the same thing now malcolm said before two or three men with guns behind a wall might do the business now they will have to make a regular attack i have no doubt that we were watched from the time we entered the town and that the news that we are travelling with the countess in a carriage and with an escort of four armed men has been carried on ahead already it is by horsemen that we shall be attacked today if we are attacked at all and they will probably fall upon us in the forest beyond amboise they will know that with a vehicle we must keep the road and that as we cannot travel more than six miles an hour at the outside we cannot attempt to escape by our speed  do you think we had better wait at amboise for the night and go on to orleans tomorrow  no i think we had better push straight on especially as we told our friends in the forest that we should come today and i feel sure they will keep their promise to be on the lookout to aid us if it were not for that i should have said let us stay at tours for the present for we may expect to be attacked by a force much superior to our own  why they would not have sent down more than six men to attack us two malcolm  no if they had been sure which road we should travel but as they didnt know that they may have had small parties at half a dozen spots and these will now be united probably there may be a score of them however i rely on the robbers the captain meant what he said and you won the goodwill of all the men if there are a dozen horsemen anywhere along the road they are sure to know of it and will i have no doubt post themselves close at hand so as to be ready to join in the fray as soon as it commences  amboise was reached without adventure here the horses in the carriage were changed and the party proceeded on their way four miles further they entered a great forest ronald now ordered two of the men to ride a few yards in front of the horses heads he and malcolm rode on each side of the coach the other two followed close behind he ordered the driver in case they were attacked to jump off instantly and run to the horses heads and keep them quiet during the fray  a vigilant lookout was kept suddenly when they were in the thickest part of the wood a number of mounted men dashed out from either side in obedience to the orders ronald had given the men in front and behind at once closed in so that there were three on either side of the carriage the assailants fired their pistols as they dashed down but the bullets flew harmlessly by while the fire of the defenders sitting quietly on their horses was more accurate two of the assailants falling dead while another was severely wounded  a moment later swords were drawn and a furious combat ensued ronald had told his men to keep close to the carriage so that they could not be attacked in the rear keeping just far enough out on either side of him to be able to use their swords for a short time the defenders of the coach maintained their position the number of their assailants giving them but slight advantage as they were unable to utilize their force  ronald ran the first man who attacked him through the body and laid open the face of the next with a sweeping blow from left to right the men they had hired fought stoutly but they were being pressed together as the assailants urged forward their horses when suddenly a volley of firearms was heard  several of the assailants fell dead and with a loud shout a number of men rushed out from the wood and fell upon them in rear the assailants turned to fly and it was now the turn of the defenders of the coach to attack which they did furiously  in two or three minutes all was over five or six only of the assailants cut their way through the footmen who had attacked them in rear while twelve lay dead or dying on the ground ronalds first impulse was to ride up to the carriage to assure his mother of his safety his next to leap off his horse and grasp the hand of the chief of the robbers  you have kept your promise nobly he said and arrived at the very nick of time they were beginning to press us hotly and though i fancy we should have rendered an account of a good many more we must have been beaten in the end  i was farther behind than i intended to be the man said but we were obliged to keep in hiding some little distance behind them there were four parties of them we kept them in sight all yesterday and last night they assembled a mile or two away i had men watching them all night and this morning we followed them here and saw them take up their position on both sides of the road we crept up as closely as we dared without being observed but you had for a couple of minutes to bear the brunt of it alone  i thank you most heartily ronald said my mother will thank you herself so saying he led them to the door of the carriage which he opened  mother i told you that if we were attacked i relied upon help being near at hand we owe our lives for i have no doubt that yours as well as mine would have been taken to this brave man and his followers  i thank you most sincerely sir the countess said at present i feel like one in a dream for i have been so long out of the world that such a scene as this has well nigh bewildered me  i am only too glad to have been of service the man said as he stood bareheaded i am not a good man madame i am one of those whom the necessities of the times have driven to earn their living as they can without much regard to the law but i trust that i have not quite lost my instincts as a gentleman and i am only too glad to have been able to be of some slight assistance to a persecuted lady for your son the other night related to us something of the treatment which you have had to endure  with a bow he now stepped back his followers were engaged in searching the pockets of the fallen and found in them a store of money which spoke well for the liberality of their employer and well satisfied the robbers for the work they had undertaken after a few words with her son the countess opened a small bag she carried with her and taking from it a valuable diamond brooch called the leader of the band up and presented it to him  ronald and his party then remounted their horses  the robbers had already overtaken and caught those of the fallen assailants  the driver mounted the box and after a cordial farewell to their rescuers the party proceeded on their way to blois    chapter xi free   it was late at night before blois was reached and having alighted at the aigle dor they engaged a private room  even the duke of chateaurouge will be satisfied ronald said that his schemes have failed and that no more can be done just at present it will be a bitter blow to him when those scoundrels on their return to paris report their utter failure for he must have considered it impossible that we could escape from the toils he had laid for us i only wish that we had clear evidence that he is the author of these attempts if so i would go straight with marshal saxe and lay an accusation against him before the king but however certain we may feel about it we have really nothing to connect him with the affair and it would be madness to accuse a kings favourite unless one could prove absolutely the truth of what one says however i hope some day that i shall get even with him it will not be my fault if i do not  that night ronald and his mother debated what would be the best way to proceed in the morning and finally they agreed that malcolm should present himself at the prison with the order of release and that they should remain at the hotel to which malcolm should bring colonel leslie after breaking to him the news that his wife and son were both awaiting him the shock in any case of sudden liberty would be a severe one and the meeting with his attached comrade would act as a preparation for that with his wife  mother and son sat hand in hand after hearing the carriage drive off with malcolm next morning in the hours they had spent together they had come to know each other and the relationship had become a real one they had scarce been able to make out each others features at their midnight meeting on the terrace and at that meeting rejoiced as they both were there was still a feeling of strangeness between them now they knew each other as they were and both were well satisfied the countess was less strange to ronald than he was to her malcolm had already described her to him as he knew her eighteen years before and the reality agreed closely with the ideal that ronald had pictured to himself except that she was younger and brighter for in thinking of her he had told himself over and over again that she would have grown much older that her hair might have turned gray with grief and trouble and her spirit been altogether broken  she on her part had been able to form no idea as to what the infant she had last seen would have grown up and was not even sure that he was in existence she had hoped that if he had lived he would have grown up like his father and although she now saw but slight resemblance between them she was indeed well satisfied with her son  he was not she thought as handsome as his father but he bade fair to surpass him in strength and stature she was delighted with his manly bearing and when he laughed he reminded her of her husband and she thought that she read in his gray eye and firm mouth a steadfastness and depth of character equal to his they spoke but little now both were too anxious ronald for his mothers sake rather than his own he was prepared to find this unknown father a man broken down by his years of captivity but although his mother said that she too was prepared for great changes he could not but think that the reality would be a sad shock to her in little over an hour the carriage drove into the courtyard  be brave mother ronald said as he felt the hand he held in his own tremble violently you must be calm for his sake  steps were heard approaching the door opened and malcolm entered with a man leaning on his arm the countess with a cry of joy sprang forward and the next moment was clasped in her husbands arms  at last my love at last she said  ronald drew aside to the window to leave his father and mother to enjoy the first rapture of their meeting undisturbed while malcolm slipped quietly from the room again  why amelie leslie said at last holding her at arms length that he might look the better at her you are scarce changed it does not seem to me that you are five years older than when i saw you last and yet malcolm tells me that you too have been a prisoner how much my love has cost you dear no you are scarce changed while i have become an old man  my hair is as white as snow and i am so crippled with rheumatism i can scarce move my limbs  you are not so much changed angus your hair is white and your face is very pale but you are not so much changed if i have suffered for your love dear what have you suffered for mine i have been a prisoner in a way but i had a certain amount of freedom in my cage while you  and she stopped  yes it has been hard he said but i kept up my spirits amelie i never lost the hope that some day we should be reunited  and now angus here is our boy to whom we owe our liberty and the joy of this meeting you may well be proud of such a son  i am proud leslie said as ronald advanced and he took him in his arms god bless you my boy you have performed well nigh a miracle malcolm has been telling me of you call him in again it is right that he to whom you owe so much should share in our happiness  ronald at once fetched malcolm and until late at night they talked of all that had happened during so many years colonel leslie had passed the first three years of his confinement in the chatelet it was well it was no longer he said for even i hard as i was with years of soldiering could not have stood that much longer my cell there was below the level of the river the walls were damp and it was there i got the rheumatism which has crippled me ever since then they moved me to blois and there my cell was in one of the turrets and the sun shone in through the window slit for half an hour a day besides for an hour once a week i was allowed to take what they called exercise on the wall between my turret and the next the governor was not a bad fellow and did not try to pocket the best part of the money allowed for the keep of the prisoners fortunately i never lost hope had i done so i would have thrown myself over the parapet and ended it at once i felt sure that you too were shut up amelie and i pictured to myself how they would try to make you give me up but i never thought they would succeed dear i knew you too well for that sometimes for months i lay as if paralysed by rheumatism and i think i should have died if i had not known how my enemies would have rejoiced at the news of my death so i held on stoutly and i have got my reward  but the hardships had told their tale although but the same age as malcolm anderson colonel leslie looked fully ten years older his long confinement had taken every tinge of colour out of his face and left it almost ghastly in its whiteness he could with difficulty lift his hands to his head and he walked as stiffly as if his legs had been jointless his voice only had not lost the cheery ring his wife remembered  no amelie he said when she remarked this i kept my tongue in practice it was the one member that was free after i had been confined a few months it struck me that i was rapidly losing the power of speech and i determined that if i could not talk for want of someone to answer me i could at least sing and having a good store of songs scottish and french i sang for hours together at first somewhat to the uneasiness of the prison authorities who thought that i could not be so merry unless i had some communication from without or was planning an escape but at last they grew accustomed to it and as my voice could not travel through the thick walls of my cells it annoyed no one  and did you never think of escaping father  the first few years of my confinement i was always thinking of it ronald but nothing ever came of my thought i had no tools to burrow through a four foot wall and if i could have done so i should have tried if it had only been to give me something to do had it not been that i hoped some day to obtain my release and that any attempt at escape would if discovered as it was almost certain to be decrease my chances  not a word was said that evening as to their future plans all their thoughts being in the past but the next morning colonel leslie said at breakfast  and now what are we going to do next how do we stand  i know no more than you do angus i do not know whether the king has gifted my mothers estate to others as assuredly he has done my fathers lands if he has i have been thinking that the best plan will be to ask the kings permission to leave the kingdom and return to your native scotland  i am very fond of scotland amelie but i have also a fondness for living and how i should live in scotland i have not the most remote idea my estate there was but a small one and was forfeited thirty years ago so unless i become a gaberlunzie and sit on the steps of st andrews asking for alms i dont see how we should get porridge to say nothing of anything else no amelie it seems to me that we must stop in france for very shame they cannot let the daughter of the marquis de recambours starve and they must at least restore you a corner of your parents estates if it be but a farm how are we off for funds at present he asked with a laugh i hope at least we have enough to pay our hotel bill  we have forty louis in cash father the remains of the hundred you committed to malcolm with me  is that so he exclaimed all i can say is that that money has lasted longer than any that ever passed through my fingers before  we have plenty of money the countess said quietly i have all the jewels which came to me from my mother and their sale will keep us for years either in scotland or france  that is good indeed the colonel said cheerily  yes i took them all with me when i was sent to the convent and have parted with none save the diamond necklet which i gave to the girl who brought ronald and me together as a parting keepsake and a brooch with which i rewarded the men who aided us in the forest but seriously angus we must settle upon something  i quite agree with you amelie but what is that something to be  i should think angus that the proper thing would be for me to write to the king thanking him for our release asking his commands and petitioning him that my mothers estates may be restored to me i will also ask permission to retire to some southern town where there are waters which may do good to your rheumatism  colonel leslie frowned  i suppose that is the right thing to do amelie though for my part i cannot thank a sovereign whom i have served well after such treatment as i have received i would rather beg my bread from door to door  no i would not ask you angus and of course you are differently placed but i have my rights as a peeress of france besides i have on my own account no complaint against the king it was my father who shut me up in the convent not the king  by the way amelie her husband said you are not yet in mourning  nor do i intend to be she said firmly unless i have to go to court no thread of mourning do i put on my father behaved like a tyrant to me and i will not feign a grief at an event which has brought us happiness well ronald what do you think had best be done you and malcolm have managed so well that we had best leave it for you to decide  i think what you propose mother is best i think you had better travel down to some place near where your mothers estates lay and then write your petition to the king i will leave you there and return with it to paris and will there consult colonel hume and marshal saxe as to how it should be delivered to the king  this plan was carried out the party journeyed together to poitiers and there having seen his parents comfortably settled in a small house near the town and remained with them a few days ronald with malcolm returned to paris bearing with him his mothers memorial to the king  ronald was glad to find that colonel hume was now recovered from his wound marshal saxe too was better the latter at once took charge of the petition and said that he would hand it to the king on the first opportunity ronald accompanied the marquis several times to versailles but the latter had no private audience with the king and thought it better not to present the memorial in public one day however he was called into the kings closet  when he emerged with the king ronald thought from his expression of countenance that things had not gone well on leaving the palace he mounted his horse  for he was now well enough to ride  and as he set out he called ronald who with other gentlemen had accompanied him to ride beside him  things have not gone well he said your fathers enemies have evidently been at work and have been poisoning the kings mind he read the memorial and then said harshly the countess of recambours has forfeited all rights to her mothers estates by marrying an alien the lands of france are for the king of frances subjects not for soldiers of fortune this touched me and i said your majesty may recollect that i am an alien and a soldier of fortune and methinks that in time of war the swords of our soldiers of fortune have done such things for france that they have earned some right to gratitude in a hundred battles our scottish troops have fought in the front ranks and had it not been for the irish brigade we should not have had to write fontenoy down among the list of french victories  you are bold marshal the king said angrily  i am bold sire i replied because i am in the right and i humbly submit that a brave soldier like colonel leslie deserves better treatment than he has received at the hands of france  the king rose at once  an answer to the petition will be sent to you tomorrow marshal  i bowed and without another word the king left his closet and entered the room of audience however lad you must not look so downcast we could perhaps expect no more the first time of course every man who has a hope or who has a relation who has a hope of obtaining the grant of your mothers estates is interested in exciting the kings displeasure against her besides which there is as you have told me the duc de chateaurouge who may be regarded as a personal enemy of your father and who has the kings ear as much as anyone about him however we must have courage i consider my personal honour is touched in the matter now and i will not let the matter drop till justice is done  at the appointed time ronald again called at marshal saxes hotel and watched the gay crowd of officers and nobles who were gathered in his reception rooms an hour later a royal attendant entered and handed a document to the marshal the latter glanced at it and looked around as soon as his eye fell upon ronald he nodded to him  here is the judgement he said in a low tone as he handed him the paper you see it is directed to the countess to my care i suppose you will start with it at once  yes marshal the horses are saddled and we shall leave immediately  dont hurry your horses the marshal said with a slight smile from the kings manner i think that the contents are such that a few hours delay in the delivery will cause the countess no pain however i do not anticipate anything very harsh in the first place although the king is swayed by favourites who work on his prejudices his intention is always to be just and in the second place after granting the release of your parents as a boon to me he can scarcely annul the boon by any severe sentence will you tell the countess from me that i am wholly at her service and that should any opportunity offer she may be sure that i will do what i can to incline the king favourably towards her lastly leslie take care of yourself the change in the kings manner shows that you have powerful enemies and now that you have succeeded in obtaining your parents freedom you have become dangerous remember the attack that was made upon you before when there seemed but little chance that you would ever succeed in obtaining their release or in seriously threatening the interests of those who were looking forward to the reversion of the family estates their enmity now when it only needs a change in the kings mood to do justice to your parents will be far greater than before  bid your father too to have a care for himself and your mother remember that violence is common enough and there are few inquiries made an attack upon a lonely house and the murder of those within it is naturally put down as the act of some party of discharged soldiers or other ruffians tell him therefore he had best get a few trusty men around him and be on guard night and day against a treacherous attack those who stand in the way of powerful men in france seldom live long so he cannot be too careful  a quarter of an hour later ronald was on horseback he had already provided himself with a pass to leave the city after the usual hour of closing the gates and he and malcolm were soon in the open country as they rode along ronald repeated the warning that the marshal had given him  he is quite right ronald and you cannot be too careful we have against us first this vindictive duc de chateaurouge who no doubt has poisoned the kings mind in all france there is no one whom i would not rather have as a foe he is powerful unscrupulous and vindictive he would hesitate at nothing to carry out anything on which he had set his mind and would think no more of obtaining the removal of one whom he considered to stand in his way than of crushing a worm even as a young man he had a villainous reputation and was regarded as one of the most dangerous men about the court to do him justice he is brave and a fine swordsman and for choice he would rather slay with his own hands those who offend him than by other means though he was but threeandtwenty at the time i first left france he had fought half a dozen duels and killed as many men and several others who were known to have offended him died suddenly some were killed in street brawls returning home at night one or two were suspected of having been poisoned altogether the man was feared and hated in those days although of course none spoke their suspicions openly  from what i have heard those suspicions have stuck to him ever since he has not been engaged in many duels because in the first place edicts against duelling are very strict and in the second because his reputation as a swordsman is so great that few would risk their lives against him still all who stood in his way have somehow or other come to a sudden end we must therefore be on our guard night and day he is of course your most dangerous foe but besides him must be numbered all those who hope to obtain your mothers estates the heirs of the marquis doubtless feel perfectly safe from interference there is no chance whatever of the king dispossessing them in favour of a foreigner so we need not count them among your foes  it is just as well ronald that we started tonight instead of waiting till tomorrow the duke is pretty certain to learn that the kings answer will be sent this evening and may possibly have made preparations for you on the road but he will hardly expect that you will start before the morning however in order to be on the safe side i propose that we shall presently turn off from the main road and avoid all large towns on our way down to poitiers  do you think the danger is as great as that malcolm  i do not think there is much danger ronald just at present though i do in the future  travelling by byways ronald and malcolm arrived at poitiers without adventure  i have brought you the kings answer mother ronald said as he alighted but before you open it i may tell you that it is unfavourable though i am ignorant of the precise nature of its contents but you must not be disappointed marshal saxe bade me tell you that he considers his honour engaged in seeing you righted and that whenever an opportunity occurs he will endeavour to move the kings mind in your favour how is my father  he suffers grievously from rheumatism ronald and can scarce move from his couch  as soon as they joined the colonel the countess opened the kings letter it was brief the countess amelie de recambours is hereby ordered to withdraw at once to her estate of la grenouille and there to await the kings pleasure concerning her  the kings signature was affixed  well that is not so very bad the countess said at any rate my right to one of my mothers estates is recognized la grenouille is the smallest of them and contains but three or four farms still that will suffice for our wants and as it lies but twenty miles from bordeaux the air will be warm and soft for you angus  is there a chateau on it mother  yes there is a small chateau i was there once as a girl it has never been modernized but is still a castle such as it was two hundred years ago  all the better ronald said and he then gave malcolms reasons for their being on the watch against any sudden attack  he is quite right ronald colonel leslie said the duke is capable of anything however we will be on our guard and if as your mother says it is a fortified house we need have no fear of any sudden attack  i would suggest colonel that i should ride to tours malcolm said and hire two of the men who escorted madames carriage they have served in the wars and can be relied upon they would not need high wages for most of the discharged soldiers have trouble enough to keep body and soul together with a couple of men of this kind and two or three of the men on the estate i think colonel you need fear no sudden attack  the colonel approved of the suggestion and a week later malcolm having returned with the two men a carriage was hired to convey the colonel and his wife and so they journeyed quietly down to la grenouille on arriving there they found that they were expected the old steward in charge having received a letter from the royal chancellor saying that he was to receive the countess as the owner of the estate  the old man who had known her mother well and remembered her visits as a child received the countess with respectful joy the chateau was as amelie had said really a castle it was surrounded by a moat filled with water from which the walls rose abruptly with no windows in the lower stories and only small loopholes in those above although the steward was ignorant when his mistress might be expected he had already caused great fires to be lighted in all the rooms and had temporarily engaged two of the farmers daughters to wait upon the countess and three stout men as servitors  what are the revenues of the estate the countess asked the steward that evening my mothers other estates have not been restored to me as yet and i have only this to depend upon and i do not know what establishment i can afford to keep up  the revenue amounts to twelve thousand francs he said there are three large farms and four small ones twelve thousand francs are not much countess for your mothers daughter but they go a long way here where one can live for next to nothing we have a garden which will provide all the fruit and vegetables you require and your poultry will cost you nothing the vineyard attached to the chateau furnishes more than enough wine and the cellars are well filled for every year i have put aside a few barrels so that in fact it will be only meat you have to buy  so that you think i can keep the two men i have brought with me and the servants you have engaged  easily madam and more if you wished it  do you think five men will be sufficient the countess said i ask because i have powerful enemies and in these lawless times an attack upon a lonely house might well be carried out  with the drawbridge drawn up madam five men could hold the chateau against a score and the sound of the alarm bell would bring all the tenants and their men down to your assistance i will answer for them all there were great rejoicings last week when i sent round the news that you were expected the memory of your mother who once resided here for a year is very dear to all of us and there is not a man on the estate but would take up arms in your defence the sound of the alarm bell would bring thirty stout fellows at least to your aid  then we need not trouble on that score amelie the colonel said cheerfully malcolm will see to the drawbridge tomorrow probably it has not been raised for years  i have already been examining it malcolm  who had just entered the room  said it only needs a little oil and a bolt or two i will have it raised tonight things look better than i expected colonel and i shall be able to return to paris without having any anxiety upon your score  but you are not thinking of going back ronald the countess asked anxiously if there is danger here for us there must be surely danger for you in paris and i want you here with us  i will stop for a few days mother and then malcolm and i will be off as i have marshal saxes protection i need fear no open enmity from anyone and as i shall be with the regiment i shall be safe from the secret attacks besides my sword can guard my head  you have taught him to defend himself  eh malcolm colonel leslie said  i malcolm repeated  i can use my sword in a melee colonel as you know and hold my own against dutchman or german when i meet them on the field but ronald is a different blade altogether he was well taught in glasgow and has practised under the best maitres darmes in paris since and i am proud to say that i do not think there are ten men in france against whom he could not hold his own  that is good that is good indeed the colonel said delighted malcolm i feel my obligations to you more and more every day truly i had never even hoped that if my son were ever to be restored to me i should have such cause to be proud of him  but why do you think you had better return to paris ronald his mother inquired  because mother it will not do to let your enemies have entirely their own way now that you have been so far restored doubtless your family will be the more inclined to aid you with their influence but there must be somebody to urge them to do so  besides amelie the colonel put in we must not cage the lad here at your apron strings he has already won saxes regard and protection by his conduct in the field and can now accept a commission in the old regiment he has begun well and may yet live to command it no no my love i should like to keep him here as much as you would but in every way it is better that he should go out and take his place in the world to you and me after our long imprisonment this place is life freedom and happiness and we are together but for him it is a dreary little country chateau and he would soon long for a life among men  and so after three weeks stay at the chateau ronald and malcolm rode back to paris and the former received a week later a commission through marshal saxe in the scottish dragoons that regiment had returned from the frontier and ronald at once took his place in its ranks and was heartily received by all the officers to whom he was formally introduced by colonel hume as the son of their former commanding officer  a short time afterwards it became the turn of duty of the scottish dragoons to furnish guards for a week at versailles and colonel hume took down two troops for that purpose that to which ronald belonged was one of them ronald knowing that for the present he was not in favour with the king begged the colonel to put him on duty as often as possible so that he might avoid the necessity of being present at the kings audiences with the other officers  he was one day walking with the colonel and several other officers in the grounds at a distance from the palace when they came at the turn of the walk upon the duc de chateaurouge and three other gentlemen of the court the former stopped abruptly before colonel hume  i had the honour colonel hume to speak to you some time since of a volunteer in your regiment who chose to call himself the name of leslie i understand he is now an officer i see by the lists in the courtyard that a cornet leslie is now on duty here where does he hide himself for i have been seeking in vain to meet him  cornet leslie is not one to balk any mans desire that way colonel hume said gravely this is cornet leslie  ronald stepped forward and looked the duke calmly in the face  so this is the young cockerel the duke said contemptuously a worthy son of a worthy father i doubt not  at any rate my lord duke ronald said quietly i do not rid myself of my foes by getting those i am afraid to meet as man to man thrown into prison nor by setting midnight assassins upon them nor do i rely upon my skill as a swordsman to be a bully and a coward  the duke started as if struck  i had made up my mind to kill you young sir he said sooner or later but you have brought it on yourself now draw sir and the duke drew his sword  colonel hume and several others threw themselves before ronald  put up your sword sir duelling is forbidden and you know the consequence of drawing within the precincts of the palace  what care i for ordinances the duke said furiously stand aside gentlemen lest i do you harm  harm or no harm colonel hume said sternly my young friend shall not fight in the palace grounds i protest against his being forced into a duel at all but at any rate he shall not fight here  the duke looked for a moment as if he was about to spring upon colonel hume but he saw by their faces that his companions also were against him for the consequences of drawing a sword within the precincts of a palace were so serious that even the most powerful nobles shrank from braving them  very well he said at last thrusting his sword back into its scabbard it is but ten minutes walk to the boundary wall i will let him live till then  so saying he started off with rapid strides down the walk followed at a slower pace by the rest    chapter xii the end of the quarrel   this is a serious business leslie the colonel said in a low voice if it had been anyone but you i should have ordered him to the barracks at once under pain of arrest and have laid the matter before the king for it would have been nothing short of murder but i can trust you to hold your own even against the duke of chateaurouge and in truth after what has been said i do not see that you can do other but meet him  i would not avoid it if i could ronald said his insults to me do not disturb me but i have my fathers wrongs to avenge  forbes the colonel said to one of the other officers do you go straight to the barracks bid leslies man saddle his own horse and his masters instantly and bring them round outside the wall of the park if leslie wounds or kills his man he will have to ride for it  the officer at once hurried away  ronald i will tell you a piece of news i heard this morning the young chevalier left paris secretly five days ago and i have received certain private information this morning that he has gone to nantes and that he is on the point of sailing for scotland on his own account i am told that this plan of his is known to but five or six persons if you get safely through this business mount and ride thither at all speed they are more likely to pursue you towards the frontier or the northern ports and will not think you have made for nantes if you get there before the prince has sailed present yourself to him and join his expedition the king will be furious at first both at the loss of his favourite and the breaking of the edicts but he must come round the gentlemen here with the duke are all honourable men and were i could see shocked at the insult which the duke passed on you therefore i can rely upon them to join me in representing the matter in its true light to the king before you return the matter will have blown over and it may be that the removal of your fathers most powerful enemy may facilitate an arrangement in any case my dear boy you can rely upon the marshal and myself to look after your interests  they had now reached a wicket gate in the wall of the park the duke was standing a few paces distant having already removed his coat and turned up the shirt sleeve of the sword arm  you will act as second marquis he said to one of the gentlemen  the latter bowed coldly  i act as second to my friend leslie colonel hume said and i call upon you all gentlemen to bear witness in the future that this encounter has been wantonly forced upon him by the duc de chateaurouge and that cornet leslie as a man of honour has no alternative whatever but to accept the challenge forced upon him  ronald had by this time stripped to his shirt sleeves the seconds took the two swords and compared their length they were found to be as nearly as possible the same they were then returned to their owners a piece of even turf was selected and a position chosen in which the light was equally favourable to both parties then both fell into position on guard and as the rapiers crossed colonel hume said solemnly  may god defend the right  an instant later they were engaged in deadly conflict it lasted but a few seconds the duke conscious of his own skill and believing that he had but a lad to deal with at once attacked eagerly desirous of bringing the contest to a termination before there was any chance of interruption he attacked then carelessly and eagerly and made a furious lunge which he thought would terminate the encounter at once but ronald did not give way an inch but parrying in carte slipped his blade round that of the duke feinted in tierce and then rapidly disengaging lunged in carte as before the blade passed through the body of his adversary and the lunge was given with such force that the pommel of his sword struck against the ribs the duke fell an inert mass upon the ground as ronald withdrew the rapier  an exclamation of surprise and alarm broke from the three gentlemen who had accompanied the duke while colonel hume said gravely  god has protected the right ah here come the horses mount and ride leslie and do not spare the spurs i should advise you he said drawing him aside to take the northern route for a few miles so as to throw them off the scent when you get to nantes search the inns till you find the duke of athole he is an intimate friend of mine and it was from him i learned in strict secrecy of the princes intentions show him this ring he knows it well and tell him i sent you to join him say nothing at first as to this business here your own name and my name will be enough he will introduce you to prince charlie who will be with him under a disguised name may god bless you my lad we will do our best for you here  at this moment malcolm arrived with the two horses  thank god you are safe ronald he exclaimed as ronald leapt into his saddle and with a word of thanks and adieu to the colonel dashed off at full speed  colonel hume then rejoined the group gathered round the duke the scottish officers were looking very grave the courtiers even more so they had from the first recognized fully that the duel had been provoked by the duke and had accompanied him reluctantly for they regarded the approaching conflict as so unfair that it would excite a strong amount of feeling against all who had a hand in the matter as to the edict against duelling it had not concerned them greatly as they felt sure that with the dukes influence the breach of the law would be passed over with only a show of displeasure on the part of the king and an order to absent themselves for a short time from court the contingency that this young scottish officer who had scarcely yet attained the age of manhood should kill one of the best swordsmen in france had not occurred to them but this had happened and there could be no doubt that the kings anger alike at the loss of his favourite and at the breach of the law would fall heavily on all concerned and that a prolonged exile from court was the least evil they could expect not a word had been spoken after they had on stooping over the duke found that death had been instantaneous until colonel hume joined them  well gentlemen he said this is a bad business and means trouble for us all his majesty will be vastly angry however the duke brought it upon himself and is the only person to blame his character is pretty well known and it will be manifest that if he had made up his mind to fight no remonstrance on your part would have availed to induce him to abstain from doing so at the same time the king will not in the first burst of his anger take that into consideration and for awhile we shall no doubt all of us suffer from his displeasure but i do not think that it will be lasting the duke forced on the duel and would have fought within the royal park had we not interfered and we were in a way forced to be present i propose that we return to the palace and give notice of what has occurred captain forbes as you were not present at the affair and will not therefore be called upon to give any account of it will you remain here until they send down to fetch the body  we will if you please gentlemen walk slowly for every mile that leslie can put between him and versailles is very important the news will reach the kings ears very shortly after we have made it public you and i marquis as the seconds in the affair are sure to be sent for first as fortunately we were both present at the quarrel we are both in a position to testify that the duke brought his fate upon himself that there was no preventing the duel and that had we refused to act he was in a frame of mind which would have driven him to fight without seconds if none had been forthcoming lastly we can testify that the combat was a fair one and that the duke fell in consequence of the rashness of his attack and his contempt for his adversary although in point of fact i can tell you that young leslie is so good a swordsman that i am confident the result would in any case have been the same  i suppose theres nothing else for it the marquis grumbled i must prepare myself for a prolonged visit to my country estates  and i shall no doubt be placed under arrest for some time colonel hume said and the regiment will probably be packed off to the frontier again however these things dont make much difference in the long run what i am most anxious about marquis is that his majesty should thoroughly comprehend that leslie was not to blame and that this affair was so forced upon him that it was impossible for him to avoid it there is much more than the lads own safety dependent on this  you may be sure colonel that i will do him justice  at a slow pace the party proceeded until they neared the palace when they quickened their steps the marquis proceeded immediately to the apartments occupied by the duke and told his domestics that their master had been killed in a duel and directed them to obtain assistance and proceed at once to the spot where his body would be found the colonel went to the kings surgeon and told him of what had taken place  his death was instantaneous he said the sword passed right through him and i believe touched the heart however it will be as well that you should go and see the body as the king will be sure to ask particulars as to the wound  the rest of the party joined their acquaintances and told them what had happened and the news spread quickiy through the palace it created a great sensation breaches of the edict were not unfrequent but the death of so powerful a noble a chief favourite too of the king took it altogether out of the ordinary category of such events the more so since the dukes reputation as a swordsman and a duellist was so great that men could scarce believe that he had been killed by a young officer who had but just joined the regiment it seemed like the story of david and goliath over again a quarter of an hour later a court official approached colonel hume and the marquis de vallecourt who were standing together surrounded by a number of courtiers and officers  monsieur le marquis and colonel hume he said saluting them i regret to say that i am the bearer of the orders of his majesty that you shall deliver me your swords and that you will then accompany me to the kings presence  the two gentlemen handed over their swords to the official and followed him to the kings presence louis was pacing angrily up and down his apartment  what is this i hear gentlemen he exclaimed as they entered a breach of the edicts here at versailles almost in the boundaries of the park and that the duc de chateaurouge one of my most valued officers and friends has been killed they tell me that you acted as seconds in the affair  they have told your majesty the truth the marquis said but i think that much as we regret what has happened we could scarcely have acted otherwise than we did the duke drew in the first place within the limits of the park and would have fought out his quarrel there had we not i may almost say forcibly intervened then he strode away towards the boundary of the park calling upon his antagonist to follow him and had we not gone the encounter would have taken place without seconds or witnesses and might then have been called a murder instead of a duel  you should have arrested him sir the king exclaimed for drawing in the park  perhaps we should have done so sire but you must please to remember that the duke of chateaurouge was of a temper not to be crossed and i believe that bloodshed would have taken place had we endeavoured to thwart him he enjoyed your majestys favour and a forcible arrest with perhaps the shedding of blood in the royal demesne would have been a scandal as grave as that of this duel  how did it come about the king asked abruptly  the duke was walking with de lisle st aignan and myself when we suddenly came upon colonel hume with three of the officers of his regiment the duke at once walked up to them and addressed colonel hume and finding which of his companions was monsieur leslie addressed him in terms of so insulting a nature that they showed that he had been waiting for the meeting to provoke a quarrel the young officer replied perfectly calmly but with what i must call admirable spirit and courage which so infuriated the duke that as i have already had the honour of telling your majesty he drew at once and when we interfered he called upon him to proceed forthwith outside the park and there settle the quarrel we most reluctantly accompanied him and determined to interfere at the first blood drawn but the affair scarcely lasted for a second the duke threw himself furiously and rashly upon the lad for as your majesty is aware he is but little more the latter standing firm parried with admirable coolness and in an instant ran the duke right through the body  but i have always heard the king said that the duke was one of the best swordsmen in the army  your majesty has heard correctly colonel hume replied but young leslie is one of the best swordsmen in france the dukes passion and rashness led to the speedy termination of the duel but had he fought with his accustomed coolness i believe that leslie would have turned out his conqueror  but what was the cause of the quarrel why should the duc de chateaurouge fix a dispute as you tell me he did upon this officer of yours  i believe sire that it was a long standing quarrel the dukes words showed that he bore an enmity against the lads father and that it was on this account that he insulted the son  leslie the king exclaimed with a sudden recollection is that the youth whom marshal saxe presented to me  the same sire the lad who distinguished himself at fontenoy and whom the marshal afterwards appointed to a commission in my regiment in which he had served as a gentleman volunteer for nearly a year  these leslies are always causing trouble the king said angrily i have already given orders that he shall be arrested wherever he is found and he shall be punished as he deserves  in punishing him colonel hume said with grave deference i am sure that your majesty will not forget that this quarrel was forced upon him and that had he accepted the insults of the duke of chateaurouge he would have been unworthy to remain an officer of your majesty  silence sir the king said angrily you will return immediately to paris under arrest until my pleasure in your case is notified to you i shall at once give orders that your troops here are replaced by those of a regiment whose officers will abstain from brawling and breaking the edicts in our very palace marquis you will retire at once to your estates the two gentlemen bowed and left the royal presence  not worse than i expected the marquis said after the door had closed behind them now he will send for st aignan and de lisle and will hear their account and as it cannot but tally with ours the king must see that the duke brought his fate upon himself louis is not unjust when his temper cools down and in a few weeks we shall meet again here  i expect to be on the frontier with my regiment before that colonel hume replied but as i would rather be there than in paris that will be no hardship  colonel hume at once mounted and rode back to paris and proceeded straight to the hotel of marshal saxe to whom he communicated what had occurred  if leslie gets safely away it will perhaps all turn out for the best the marshal said as soon as the kings anger dies out i will begin to plead the cause of the boys parents and now that the influence of chateaurouge the other way is withdrawn i may hope for a more favourable hearing as to the lad himself we will make his peace in a few months the king is brave himself as he showed when under fire at fontenoy and he admires bravery in others and when he has once got over the loss of chateaurouge he will appreciate the skill and courage which the lad showed in an encounter with one of the most noted duellists in france now too that the duke has gone some of the stories to his disadvantage of which there are so many current are likely to meet the kings ears hitherto no one has ventured to speak a word against so powerful a favourite but the kings eyes will soon be open now and he will become ashamed of so long having given his countenance to a man who is generally regarded as having not only killed halfadozen men in duels but as having procured the removal by unfair means of a score of others when he knows the truth the king is likely to do justice not only to young leslie but to his parents i only hope that they will not manage to overtake the lad before he reaches the frontier for although i can rely on the kings justice when he is cool i would not answer for it just at present  as ronald rode off at full speed with malcolm he related to him the whole circumstances of the quarrel and subsequent duel  it was well done ronald i made sure that sooner or later you and the duke would get to blows that is if he did not adopt other means to get you removed from his path anyhow i am heartily glad its over and that the most dangerous enemy of your father and yourself is out of the way and now we must hope that we shant be overtaken before we get to the frontier the danger is that orders for your arrest will be passed by signal  we are not going to the frontier malcolm i am only riding this way to throw them off the scent we are going to nantes  well thats not a bad plan malcolm said they are not so likely to send orders there as to the northern ports but it will not be easy to get a vessel to cross for you see now that we are at war with england there is little communication however we shall no doubt be able to arrange with a smuggler to take us across  we are not going to england malcolm we are going direct to scotland colonel hume has told me a secret prince charles has gone down to nantes and is going to cross at once to scotland  what alone and without an army malcolm exclaimed in astonishment  i suppose he despairs of getting assistance from louis now that fontenoy has put an end to danger on the frontier the king of france is no longer interested in raising trouble for george at home  but it is a mad scheme of the princes malcolm said gravely if his father did not succeed in 15 how can he expect to succeed now  the country has had all the longer time to get sick of the hanoverians and the gallantry of the enterprise will appeal to the people besides malcolm i am not so sure that he will not do better coming alone than if he brought the fifteen thousand men he had at dunkirk last year with him fifteen thousand men would not win him a kingdom and many who would join him if he came alone would not do so if he came backed by an army of foreigners it was the french you will remember who ruined his grandfathers cause in ireland their arrogance and interference disgusted the irish and their troops never did any fighting to speak of for myself i would a thousand times rather follow prince charles fighting with an army of scotsmen for the crown of scotland than fight for him with a french army against englishmen  well perhaps you are right ronald it went against the grain at fontenoy for after all as you said we are closely akin in blood and language to the english and although scotland and france have always been allies it is very little good france has ever done us she has always been glad enough to get our kings to make war on england whenever she wanted a diversion made but she has never put herself out of the way to return the favour it has been a one sided alliance all along scotland has for centuries been sending some of her best blood to fight as soldiers in france but with a few exceptions no frenchman has ever drawn his sword for scotland  no i am inclined to think you are right ronald and especially after what we saw at fontenoy i have no wish ever to draw sword again against the english and am willing to be the best friends in the world with them if they will but let us scots have our own king and go away peacefully i dont want to force prince charles upon them if they will but let us have him for ourselves if they wont you know it is they who are responsible for the quarrel not us  that is one way of putting it certainly ronald laughed i am afraid after having been one kingdom since king james went to london they wont let us go our own way without making an effort to keep us but here is a crossroad we will strike off here and make for the west  they avoided the towns on their routes for although they felt certain that they were ahead of any messengers who might be sent out with orders for their arrest they knew that they might be detained for some little time at nantes and were therefore anxious to leave no clue of their passage in that direction on the evening of the third day after starting they approached their destination  on the first morning after leaving versailles they had halted in wood a short distance from chartres and malcolm had ridden in alone and had purchased a suit of citizens clothes for ronald as the latters uniform as an officer of the scotch dragoons would at once have attracted notice henceforward whenever they stopped malcolm had taken an opportunity to mention to the stable boy that he was accompanying his master the son of an advocate of paris on a visit to some relatives in la vendee this story he repeated at the inn where they put up at nantes  the next morning malcolm went round to all the inns in the town but could hear nothing of the duke of athole so he returned at noon with the news of his want of success  they may have hired a private lodging to avoid observation ronald said or not improbably may have taken another name the best thing we can do is to go down to the river side inquire what vessels are likely to leave port soon and then if we see anyone going off to them to accost them we may hear of them in that way  accordingly they made their way down to the river there were several vessels lying in the stream in readiness to sail when the wind served and the mouth of the river was reported to be clear of any english cruisers they made inquiries as to the destination of the vessels all the large ones were sailing for bordeaux or the mediterranean ports of france  what is that little vessel lying apart from the rest malcolm asked she looks a saucy little craft  that is the privateer la doutelle one of the fastest little vessels on the coast she has brought in more than one english merchantman as a prize  as they were speaking a boat was seen to leave her side and make for the shore with a glance at malcolm to break off his conversation with the sailor and follow him ronald strode along the bank towards the spot where the boat would land two gentlemen got out and advanced along the quay as they passed ronald said to malcolm  i know one of those mens faces  do you ronald i cannot recall having seen them  ronald stood for a moment in thought  i know now he exclaimed and he is one of our men sure enough  i think sir he said as he came up to them that i have had the honour of meeting you before  a look of displeasure came across the gentlemans face  i think you are mistaken sir he said coldly you must take me for some one else my name is verbois  monsieur verbois of le mans  i have not the pleasure of knowing monsieur verbois ronald said with a slight smile but i hardly think sir that that is the name that you went by when i had the honour of meeting you in glasgow more than two years ago  in glasgow the gentleman said looking earnestly at ronald in glasgow i do not remember you  i had the pleasure of doing you some slight service nevertheless ronald said quietly when i brought you news that your enemies were upon you and managed to detain them while you made your escape through the attic window  a thousand pardons the gentleman exclaimed speaking in english how could i have forgotten you but i saw you for such a short time and two years have changed you greatly this is the young gentleman marquis to whom i am indebted for my escape when i was so nearly captured at glasgow as you have heard me say it was to his kindly warning in the first place and to his courage in the second that i owed my liberty it is wonderful that you should remember me  two years have not changed you as much as they have changed me ronald said besides you were busy in destroying papers while i had nothing to do but to watch you  that is so the gentleman agreed at any rate i am heartily glad of the happy chance which has thrown us together and has given me an opportunity of expressing to you the deep gratitude which i have felt for your warning and assistance had it not been for that not only should i myself have been taken but they would have got possession of those papers which might have brought the heads of a score of the best blood of scotland to the scaffold i took a boat that was lying in readiness and making down the river got on board a ship which was cruising there awaiting me and got off it has always been a matter of bitter regret to me that i never learned so much as the name of the brave young gentleman to whom i owed so much or what had happened to him for his share in that nights work  my name is ronald leslie sir i am the son of leslie of glenlyon who fought with the chevalier in 15 and afterwards entered the service of the king of france and was colonel of the 2nd scorch dragoons  of course i knew him well the gentleman said and with others endeavoured to obtain his pardon when he fell under the kings displeasure some fifteen years ago although i regret to say without success believe me if prince charles  he stopped suddenly as his companion touched him  you would say sir ronald said with a smile if prince charles succeeds in his present enterprise and regains his throne you will get him to exert his influence to obtain my fathers release  the two gentlemen gave an exclamation of astonishment  how do you know of any enterprise that is meditated  i was told of it as a secret by a scotch officer in paris and am the bearer of a message from him to the duke of athole to ask him to allow me to join the prince  i am the duke the other gentleman said  since it is you sir i may tell you that the officer i spoke of is colonel hume and that he bade me show you this ring which he said you would know as a token that my story was a correct one  hume is my greatest friend the duke exclaimed and his introduction would be sufficient even if you had not already proved your devotion to the cause of the stuarts i will take you at once to the prince but he said before i do so i must tell you that the enterprise upon which we are about to embark is a desperate one the prince has but five companions with him and we embark on board that little privateer lying in the stream it is true that we shall be escorted by a man of war which will convey the arms which prince charles has purchased for the enterprise but not a man goes with us and the prince is about to trust wholly to the loyalty of scotland  i shall be ready to accompany him in any case sir ronald said and i beg to introduce to you a faithful friend of my father and myself his name is malcolm anderson he fought for the chevalier in 15 and accompanied my father in his flight to france and served under him in the french service upon the occasion of my fathers arrest he carried me to scotland and has been my faithful friend ever since  so saying he called malcolm up and presented him to the duke and the party then proceeded to the lodging where prince charles was staying  i have the misfortune to be still ignorant of your name sir ronald said to his acquaintance of glasgow  what the gentleman said in surprise you do not know my name after doing so much for me i thought as a matter of course that when you were captured for aiding my escape you would have heard it hence my remissness in not introducing myself i am colonel macdonald when you met me i was engaged in a tour through the highland clans sounding the chiefs and obtaining additions to the seven who had signed a declaration in favour of the prince three years before the english government had obtained through one of their spies about the person of the chevalier news of my mission and had set a vigilant watch for me  but is it possible that there can be spies among those near the chevalier ronald exclaimed in astonishment  aye there are spies everywhere macdonald said bitterly all sorts of people come and go round the chevalier and round prince charles every scotch or irish vagabond who has made his native country too hot to hold him come to them and pretend that they are martyrs to their loyalty to the stuarts and the worst of it is their story is believed they flatter and fawn they say just what they are wanted to say and have no opinion of their own and the consequence is that the chevalier looks upon these fellows as his friends and often turns his back upon scottish gentlemen who have risked and lost all in his service but who are too honest to flatter him or to descend to the arts of courtiers look at the men who are here with the prince now  macdonald macdonald the duke said warmly  well well the other broke off impatiently no doubt it is better to hold ones tongue but it is monstrous that when there are a score ay a hundred of scottish gentlemen of family many of them officers with a high knowledge of war who would gladly have accompanied him at the first whisper of his intentions the prince should be starting on such a venture as this with yourself only duke as a representative of the scottish nobles and chiefs and six or eight mongrels  irish english and scotch  the sort of men who haunt the pot houses of flanders and spend their time in telling what they have suffered in the stuart cause to any who will pay for their liquor  not quite so bad as that macdonald the duke said still i admit that i could have wished that prince charles should have landed in scotland surrounded by men with names known and honoured there rather than by those he has selected to accompany him  but you are going are you not sir ronald asked colonel macdonald  no i do not accompany the prince but i hope to follow shortly as soon as the prince has sailed it is my mission to see all his friends and followers in france and urge them to join him in scotland while we bring all the influence we have to bear upon louis to induce him to furnish arms and assistance for the expedition    chapter xiii prince charles   upon arriving at the princes lodgings macdonald remained without the duke of athole entering accompanied only by ronald  the prince is in disguise he said and but one or two of us visit him here in order that no suspicion may be incited among the people of the house that he is anything beyond what he appears to be  a young student of the scotch college at paris  they ascended the stairs to the upper story and on the marquis knocking a door was opened the duke entered followed by ronald  well duke what is the news  the question was asked by a young man who was pacing restlessly up and down the room of which he was with the exception of his valet de chambre an italian named michel the person who had opened the door the only occupant  ah whom have you here  allow me to present to your royal highness lieutenant leslie he is the son of leslie of glenlyon who fought by my side in your fathers cause in 15 and has like myself been an exile ever since this is the young gentleman who two years since saved macdonald from arrest in glasgow  ah i remember the adventure the prince said courteously and right gallant action it was but how did you hear that i was here sir  i was told by my good friend and commanding officer colonel hume of the 2nd scottish dragoons your royal highness  i revealed it to hume before leaving paris the duke said he being a great friend of mine and as staunch as steel and i knew that he could be trusted to keep a secret  it seems that in the last particular you were wrong the prince remarked with a slight smile  colonel hume only revealed it to me sir ronald said anxious to save his friend from the suspicion of having betrayed a secret confided to him for very special reasons i had the misfortune to kill in a duel the duke of chateaurouge and as we fought just outside the park of versailles and the duke was a favourite of the kings i had to ride for it then colonel hume knowing my devotion to the cause of your highness whispered to me the secret of your intention and gave me a message to his friend the duke of athole  do you say that you have killed the duke of chateaurouge in a duel the duke exclaimed in astonishment why he has the reputation of being one of the best swordsmen in france and has a most evil name as a dangerous and unscrupulous man i met him constantly at court and his arrogance and haughtiness were well nigh insufferable and you have killed him  i knew him well too the prince said and his reputation we do not doubt what you say young gentleman he added quickiy seeing a flush mount into ronalds face but in truth it seems strange that such should have been the case  colonel hume did me the honour to be my second ronald said quietly and the marquis de vallecourt was second to the duke some other officers of the scottish regiment were present as were two other french noblemen de lisle and st aignan  we doubt you not sir the duke said warmly you will understand that it cannot but seem strange that you at your age  for it seems to me that you cannot be more than nineteen  should have been able to stand for a moment against one of the best swordsmen in france to say nothing of having slain him  colonel hume would scarcely have consented to act as my second had he thought that the contest was a wholly unequal one ronald said with a slight smile indeed i may say that he regarded it as almost certain that i should have the best of the fray  why you must be a very paladin the prince said admiringly but sit down and tell us all about it upon my word i am so sick of being cooped up for four days in this wretched den that i regard your coming as a godsend now tell me how it was that the duc de chateaurouge condescended to quarrel with a young officer in the scottish horse  it was a family quarrel sir which i had inherited from my father  yes yes i remember now the duke of athole broke in it is an old story now but i heard all about it at the time and did what i could as did all leslies friends to set the matter right but in vain leslie of glenlyon prince was colonel of the scottish dragoons and as gallant and dashing a soldier as ever was in the service of the king of france and as good looking a one too and the result was the daughter of the marquis de recambours one of the richest heiresses in france whom her father and the king destined as the bride of this duke of chateaurouge who was then quite a young man fell in love with leslie and a secret marriage took place between them for three years no one suspected it but the young ladys obstinacy in refusing to obey her fathers orders caused her to be shut up in a convent somehow the truth came out leslie was arrested and thrown into the bastille and he has never been heard of since what became of the child which was said to have been born no one ever heard but it was generally supposed that it had been put out of the way we in vain endeavoured to soften the kings anger against leslie but the influence of recambours and chateaurouge was too great for us hume told me some time since that leslies son had been carried off to scotland by one of his troopers and had returned and was riding as a gentleman volunteer in his regiment but we have had no further talk on the subject  you will be glad to hear sir ronald said that my father and mother have within the last few weeks been released and are now living on a small estate of my mothers in the south they were ordered to retire there by the king  i am glad indeed the duke said cordially and how is your father  he is sadly crippled by rheumatism and can scarce walk ronald said and i fear that his health is altogether shaken with what he had to go through  how did you obtain their release leslie the prince asked  marshal saxe obtained it for me ronald answered colonel hume first introduced me to him and as he too had known my father he promised that should he obtain a victory he would ask as a boon from the king the release of my father and he did so after fontenoy where the marquis de recambours was killed and the king thereby freed from his influence the duke of chateaurouge whose hostility against my father had always been bitter was doubtless greatly irritated at his release and took the first opportunity on meeting me of grossly insulting me on my replying in terms in accordance with the insult he drew and would have fought me in the palace grounds had not colonel hume and his friends interfered then we adjourned outside the park the duke doubtless thought that he would kill me without difficulty and so rushed in so carelessly that at the very first thrust i ran him through  and served him right the prince said heartily now since both your fathers enemies are gone it may be hoped that his troubles are over and that your mother will recover the estates to which she is entitled and now duke what is your news when are we going to sail  the doutelle is already by this time on her way down the river and it is proposed that we shall start this evening and board her there the stores and arms are all safely on board the elizabeth and she is lying off belleisle so far as mr walsh has heard no suspicion has been excited as to their purpose or destination so that we may hope in twentyfour hours to be fairly on board  that is the best news i have heard for months the prince said thank goodness the time for action is at last at hand  i have i trust your royal highness permission to accompany you ronald said together with my follower anderson he is the trooper who carried me over to scotland as a child and has been my faithful friend ever since  certainly leslie i shall be glad indeed to have a member of a family who have proved so faithful to my fathers cause with me in the adventure upon which i am embarking  ronald with a few words of thanks bowed and took his leave after receiving instructions from the duke to start shortly and to ride down the river towards lorient  you can halt for a few hours on the road and then ride on again we shall overtake you before you reach the port we shall all leave singly or in pairs to avoid attracting any attention  ronald left delighted with the kindness of the princes manner prince charles was indeed possessed of all the attributes which win mens hearts and devotion in figure he was tall and well formed and endowed both with strength and activity he excelled in all manly exercises and was an excellent walker having applied himself ardently to field sports during his residence in italy  he was strikingly handsome his face was of a perfect oval his features high and noble his complexion was fair his eyes light blue and contrary to the custom of the time when wigs were almost universally worn he allowed his hair to fall in long ringlets on his neck his manner was graceful and although he always bore himself with a sort of royal dignity he had the peculiar talent of pleasing and attracting all with whom he came in contact and had the art of adapting his conversation to the taste or station of those whom he addressed  his education had been intrusted to sir thomas sheridan an irish roman catholic who had grossly neglected his duties and who indeed has been more than suspected of acting as an agent in the pay of the british government the weakness in the princes character was that he was a bad judge of men and inclined on all occasions to take the advice of designing knaves who flattered and paid deference to him rather than that of the scottish nobles who were risking their lives for his cause but who at times gave their advice with a bluntness and warmth which were displeasing to him it was this weakness which brought an enterprise which at one time had the fairest prospect of success to destruction and ruin  on leaving the house ronald was joined by malcolm and half an hour later they mounted their horses and rode for the mouth of the loire the whole party arrived on the following day at st nazaire embarking separately on board the doutelle where prince charles who had come down from nantes in a fishing boat was received by mr walsh the owner of the vessel ronald now saw gathered together the various persons who were to accompany prince charles on this adventurous expedition these were sheridan the former tutor of the prince kelly a nonjuring clergyman and sullivan  both like sheridan irishmen strickland a personage so unimportant that while some writers call him an englishman others assert that he was irish aeneas macdonald a scotchman sir john macdonald an officer in the spanish service the princes valet michel and the duke of athole or as he is more generally called the marquis of tullibardine the last named being the only man of high standing or reputation never did a prince start to fight for a kingdom with such a following  the doutelle weighed anchor as soon as the last of the party arrived on deck and under easy sail proceeded to belleisle here she lay for some days awaiting the arrival of the elizabeth mr rutledge a merchant at nantes had obtained an order from the french court that this man of war should proceed to cruise on the coast of scotland and had then arranged with the captain of the ship to take on board the arms that had been purchased by the prince with the proceeds of the sale of some of the family jewels  these consisted of fifteen hundred muskets eighteen hundred broadswords twenty small field pieces and some ammunition the captain had also agreed that the doutelle which only mounted eighteen small guns should sail in company with the elizabeth to scotland as soon as the elizabeth was seen the doutelle spread her sails and keeping a short distance from each other the two vessels sailed north so great was the necessity for prudence that the prince still maintained his disguise as a scottish student and with the exception of mr walsh none of the officers and crew of the doutelle were acquainted with his real rank and the various members of his party treated him and each other as strangers  four days after leaving belleisle a british man of war of fiftyeight guns hove in sight and crowding on all sail rapidly came up the elizabeth at once prepared to engage her signalling to the doutelle to do the same the prince urged mr walsh to aid the elizabeth but the latter steadily refused  he had undertaken he said to carry the prince to scotland and would do nothing to endanger the success of the enterprise the two vessels were well matched and he would not allow the doutelle to engage in the affair the prince continued to urge the point until at last mr walsh said that unless he abstained from interference he should be forced to order him below  the doutelle therefore stood aloof from the engagement which lasted for five or six hours and sailed quietly on her course in order to be beyond the risk of capture should the english ship prove victorious neither of the vessels however obtained any decided advantage both were so crippled in the encounter that the elizabeth returned to france the lion to plymouth to refit thus the small supply of arms and artillery which the prince had with such great trouble got together was lost  well ronald malcolm said that evening as they leant over the taffrail together i do think that such a mad headed expedition as this was never undertaken an exiled prince an outlawed duke six adventurers a valet and our two selves one could laugh if one was not almost ready to cry at the folly of invading a country like england in such a fashion  that is only one way of looking at it malcolm we are not an army of invasion the prince is simply travelling with a few personal followers to put himself at the head of an army the affair depends not upon us but upon the country if the clans turn out to support him as they did in 15 he will soon be at the head of some twenty thousand men not enough i grant you to conquer england but enough for a nucleus round which the lowland and english jacobites can gather  yes it depends upon the ifs ronald if all the highland clans join and if there are sufficient jacobites in the lowlands and england to make a large army we may do i have some hopes of the clans but after what we saw of the apathy of the english jacobites in 15 i have no shadow of faith in them however i fought for the chevalier in 15 and i am ready to fight for prince charles now as long as there is any fighting to be done and when that is over i shall be as ready to make for france as i was before  ronald laughed  you are certainly not enthusiastic about it malcolm  when one gets to my age ronald common sense takes the place of enthusiasm and i have seen enough of wars to know that for business a well appointed and well disciplined army is required if prince charles does get what you call an army but which i should call an armed mob together there will be the same dissensions the same bickerings the same want of plan that there was before and unless something like a miracle happens it will end as the last did at preston in defeat and ruin however lad here we are and we will go through with it to the end by the time we get back to france we must hope that king louis will have got over the killing of his favourite however i tell you frankly that my hope is that when the highland chiefs see that the prince has come without arms without men and without even promises of support by france they will refuse to risk liberty and life and to bring ruin upon their people by joining in such a mad brained adventure  i hope not malcolm ronald said as he looked at the prince as he was pacing up and down the deck with the duke of athole talking rapidly his face flushed with enthusiasm his clustering hair blown backward by the wind he is a noble young prince he is fighting for his own he has justice and right on his side and god grant that he may succeed  amen to that ronald with all my heart but so far as my experience goes strength and discipline and generalship and resources go a great deal further than right in deciding the issue of a war  two days later another english man of war came in sight and gave chase to the doutelle but the latter was a fast sailer and soon left her pursuer behind and without further adventure arrived among the western isles and dropped anchor near the little islet of erisca between barra and south uist as they approached the island an eagle sailed out from the rocky shore and hovered over the vessel and the duke of athole pointed it out as a favourable augury to the prince  charles and his companions landed at erisca and passed the night on shore they found on inquiry that this cluster of islands belonged to macdonald of clanranald a young chief who was known to be attached to the jacobite cause he was at present absent on the mainland but his uncle and principal adviser macdonald of boisdale was in south uist the prince sent off one of his followers in a boat to summon him and he came aboard the doutelle the next morning but when he heard from the prince that he had come alone and unattended he refused to have anything to do with the enterprise which he asserted was rash to the point of insanity and would bring ruin and destruction on all who took part in it  the prince employed all his efforts to persuade the old chief but in vain and the latter returned to his isle in a boat while the doutelle pursued her voyage to the mainland and entered the bay of lochnanuagh in inverness shire and immediately sent a messenger to clanranald who came on board shortly with macdonald of kinloch moidart and several other macdonalds  they received the prince with the greatest respect but like macdonald of boisdale the two chiefs refused to take up arms in an enterprise which they believed to be absolutely hopeless in vain prince charles argued and implored the two chiefs remained firm until the prince suddenly turned to a younger brother of moidart who stood listening to the conversation and with his fingers clutching the hilt of his broadsword as he heard the young prince whom he regarded as his future king in vain imploring the assistance of his brother and kinsmen  will you at least not assist me the prince exclaimed  i will i will ranald macdonald exclaimed though no other man in the highlands shall draw a sword i am ready to die for you  the enthusiasm of the young man was catching and throwing to the winds their own convictions and forebodings the two macdonalds declared that they also would join and use every exertion to engage their countrymen the clansmen who had come on board the ship without knowing the object of the visit were now told who the prince was and they expressed their readiness to follow to the death two or three days later on the 25th of july prince charles landed and was conducted to borodale a farmhouse belonging to clanranald  charles at once sent off letters to the highland chiefs whom he knew to be favourable to the stuart cause among these the principal were cameron of locheil sir alexander macdonald and macleod locheil immediately obeyed the summons but being convinced of the madness of the enterprise he came not to join the prince but to dissuade him from embarking in it on his way he called upon his brother cameron of fassefern who agreed with his opinion as to the hopelessness of success and urged him to write to the prince instead of going to see him  i know you better than you know yourself he said if the prince once sets eyes upon you he will make you do whatever he pleases  locheil however persisted in going convinced that the prince would on his representation abandon the design for a long time he stood firm until the prince exclaimed  i am resolved to put all to the hazard in a few days i will erect the royal standard and proclaim to the people of britain that charles stuart is come over to claim the crown of his ancestors or perish in the attempt locheil who my father has often told me was our firmest friend may stay at home and learn from the newspapers the fate of his prince  locheils resolution melted at once at these words and he said  not so i will share the fate of my prince whatsoever it be and so shall every man over whom nature or fortune hath given me power  the conversion of locheil was the turning point of the enterprise upon the news of the princes landing spreading most of the other chiefs had agreed that if locheil stood aloof they would not move and had he remained firm not a man would have joined the princes standard and he would have been forced to abandon the enterprise sir alexander macdonald and macleod instead of going to see the prince had gone off together on the receipt of his letter to the isle of skye so as to avoid an interview clanranald was despatched by prince charles to see them but they declined to join urging with the truth that the promises which they had given to join in a rising were contingent upon the prince arriving at the head of a strong french force with arms and supplies they therefore refused at present to move others however were not so cautious fired by the example of locheil and by their own traditions of loyalty to the stuarts cause many of the lesser chiefs at once summoned their followers to the field with the majority the absence of french troops had the exactly opposite effect that it had had with sir alexander macdonald and macleod had the prince landed with a french army they might have stood aloof and suffered him to fight out his quarrel unaided but his arrival alone and unattended trusting solely and wholly to the loyalty of the scottish people made an irresistible appeal to their generous feelings and although there were probably but few who did not foresee that failure ruin and death would be the result of the enterprise they embarked in the cause with as much ardour as if their success had been certain  from borodale after disembarking the scanty treasure of four thousand louis dor which he had brought with him and a few stands of arms from the doutelle charles proceeded by water to kinloch moidart  mr walsh sailed in the doutelle after receiving the princes warmest thanks and a letter to his father in rome begging him to grant mr walsh an irish earldom as a reward for the services he had rendered a recommendation which was complied with  the chiefs soon began to assemble at moidart and the house became the centre of a picturesque gathering  ronald had now put aside the remembrance of malcolms forebodings and entered heart and soul into the enterprise he had in glasgow frequently seen highlanders in their native dress but he had not before witnessed any large gathering and he was delighted with the aspect of the sturdy mountaineers in their picturesque garb  the prince had at once laid aside the attire in which he had landed and had assumed highland costume and by the charm and geniality of his manner he completely won the hearts of all who came in contact with him among those who joined him at moidart was murray of broughton a man who was destined to exercise as destructive an influence on the princes fortune as had mr forster over that of his father murray had hurried from his seat in the south having first had a large number of manifestoes for future distribution printed he was at once appointed by charles his secretary of state  while the gathering at moidart was daily growing the english remained in ignorance of the storm which was preparing it was not until the 30th of july that the fact that the prince had sailed from nantes was known in london and as late as the 8th of august nearly three weeks after charles first appeared on the coast the fact of his landing was unknown to the authorities in edinburgh  on the 16th of august the english governor at fort augustus alarmed at the vague reports which reached him and the sudden news that bodies of armed highlanders were hurrying west sent a detachment of two companies under captain scott to reinforce the advance post of fort william  after marching twenty miles the troops entered the narrow ravine of spean bridge when they were suddenly attacked by a party of keppochs clansmen who were on their way to join the prince when they saw the english troops on their march they were joined by some of locheils clansmen and so heavy a fire was kept up from the heights that the english after having five or six men killed and many more wounded among them their commanding officer were forced to lay down their arms  they were treated with great humanity by their captors and the wounded were well cared for the news of this success reached the prince on the day before that fixed for the raising of his standard the 19th of august and added to the enthusiasm which prevailed among the little force gathered in glenfinnan where the ceremony took place the glen lay about halfway between borodale and fort william both being about fifteen miles distant the gathering consisted principally of the camerons of locheil some six hundred strong and they brought with them two english companies captured on the 16th disarmed and prisoners  the duke of athole performed the ceremony of unfurling the banner he was the heir to the dukedom of athole but had been exiled for taking part in the rising of 15 and the dukedom bestowed by the english government upon his brother thus among the english he was still spoken of as the marquis of tullibardine while at the french court and among the followers of the stuarts he was regarded as the rightful duke of athole  the unfurling of the standard was greeted with loud shouts and the clansmen threw their bonnets high in the air the duke then read the manifesto of the chevalier and the commission of regency granted by him to prince charles after this the prince himself made an inspiring speech and declared that at the head of his faithful highlanders he was resolved to conquer or to perish  among the spectators of the ceremony was captain swetenham an english officer taken prisoner a few days before while on his way to assume the command of fort william he had been treated with great courtesy and kindness by the prince who after the ceremony dismissed him with the words you may now return to your general tell him what you have seen and add that i am about to give him battle  soon after the conclusion of the ceremony keppoch marched in with three hundred of his clan and some smaller parties also arrived the next morning the force marched to locheils house at auchnacarrie where the prince was joined by the macdonalds of glencoe a hundred and fifty strong two hundred stuarts of appin under their chief and by the younger glengarry with two hundred more so that the force had now swelled to sixteen hundred men  we begin to look like an army ronald said to malcolm  well yes the latter replied drily we are rather stronger than one regiment and not quite so strong as two still if things go on like this we shall ere very long have mounted up to the strength of a brigade but even a brigade ronald does nor go very far towards the conquest of a kingdom especially when only about one man in three has got a musket and so far there are neither cavalry nor artillery still you know these things may come  ronald laughed gaily at his companions want of faith he himself had now caught the enthusiasm which pervaded all around it was true that as yet the princes adherents were but a handful but it was not to be expected that an army would spring from the ground promises of assistance had come from all quarters and if the army was a small one the english army in scotland was but little larger and if a first success could be achieved all scotland might be expected to rise and the news would surely influence the jacobites of england to declare for the prince  sir john cope the english officer commanding the english forces in scotland at the first rumour of troubles had ordered his troops to assemble at stirling he had with him two regiments of dragoons gardiners and hamiltons both young regiments and the whole force at his disposal exclusive of troops in garrison did not exceed three thousand men with these he proposed to march at once to the west and crush the rebellion before it gained strength the english government approved of his proposal and sent him a proclamation offering a reward of thirty thousand pounds to any person who should seize and secure the pretended prince of wales  on the day of the raising of the standard cope set out from edinburgh for stirling and the next day commenced his march at the head of fifteen hundred infantry leaving the dragoons behind him as these could be of but little service among the mountains where they would have found it next to impossible to obtain forage for their horses he took with him a large quantity of baggage a drove of black cattle for food and a thousand stand of arms to distribute among the volunteers who he expected would join him as however none of these came in he sent back seven hundred muskets to crieff  the first object of the march was fort augustus which he intended to make his central post as he advanced he was met by captain swetenham who informed him of the raising of the standard and the gathering he had witnessed as however only locheils clansmen had arrived before swetenham left cope considered his force ample for the purpose and continued his march in order to reach fort augustus however he had to pass over corry arrack a lofty and precipitous mountain which was ascended by a military road with fifteen zigzags known to the country as the devils staircase  prince charles who had received early news of the advance from stirling had recognized the importance of the position and having burned and destroyed all baggage that would impede his progress made a forced march and reached corry arrack on the 27th before sir john cope had commenced his ascent as sir john saw that the formidable position was in the hands of the enemy he felt that it would be in vain to endeavour to force it each zigzag would have to be carried in turn and the enterprise would be a desperate one success would be of no great advantage as the highlanders lightly clad and active would make off and defy pursuit defeat would be disastrous he therefore called a council of war and asked his officers to decide whether it would be best to remain at dalwhinnie at the foot of the mountain to return to sterling or to march to inverness where they would be joined by the well affected clans he himself strongly urged the last course believing that the prince would not venture to descend into the lowlands while he remained in his rear the council of war adopted his opinion no officer advocated remaining inactive at dalwhinnie one only supported the alternative of the retreat to stirling the rest agreed upon an advance to inverness  when it was found that copes army had moved away without fighting the exultation of the highlanders was great most of the chiefs wished to follow at once and give battle urging that it would be hazardous to advance south and leave the enemy to cut off their retreat but the prince himself saw the supreme importance of a descent into the lowlands and that plan of action was decided upon    chapter xiv prestonpans   advancing in high spirits through the mountains of badenoch prince charles with his army came down into the vale of athole and visited with tullibardine the castle of blair athole the noble property of which the marquis had so long been deprived owing to his constancy to the cause of the stuarts but which would again be his own were this great enterprise successful  from blair athole the little army moved on to perth here they were joined by powerful friends of whom the principal were the young duke of perth lord nairn and lord george murray the younger brother of the marquis of tullibardine lord george murray was but ten years of age when the events of 1715 had taken place but four years later he came over with the marquis with a handful of spaniards and was wounded at the battle of glenshiels the influence of the family obtained his pardon on the plea of his extreme youth but he remained at heart a jacobite and going to the continent entered the service of sardinia then a portion of the possessions of the duke of savoy for many years he served abroad and acquired a considerable reputation as an excellent officer and a most gallant soldier  he had indeed a natural genius for military operations and had he not been thwarted at every turn by the jealousy of murray of broughton it is by no means improbable that he would have brought the enterprise to a successful termination and seated the stuarts upon the throne of england the accession of such an officer was of the highest value to the prince  hitherto the army had consisted merely of wild clansmen full of valour and devotion but wholly undisciplined while among those who accompanied him or who had joined him in scotland there was not a single officer of any experience in war or any military capacity whatever lord george murray and the duke of perth were at once named generals in the princes army but the command in reality remained entirely in the hands of murray for lord perth though an estimable young nobleman possessed of considerable ability had no military experience and was of a quiet and retiring disposition  lord george murray at once set about raising the tenantry of his brother the hanoverian duke of athole who was absent in england and as these had always remained attached to the stuart cause and still regarded the marquis of tullibardine as their rightful head they willingly took up arms upon lord george murrays bidding lord george decided at once that it would be useless to attempt to drill the highlanders into regular soldiers but that they must be allowed to use their national style of fighting and trust to their desperate charge with broadsword and target to break the enemys ranks  unfortunately dissensions commenced among the leaders from the very first secretary murray who desired to be all powerful with the prince saw that he should not succeed in gaining any influence over so firm and energetic a character as lord george murray while it would be easy for him to sway the young duke of perth and he was not long in poisoning the ear of the latter against his companion in arms by representing to him that lord george treated him as a mere cipher although of equal rank in the army the secretarys purpose was even more easily carried out with prince charles the latter was no judge of character and fell readily under the influence of the wily and unscrupulous murray who flattered his weaknesses and assumed an air of deference to his opinions lord george murray on the other hand was but too prone to give offence he was haughty and overbearing in manner expressed his opinions with a directness and bluntness which were very displeasing to the prince and conscious of his own military genius and experience put aside with open contempt the suggestions of those who were in truth ignorant of military matters loyal straightforward and upright he scorned to descend to the arts of the courtier and while devoting his whole time to his military work suffered his enemies to obtain the entire command of the ear of the prince  ronald was introduced to him as soon as he joined at perth and finding that young leslie had had some military experience lord george at once appointed him one of his aides de camp and soon took a warm liking to the active and energetic young officer whose whole soul was in his work and who cared nothing for the courtly gatherings around the person of the prince  malcolm rode as ronalds orderly and during the few days of their stay in perth ronald was at work from morning till night riding through the country with messages from lord george and in the intervals of such duty in trying to inculcate some idea of discipline into the wild highland levies at this time charles was using all his efforts to persuade lord lovat one of the most powerful of the northern noblemen to join him offering him his patent as duke of fraser and the lord lieutenancy of the northern counties  lovat however an utterly unscrupulous man refused openly to join although he sent repeatedly assurances of his devotion throughout the struggle he continued to act a double part trying to keep friends with both parties but declaring for the prince at the moment when his fortunes were at their highest the result was that while he afforded the prince but little real assistance his conduct cost him his head  sir john cope finding that his march to inverness had failed to draw the prince after him and had left the lowlands and the capital open to the insurgents directed his march to aberdeen and sent to edinburgh for transports to bring down his army to cover that city but prince charles determined to forestall him and on the 11th of september commenced his march south the age and infirmities of the marquis of tullibardine prevented his accompanying prince charles during active operations  it was impossible for the army to march direct against edinburgh as the magistrates of that town had taken the precaution to withdraw every ship and boat from the northern side of the forth and the prince was consequently obliged to make a detour and to cross the river at the fords eight miles above stirling and then marching rapidly towards edinburgh arrived on the evening of the 16th within three miles of that town  so long as the coming of the prince was doubtful the citizens of edinburgh had declared their willingness to defend the town to the last volunteer regiments had been formed and guns placed on the walls but when the volunteers were ordered to march out with hamiltons regiment of dragoons to oppose the advance of the insurgents the men quitted their ranks and stole away to their houses leaving the dragoons to march out alone the latter however showed no greater courage than that of their citizen allies when on the following day they came in contact with a party of mounted gentlemen from the princes army who fired their pistols at their pickets these rode off in haste their panic was communicated to the main body whose officers in vain endeavoured to check them and the whole regiment galloped away in wild confusion and passing close under the walls of edinburgh continued their flight without halting to preston there they halted for the night but one of the troopers happening in the dark to fall into a disused well his shouts for assistance caused an alarm that they were attacked and mounting their horses the regiment continued their flight to dunbar where they joined general copes army which had just landed there  this disgraceful panic added to the terror of the citizens of edinburgh and when late in the afternoon a summons to surrender came in from prince charles the council could arrive at no decision but sent a deputation to the prince asking for delay hoping thereby that copes army would arrive in time to save them but the prince was also well aware of the importance of time and that night he sent forward lochiel with five hundred camerons to lie in ambush near the netherbow gate they took with them a barrel of powder to blow it in if necessary but in the morning the gate was opened to admit a carriage and the highlanders at once rushed in and overpowered the guard and sending parties through the streets they secured these also without disturbance or bloodshed and when the citizens awoke in the morning they found to their surprise that prince charles was master of the city  the jacobite portion of the population turned out with delight to greet the prince while the rest thought it politic to imitate their enthusiasm the highlanders behaved with perfect order and discipline and although the town had as it were been taken by storm no single article of property was touched an hour later prince charles at the head of his troops entered the royal palace of holyrod being met by a crowd of enthusiastic supporters from the city who received him with royal shouts and tears of joy  in the evening a grand ball was held in the palace in spite of the fact that it was within range of the guns of edinburgh castle which still held out but one day was spent in edinburgh this was occupied in serving out about a thousand muskets found in the magazines to the highlanders and in obtaining tents shoes and cooking vessels which the town was ordered to supply they were joined during the day by many gentlemen and on the night of the 19th the army two thousand five hundred strong of whom only fifty were mounted moved out to the village of duddingston there the prince that evening called a council of war and proposed to march next morning to meet the enemy halfway and declared that he would himself lead his troops and charge in the first ranks  the chiefs however exclaimed against this urging that if any accident happened to him ruin must fall upon the whole whether they gained or lost the battle and upon the prince persisting they declared that they would return home and make the best terms they could for themselves he was therefore obliged to give way declaring however that he would lead the second line the next morning the army commenced its march they had with them only one cannon so old that it was quite useless and it was only taken forward as an encouragement to the highlanders who had the greatest respect for artillery  sir john cope who had received intelligence of all that had happened at edinburgh had also moved forward on the 19th and on the 20th the two armies came in sight of each other the highlanders after passing the bridge of musselburgh left the road and turning to the right took up their position on the brow of carberry hill and there waited the attack the english forces were marching forward with high spirit and believed that the highlanders would not even wait their assault cope had with him two thousand two hundred men including the six hundred runaway dragoons the numbers therefore were nearly equal but as the english were well armed disciplined and equipped while only about half the highlanders had muskets and as they had moreover six pieces of artillery against the one unserviceable gun of prince charles they had every reason to consider the victory to be certain  on seeing the highland array cope drew up his troops in order of battle  his infantry in the centre with a regiment of dragoons and three pieces of artillery on each flank his right was covered by a park wall and by the village of preston on his left stood seaton house and in his rear lay the sea with the villages of prestonpans and cockenzie their front was covered by a deep and difficult morass  it was now about three oclock in the afternoon and the highlanders seeing that the english did not advance against them clamoured to be led to the attack prince charles was himself eager to fight but his generals persuaded him to abstain from attacking the english in such a formidable position the highlanders however fearing that the english would again avoid a battle were not satisfied until lord nairn with five hundred men was detached to the westward to prevent the english from marching off towards edinburgh  during the night the two armies lay upon the ground cope retired to sleep at cockenzie the prince lay down in the middle of his soldiers before doing so however he held a council and determined to attack next morning in spite of the difficulty of the morass but in the course of the night anderson of whitburg a gentleman well acquainted with the country bethought himself of a path from the height towards their right by the farm of ruigan head which in a great measure avoided the morass this important fact he imparted to lord george murray who at once awoke the prince  locheil and some other chiefs were sent for and it was determined to undertake the enterprise at once an aide de camp was sent to recall lord nairn and his detachment and under the guidance of anderson the troops made their way across the morass this was not however accomplished without great difficulty as in some places they sank knee deep the march was unopposed and covered by the darkness they made their way across to firm ground just as the day was breaking dull and foggy as they did so however the dragoon outposts heard the sound of their march and firing their pistols galloped off to give the alarm sir john cope lost no time facing his troops about and forming them in order of battle he was undisturbed while doing so for the highlanders were similarly occupied  as the sun rose the mist cleared away and the two armies stood face to face the macdonalds had been granted the post of honour on the highland right the line being completed by the camerons and stuarts prince charles with the second line being close behind the highlanders uncovered their heads uttered a short prayer and then as the pipers blew the signal they rushed forward each clan in a separate mass and raising their war cry the camerons and stuarts rushed straight at the cannon on the left  these guns were served not by royal artillerymen but by some seamen brought by cope from the fleet they panic struck by the wild rush of the highlanders deserted their guns and fled in all directions colonel gardiner called upon his dragoons to follow him and with his officers led them to the charge but the stuarts and camerons pouring in a volley from their muskets charged them with their broadswords and the dragoons panic stricken turned their horses and galloped off  the macdonalds on the right had similarly captured three guns and charging with similar fury upon hamiltons regiment of dragoons drove them off the field macgregors company who for want of other weapons were armed with scythes doing terrible execution among the horses and their riders the english infantry deserted by their cavalry and with their guns lost still stood firm and poured a heavy fire into the highlanders but these as soon as they had defeated the cavalry faced round and charged with fury upon both flanks of the infantry their onslaught was irresistible the heavy masses of the clans broke right through the long line of the english infantry and drove the latter backward in utter confusion but the retreat was impeded by the inclosure and park wall of preston and the highlanders pressing on the greater portion of the english infantry were killed or taken prisoners  a hundred and seventy of the infantry alone succeeded in making their escape four hundred were killed and the rest captured colonel gardiner and many of his officers were killed fighting bravely but the loss of the dragoons was small only thirty of the highlanders were killed and seventy wounded the battle lasted but six minutes and the moment it had terminated prince charles exerted himself to the utmost to obtain mercy for the vanquished  he treated the prisoners with the greatest kindness and consideration and the wounded were relieved without any distinction of friend or foe the dragoons fled to edinburgh and dashed up the hill to the castle but the governor refused to admit them and threatened to open his guns upon them as cowards who had deserted their colours later on in the day the greater portion were rallied by sir john cope and the earls of loudon and home but being seized with a fresh panic they galloped on again at full speed as far as coldstream and the next morning continued their flight in a state of disgraceful disorder as far as berwick the contents of the treasure chest consisting of two thousand five hundred pounds with the standards and other trophies were brought to prince charles the rest of the spoil was divided among the highlanders of whom a great number immediately set off towards their homes to place the articles they had gathered in safety  so greatly was the highland army weakened by the number of men who thus left the ranks that the prince was unable to carry out his wish for an instant advance into england his advisers indeed were opposed to this measure urging that in a short time his force would be swelled by thousands from all parts of scotland but unquestionably his own view was the correct one and had he marched south he would probably have met with no resistance whatever on his march to london there were but few troops in england a requisition had been sent to the dutch by king george for the six thousand auxiliaries they were bound to furnish and a resolution was taken to recall ten english regiments home from flanders  marshal wade was directed to collect as many troops as he could at newcastle and the militia of several counties was called out but the people in no degree responded to the efforts of the government they looked on coldly not indeed apparently favouring the rebellion but as little disposed to take part against it the state of public feeling was described at the time by a member of the administration henry fox in a private letter  england wade says and i believe is for the first comer and if you can tell me whether these six thousand dutch and the ten battalions of england or five thousand french or spaniards will be here first you know our fate the french are not come god be thanked but had five thousand landed in any part of this island a week ago i verily believe the entire conquest would not have cost a battle  the prince indeed was doing his best to obtain assistance from france conscious how much his final success depended upon french succour  king louis for a time appeared favourable the princes brother henry of york had arrived from rome and the king proposed to place him at the head of the irish regiments in the kings service and several others to enable him to effect a landing in england but with his usual insincerity the french king continued to raise difficulties and cause delays until it was too late and he thus lost for ever the chance of placing the family who had always been warm friends of france and who would in the event of success have been his natural friends and allies on the throne of england  in the meantime prince charles had taken up his abode in edinburgh where he was joined by most of the gentry of scotland he was proclaimed king in almost every town of the tweed and was master of all scotland save some districts beyond inverness the highland forts and the castles of edinburgh and stirling prince charles behaved with the greatest moderation he forbade all public rejoicing for victory saying that he could not rejoice over the loss which his fathers misguided subjects had sustained he abstained from any attempt to capture edinburgh castle or even to cut off its supplies because the general of the castle threatened that unless he were allowed to obtain provisions he would fire upon the city and lay it in ruins and he even refused to interfere with a scotch minister who continued from his pulpit to pray for king george  in one respect he carried his generosity so far as to excite discontent among his followers it was proposed to send one of the prisoners taken at preston to london with a demand for the exchange of prisoners taken or to be taken in the war and with the declaration that if this were refused and if the princes friends who fell into the enemys hands were put to death as rebels the prince would be compelled to treat his captives in the same way it was evident that this step would be of great utility as many of the princes adherents hesitated to take up arms not from fear of death in battle but of execution if taken prisoners  the prince however steadily refused saying it is beneath me to make empty threats and i will never put such as this into execution i cannot in cold blood take away lives which i have saved in the heat of action  six weeks after the victory the princes army mustered nearly six thousand men but macleod macdonald and lovat who could have brought a further force of four thousand men still held aloof had these three powerful chiefs joined at once after the battle of prestonpans prince charles could have marched to london and would probably have succeeded in placing his father on the throne without having occasion to strike another blow but they came not and the delay caused during the fruitless negotiations enabled the english troops to be brought over from flanders while prince charles on his side only received a few small consignments of arms and money from france  but in the meantime edinburgh was as gay as if the stuart cause had been already won receptions and balls followed each other in close succession and prince charles won the hearts of all alike by his courtesy and kindness and by the care which he showed for the comfort of his troops  at the commencement of the campaign lord george murray had but one aide de camp besides ronald this was an officer known as the chevalier de johnstone who afterwards wrote a history of the campaign after the battle of prestonpans he received a captains commission and immediately raised a company with which he joined the duke of perths regiment two other gentlemen of family were then appointed aides de camp and this afforded some relief to ronald whose duties had been extremely heavy  a week after the battle lord george said to ronald  as there is now no chance of a movement at present and i know that you care nothing for the court festivities here i propose sending you with the officers who are riding into glasgow tomorrow with the orders of the council that the city shall pay a subsidy of five thousand pounds towards the necessities of the state the citizens are hanoverians to a man and may think themselves well off that no heavier charge is levied upon them do you take an account of what warlike stores there are in the magazines there and see that all muskets and ammunition are packed up and forwarded  the next morning ronald started at daybreak with several other mounted gentlemen and an escort of a hundred of clanranalds men under the command of the eldest son of that chief for glasgow and late the same evening entered that city they were received with acclamation by a part of the population but the larger portion of the citizens gazed at them from their doorways as they passed in sullen hostility they marched direct to the barracks lately occupied by the english troops the gentlemen taking the quarters occupied by the officers a notification was at once sent to the provost to assemble the city council at nine oclock in the morning to hear a communication from the royal council  as soon as malcolm had put up ronalds horse and his own in the stables and seen to their comfort he and ronald sallied out it was now dark but they wrapped themselves up in their cloaks so as not to be noticed as in the hostile state of the town they might have been insulted and a quarrel forced upon them had they been recognized as two of the new arrivals the night however was dark and they passed without recognition through the ill lighted streets to the house of andrew anderson they rang at the bell a minute later the grille was opened and a voice which they recognized as that of elspeth asked who was there and what was their business  we come to arrest one elspeth dow as one who troubles the state and is a traitor to his majesty  there was an exclamation from within and the door suddenly opened  i know your voice bairn the lord be praised that you have come back home again and she was about to run forward when she checked herself is it yourself ronald  it is no one else elspeth he replied giving the old woman a hearty kiss  and such a man as you have grown she exclaimed in surprise for the two years had added several inches to ronalds stature and he now stood over six feet in height  and have you no welcome for me elspeth malcolm asked coming forward  the lord preserve us elspeth exclaimed why its my boy malcolm  turned up again like a bad penny you see elspeth  what is it elspeth andrews voice called from above who are these men you are talking to and what do they want at this time of night  they want some supper andrew malcolm called back and that badly  in a moment andrew ran down and clasped his brothers hand in the darkness he did not notice malcolms companion and after the first greeting with his brother led the way up stairs  it is my brother malcolm he said to his wife as he entered the room  ronald followed malcolm forward as the light fell on his face andrew started and as ronald smiled ran forward and clasped him in his arms  it is ronald wife ah my boy have you come back to us again  mrs anderson received ronald with motherly kindness  we had heard of your escape before your letter came to us from paris our city constables brought back the news of how you had jumped overboard and had been pulled into a boat and disappeared and finely they were laughed at when they told their tale then came your letter saying that it was malcolm who had met you with the boat and how you had sailed away and been wrecked on the coast of france but since then we have heard nothing  i wrote twice ronald said but owing to the war there have been no regular communications and i suppose my letters got lost  and i suppose you have both come over to have a hand in this mad enterprise  i dont know whether it is mad or not andrew but we have certainly come over to have a hand in it malcolm said and now before we have a regular talk let me tell you that we are famishing i know your supper is long since over but doubtless elspeth has still something to eat in her cupboard oh here she comes  elspeth soon placed a joint of cold meat upon the table and ronald and malcolm set to at once to satisfy their hunger then a jar of whiskey and glasses were set upon the table and pipes lighted and ronald began a detailed narration of all that had taken place since they had last met  had my father and mother known that i was coming to scotland and should have an opportunity of seeing you both they would have sent you their warmest thanks and gratitude for your kindness to me he concluded for over and over again have i heard them say how deeply they felt indebted to you for your care of me during so many years and how they wished that they could see you and thank you in person  what we did was done in the first place for my brother malcolm and afterwards for love of you ronald and right glad i am to hear that you obtained the freedom of your parents and a commission as an officer in the service of the king of france i would be glad that you had come over here on any other errand than that which brings you things have gone on well with you so far but how will they end i hear that the jacobites of england are not stirring and you do not think that with a few thousand highland clansmen you are going to conquer the english army that beat the french at dettingen and well nigh overcame them at fontenoy ah lad it will prove a sore day for scotland when charles stuart set foot on our soil  we wont talk about that now andrew malcolm said good temperedly the matter has got to be fought out with the sword and if our tongues were to wag all night they could make no difference one way or another so let us not touch upon politics but i must say that as far as ronald and i are concerned we did not embark on this expedition because we had at the moment any great intention of turning hanoverian george off his throne but simply because ronald had made france too hot to hold him and this was the simplest way that presented itself of getting out of the country as long as there are blows to be struck we shall do our best when there is no more fighting to be done either because king james is seated on his throne in london or because the clans are scattered and broken we shall make for france again where by that time i hope the king will have got over the breach of his edict and the killing of his favourite and where ronalds father and mother will be longing for his presence  eh but its awful sirs elspeth who as an old and favourite servant had remained in the room after laying the supper and listened to the conversation put in to think that a young gallant like our ronald should have slain a man he who ought not yet to have done with his learning to be going about into wars and battles and to have stood up against a great french noble and slain him eh but its awful to think of  it would be much more awful elspeth if the french noble had killed me at least from the light in which i look at it  thats true enough elspeth said and if he wanted to kill you and it does seem from what you say that he did want of course i cannot blame you for killing him but to us quiet bodies here in glasgow it seems an awful affair though after you got in a broil here and drew on the city watch i ought not to be surprised at anything  and now we must go ronald said rising it is well nigh midnight and time for all decent people to be in bed    chapter xv a mission   the next morning early ronald proceeded to take an inventory of the arms and ammunition left behind by the troops when they had marched to join sir john cope at stirling having done this he saw that they were all packed up in readiness to be sent off the next day under the escort who were also to convey the money which the city was required to pay for the provost and council knowing that it was useless to resist the order and perhaps anxious in the present doubtful state of affairs to stand well with prince charles had arranged that the money should be forthcoming of the following morning after his work was over ronald again spent the evening at andrew andersons  the next morning he returned to edinburgh with the arms and escort it was late when he arrived but as he knew that lord george murray would be at work in his tent he repaired there at once  we have brought back the money and arms lord george i have handed over the arms and ammunition at the magazine tent and those in charge of the money have gone into the town with a part of the escort to give it over to the treasurer  how many arms did you get  two hundred and twentythree muskets and eighty pistols fourteen kegs of gunpowder and well nigh a ton of lead  that is more than i had expected and now leslie i have an important mission for you the prince this morning asked me whom i could recommend as a sure and careful person likely to do the business well to go down into lancashire to visit the leading jacobites there and urge them to take up arms i said that i knew of none who would be more likely to succeed than yourself your residence of two years in france has rubbed off any scotch dialect you may have had and at any rate you could pass for a northern englishman in the next place your youth would enable you to pass unsuspected where an older man might be questioned the prince agreed at once and took shame to himself that he had not before given promotion to one who was his companion on his voyage to scotland the more so as he had made johnstone a captain your claims are far greater than his and moreover you have served as an officer in the french army but in truth the fault is in some degree your own for you spend all your time in carrying out your duties and do not show yourself at any of the levees or festivities and you know with princes as with other people out of sight is out of mind however the prince at once took steps to repair the omission and has signed your commission as captain here it is you will understand of course that it is for past services and that you are perfectly free to decline this mission to the south if you would rather not undertake it it is unquestionably a dangerous one  i will undertake it readily sir ronald said and i thank you sincerely for bringing my name before the prince and the prince himself for his kindness in granting me his commission which so far i have done but little to win i shall be able i trust to carry out this mission to his satisfaction and although i am ignorant of the country i shall have the advantage of taking with me my brave follower malcolm anderson who for years was in the habit of going with droves of cattle down into lancashire and will not only know the country but have acquaintances there and being known as a drover would pass without suspicion of his being engaged with politics  that will do well lord george said i will get the list of persons on whom you should call prepared tomorrow you had best go to sir thomas sheridan and francis strickland who came over with you and get them to present you to secretary murray and recommend you to him if he hears that your mission is of my recommendation he will do all he can to set the prince against you everything that i do is wrong in his eyes and i do believe that he would ruin the cause in order to injure me did he see no other way to accomplish that end therefore if he mentions my name as he is like to do knowing that you have been my aide de camp be sure that you say nought in my favour or it will ruin you with him you will of course attend the princes levee tomorrow and had best make preparation to start at nightfall  the next day accordingly ronald called upon sir thomas sheridan and strickland and telling them that the prince had determined to send him on a mission into lancashire asked them to present him to secretary murray from whom he would receive orders for his guidance and instruction as to the persons whom he was to visit the two gentlemen proceeded with him to the house in which secretary murray had taken up his abode and introduced him with much warmth as a fellow passenger on board the doutelle  you have been serving since as lord murrays aide de camp  yes sir the prince recommended me to him at perth and i have since had the honour to carry his orders  captain leslie for so the prince has granted him a commission sir thomas said has served two years in the french army and was present at dettingen and fontenoy he mentioned to me on the voyage that he had the honour of being presented by marshal saxe to the king of france and that he received his commission from the marshal to whom he had acted as aide de camp at fontenoy  you have begun well indeed young sir murray said to have received at your age for i judge that you are not yet twenty commissions in the french army and ours  ronald bowed  he has another claim upon all you scottish gentlemen sir thomas said for colonel macdonald told us when he introduced him to us at nantes that it was through his interference and aid alone that he escaped safely from glasgow and that all his papers with the names of the kings friends in scotland did not fall into georges hands he was taken prisoner for his share in that affair but escaped from the ship in the thames and succeeded in crossing to france so you see young as he is he has rendered good service to the cause  the expression of the secretarys face which had before been cold and distant changed at once he had been aware that ronald had been chosen for this business on the recommendation of lord george murray and his jealousy of that nobleman had at once set him against ronald of whose antecedents he was entirely ignorant but what he now heard entirely altered the case and disposed him most favourably towards him especially as his own name would have been one of the most prominent in the list he having been in constant communication with colonel macdonald during the stay of the latter in scotland  i had no idea it was to you that we are all so indebted he said warmly i heard from colonel macdonald after his return from france that he owed his escape entirely to the quickness and bravery of a young gentleman of whose name he was ignorant but who he feared would suffer for his interference on his behalf and prayed me and all other loyal gentlemen of scotland to befriend you should they ever discover your name for that we assuredly owed it to you that we escaped imprisonment if not worse i am truly glad to meet you and thank you in person and so you are going on this mission  i have undertaken to do my best sir fortunately i have a faithful follower who fought beside my father in 15 followed him to france and fought by his side in the scottish dragoons for fifteen years and who has since been my best friend he worked for years when i was a child as a drover of cattle from the highlands into england he knows cumberland and lancashire well and would be known at every wayside inn he will accompany me and i shall pass as his nephew therefore no suspicion will be likely to light upon me  and you set out tonight  yes sir if my orders and letters are ready  there will not be many letters the secretary said it would not do for you to have documents upon you which might betray you and our friends there should you be arrested i will give you a list of the gentlemen on whom you have to call which you had best learn by heart and destroy before you cross the frontier you shall have one paper only and that written so small that it can be carried in a quill this you can show to one after the other if you find you are in danger of arrest you can destroy or swallow it i will give them to you at the princes levee this afternoon and will send to your tent a purse of gold for your expenses  i shall need but little for that sir ronald said smiling  for your expenses no the secretary said but one never can say what money may be required for you may have to buy fresh horses you may want it to bribe someone to conceal you money is always useful my young friend by the way what family of leslies do you belong to i heard that one of your name had accompanied the prince but no more  my father was leslie of glenlyon  indeed the secretary exclaimed of course i know the name well the lands were confiscated but we shall soon set that right and i will see that they are added to when the time comes to reward the kings friends and punish his foes  ronald now took his leave and returned to malcolm who was making preparation for the enterprise he had already purchased two suits of clothes such as would be worn by lowland drovers and was in high spirits being more elated than was ronald himself at the latters promotion in the course of the day he bought two rough ponies as being more suitable for the position they were to assume than the horses with which they had been furnished at perth ronald attended the levee and thanked the prince for the favour which he bestowed upon him  you are a young gentleman after my own heart prince charles said and i promised myself on shipboard that we should be great friends but i have been so busy since i landed and you have been so occupied in my service that i have seen but little of you on your return i hope that i shall be able to have you near my person i am half jealous of you for while you are younger than i am you have seen good service and taken part in great battles but hitherto i have led a life almost of idleness  ronald bowed deeply at the princes gracious speech on his return to his tent he found a messenger from the secretary with a purse which on counting its contents they found to amount to a hundred guineas  they started immediately and travelled twenty miles before stopping for the night at a small wayside inn  this seems like old times to me malcolm said as after eating supper they sat by a turf fire except that on my way down i had the herd to look after there is no fear of our being questioned or suspected till we reach the border for there is not an english soldier between the forth and the tweed nor is it likely that we shall meet with any difficulty whatever till we get to carlisle copes forces or what remain of them are at newcastle and it will be there that the english will gather and the western road is likely to be open until at any rate prince charles moves south georges troops have plenty to think about without interfering with the lowlands drovers at the same time after we have once crossed the tweed we may as well leave the high road i know every bypath over the fells  on the third day after starting they crossed the border and were among the hills of cumberland they found that among the villages great apprehension existed the tales of the rapine and destruction wrought in the old times by the scottish forays had been handed down from father to son and nothing less than the destruction of their homes and the loss of their flocks and herds was looked for malcolm was welcomed warmly at the little village inn where they put up for the night  why its well nigh three years since i saw you last the host said and before that it was seldom two months without our seeing you what have you been doing with yourself  i have been gathering the herds in the highlands malcolm said while others have driven them down for sale but at present my occupation is gone the highlanders are swarming like angry bees whose hive has been disturbed and even if we could collect a herd it would not be safe to drive it south it would be seized and despatched to edinburgh for the use of the clans there  is it true that there are fifty thousand of them and that they have sworn to kill every english man woman and child  no they are not so strong as that malcolm said from what i hear i should say they were not more than half and i do not think there is any occasion for peaceful people to be afraid for they say that the prince has treated all the prisoners who fell into his hands in the kindest manner and that he said that the english are his fathers subjects as well as the scots and that he will see that harm is done to no man  i am right glad to hear it the innkeeper said i dont know that i am much afraid myself but my wife and daughter are in a terrible fright and wanted me to quit the house and go south till it is all over  there is no occasion for that man malcolm said you will have no reason for fear were the whole of the clans to march through your village unless you took it into your head to stand at the door and shout god bless king george  i care not a fig about king george or king james the man said its nought to me who is king at london and as far as i know thats the way with all here let them fight it out together and leave us hard working folks to ourselves  i dont suppose either james or george would care for that malcolm said laughing but from what i have heard of prince charles i should say that there is nothing in the world that he would like better than to stand with broadsword or dagger against the duke of cumberland and so settle the dispute  that would be the most sensible thing to my mind the innkeeper said but what brings you here anderson since you have no herd with you  i am just getting out of it all malcolm said i have had my share of hard knocks and want no more of them i dont want to quarrel with highlanders or lowlanders and as trade is at a standstill at present and theres nothing for me to do in the highlands i thought i would come south till it was all over there is money to collect and things to look after and i have to notify to our regular customers that the herds will come down again as soon as the tempest is over and between ourselves he said in a lower voice i wanted to get my nephew out of harms way he has a hankering to join the princes army and i dont want to let him get his brains knocked out in a quarrel which isnt his so i have brought him along with me  he is a good looking young fellow i can see and a strong one i dont wonder that he wanted to mount the white cockade lads are always wanting to run their heads into danger you have had your share of it as you say still you are wise to keep the lad out of it i dont hold with soldiering or fighting in quarrels that dont concern you  malcolm and ronald travelled through cumberland and westmoreland calling upon many of the gentlemen to whom the latter had been charged to deliver prince charless messages they could not however flatter themselves that their mission was a success for from few of those on whom they called did they receive assurances that they were prepared to take action all the gentlemen professed affection for the stuarts but deprecated a descent into england unless the prince were accompanied by a strong body of french troops  the rising of 15 had been disastrous for the jacobites of the north of england and though all declared that they were ready again to take up arms and risk all for the cause of the stuarts if the prince was at the head of a force which rendered success probable they were unanimously of opinion that it would be nothing short of madness to rise until at any rate the prince had marched into england at the head of a strong army  the principal personage upon whom they called was mr ratcliff a brother of the earl of derwentwater who had been executed after the rising of 15 that gentleman assured them that he himself was ready to join the prince as soon as he came south but that he wished the prince to know that in his opinion no large number of english would join  the memory of  15 is still too fresh he said while the stuarts have been absent so long that although there are great numbers who would prefer them to the hanoverians i do not believe that men have the cause sufficiently at heart to risk life and property for it many will give their good wishes but few will draw their swords that is what i wish you to say to prince charles among gentlemen like myself the feeling of respect and loyalty to his fathers house is as strong as ever and we shall join him however desperate in our opinion the chances of success may be but he will see that the common people will stand aloof and leave the battle to be fought out by the clansmen on our side and georges troops on the other  some weeks were passed in traversing the country to and fro for the desired interviews were often only obtained after considerable loss of time they could not ride up as two highland drovers to a gentlemans house and had to wait their chances of meeting those they wished to see on the high road or of sending notes requesting an interview couched in such terms that while they would be understood by those to whom they were addressed they would compromise no one if they fell into other hands there was indeed the greatest necessity for caution for the authorities in all the towns and villages had received orders from the government to be on the lookout for emissaries from the north and they were frequently exposed to sharp examination and questioning indeed it was only malcolms familiarity with the country and the fact that he had so many acquaintances ready to testify that he was as he said a scotch drover in the habit for many years of journeying down from the north with cattle that enabled them to escape arrest  after much thought they had decided upon a place of concealment for the quill containing ronalds credentials which would they thought defy the strictest scrutiny a hole had been bored from the back into the heel of ronalds boot deep enough to contain the quill and after this was inserted in the hiding place the hole was filled up with cobblers wax so that it would need a close examination indeed to discover its existence thus although they were several times closely searched no document of a suspicious nature was found upon them  their money was the greatest trouble as the mere fact of so large a sum being carried by two drovers would in itself have given rise to suspicions although had they been on their return towards scotland the possession of such an amount would have been easily explained as the proceeds of the sale of the cattle they had brought down they had therefore left the greater part of it with a butcher in carlisle with whom malcolm had often had dealings retaining only ten pounds for their necessary expenses  the day after they reached manchester four constables came to the little inn where they were stopping and told them that they were to accompany them before the magistrates  i should like to know what offence we are charged with malcolm said angrily things have come to a pretty pass indeed when quiet drovers are to be hauled before magistrates without rhyme or reason  you will hear the charge quickly enough when you are before their worships the constable said but that is no affair of mine  my orders are simply to take you there  well of course we must go malcolm said grumblingly but here we have been well nigh twenty years travelling to and fro between england and scotland as my host here can testify without such a thing happening before i suppose somebody has been robbed on the highway and so you sharp sighted gentlemen clap hands on the first people you come across  three magistrates were sitting when ronald and malcolm were brought into the courthouse they were first asked the usual questions as to their names and business and then one of the magistrates said  your story is a very plausible one but it happens that i have here before me the reports sent in from a score of different places for in times like these it is needful to know what kinds of persons are travelling through the country and two men answering to your description are reported to have visited almost every one of these places it is stated in nearly every report that you are drovers ordinarily engaged in bringing down herds of highland cattle and it is added that in every case this account was verified by persons who have previously known you all this would seem natural enough but you seem to have journeyed hither and thither without any fixed object sometimes you have stopped for two days at little villages where you could have had no business and in short you seem for upwards of a month to have been engaged in wandering to and fro in such a way as is wholly incompatible with the affairs upon which you say you were engaged  but you will observe sir malcolm said quietly that i have not said i am engaged upon any affairs whatever i am not come to england on business but solely to escape from the troubles which have put a stop to my trade in the highlands and as for fifteen years i was engaged in journeying backwards and forwards and had many friends and acquaintances i came down partly as i have said to avoid being mixed up in the trouble partly to call upon old acquaintances and partly to introduce to them my nephew who is new to the work and will shortly be engaged in bringing down cattle here i thought the present was a good opportunity to show him all the roads and halting places in order that he might the better carry out the business  your story has been well got up one of the magistrates said though i doubt whether there be a single word of truth in it however you will be at present searched and detained until we get to the bottom of the matter this is not a time when men can travel to and fro through the country without exciting a suspicion that they are engaged upon other than lawful business at present i tell you that in our eyes your conduct appears to be extremely suspicious  the prisoners were then taken to a cell and searched with the utmost rigour their clothes were examined with scrupulous care many of the seams being cut open and the linings slit to see if any documents were concealed there their shoes were also carefully examined but the mud had dried over the opening where the quill was concealed and the officials failed to discover it even their sticks were carefully examined to see if they contained any hollow place but at last convinced that had they been the bearers of any documents these must have been discovered the officials permitted them to resume their clothes and then paying no heed to the angry complaints of malcolm at the state to which the garments had been reduced they left the prisoners to themselves  be careful what you say malcolm whispered to ronald many of these places have cracks or peepholes so that the prisoners can be watched and their conversation overheard  having said this malcolm indulged in a long and violent tirade on the hardship of peaceful men being arrested and maltreated in this way and at the gross stupidity of magistrates in taking an honest drover known to half the countryside for a jacobite spy ronald replied in similar strains and any listeners there might have been would certainly have gained nothing from the conversation they overheard  i should not be surprised malcolm said in low tones when night had come and all was quiet if some of our friends outside try to help us the news will speedily spread that two men of the appearance of drovers have been taken on suspicion of being emissaries from scotland and it will cause no little uneasiness among all those on whom we have called they cannot tell whether any papers have been found upon us nor what we may reveal to save ourselves so they will have a strong interest in getting us free if possible  if we do get free malcolm the sooner we return to scotland the better we have seen almost all those whom we are charged to call upon and we are certainly in a position to assure the prince that he need hope for no rising in his favour here before he comes and that it is very doubtful that any numbers will join him if he marches south  the next morning they were removed from the cell in which they had been placed to the city jail and on the following day were again brought before the magistrates  you say that you have been calling on people who know you one of the magistrates began and as i told you the other day we know that you have been wandering about the country in a strange way i now requite that you shall tell us the names of all the persons with whom you have had communication  the question was addressed to malcolm as the oldest of the prisoners ronald looked round the court which was crowded with people and thought that in several places he could detect an expression of anxiety rather than curiosity  it will be a long story malcolm said in a drawling voice and i would not say for sure but that i may forget one or two seeing that i have spoken with so many we came across the hills and the first person we spoke to was master fenwick who keeps the collie dog at appleswade i dont know whether your worship knows the village i greeted him as usual and asked him how the wife and children had been faring since i saw him last he said they were doing brawly save that the eldest boy had twisted his ankle sorely among the fells  we dont want to hear all this nonsense the magistrate said angrily we want a list of persons not what you said to them  it will be a hard task malcolm said simply but i will do the best i can your worship and i can do no more let me think there was joseph repton and nat somner  at least i think it was nat but i wont be sure to his christian name  and john dykes and a chap they called pitman but i dont know his right name  who were all these people the magistrate asked  joe repton he is a wheelwright by trade and nat somner he keeps the village shop i think the others are both labouring men anyhow they were all sitting at the tap of the collie dog when i went in  but what have we to do with these fellows the magistrate exclaimed angrily  i dont know no more than a child malcolm said but your worship ordered me to tell you just the names of the persons i met and i am doing so to the best of my ability  take care prisoner the magistrate said sternly you are trifling with the court you know what i want you to tell me you have been to these villages and he read out some fifteen names what did you go there for and whom did you see  that is just what i was trying to tell your worship in regular order but directly i begin you stop me i have been going through this district for fifteen years and i am known in pretty well every village in cumberland westmoreland and lancashire having been away for three years and my trade being stopped by the war as your worship well knows i have been going round having a crack with the people i know such as were butchers i promised some fine animals next time i came south such as were innkeepers i stayed a night with and talked of old times if your worship will have patience with me i can tell you all the names and what i said to each of them and what they said to me and all about it  i dont want to know about these things i am asking you whether you have not been calling on some of the gentry  indeed now malcolm said with an air of astonishment and this is the first time that i have heard a word about the gentry since i came into the court well let me think now i did meet squire ringwood and he stopped his horse and said to me is that you malcolm anderson you rascal and i said its me sure enough squire and he said you rascal that last score of beasts i bought of you   silence shouted the magistrate as a titter ran through the court all this fooling will do you no good i can tell you we believe that you are a traitor to the king and an emissary of the pretender if you make a clean breast of it and tell me the names of those with whom you have been having dealings there may be a hope of mercy for you but if not we shall get at the truth other ways and then your meanness of condition will not save you from punishment  your worship must do as you like malcolm said doggedly i have done my best to answer your questions and you jump down my throat as soon as i open my mouth what should a man of my condition have to do with kings or pretenders they have ruined my trade between them and i care not whether king george or king james get the best of it so that they do but make an end of it as soon as possible and let me bring down my herds again theres half a dozen butchers in the town who know me and can speak for me i have sold thousands of beasts to master tregold but if this is the treatment an honest man meets with i aint likely to sell them any more for as soon as i am let free and get the money the constables have taken from me i am off to glasgow and if i ever come south of the border again may i be hung and quartered  finding that nothing was to be made out of the prisoners the magistrate ordered them to be taken back to jail    chapter xvi the march to derby   two days later when the jailer brought in breakfast to their cell he dropped on the table by the side of the loaf a tiny ball of paper and then without a word went out and locked the back door malcolm put his finger to his lips as ronald was about to utter an exclamation of joy  ones appetite is not as good here as it was when we were tramping the hills ronald but one looks forward to ones meals they form a break in the time  so saying he took up one of the lumps of bread and began to ear securing at the same time the pellet of paper we cant be too careful he said in a whisper it is quite possible that they may be able to overhear us  i dont see how ronald replied in the same tone i see no crack or crevice through which sound could pass  you may not see one malcolm said but it may exist for all that one of the boards of the ceiling may be as thin as paper and anyone listening through could hear every word we say when we speak in our natural voices the magistrates evidently believe that they have made a valuable capture and would give anything to prove that their suspicions are correct now i will go and stand at that grated opening and look at this paper if they are watching us they will see nothing then  the little piece of paper when unfolded contained but a few words keep up your courage you have friends without working for you destroy this  malcolm at once again rolled up the pellet put it into his mouth and swallowed it and then whispered to ronald what he had just read  i thought he whispered that we should soon get a message of some sort the news of our arrest will have set the hearts of a score of people quaking and they would do anything now to get us out from this prison they have already you see succeeded in bribing our warder  at his evening visit the warder passed into ronalds hand a small parcel and then as before went out without speaking  i am confirmed in the belief that we can be overheard malcolm said had the man not been afraid of listeners he would have spoken to us now let us see what he has brought us this time  the parcel contained a small file a saw made of watch spring and a tiny phial of oil  so far so good malcolm said quietly our way through these bars is clear enough now but that is only the beginning of our difficulties this window looks into the prison yard and there is a drop of some forty feet to begin with however i have no doubt our friends will send us the means of overcoming these difficulties in due course all we have to concern ourselves about now is the sawing through of these bars  as soon as it was dark they began the work relieving each other in turns the oil prevented much sound being made but to deaden it still further they wrapped a handkerchief over the file the bars had been but a short time in position and the iron was new and strong it was consequently some hours before they completed their work when they had done the grating was left in the position it before occupied the cuts being concealed from any but close observation by kneading up small pieces of bread and pressing them into them and then rubbing the edges with iron filings  that will do for tonight malcolm said no one is likely to pay us a visit but if they did they would not notice the bars unless they went up and shook them tomorrow morning we can put a finishing touch to the work  as soon as it was daylight they were upon their feet  it does very well as it is malcolm said examining the grating it is good enough to pass and we need not trouble further about it now collect every grain of those iron filings no dont do that on any account he broke in as ronald was preparing to blow some of it from the lower stonework through the opening were you to do that it would be quite possible that one of the prisoners walking in the yard might see it and would as likely as not report the circumstance to one of the warders in order to curry favour and perhaps obtain a remission of his sentence scrape it inside and pour every atom down the crevices in the floor that done we are safe unless anyone touches the grating  they watched their warder attentively when he next came into the cell but this time he had no message for them we must not be impatient malcolm said our friends have a good many arrangements to make for they will have to provide for our getting away when we are once out besides they will probably have to bribe other warders and that kind of thing cant be done in a hurry  it was not for another two days that the warder made any fresh sign then as on the first occasion he placed a pellet of paper on the table with their bread  this is a good deal larger than the last ronald whispered  it was not until some little time after they had finished their meal that ronald moved to the grating and unrolled the little ball of paper it contained only the words  you will receive a rope this evening with this lower yourselves from your window into the courtyard start when you hear the church bells strike midnight cross the court and stand against the wall near the right hand corner of the opposite side the third window on the second floor will be opened and a rope lowered to you attach yourselves to this and you will be pulled up from above  after reading the note ronald passed it on to malcolm who as before swallowed it but had this time to tear it into several pieces before doing so the warder was later bringing their supper than usual that evening and it was dark when he came in as he entered the room he let the lamp fall which he carried  confound the thing he said roughly here take hold of this bread and let me feel for the lamp i cant be bothered with going down to get another light you can eat your supper in the dark just as well i have no doubt  as he handed ronald the bread he also pushed into his hand the end of the rope and while he pretended to search for the lamp he turned round and round rapidly and so unwound the rope which was twisted many times round his body as soon as this was done he picked up the lamp and with a rough goodnight left them  it is just as i suspected malcolm said in ronalds ear there is a peephole somewhere otherwise there could be no occasion for him to have dropped the lamp it is well that we have always been on our guard  they ate their bread in silence and then after a short talk on the stupidity of the english in taking two drovers for messengers of prince charles they lay down on their rough pallets to pass with what patience they could the long hours before midnight for it was late in october and it was little after five oclock when the warder visited them they felt but slight anxiety as to the success of the enterprise for they had no doubt that every detail had been carefully arranged by their friends without although certainly it seemed a strange method of escape that after lowering themselves from a third floor window they should afterwards be hauled up into a second at last after what seemed almost an endless watch they heard the church clocks strike twelve and simultaneously rose to their feet not a word was spoken for although it was improbable in the extreme that any watcher would be listening at that hour of the night it was well to take every precaution the grating was lifted out and laid down on one of the couches so that all noise should be avoided the rope was then strongly fastened to the stump of one of the iron bars  now malcolm i will give you a leg up i am younger and more active than you are so you had better go first  without debating the question malcolm put his foot on ronalds hand and in a moment was seated in the opening of the window grasping the rope he let himself quietly out and lowered himself to the ground reaching it so noiselessly that ronald who was listening did nor hear a sound after waiting a minute however he sprang up on to the sill and feeling that the rope was slack was soon by malcolms side below then both removed their shoes and hung them round their necks and walking noiselessly across the court they took up their post under the window indicated in the note in less than a minute the end of a rope was dropped upon their heads  you go first this time ronald malcolm said and fastened it beneath ronalds arms then he gave a pull at the rope to show that they were ready the rope tightened and ronald found himself swinging in the air he kept himself from scraping against the walls by his hands and feet and was especially careful as he passed the window on the first floor in a minute he was pulled into the room on the second floor by the men who had hoisted him up a low hush warned him that there was still a necessity for silence the rope was lowered again and ronald lent his aid to hoist malcolm up to the window as soon as he was in it was as slowly and carefully closed  you are mighty heavy both of you a voice whispered i should not have thought it would have been such hard work to lift a man up this height now follow us and be sure you make no noise  two flights of stairs were descended and then they stood before a small but heavy door some bolts were drawn and a key turned in the lock this being done so noiselessly that ronald was sure they must have been carefully oiled the two men passed through with them locking the door behind them  thank god we are out malcolm said fervently i have been in a watch house more than once in my young days but i cant say i like it better as i grow older they walked for some minutes and then their guides opened a door and they entered a small house  stir up those peats jack one of the men said and blow them a bit while i feel for a candle  in a minute or two a light was obtained  thats very neatly done i think gentlemen laughed the man addressed as jack and who they now saw was the warder who had attended upon them we had rare trouble in hitting upon that plan the cell you were in opened upon a corridor the doors to which are always locked by the chief constable himself and even if we could have got at his key and opened one of them we should have been no nearer escape for two of the warders sleep in the lodge and there would be no getting out without waking them and they could not be got at they are both of them married men with families and that sort of man does not care about running risks unless he happens to be tired of his wife and wanting a change nat here and i have no incumbrances and werent sorry of a chance to shift anyhow there was no way as far as we could see of passing you out through that part of the prison and at last the idea struck us of getting you out the way we did that wing of the jail is only used for debtors and they are nothing like so strict on that side as they are on the other some of the warders sleep there so there was no difficulty in getting hold of the key for an hour and having a duplicate made till yesterday all the cells were full and we had to wait till a man whose time was just up moved out after that it was clear sailing  well we are immensely obliged to you ronald said  oh you neednt be obliged to us the warder replied we are well paid for the job and have a promise of good berths if prince charles gets the best of it anyhow we shall both make for london where we have acquaintances now we are going to dress up theres no time to be lost talking there is a light cart waiting for us and horses for you half a mile outside the town  he opened a cupboard and took our two long smock frocks which he and his companion put on  now gentlemen will you put on these two suits of soldiers clothes i think they will about fit you  ronald and malcolm were soon attired as dragoons  theres a regiment of them here the man said so there was no difficulty in buying a cast off suit and getting these made from it as to the helmets i guess there will be a stir about them in the morning we got hold of a soldier today and told him we wanted a couple of helmets for a lark and he said for a bottle of brandy he would drop them out of a barrack window at ten oclock tonight and he kept his word two of them will be surprised in the morning when they find that their helmets have disappeared as to the swords and belts i dont know that they are quite right they were bought at an old shop and i believe they are yeomanry swords but i expect they are neat enough i was to give you this letter to take with you it is as you see directed to general wade at newcastle and purports to come from the colonel of your regiment here so that if by any chance you are questioned on the way that will serve as a reason for your journeying north here is a purse of twenty guineas i think thats about all  but are we not to see those who have done us such service ronald asked in order that we may thank them in person  i dont know who it is any more than the man in the moon the warder replied it was a woman dressed as a serving wench though i doubt it was only a disguise who came to me she met me in the street and asked me if i should like to earn fifty pounds i said i had no objection and then after a good deal of beating about the bush it came out that what was wanted was that i should aid in your escape i didnt see my way to working it alone and i told her so she said she was authorized to offer the same sum to another so i said i would talk it over with nat he agreed to stand in and between us we thought about the arrangements but i never got to know any more about her it was nothing to me whom the money came from as long as it was all right we have had half down and are to have the other half when we get to the cart with you and now if you are ready we will be starting the further we get away from here before morning the better  they made their way quietly along the streets the town was in total darkness and they did not meet a single person abroad and in a quarter of an hour they were in the open country another ten minutes and they came upon the cart and horses three men were standing beside them and the impatient stamp of a horses hoof showed that the horses were tied up closely a lantern was held up as the party came up  all safe  all safe ronald replied thanks many thanks to you for our freedom  the man holding the lantern was masked so they could not see his face he first turned to the two warders and placed a bag of money in their hand  you have done your work well he said the cart will take you thirty miles on your road and then drop you i wish you a safe journey you had best hide your money in your boots unless you wish it to fall into the hands of highwaymen the london road is infested with them  with a word of farewell to ronald and malcolm the two warders climbed into the cart one of them mounted beside them and took the reins and in another minute the cart drove away in the darkness as soon as it had started the man with the lantern removed his mask  mr ratcliff ronald exclaimed in surprise  yes it is myself there are half a dozen of us engaged in the matter as soon as we heard of your arrest we determined to get you out i was only afraid you would have been taken up to london before we could get all our plans arranged for i knew they had sent up for instructions it was well that we were ready to act tonight for orders were received this afternoon that you should be sent up under an escort tomorrow you puzzled them rarely at your examination and they could make nothing of you our greatest fear was that you might betray yourselves in the prison when you fancied you were alone for we learned from the men who have just left us that you were placed in a special cell where all that you said could be overheard and your movements to some extent watched through a tiny hole in the wall communicating with the cell next to it it widens out on that side so that a man can get his ear or his eye to the hole which is high up upon the wall and but a quarter of an inch across so that it could scarcely be observed unless by one who knew of its existence the warder said that they could hear plainly enough through this hole but could see very little however they do not seem to have gathered much that way  we were on guard sir my friend malcolm thought it possible that there might be some such contrivance  and now my young friend mr ratcliff said you had best mount at once follow this road for half a mile and then take the broad road to the left you cannot mistake it it goes straight to penrith you have got the letter to general wade  yes sir and the money we are indeed in every way greatly indebted to you  say nothing about it mr ratcliff said i am risking my life as well as my fortune in the cause of prince charles and this money is on his service i hear he is already on the march south repeat to him when you join him what i have already told you namely that i and other gentlemen will assuredly join him but that i am convinced there will be no general rising in his favour unless a french army arrive to his assistance the delay which has taken place has in my opinion entirely destroyed his chances unless he receives foreign assistance wade has ten thousand men at newcastle the duke of cumberland has gathered eight thousand in the midlands and there is a third army forming to cover london already many of the best regiments have returned from holland and each day adds to their number do all you can to dissuade him from advancing until french aid arrives but tell him also that if he comes with but half a dozen followers charles ratcliff will join him and share his fate whatever it be  with a hearty shake of the hand he leapt on his horse and followed by his servant galloped off in one direction while ronald and malcolm set out in the other  this is a grand disguise ronald said we might ride straight into wades camp at newcastle without being suspected  i have no doubt we could malcolm agreed still it will be wiser to keep away from the neighbourhood of any english troops awkward questions might be asked and although the letter you have for the general may do very well to impress any officers of militia or newly raised troops we may meet on the road and would certainly pass us as two orderlies conveying despatches it would be just as well not to have to appear before the general himself our swords and belts would probably be noticed at once by any cavalry officers i know nothing about the english army and do not know how much the yeomanry swords and belts may differ from those of the line however it is certain the less observation we attract from the soldiers the better but as to civilians we can ride straight on through towns and villages with light hearts  we may as well breathe our horses a bit malcolm now there is no occasion for haste and we can jog along at our own pace there is no probability of pursuit for when they find that we and the warders are missing and see the rope from our window they will be sure that we shall have started early and are far away by the time they find out we are gone  accordingly they travelled quietly north boldly riding through small towns and villages putting up at little inns and chatting freely with the villagers who came in to talk over the news for the north was all excitement orders had been issued for all the militia to turn out but there was little response for although few had any desire to risk their lives in the cause of the stuarts fewer still had any intention of fighting for the hanoverians  when they arrived within a few miles of newcastle they left the main road and struck across country their object being to come down upon the road running north from carlisle for they thought it likely that parties of general wades troops would be scattered far over the country north of newcastle at a farm house they succeeded in buying some civilian clothes giving out that they were deserters and as they were willing to pay well the farmer who had no goodwill towards the hanoverians had no difficulty in parting with two of his best suits  they were now in a country perfectly well known to malcolm and travelling by byways across the hills they crossed the cheviots a few miles south of carter fell and then rode down the wild valleys to castletown and thence to canobie of the esk as they entered the little town they found the wildest excitement prevailing an officer with two orderlies had just ridden in to say that quarters were to be prepared for prince charles and a quantity of bullocks and meal got in readiness for the use of the army which would arrive late that evening ronald soon found the officer who had brought the order and recognized him as one of lord perths aides de camp he did not know ronald in his present dress but greeted him heartily as soon as he discovered who he was  how is it the troops are coming this way ronald asked  they are marching through liddesdale from kelso we halted there for two days and orders were sent forward to wooler to prepare quarters this was to throw wade off the scent and induce him to march north from newcastle to oppose us on that road while as you see we have turned west and shall cross into cumberland and make a dash at carlisle  a few hours later the prince arrived with his army and as soon as he entered the quarters prepared for him ronald proceeded there and made his report  i could wish it had been better captain leslie the prince said but the die is cast now and i cannot think that our friends in the north who proved so loyal to our cause in 15 will hang back when we are among them when they see that charles ratcliff and other gentlemen whom you have visited range themselves under our banner i believe the common people will join us also now give me a full account of your mission  ronald gave the list of the gentry he had visited and described his arrest and imprisonment in manchester and the manner in which mr ratcliff had contrived his escape  you have done all that is possible sir the prince said and at an early opportunity i will show you i appreciate your services  on the next day the 8th of november the corps crossed the border on the 9th they were joined by another column which had marched from edinburgh by the western road and the united force marched to carlisle and sat down before it the walls of the city were old and in bad condition the garrison was ill prepared for a siege it consisted of a company of invalids in the castle under the command of colonel durand and a considerable body of cumberland militia the walls however old as they were could for some time have resisted the battery of four pounder guns which formed the princes sole artillery  the mayor returned no answer to the princes summons and orders were issued to begin to throw up trench works but scarcely had the operations begun when news arrived that marshal wade was marching from newcastle to relieve the city the siege was at once abandoned and the prince marched out with the army to brampton and took up a favourable position there to give battle the news proved incorrect and the duke of perth with several regiments were sent back to resume the siege  on the 13th the duke began to raise a battery on the east side of the town but after a few shots had been fired from the walls the courage of the besieged failed them the white flag was hung out and the town and castle surrendered on the condition that the soldiers and militia might march away leaving their arms and horses behind and engaging not to serve again for a year on the 17th the prince made a triumphal entry into the place but was received with but little show of warmth on the part of the inhabitants  a halt was made at carlisle and a council was held to determine upon the next step to be taken the news which had been received from scotland was very unfavourable lord strathallan who had been appointed by the prince as commander in chief and directed to raise as many troops as possible had collected between two and three thousand men at perth and lord lewis gordon had raised three battalions in aberdeenshire but on the other hand a considerable force had been collected at inverness for king george the towns of glasgow paisley and dumfries had turned out their militia for the house of hanover the officers of the crown had reentered edinburgh and two regiments of cavalry had been sent forward by marshal wade to their support  while even scotland was thus wavering it seemed almost madness for the little army to advance into england the greater portion of the highlanders had from the first objected strongly to leave their country and upwards of a thousand had deserted and gone home on the march down from edinburgh they had started less than six thousand strong and after leaving a garrison of two hundred men in carlisle but four thousand five hundred were available for the advance south while wade with his ten thousand men would be in their rear and two english armies of nearly equal strength be waiting to receive them at the council the opinions of the leaders were almost unanimous against an advance but upon lord george murray saying that if prince charles decided upon advancing the army would follow him he determined upon pressing forward  the army began its advance on the 20th of november and halted a day at penrith upon the news that marshal wade was moving to attack them but the english general had not made any move and the scotch again pushed on through shap kendal and lancaster to preston during the march prince charles marched with his troops clad in highland garb and with his target thrown across his shoulder he seldom stopped for dinner but ate his food as he walked chatting gaily with the highlanders and by his cheerfulness and example kept up their spirits the strictest discipline was enforced and everything required by the troops was paid for at preston the prince on his entry was cheered by the mob and a few men enlisted  from preston the army marched to wigan and thence to manchester the road was thronged with people who expressed the warmest wishes for the princes success but when asked to enlist they all hung back saying they knew nothing about fighting still the feeling in favour of the princes cause became stronger as he advanced south and at manchester he was received with the acclamations of the inhabitants the ringing of the bells and an illumination of the city in the evening the people mounted white cockades and the next day about two hundred men enlisted and were enrolled under the name of the manchester regiment the command of which was given to mr francis townley a roman catholic belonging to an old lancashire family who with mr ratcliff and a few other gentlemen had joined the army on the advance  the leaders however of the princes army were bitterly disappointed at the general apathy of the people lancashire had in 15 been the stronghold of the jacobites and the mere accession of two or three hundred men was evident that nothing like a popular rising was to be looked for and they had but themselves to rely upon in the struggle against the whole strength of england marshal wade was in full march behind them the duke of cumberland lay at lichfield in their front with a force of eight thousand veteran troops while a third army of which the royal guards were the nucleus was being formed at finchley large bodies of militia had been raised in several districts liverpool had declared against them chester was in the hands of the earl of cholmondeley the bridges of the mersey had been broken down difficulties and dangers multiplied on all sides  prince charles ever sanguine was confident that he should be joined by large numbers as he advanced south but his officers were now thoroughly alarmed and the leaders in a body remonstrated with lord george murray against any further advance he advised them however to offer no further opposition to the princes wishes until they came to derby promising that unless by that time they were joined by the jacobites in considerable numbers he would himself as general propose and insist upon a retreat ronald utilized the short halt at manchester to obtain new uniforms for himself and malcolm which he was glad to exchange for the farmers garb which had been the occasion of a good deal of joking and mirth among his fellow officers on the downward march  on the first of december prince charles at the head of one division forded the mersey near stockport where the water was waist deep the other division with the baggage and artillery crossed lower down at cheadle on a hastily constructed bridge and the two columns joined that evening at macclesfield here lord george murray succeeded in misleading the duke of cumberland as to his intentions by a dexterous manoeuvre advancing with a portion of his force he dislodged and drove before him the duke of kingston and a small party of english horse posted at congleton and pursued them some distance along the road towards newcastle under tyne  the duke of cumberland supposing that the princes army were on their march either to give him battle or to make their way into wales where the jacobite party were extremely strong pushed forward with his main body to stone lord george murray however having gained his object turned sharp off to the left and after a long march arrived at ashborne where the prince with the other division of the army had marched direct the next afternoon they arrived at derby having thus altogether evaded the duke of cumberland and being nearly three days march nearer london than was his army  the prince that night was in high spirits at the fact that he was now within a hundred and thirty miles of london and that neither wades nor cumberlands forces interposed between him and the capital but his delight was by no means shared by his followers and early next morning he was waited upon by lord george murray and all the commanders of battalions and squadrons and a council being held they laid before the prince their earnest and unanimous opinion that an immediate retreat to scotland was necessary  they had marched they said so far on the promise either of an english rising or a french descent upon england neither had yet occurred their five thousand fighting men were insufficient to give battle to even one of the three armies that surrounded them  scarcely adequate indeed to take possession of london were there no army at finchley to protect it even did they gain london how could they hold it against the united armies of wade and cumberland defeat so far from home would mean destruction and not a man would ever regain scotland  in vain the prince replied to their arguments in vain expostulated and even implored them to yield to his wishes after several hours of stormy debate the council broke up without having arrived at any decision the prince at one time thought of calling upon the soldiers to follow him without regard to their officers for the highlanders reluctant as they had been to march into england were now burning for a fight and were longing for nothing so much as to meet one or other of the hostile armies opposed to them the princes private advisers however sheridan and secretary murray urged him to yield to the opinion of his officers since they were sure that the clansmen would never fight well if they knew that their chiefs were unanimously opposed to their giving battle accordingly the prince heartbroken at the destruction of his hopes agreed to yield to the wishes of his officers and at a council in the evening gave his formal consent to a retreat    chapter xvii a baffled plot   utterly disheartened and dispirited the army commenced its march north the prince himself was even more disappointed than his soldiers and showed by his manner how bitterly he resented the decision at which his officers had arrived it had seemed to him that success was within his grasp and that he had but to march to london to overthrow the hanoverian dynasty and it is by no means improbable that his instincts were more correct than the calculations of his advisers the news of his rapid march south had sent a thrill through the country and although so far the number of those who had joined him was exceedingly small at that moment numbers of gentlemen in wales and other parts of the country were arming their tenants and preparing to take the field  there was no hostile force between himself and london for the force at finchley was not yet organized and could have offered no effectual opposition a panic reigned in the metropolis and the king was preparing to take ship and leave the country had the little army marched forward there is small doubt that james would have been proclaimed king in london but it may be doubted whether prince charles could have maintained the advantage he had gained two armies both superior to his own were pressing on his rear and would have arrived in london but a few days after himself and although the londoners might have accepted him they would hardly have risen in arms to aid him against cumberlands army had this halted at a distance the reinforcements which might have joined the prince would have been more than counterbalanced by the regiments of english and hanoverian troops which the king could have sent over and although the strife might have been lengthened the result would in all probability have been the same  prince charles had no ability in governing his notions of the absolute power of kings were as strong as those of his ancestors and surrounded as he was by hotheaded highlanders he would speedily have caused discontent and disgust even among those most favourably inclined by hereditary tradition to the cause of the stuarts but of all this he was ignorant and in the retreat from derby he saw the destruction of his hopes  hitherto he had marched on foot with the highlanders chatting gaily as he went now he rode in rear of the column and scarce exchanged a word with even his most intimate advisers the highlanders no longer preserved the discipline which had characterized their southward march villages were plundered and in some cases burned and in retaliation the peasantry killed or took prisoners stragglers and those left behind even at manchester where the reception of the army had been so warm a few days before its passage was opposed by a violent mob and the prince was so offended at the conduct of the townspeople that he imposed a fine of five thousand pounds upon the city  the next morning the march was continued the highlanders laid hands on every horse they could find and so all pressed on at the top of their speed for the border the duke of cumberland who had fallen back in all haste for the protection of london was close to coventry when he heard that the scotch had retreated northward with all his cavalry and a thousand foot whom he mounted on horses supplied by the neighbouring gentry he set out in pursuit at preston he was joined by another body of horse sent across the country from the army of marshal wade but it was not until he entered westmoreland that he came up with the rear guard of the insurgents which was commanded by lord george murray  defeating some local volunteers who molested him lord george learned from the prisoners that the duke with four thousand men was close at hand and he sent on the news to the prince who despatched two regiments the stuarts of appin and the macphersons of cluny to reinforce him it was nearly dark when by the light of the moon lord george saw the english infantry who had now dismounted advancing he at once charged them at the head of the macphersons and stuarts and in a few minutes the english were completely defeated their commander colonel honeywood being left severely wounded on the field with a hundred killed or disabled men while the loss of the scotch was but twelve  it was with great difficulty that the highlanders could be recalled from the pursuit and lord george himself sent an urgent message to the prince begging for a further reinforcement in order that he might maintain his ground and defeat the whole force of the duke as usual his wishes were disregarded and he was ordered to fall back and join the main body at penrith the check however was so effective that the duke made no further attempt to harass the retreat of the highlanders  passing through carlisle some men of a lowland regiment and colonel twonley with his regiment raised at manchester were left there as a garrison so that the road should be kept open for another and as the prince hoped not far distant invasion the step was however a cruel one for the duke of cumberland at once laid siege to the place battered a breach in its ancient wall and the garrison were forced to surrender many of them were afterwards executed and imprisoned and ruin fell upon all  charles with his army marched north to glasgow where they remained eight days requisitioning supplies from the town during their stay ronald and malcolm put up at the house of andrew anderson  what think you of the chances now malcolm andrew asked his brother after hearing what had taken place since he had last seen him  i think no better and no worse of it than i did before brother they have had more success than i looked for i did not think they would ever have got as far south as derby who would have thought that a few thousand highlanders could have marched half through england but i see no prospect of success the prince is badly advised he has but one really good soldier with him and he is set against him by the intrigues and spite of secretary murray and his friends and partly it may be by lord georges own frankness of speech he has at his back but half the highlands for the other portion stand aloof from him in the lowlands he has found scarce an adherent and but a handful in england the highlanders are brave but it is surely beyond human expectation that five or six thousand highlanders can vanquish a kingdom with a brave and well trained army with abundant artillery ronald and i mean to fight it out to the end but i do not think the end will be very far off  i am sorry for the young prince andrew said he is a fine fellow certainly  handsome and brave and courteous and assuredly clement for three times his life has been attempted and each time he has released those who did it without punishment i could not but think as i saw him ride down the street today that it was sad that so fine a young man should be doomed either to the block or to a lifelong imprisonment and that for fighting for what he has been doubtless taught to consider his right there are many here who are bitter against him but i am not one of them and i am sorry for him sorry for all these brave gentlemen and clansmen for i fear that there will be a terrible vengeance for all that has been done they have frightened the english king and his ministers too sorely to be ever forgiven and we shall have sad times in scotland when this is all over  two evenings later ronald noticed that andrew who had been absent for some time and had only returned just in time for supper looked worried and abstracted and replied almost at random to any questions put to him  it is of no use he said suddenly when his wife had left the room after the conclusion of the meal i am a loyal subject of king george and i wish him every success in battle and am confident that he will crush out this rebellion without difficulty but i cannot go as far as some i cannot stand by and see murder done on a poor lad who whatever his faults is merciful and generous to his enemies malcolm i will tell you all i know only bidding you keep secret as to how you got the news for it would cost me my life were it known that the matter had leaked out through me  this evening five of the council knowing that i am a staunch kings man took me aside after the meeting was over and told me that there was a plan on foot to put an end to all the trouble by the carrying off or slaying of prince charles i was about to protest against it when i saw that by so doing i should in the first place do no good in the second be looked upon as a jacobite and in the third be unable to learn the details of what they were proposing so i said that doubtless it was a good thing to lay by the heels the author of all these troubles and that the life of one man was as nought in the balance compared to the prosperity of the whole country whereupon they revealed to me their plan asking me for a subscription of a hundred pounds to carry it out and saying truly that i should get back the money and great honour from the king when he learned i had done him such service after some bargaining i agreed for fifty pounds  but what is the plot andrew malcolm said anxiously  it is just this the prince as you know goes about with scant attendance and though there are guards in front of his house there are but two or three beside himself who sleep there there is a back entrance to which no attention is paid and it will be easy for those who know the house to enter by that door to make their way silently to his chamber and either to kill or carry him off i threw my voice in against killing pointing out that the king would rather have him alive than dead so that he might be tried and executed in due form this was also their opinion for they had already hired a vessel which is lying in the stream the plan is to seize and gag him and tie his arms there will be no difficulty in getting him along through the streets there are few folks abroad after ten oclock and should they meet anyone he will conclude that it is but a drunken highlander being carried home you see malcolm there is not only honour to be gained from the king but the thirty thousand pounds offered for the princes person i pretended to fall in with the plan and gave them the fifty pounds which they lacked for the hire of the vessel the captain refusing to let them have it save for money paid down now malcolm i have told you and ronald all i know about the matter and it is for you to see how a stop may be put to it  the scoundrels malcolm said their loyalty to the king is but a veil to hide their covetousness for the reward when is it to take place and how many men are likely to be engaged in it  six trusty men of the city watch and their five selves i said i would subscribe the money but would have no active share in the business they might have all the honour i would be content with my share of the reward offered two of them with four of the guards will enter the house and carry off the prince the rest will wait outside and follow closely on the way down to the port ready to give aid if the others should meet with any obstruction the whole will embark and sail to london with him  and when is this plot to be carried out malcolm asked  tomorrow at midnight tide will be high half an hour later they will drop down the river as soon as it turns and will be well out to sea by the morning and now i have told you all i will only ask you to act so that as little trouble as possible may arise do not bring my name into the matter if you can avoid doing so but in any case i would rather run the risk of the ruin and death which would alight upon me when this rebellion is over than have such a foul deed of treachery carried out there is not a scotchman but to this day curses the name of the traitor menteith who betrayed wallace my name is a humble one but i would not have it go down to all ages as that of a man who betrayed charles stuart for english gold  make yourself easy brother ronald and i will see to that when once treachery is known it is easy to defeat and ronald and i will see that your name does not appear in the matter  thank god that is off my mind andrew said and i will off to bed or janet will wonder what i am talking about so long i will leave you two to settle how you can best manage the affair which you can do without my help for matters of this kind are far more in your way than in mine  this is a villainous business ronald malcolm said when they were alone and yet i am not surprised thirty thousand pounds would not tempt a highlander who has naught in the world save the plaid in which he stands up but these money grubbing citizens of glasgow would sell their souls for gain and now what do you think had best be done in the matter so that the plot may be put a stop to and that without suspicion falling upon andrew it would be easy to have a dozen men hiding in the yard behind the house and cut down the fellows as they enter  i do not think that would do malcolm it would cause a tumult and the fact could not be hidden and besides you know what these highlanders are they already loathe and despise the citizens of glasgow and did they know that there had been a plot on foot to capture and slay the prince nothing could prevent their laying the town in ashes  that is true enough what do you propose then ronald  i think it best that if there should be any fighting it should be on board the ship but possibly we may avoid even that i should say that with eight or ten men we can easily seize the vessel and then when the boat comes alongside capture the fellows as they step on to the deck without trouble and leave it to the prince to settle what is to be done with them  that is certainly the best plan ronald i will get together tomorrow half a dozen trusty lads who will ask no questions as to what i want them to do and will be silent about the matter afterwards we must get from andrew tomorrow morning the name of the vessel and see where she is lying in the stream and where the boat will be waiting for the prince  the next night ronald and malcolm with six men made their way one by one through the streets so as not to attract the attention of the watch and assembled near the strand not until the clock struck twelve did they approach the stairs at the foot of which the boat was lying there were two men in it  you are earlier than we expected one said as they descended the steps the captain said a quarter past twelve  yes we are a little early malcolm replied as he stepped into the boat we are ready earlier than we expected  a moment later malcolm suddenly seized one of the sailors by the throat and dragged him down to the bottom of the boat a handkerchief was stuffed into his mouth and his hands and feet tied the other was at the same time similarly secured  so suddenly and unexpected had been the attack that the sailors had had no time to cry out or to offer any resistance and their capture was effected without the slightest sound being heard the oars were at once got out and the boat was rowed out towards the vessel lying out in the middle of the stream with a light burning at her peak as they approached the side the captain appeared at the gangway  all is well i hope he asked  could not be better malcolm replied as he seized the rope and mounted the gangway the others closely following him as he sprang upon the deck he presented a pistol at the captains head  speak a word and you die he said sternly  taken by surprise the captain offered no resistance but suffered himself to be bound two or three sailors on deck were similarly seized and secured the hatchway was fastened to prevent the rest of the crew from coming on deck and the ship being thus in their possession two of the men at once took their places in the boat and rowed back to the stairs  a quarter of an hour later those on board heard a murmur of voices on shore and two or three minutes later the splash of oars as the boat rowed back to the ship ronald put on the captains cap and stood at the gangway with a lantern  all right i hope he asked as the boat came alongside  all right captain you can get up your anchor as soon as you like  two men mounted on to the deck and then four others carried up a figure and were followed by the rest as the last one touched the deck ronald lifted the lantern above his head and to the astonishment of the newcomers they saw themselves confronted by eight armed men  the six men of the watch furious at the prospect of losing the reward upon which they had reckoned drew their swords and rushed forward but they were struck down with handspikes and swords for ronald had impressed upon his men the importance of not using their pistols save in the last extremity in two minutes the fight was over the five citizens had taken little part in it save as the recipients of blows for malcolm furious at their treachery had bade the men make no distinction between them and the watch and had himself dealt them one or two heavy blows with his handspike after he had seen that the guard was overpowered  the whole of them were then bound and warned that their throats would be cut if they made the least noise the prince was released from his bonds and he was at once conducted by malcolm and ronald to the cabin where a light was burning  the prince was so much bewildered by the events that had occurred that he did not yet understand the state of the case he had been awoke by a gag being roughly forced into his mouth while at the same moment his hands were tightly bound then he was lifted from his bed some clothes were thrown on to him a man took his place on either side and thrusting their arms into his threatened him with instant death if he did not come along with them without resistance then he had been hurried down stairs and along the streets two men keeping a little ahead and others following behind he had been forced into a boat and rowed up to a ship and on reaching the deck a desperate combat had suddenly commenced all round him then the gag had been removed and the bonds cut bewildered and amazed he gazed at the two men who had accompanied him to the cabin  why captain leslie he exclaimed is it you what means all this scene through which i have passed  it means your royal highness ronald said respectfully that i and my friend malcolm obtained information of a plot on the part of some of the citizens to carry you off and sell you to the english we could have stopped it by attacking them as they entered the house to seize you but had we done so an alarm must have been raised and we feared that the highlanders when they knew of the treachery that had been attempted against you might have fallen upon the citizens and that a terrible uproar would have taken place therefore we carried out another plan we first of all obtained possession of the ship in which you were to have been taken away and then overcame your captors as they brought you on board all this has been done without any alarm having been given and it now rests with you to determine what shall be done with these wretches  you have done well indeed captain leslie and i thank you and your friend not only for the great service you have rendered me but for the manner in which you have done it i ought to have foreseen this did not the lowlanders sell king charles to the english i might have expected that some at least would be tempted by the reward offered me as for punishment for these men they are beneath me and moreover if i can trust my eyes and my ears the knocks which you gave them will be punishment enough even did i wish to punish them which i do not i could not do so without the story of the attempt being known and in that case there would be no keeping my highlanders within bounds as it is they are continually reproaching me with what they call my mistaken clemency and there would be no restraining them did they know of this no we had best leave them to themselves we will order the captain to put to sea with them at once and tell him he had best not return to glasgow until i have left it they will have time to reflect there at leisure and as doubtless they have each of them given reasons at home for an absence of some duration there will be no anxiety respecting them and now gentlemen will you fetch in those who have aided in my rescue i would thank every one of them for the service they have rendered and impress upon them my urgent desire that they should say nothing to anyone of this nights work  while the prince was speaking to the men malcolm went out and having unbound the captain ordered him to deliver up the sum which he had received for the conveyance of the prince and his captors to england  the captain did as he was ordered  how much is there here malcolm asked  three hundred pounds  malcolm counted out fifty of it and placed them in his pocket saying to ronald  there is no reason andrew should be a loser by the transaction that will leave two hundred and fifty which i will divide among our men when we get ashore  malcolm then gave the princes orders to the captain that he must immediately they left the ship get up his anchor as before intended and make out to sea and that under pain of being tried and executed for his share in this treacherous business he was not to return to glasgow with his eleven passengers for the space of a week  the prince and his rescuers then entered the boats and rowed to shore and the prince regained his apartment without anyone in the house being aware that he had been absent from it the next day the prince sent for ronald and malcolm and in a private interview again expressed to them his gratitude for his rescue from the hands of his enemies  i have none but empty honour to bestow now he said but believe me if i ever mount the throne of england you shall see that charles edward stuart is not ungrateful  the incident was kept a close secret only two or three of the princes most intimate advisers ever informed of it these were unanimous in urging that an absolute silence should be maintained on the subject for the fact that the attempt would have certainly been crowned with success had it not been for the measures ronald had taken might encourage others to attempt a repetition of it  having rested his army by a stay of eight days at glasgow prince charles set out on the 3rd of january 1746 for stirling where he was joined by lords john drummond lewis gordon and strathallan the first named of whom had brought some battering guns and engineers from france their following raised the force to nearly nine thousand men  the largest army that charles mustered during the course of the campaign the siege of stirling was at once commenced but the castle was strong and well defended and the siege made but little progress  in the meantime the duke of cumberland had been recalled with the greater part of his force to guard the southern coasts of england which were threatened by an invasion by a french force now assembled at dunkirk and which had it sailed before the highlanders commenced their retreat from derby might have altogether altered the situation of affairs the command of the english army in the north was handed by the duke to general hawley a man after his own heart violent in temper brutal and cruel in conduct  he collected at edinburgh an army of nearly the same strength as that of prince charles and with these he matched out as far as falkirk to raise the siege of stirling and as he confidently boasted to drive the rebels before him prince charles leaving a few hundred men to continue the siege matched out to bannockburn the english did not move out from falkirk and the prince after waiting for a day determined to take the initiative  hawley himself was stopping at callendar house at some distance from his army and general huske remained in command of the camp to occupy his attention the prince despatched lord john drummond with all the cavalry by the straight road by stirling to falkirk which ran north of the english camp they displayed as they marched the royal standard and other colours which had the desired effect of impressing huske with the idea that the prince with all his army was moving that way in the meantime charles with his main force had crossed the river carron to the south and was only separated from the english by falkirk muir a rugged and rigid upland covered with heath  just as the english were about to take their dinner some country people brought in the news of the approach of the highlanders huske at once got his men under arms but he had no authority in the absence of hawley to set them in motion messengers however were sent off on horseback at once to callendar house and the general presently galloped up in breathless haste and putting himself at the head of his three regiments of dragoons started for falkirk muir which he hoped to gain before the highlanders could take possession of it he ordered the infantry to follow as fast as possible a storm of wind and rain beat in the face of the soldiers and before they could gain the crest of the muir the highlanders had obtained possession the english then halted and drew up on somewhat lower ground  between them was a ravine which formed but a small depression opposite the centre of the english line but deepened towards the plain on their right the english artillery in the hurry of their advance had stuck fast in a morass but as the highlanders had brought no guns with them the forces were equal in this respect lord john drummond had from a distance been watching the movements of the english and as soon as he saw that they had taken the alarm and were advancing against the prince he made a detour and riding round the english joined the highland infantry the princes army was divided into two lines its right was commanded by lord george murray the left by lord john drummond the prince as at preston took up his station in the centre of the second line on a conspicuous mound still known by the name of charlies hill  the english infantry were also drawn up in two lines with the argyle militia and the glasgow regiment in reserve behind the second line the cavalry were in front under colonel ligonier who at the death of colonel gardiner had succeeded to the command of his regiment general hawley commanded the centre and general huske the right  the battle commenced by a charge of ligonier with his cavalry upon the highland right here the macdonald clansmen were posted and these at lord george murrays order reserved their fire until the dragoons were within ten yards and then poured in a scathing volley under which numbers of the horsemen went down the two dragoon regiments which had fled so shamefully at preston and coltbridge turned and galloped at once from the field but cobhams regiment fought well and when compelled to retreat rallied behind the right of the line  lord george murray endeavoured to get the victorious macdonalds into line again but these were beyond control and rushing forward fell upon the flank of hawleys two lines of foot which were at the same moment furiously assailed in front the highlanders after pouring in their fire dropped their muskets and charged broadsword in hand  the english nearly blinded by the wind and rain were unable to withstand this combined assault general hawley who at least possessed the virtue of courage rode hither and thither in their front trying to encourage them but in vain the whole centre gave way and fled in confusion on the right however the english were defending themselves successfully the three regiments placed there on the edge of the ravine maintained so steady a fire that the highlanders were unable to cross it and cobhams dragoons charged down upon the scattered and victorious highlanders in the centre and effectually checked their pursuit prince charles seeing the danger put himself at the head of the second line and advanced against the three english regiments who still stood firm  unable to withstand so overwhelming a force these fell back from the ground they had held but did so in steady order their drums beating and covering in their retreat the mingled mass of fugitives had the highlanders at this critical moment flung themselves with their whole force upon these regiments the english army would have been wholly destroyed but night was already setting in and the scottish leaders were ignorant how complete was their victory and feared an ambuscade lord john drummond a general officer in the french service especially opposed the pursuit saying these men behaved admirably at fontenoy surely this must be a feint  the highlanders remained stationary on the field until some detachments sent forward by the prince brought back word that the english had already retreated from falkirk they left behind them on the field four hundred dead or dying with a large portion of officers and a hundred prisoners all their artillery ammunition and baggage fell into the hands of the highlanders whose total loss was only about a hundred the english on their retreat burned to the ground the royal palace at linlithgow    chapter xviii culloden   the victory of falkirk brought but little advantage to prince charles and dissensions arose among the officers lord george murray being furious with lord john drummond for preventing the complete destruction of the english army while lord john drummond severely criticised lord george for the confusion which had taken place among his troops after their success  great numbers of the highlanders who had spent the night after the battle in plundering the english camp and stripping the slain made off with their booty to the mountains and the number of desertions was increased by the withdrawal of the greater part of glengarrys clansmen on the day after the battle the musket of one of the clanranald clansmen went off by accident and killed the son of glengarry his clansmen loudly demanded life for life and clanranald having reluctantly consented to surrender his follower the poor fellow was immediately led out and shot but even this savage act of vengeance was insufficient to satisfy the glengarry men the greater part of whom at once left the army and returned to their homes  after the battle the siege of stirling was renewed but owing to the gross incompetence of a french engineer who had come over with lord drummond the batteries were so badly placed that their fire was easily silenced by that of the castle guns the prince in spite of the advice of lord george murray and the other competent authorities and listening only to his favourite councillors secretary murray and sir thomas sheridan continued the siege although on the 3oth of january the duke of cumberland arrived in edinburgh and took the command of the army  never had scotland a more bitter enemy relentless and savage as general hawley had been his deeds were more than rivalled by those of the duke of cumberland who was justly branded by contemporary historians with the name of the butcher he was however an able general of great activity and high personal courage  after halting but one night in edinburgh he set out at the head of his army to meet the enemy but these did not repeat their tactics at falkirk disgusted at the conduct of the prince in slighting their advice and listening only to his unworthy counsellors lord george murray with all the principal military leaders held a consultation and presented a memorial to the prince in this they stated that seeing the great numbers of highlanders who had gone home they were of opinion that another battle could not be fought with a chance of success and therefore recommended that the army should at once retire to the highlands where a sufficient number of men could be kept together to defy the efforts of the enemy at such a season of the year and that in the spring ten thousand highlanders could be got together to go wheresoever the prince might lead them prince charles was struck with grief and dismay at this decision but as all the military leaders had signed it he was forced to give way  the army at once blew up its magazines spiked its guns and marched for the north in two divisions with much confusion and loss of order the duke of cumberland pursued but was unable to come up to them and halted at perth  ronald who had from the time he returned to the army again taken up his former appointment of aide de camp to lord george murray had during this time tried his best to reconcile the differences which were constantly breaking out between that general the prince and the clique who surrounded him it was a difficult task for lord georges impetuosity and outspoken brusqueness and his unconcealed contempt for secretary murray and sheridan reopened the breach as fast as it was closed  since the day when he had saved the prince from being carried off at glasgow the latter had shown a marked partiality for ronalds society and the latter had therefore many opportunities of intervening to prevent open quarrels from breaking out the prince himself was frequently greatly depressed in spirits and the light hearted gaiety which had distinguished him on the first landing was now fitful and short lived his disappointment at the failure of a campaign in which he had won every battle was deep and bitter he had relied upon the aid of france but no aid had come he had been grossly misinformed as to the willingness of the jacobites of england to take up arms in his favour and although a portion of the highlanders of scotland had warmly embraced his cause yet many on whom he had relied stood aloof or were in arms against him while in the lowlands he had found but few adherents  so far from gaining ground he was losing it numbers of the highlanders had gone off to their homes the retreat from derby had completely chilled the enthusiasm of his adherents while the waverers and time servers had been induced thereby to declare against him the duke of cumberlands army steadily increased and even had the advice of the highland chiefs been followed and the army dispersed to reassemble in the spring the chances of success would have been no more favourable than at present for now that the first surprise and panic were past england would put forth her whole strength and would by the spring have an army assembled in scotland against which the highland clans even if unanimous could not hope to cope  ronald was perfectly alive to the hopelessness of final success he had seen the british infantry at dettingen and fontenoy and felt sure that although the wild highland rush had at first proved irresistible this could nor continue and that discipline and training must eventually triumph over mere valour when he and malcolm talked the matter over together they agreed that there could be but one issue to the struggle and that ruin and disaster must fall upon all who had taken part in the enterprise  i feel thankful indeed ronald said one day that i am here only as a private gentleman risking my own life i do not know what my feelings would be if like these highland chiefs i had brought all my kinsmen and followers with me into the field the thought of the ruin and misery which would fall upon them would be dreadful i fear that the vengeance which will be taken after this is over will be far greater and more widespread than that which followed 15 all say that the duke of cumberland is brutal and pitiless and the fact that we were nearly successful will naturally add to the severity with which the english government will treat us if we fall into their power had the enterprise been defeated at its commencement they could have afforded to be lenient as it is i fear that they will determine to teach the highlands such a lesson as will ensure their never again venturing to rise in arms against the house of hanover  and i dont know that they are altogether to be blamed malcolm said i am not so young as i was ronald and i see now that i was wrong in teaching you to be a jacobite it is all very well for men like tullibardine who knew the stuarts on the throne to fight to put them back again but to your generation ronald the stuarts are after all only a tradition and it is a sort of generous madness for you to risk your life to set them again on the throne of england it cannot matter a brass pin to you whether james or george rules at st jamess it is not as in the case of the royalists in england in charless time or of the covenanters of scotland that a great principle is involved  a principle for which men may well risk their lives and all they hold dear it is a question of persons only and although i may hold that by right of descent charles edward is prince of wales and rightful heir to the throne of england that is no reason why i should risk my life to place him there and after all it seems to me that if the majority in these islands determine that they will be ruled by the house of hanover instead of the house of stuart they have some right to make their own choice  you argue like a philosopher malcolm ronald said laughing and do not remind me in the slightest degree of the malcolm who used to chat with me in glasgow  you are right there lad you see i was brought up a jacobite and i have been a soldier all my life accustomed to charge when i was told to charge and to kill those i was told to kill but i own that since i have been out now i have got to look at matters differently the sight of all these poor highland bodies blindly following their chiefs and risking life and all for a cause in which they have no shadow of interest has made me think a soldier is a soldier and if he were to sit down to argue about the justice of every cause in which he is ordered to fight there would be an end to all discipline but these poor fellows are not soldiers and so i say to myself what concern have they in this matter their chiefs would gain honours and rewards patents of high nobility and additions to their estates if the stuarts conquered but their followers would gain nothing whatever no lad if we get over this scrape i have done with fighting and i hope that no stuart will ever again succeed in getting scotland to take up his cause i shall go on fighting for prince charles as long as there is a man left with him but after that there is an end of it as far as i am concerned and i hope as far as scotland is concerned  i hope so too malcolm when scotland is herself divided ireland passive and all england hostile success is hopeless the stuarts will never get such another chance again as they had on the day when we turned our backs on london at derby and i hope that they will not again make the attempt especially as it is manifest now that france has only used them as tools against england and has no idea of giving them any effectual aid  charles on approaching inverness found it toughly fortified and held by lord loudon with a force of two thousand men the prince halted ten miles from the town at moy castle where he was entertained by lady mintosh whose husband was serving with lord loudon but who had raised the clan for prince charles the prince had but a few personal attendants with him the army having been halted at some distance from the castle  one evening ronald had ridden over to moy castle with some despatches from lord george murray to the prince and had remained there to dine with him it was late before he mounted his horse he was as usual accompanied by malcolm they had ridden but a short distance through the wood which surrounded the castle when a shot was fired and almost immediately afterwards four or five men came running through the trees  what is the matter malcolm shouted  the english army are upon us one of the mintoshes  for they were clansmen who had been sleeping in the wood  answered  they must intend to seize the prince ronald said and will already have sent round a body of horse to cut off his retreat scatter through the wood men and do each of you raise the war cry of one of the clans as if the whole army were here this may cause a delay and enable the prince to ride off malcolm do you ride back with all speed to the castle and warn the prince of loudons approach  the highlanders at once obeyed ronalds orders and in a minute or two the war cries of half a dozen of the principal clans in prince charless army rang through the woods while at the same time the highlanders discharged their muskets ronald also shouted orders as to a large body of men  the english who had made sure of effecting a successful surprise hesitated as they heard the war cries of the clans ringing through the woods and believing that the whole of prince charless army were at hand and they were about to be attacked in overwhelming numbers they retreated hastily to inverness no sooner had ronald discovered that they had fallen back than he rode off to inform the prince that the danger was over  he found prince charles mounted with lady mintosh on horseback by his side and the retainers in the castle gathered round broadsword in hand in readiness to cut their way through any body of the enemys horse who might intercept their retreat charles laughed heartily when he heard of the strategy which ronald had employed to arrest the advance of the enemy and thanked him for again having saved him from falling into the hands of the enemy  the english made their retreat to inverness in such confusion and dismay that the affair became known in history as the rout of moy  the next morning the 17th of february the prince called up his army and the next day advanced against inverness lord loudon did not await his coming the panic of his soldiers two days before showed him that no reliance could be placed upon them and embarking with them in boats he crossed the moray frith to cromarty where the troops shortly afterwards disbanded upon hearing that the earl of cromarty was marching against them with some highland regiments  the town of inverness was occupied at once and the citadel surrendered in a few days the army now in a barren and mountainous region were deprived of all resources many ships with supplies were sent off from france but few of them reached their destination several being captured by british cruisers and others compelled to go back to french ports  the supply of money in the treasury was reduced to the lowest ebb and charles was obliged to pay his troops in meal and even this was frequently deficient and the men suffered severely from hunger many deserted and others scattered over the country in search of subsistence  in the meantime the duke of cumberlands army was receiving powerful reinforcements in february prince frederick of hesse cassel with five thousand of his troops who had been hired by the british government landed at leith these troops were placed in garrison in all the towns in the south of scotland thus enabling the duke of cumberland to draw together the whole of the english forces for his advance into the highlands  on the 8th of april he set out from aberdeen with eight thousand foot and nine hundred horse he marched along the coast accompanied by the fleet which landed supplies as needed at the spey lord john drummond had prepared to defend the fords and some works had been thrown up to protect them but the english cannon were brought up in such numbers that lord john considering the position untenable retired to inverness while the english army forded the spey and on the 14th entered nairn where some skirmishing took place between their advance guard and the highland rear  prince charles and his principal officers rested that night at culloden house and the troops lay upon the adjacent moor on the morning of the 15th they drew up in order of battle the english however rested for the day at nairn and there celebrated the duke of cumberlands birthday with much feasting abundant supplies being landed from the fleet  the highlanders on the other hand fasted only one biscuit per man being issued during the day consequently many straggled away to inverness and other places in search of food lord cromarty with the regiments under his command were absent so that barely five thousand men were mustered in the ranks at a council of war lord george murray suggested that a night surprise should be made on the dukes camp at nairn and as this was the princes own plan it was unanimously agreed to  before however the straggling troops could be collected it was eight oclock at night nairn was twelve miles distant and the men weakened by privation and hunger marched so slowly across the marshy ground that it was two oclock in the morning before the head of the columns arrived within four miles of the british camp while the rear was still far away and many had dropped out of the ranks from fatigue  it was now too late to hope that a surprise could be effected before daylight and the army retraced its steps to culloden moor worn out and exhausted as they were and wholly without supplies of provisions lord george murray and the other military officers felt that the troops could not hope to contend successfully against a vastly superior army fresh well fed and supported by a strong force of artillery on the open ground and he proposed that the army should retire beyond the river bairn and take up a position there on broken ground inaccessible to cavalry  the prince however supported by sir thomas sheridan and his other evil advisers overruled the opinion of the military leaders and decided to fight on level ground the highlanders were now drawn up in order of battle in two lines on the right were the athole brigade the camerons the stuarts and some other clans under lord george murray on the left the macdonald regiments under lord john drummond this arrangement unfortunately caused great discontent among the macdonalds just as their being given the post of honour at falkirk had given umbrage to the other clans  at eleven oclock the english army was seen approaching it was formed in three lines with cavalry on each wing and two pieces of cannon between every two regiments of the first line the battle began with an artillery duel but in this the advantage was all on the side of the english the number of their pieces and the skill of their gunners being greatly superior  prince charles rode along the front line to animate his men and as he did so several of his escort were killed by the english cannonade a storm of snow and hail had set in blowing full in the face of the highlanders at length lord george murray finding that he was suffering heavily from the enemys artillery fire while his own guns inflicted but little damage upon them sent to prince charles for permission to charge  on receiving it he placed himself at the head of his men and with the whole of the right wing and centre charged the enemy they were received with a tremendous musketry fire while the english artillery swept the ranks with grape but so furious was their onslaught that they broke through munro and burrels regiments in the first line and captured two pieces of cannon but behind were the second line drawn up three deep with the front rank kneeling and these reserving their fire until the highlanders were close at hand opened a rolling fire so sustained and heavy that the highlanders were thrown into complete disorder  before they could recover themselves they were charged by horse and foot on both flanks and driven together till they became a confused mass in vain did their chiefs attempt to rally them exhausted and weakened in body swept by the continuous fire of the english they could do no more and at last broke and fled in the meantime the macdonalds on the left remained inactive in vain lord john drummond and the duke of perth called upon them to charge in vain their chief keppoch rushed forward with a few of his clansmen and died in front of them nothing would induce them to fight and when the right and centre were defeated they fell back in good order and joining the remnants of the second line retired from the field unbroken  charles from the heights on which he stood with a squadron of horse could scarce believe the evidence of his eyes when he saw the hitherto victorious highlanders broken and defeated and would have ridden down himself to share their fate had not osullivan and sheridan seized his horse by the bridle and forced him from the field being pressed by the english the retreating force broke into two divisions the smaller retreated to inverness where they next day laid down their arms to the duke of cumberland the other still preserving some sort of order marched by way of ruthven to badenoch  fourteen colours two thousand three hundred muskets and all their cannon fell into the hands of the english the loss of the victors in killed and wounded amounted to three hundred and ten men that of the highlanders to a thousand no quarter was given to the stragglers and fugitives who fell into the hands of the english their wounded were left on the ground till the following day without care or food and the greater portion of them were then put to death in cold blood with a cruelty such as never before or since disgraced an english army  some were beaten to death by the soldiers with the stocks of their muskets some were dragged out from the thicket or caverns to which they had crawled and shot while one farm building in which some twenty wounded men had taken refuge was deliberately set on fire and burned with them to the ground in any case such conduct as this would have inflicted eternal discredit upon those who perpetrated it but it was all the more unjustifiable and abominable after the extreme clemency and kindness with which prince charles had throughout the campaign treated all prisoners who fell into his hands  ronald had ridden close beside lord george murray as he led the highlanders to the charge but he had as they approached the first english line received a ball in the shoulder while almost at the same instant malcolms horse was shot under him ronald reeled in the saddle and would have fallen had not malcolm extricated himself from his fallen horse and run up to him  where are you hit lad he asked in extreme anxiety  in the shoulder malcolm help me off my horse and do you take it and go on with the troops  i shall do nothing of the kind malcolm said one man will make no difference to them and i am going to look after you  so saying he sprang up behind ronald and placing one arm round him to support him took the reins in the other and rode to the rear he halted on rising ground and for a short time watched the conflict  the battle is lost he said at last lord georges troops are in utter confusion the macdonalds show no signs of moving though i can see their officers are urging them to charge now ronald the first thing is to get you out of this and beyond the reach of pursuit  so saying he turned the horse and rode away from the field of battle  does your shoulder hurt much he asked after they had gone a short distance  it does hurt abominably ronald said faintly for he was feeling almost sick from the agony he was suffering from the motion of the horse  i am a fool malcolm said not to have seen to it before we started i cant do much now but at least i can fasten it so as to hurt you as little as possible  he took off his scarf and telling ronald to place his arm in the position which was most comfortable to him he bound it tightly against his body  that is better is it not he asked as he again set the horse in motion  much better malcolm i feel that i can go on now whereas before i could not have gone much further if all cumberlands cavalry had been close behind how far are you thinking of going i dont think my horse can carry double much further poor beast he has had as short rations as his master and was on the move all last night  no but we shall not have to make a very long journey the english marched twelve miles before they attacked us and i do not think they are likely to closely pursue far tonight besides i have no intention of riding now that there is no fear of immediate pursuit i think that in another two miles we shall be safe from any fear of the english cavalry overtaking us for we shall then reach a forest once in that we shall be safe from pursuit and shall soon be in the heart of the hills  on reaching the forest malcolm dismounted and leading the horse turned off from the road following a little trodden path they were soon in the heart of the forest and after keeping on for two hours and crossing several hills he stopped by the side of a stream  we are perfectly safe here he said and can sleep as securely as if we were in a palace  the saddle was taken off and the horse turned loose to graze malcolm then removed ronalds coat and shirt bathed the wound for some time with water cut some pieces of wood to act as splints and tearing some strips off his sash bound these tightly  the ball has regularly smashed the bone ronald and we must be careful to keep the shoulder in its proper position or you will never look square again  that does not seem very important to me just at present malcolm  no just at present the most important question is that of getting something to eat we have had nothing today and not much yesterday and now that we are no longer in danger of pursuit one begins to feel one is hungry you stay here while i go and forage there ought to be a village somewhere among the hills nor far away  do you know the country malcolm  i never came by this path lad but i have travelled pretty well all over the highlands and just as you found to be the case in lancashire there are few villages i do not know i will first pull you a couch of this dead bracken and then be off an hours sleep will do you almost as much good as a meal  ronald lay down on the soft couch malcolm prepared for him and before he had been alone for a minute he was fast asleep  the sun was setting when he awoke malcolm stood beside him  here is supper lad not a very grand one but theres enough of it which is more than has been the case for some weeks  so saying he laid down by ronalds side a large loaf of black bread a cheese made of sheeps milk and a bottle of spirits  the village is five miles away which is farther than i expected however i came back quicker than i went for i had had a bowl of milk and as much bread as i could eat i found the place in a state of wild excitement for two or three of the men had just come in from the battlefield and brought the news with them they are all for the stuarts there and you would be well entertained but there is sure to be a search high and low and you would not be safe in any village however a lad has promised to be here in the morning and he will guide us to a lonely hut in the heart of the hills used by the shepherds in summer you will be perfectly safe there  it is about three miles from the village he said so i can go down two or three times a week and get food and learn how things are going on the highlanders may rally again and make another fight of it but i hardly expect they will they are not like regular troops whose home is naturally with their colours and who after the first rout try to rejoin their regiments there is no discipline among these highlanders each man does as he likes and their first impulse after a battle is to make for their homes  if it is a victory to carry home their spoil if they are defeated for rest and shelter at any rate whether they gather again or not you will have to keep perfectly quiet for a time when your shoulder is perfectly healed we can act according to circumstances and make for the army if there be an army or for the seacoast if there is not  although he had eaten but a short time before malcolm was quite ready for another meal and sitting down beside ronald he joined him in his assault upon the black bread and cheese then he collected some more of the bracken mixed himself a strong horn of whiskey and water and a much weaker one for ronald after which the two lay down and were fast asleep  they were awake at sunrise and shortly afterwards the lad whom malcolm had engaged to act as guide made his appearance the horse was saddled ronald mounted and they started at once for their destination among the hills they followed the path which malcolm had taken the afternoon before for some three miles and then struck off to the left half an hour took them out of the forest and they journeyed for an hour along the bare hillsides until lying in a sheltered hollow they saw the hut which was their destination  they are not likely to find us here malcolm said cheerfully even were they to scour the mountains they might ride within fifty yards of this hollow without suspecting its existence where are we to get water he asked the lad in gaelic  a quarter of a mile away over that brow is the head of a stream the lad replied you cannot well miss it  that is all right malcolm said i dont mind carrying up provisions or a bottle of spirits now and then but to drag all the water we want three miles would be serious  the door of the hut was only fastened by a latch and they entered without ceremony it consisted of but a single room there were two or three rough wooden stools and a heap of bracken in one corner nor a large amount of furniture but in the opinion of a highlander amply sufficient  we shall do here capitally malcolm said now what do you think about the horse ronald  of course he might be useful if we were obliged to move suddenly but we have no food to give him and if we let him shift for himself he will wander about and might easily be seen by anyone crossing these hills a horse is always a prize and it might bring troops out into our neighbourhood who would otherwise not have a thought about coming in this direction  i quite agree with you ronald the lad had better take him down to the village and give him to the head man there he can sell him or keep him or get rid of him as he likes at any rate he will be off our hands    chapter xix fugitives   for three weeks ronald and malcolm remained in hiding in the hut among the hills every two or three days malcolm went down to the village and brought back food he learned that the remains of the army at ruthven had entirely dispersed the prince himself seeing the hopelessness of any longer continuing the struggle terrible tales of slaughter and devastation by cumberlands troops circulated through the hills the duke had fixed his headquarters at fort augustus and thence his troops ravaged the whole country of the clans lately in insurrection villages were burned cattle slaughtered women subjected to the grossest insult and ill treatment and often wantonly slain and the fugitives among the mountains hunted like wild beasts and slain as pitilessly whenever overtaken  ronalds arm was healing fast youth and a good constitution and the care and attention of malcolm aided perhaps by the pure mountain air did wonders for him the splints had proved efficacious and although they had not yet been taken off malcolm was confident that the injury would be completely repaired one morning malcolm had left but half an hour for the village when he returned  the enemy are in the village he said i can see clouds of smoke rising in that direction we had better be off at once they will be scouring all the hills here as they have done elsewhere and we had better get out of the neighbourhood  there was no packing to be done and taking with them what remained of the food malcolm had last brought they started on their way they made first for the spring from which they had drawn their water and then followed the little stream on its way down the hill as it flowed in the opposite direction to the village an hours walking took them into the forest  before we go further let us have a consultation malcolm said we are safe now from pursuit and had better settle upon what course we intend to adopt shall we make for glasgow and lie hid there until things blow over a little or make for the isles and stay there until we get a chance of being taken off by some french ship that is what they say the prince has done and indeed as there would be no chance of his getting a ship on the east coast and all the lowlands are against them he is certain to have made for the isles the clanranalds and most of the other islemen are loyal to him and would receive and shelter him skye is hostile but elsewhere he will be safe and would move from island to island or get across to the mainland by night if the pursuit became too hot what do you say ronald  i would not try glasgow unless as a last resource malcolm you are known to many there and as i was there as one of the princes officers on two occasions i might easily be recognized you may be sure that there is a very strict lookout for fugitives and every stranger who enters a town will be closely examined after some time when prince charles and the principal chiefs and the leaders will either have escaped across the water or been hunted down things will calm down but at present we must not try to pass through the lowlands  at any rate we cannot try to do so till your shoulder is completely healed and you can use your arm naturally but i do not think that we had better try and cross to the isles just at present if prince charles is there or is believed by the english to be there the search will be so keen that every stranger would be hunted down and although the highlanders might risk imprisonment and death for the prince himself they could not be expected to run the same risk for anyone else if the prince escapes it will be because the whole population are with him and every man woman and child is trying to throw the pursuers off the scent no i think we should be safer in edinburgh itself than in the isles we will make a shift to live as we can for a month or so by that time i hope you will be able to use one arm as well as the other and we will then boldly go down into the lowlands in our old characters as two drovers  that will be the best plan no doubt ronald agreed the difficulty will be the getting over the next month  we shall manage that malcolm said fortunately you have still got some money left  yes i have over fifty pounds it was lucky i was able to draw it as we returned north from the man i left it with at carlisle  yes and you wanted to give it back to the treasury malcolm said and would have done it if i had not almost quarrelled with you about it saying that it had been given you for a certain purpose that you had carried out that purpose and had therefore a right to it and that you would be only looked upon as a fool if you offered to pay it back however there it is now and lucky it is you have got it however hard the times however great the danger a man will hardly starve in scotland with fifty pounds in his pocket so now we will turn our faces west and make for the head of one of the lochs there are plenty of fish to be had for catching and with them and a little oatmeal and a bottle or two of whiskey we can live like lords  they walked for some hours and stopped for the night in the hut of a shepherd who received them hospitably but could give them but little food his scanty supplies being almost exhausted for as he told them the hills are full of fugitives and those who come all cry for meal as for meat there is no want of it men wont starve as long as there are sheep and cattle to be had for lifting them and at present there are more of these than usual in the hills for they have all been driven up from the villages lest they should fall into the hands of the troopers but meal is scarce for men dare not go down to the villages to buy and we only get it when the women bring it up as they have a chance  in the morning the shepherd gave them directions as to the way they should take and a few hours later they came down upon the head of one of the many deep inlets on the western coast a small fishing boat stood on the shore but they dared not descend into this but made their way to the point where as the shepherd had told them a stream which flowed from a mountain tarn some miles inland made its way down into the sea  the banks were thickly wooded for some two miles from its outlet beyond that was a moorland covered with heather they determined to encamp near the upper edge of the wood and at once set to with their swords to cut down branches and construct a hut this was completed before dusk and malcolm then started for the village on the seashore ronald besought him to be most careful  there is likely he said to be a party of soldiers in every village round the coast for they will know that all the chiefs and officers would be making for the sea the clansmen have only to remain in the hills until this persecution dies out and then go quietly home again but for the leaders the only hope is escape by sea  i will be careful lad malcolm said i shall not enter the village but will hang about in its outskirts until i come across someone and with plenty of money in my pocket it is hard if i cannot manage to get a bag of meal and a net even if the place is full of english soldiers  three hours later malcolm returned laden with a sack containing forty pounds of meal a jar with two gallons of whiskey and a net  there he said as he entered we can do for a month now if needs be there is a party of militia in the village and i hear the whole coast is closely watched and there are a number of english cruisers among the islands  how did you get the things  i waited till a woman came down with a bundle of faggots and told her what i wanted she said at first it was impossible but when i said i was prepared to pay well she altered her tone and said she would send her husband out to me he soon came and after some bargaining he agreed to bring me out the things i wanted for three pounds and here they are i see you have got a fire alight so we will make some cakes at once i have brought a griddle and two horns with me  the next morning they set to work to fish the net was stretched across the lower end of a pool and they then stripped and waded in splashing and throwing stones as they went it was just up to their necks in the deepest parts shallowing to two feet below when they reached the net they found two fine salmon caught there and carrying these ashore they split one and placed it above the fire the net was then removed and in half an hour they were sitting down to a breakfast of grilled salmon and hot oatmeal cakes which ronald thought the most delicious repast he had ever tasted  for three weeks they remained at this spot they were not always alone being sometimes joined for a day or two by other fugitives who like themselves were wandering near the sea coast seeking escape these seldom stayed long for it was felt unsafe to keep in parties of more than two or three at the utmost some of the fugitives were in wretched condition having been wandering among the moors and forests for weeks and as the fishing was very successful ronald and malcolm were able to give them at parting a good supply of smoked salmon and a portion of meal of which malcolm from time to time brought a fresh supply up from the village  the people there knew little of what was passing in the outer world but from the conversation of the soldiers they were sure that prince charles had so far escaped capture and an opinion began to prevail that he had succeeded in making his escape by sea in spite of the vigilance of the english cruisers  by the end of the three weeks even malcolm admitted that ronalds wound was completely cured two large blue scars showed where the bullet had passed through and beneath this could be felt a lump where the broken bone had knitted together and this would in time become as strong as the rest of the shoulder malcolms splints had done their duty and the eye could detect no difference between the level or width of the two shoulders ronald could move his arm freely in all directions and except that he could not at present venture to put any strain upon the arm he might be considered as perfectly cured they determined therefore to continue their way in the first place however it was necessary to procure other clothes for ronald was still in uniform and although malcolms attire was not wholly military it yet differed materially from that of a countryman  we shall have to get other clothes when we get south malcolm said for a highlanders dress would be looked upon with as much suspicion in glasgow as would that uniform of yours but until we get down to the lowlands the native garb will be the best  accordingly he paid another visit to the village and with the utmost difficulty persuaded the man he had before dealt with to bring him two suits of clothes such as were worn by the fishermen there in these although malcolms small stock of gaelic would betray them at once for other than they seemed to the first clansman who might address them they could pass muster with any body of english troops they might meet by the way  before starting they caught and smoked as many salmon as they could carry as the fishermen of the coast were in the habit of exchanging fish for sheep with their inland neighbours they cut each a short pole and slung some fish at each end and then placing it on their shoulder started on their way they kept along the hillside until they struck the track  for it could scarcely be called a road  leading from the village into the interior and then boldly followed this for the difficulty of travelling across the hilly and broken country was so great that they preferred to run the slight extra risk of keeping to the road feeling certain that for the first days march at least their appearance and the fish they carried would answer for themselves with any body of troops they might meet  of this however they did not think there was much chance the authorities would have long since learned the futility of hunting the fugitives among the hills and would be confining their efforts to the sea coast they were now at a considerable distance from the scene of the bloody persecutions of cumberland and hawley and although in other parts of scotland severe measures might be adopted against known adherents of the stuarts it was among the highland clans only that savage and wholesale massacres were being carried into effect  occasionally in the course of the days walk they met with clansmen passing along the road these generally passed with a brief word of greeting in gaelic one or two who stopped to speak recognized at once by malcolms accent that the wayfarers were not what they pretended to be but they asked no questions and with a significant smile and an expression of good wishes went on their way  at the village where they stopped after a long days journey the same line of conduct was observed towards them the inhabitants guessed at once that they were in disguise but the edicts against those who assisted fugitive insurgents were so severe that none made any open sign of their recognition they paid for their nights lodging and food with a portion of their fish which they were indeed glad to get rid of  the next day they resumed their journey and towards sunset arrived at a village where they saw a party of english cavalry who had apparently but just arrived the men were cleaning their horses and an officer was sitting on a bench in front of the principal house in the village for he had already made a close inspection of every house in the village and the angry faces of the women and the sullen looks of a few men there were about showed how they resented the disturbance of their households  it was too late to retreat and malcolm and ronald walked boldly to the public house in the centre of the village the officer at once rose and walked across to him  who are you he asked and where do you come from  malcolm shook his head and said in gaelic  i do not understand english  what fools these people are the officer exclaimed ho within there  the landlady came to the door  do you speak english  i speak a little the woman said  just ask these men who they are and where they come from  the woman asked the question in gaelic and malcolm replied  we are as you see fishermen and we come from huish  as he spoke there was a slight change in the womans face but it passed away and she translated malcolms answer to the officer  but that is forty miles away the officer said what do they do with their fish at this distance from their home  the question being put in gaelic by the woman malcolm replied that owing to the boats being seized by the soldiers and trade being at a standstill they could no longer make a living at home and were therefore on their way to glasgow to ship as sailors they were carrying their fish with them to pay for their food and lodging on the way  the story was probable enough and the officers suspicion was allayed  they are fine looking fellows both of them he said to himself as he returned to his bench father and son i suppose the young one would make a strapping soldier like enough he was at culloden however thank goodness i have no grounds for suspecting or detaining them i am sick of this brutal business of fugitive hunting we are officers and not butchers and this slaying of brave men who have met us fairly in battle is a disgrace to the british name  ronald and malcolm followed the woman into the house  i am ready to buy some of your fish she said in a loud tone of voice in gaelic for there will be many to feed this evening as my house is full of soldiers i cannot take you in but if you like you can sleep in that shed over there i can cook one of your fish for you and let you have some black bread but that is all i can do now how much do you want for the fish  malcolm named a low price and the woman took three or four of the largest for these she offered him the price he had asked he glanced round and seeing that they were not overlooked he shook his head  we dont want money he said we are well provided many thanks for keeping our secret  the woman nodded and without another word the two went out and sat down on a stone bench outside until the landlady brought out a platter with a fish and some black bread this they ate where they sat malcolm then went in to get some tobacco and returned with his pipe alight and sat with ronald watching with apparent interest the operations of the soldiers until night closed in then they retired to the shed the landlady had pointed out and found that a large bundle of freshly gathered rushes had been shaken out to form a bed carrying in their poles with their now diminished load of fish they closed the door and threw themselves down upon the rushes  that has passed off well malcolm said tomorrow we will only go a mile or so out of the village and stop in the first wood we come to and go on at night thirty miles will take us close down to dumbarton and there we must manage to get some fresh clothes  we shall be able to leave our poles behind us ronald said and that will be a comfort although my load of fish was not nearly as heavy as yours still carrying it on one shoulder was no joke and i shall be heartily glad to get rid of it  i shall not be sorry myself malcolm said but there will be no occasion to waste the fish we shall be up and away long before the soldiers are stirring and we may as well hand them over as a present to the landlady  this was done and at an early hour in the morning they were upon the road again after an hours walking they stopped in a wood till evening and then continued on their way until they reached dumbarton where they threw themselves down beside some boats drawn up upon the shore and slept till the morning  they then boldly entered the town and as their garb was similar to that of the men who brought down the fish caught at the villages on the coast no attention whatever was paid to them they had no difficulty in purchasing the clothes they required and carrying them out of the town they changed in the first retired spot they reached and as two lowland drovers tramped on to glasgow with their bonnets pulled well down over their eyes they entered the town they had little fear of discovery for none would be likely to recognize in ronald the gaily dressed young officer of prince charles  as to malcolm he felt safe from molestation he was of course known to many drovers and others but they would not concern themselves with what he had been doing since they last saw him and even had they noticed him when he was there with ronald would not denounce an old comrade he went therefore boldly to the little inn where he had been in the habit of staying when in the city  ah malcolm is that you man the landlord said as he entered i didna think o seeing you again i thought it likely ye were laying stiff and stark somewhere out on the muirs eh man you are a foolish fellow to be mixing yourself up in the affairs of ithers  i have done with it now jock for good and all malcolm said and am going back to my old trade again  i think you are a fule to come back here so soon theres mony a one marked ye as ye rode in behind that young officer of the princes and if they denounce you now they would soon clap you in between four walls  hoots man malcolm laughed who would trouble themselves about a body like me  there are bleudy doings up i the highlands the landlord said gravely if a they say is true  it is true jock more shame to them but they wouldnt do in glasgow what they are doing there they are hunting down the clansmen like wild beasts but here in the lowlands they will not trouble themselves to ask who was for king george and who was against him except among those who have got estates they can confiscate  may be no the landlord replied still malcolm if you will take my advice you wont show yourself much in the streets nor your friend either he added significantly you may be safe but the citizens are smarting yet over the requisitions that were made upon them and your friend had best keep in his room as long as ye stay here  malcolm nodded  he will be careful jock never fear we shall be off again as soon as we get a chance i will leave him here while i go down the town and find whether there is a herd starting for england if there is we will go with it if not i shall try and get a passage by sea  malcolm could not hear of any drove of cattle going south the troubles had for the time entirely put a stop to the trade after it was dark he went to andrews his brothers face expressed both pleasure and dismay at seeing him  right glad i am to see you have got safely through it all malcolm but you must be mad to show yourself here again at present but how is the boy we have troubled sorely over him i trust that he too has come safely through it  safe and sound andrew save that he had a bullet through his shoulder at culloden but he is tight enough again now  and what have you been doing ever since  curing his shoulder and fishing malcolm briefly related their adventures since culloden  and is he with you here in glasgow malcolm surely you are not mad enough to bring him here where he is known to scores of people as one of the rebel officers  he is here sure enough malcolm said and safer than he has been for some time it is nearly two months since culloden and people are beginning to think of other things except in the highlands where those fiends cumberland and hawley are burning and slaying ronald is dressed like a drover and no one is likely to recognize him however he will remain within doors and now brother i want you to take us a passage in the next vessel sailing for london if i go to a shipper he may ask questions and like enough it may be necessary to get passes signed before we can go on board  certainly it is andrew said a strict lookout is kept to prevent the rebel leaders from escaping and no captain of a ship is permitted to take a passenger unless he is provided with a pass signed by a magistrate saying that he is a peaceable and well known person  but just at present we are both peaceable persons andrew and we can certainly claim to be well known citizens  it is no joking matter malcolm i can tell you andrew said irritably but of course i will see what i can do and now i will put on my bonnet and come with you and have a chat with ronald it will not do to bring him here tonight but we must arrange for him to come and see janet before he sails i shall not tell her anything about it till he is ready to start for you know she is very particular and i am afraid i shall have to say what is not quite true to get the order i can sign it myself but it must have the signature of the provost too  so saying he took his cap and accompanied malcolm to the lodging  stay here a moment andrew malcolm said when he arrived within a few yards of the little inn i will see that there is no one drinking within it wouldna look well to see a decent bailie of the city going into a liquor shop after dark it will be best for me to fetch him out here for i doubt theres any room where you could talk without fear of being overheard  ronald who was sitting with his cap pulled down over his eyes as if asleep in a corner of the room where three or four drovers were smoking and talking was called out by malcolm  i am right glad to see you again andrew anderson said heartily janet and i have passed an ill time since the battle was fought elspeth has kept up our hopes all along she said she was sure that you were alive quite downright sure and though neither janet nor i have much faith in superstitions the old womans assertions that she should assuredly know it if you were dead did somehow keep up our spirits besides i had faith in malcolms knowledge of the country and knew you were both famous for getting into scrapes and out of them so i thought that if neither bullet nor sabre had stretched you on the moor of culloden you would manage to win your way out of the trouble somehow however i think you are pretty safe here the bloody doings of cumberland have shocked every scotchman and even those who were strongest against the stuarts now cry shame and so strong is the feeling that were the prince to appear now with a handful of followers i believe the whole country would rise in his favour so deep is the wrath and grief at the red slaughter among the highlands there would not be many scotchmen found who would betray a fellow scot into the hands of these butchers i will make inquiry tomorrow as to what ships are sailing and will get you a passage in the first there may be some difficulty about the permit but if i cant get over it we must smuggle you on board as sailors however i dont think the provost will ask me any questions when i lay the permit before him for his signature he is heart and soul for the king but like us all he is sick at heart at the news from the north and would i think shut an eye if he saw a jacobite making his escape and now lad i must be going back for the hour is getting late and janet does not know why i am away come to us tomorrow evening as soon as the shop closes janet and elspeth will be delighted to see you and we will have a long talk over all that you have gone through  on the following evening ronald and malcolm presented themselves at andrews and were received with delight by elspeth and mrs anderson the latter had while the rebellion appeared to have a chance of success been its bitter opponent and had spoken often and wrathfully against her husbands brother and ronald embarking in such an enterprise but with its overthrow all her enmity had expired and she would have been ready to give assistance not only to them but to any other fugitive trying to escape  i have good news for you andrew said when the first greetings were over a vessel sails in the morning and i have taken passages for you in it and what is more have brought your permits i went to the provost and said to him provost i want you to sign these permits for two friends of mine who are wanting to go up to london  who are they said he  they are just two drover bodies i said he looked at me hard  one question andrew i know how you feel just at present you are a loyal man like myself but we all feel the same i will sign your permit for any save one give me your word that neither of these men is charles stuart i care not who they may be beside but as a loyal subject of king george i cannot aid his arch enemy to escape  i give you my word provost i said one is   i dont want to know who they are he interrupted i had rather not know it is enough for me that you give me your word that neither of them is charles stuart and he took the pen and signed the permit between ourselves he went on i shall be glad to hear that the misguided young man is safe across the water but as provost of glasgow i could lend him no help to go  they say he has got safe away already i said  i think not andrew the coast has been too closely watched for that the young man is hiding somewhere among the isles among the clanranalds or macdonalds i fear they will have him yet i dread every day to get the news but i hope beyond all things that if they do lay hands on him it will be through the treachery of no scot  i hope not provost i said they havent got over throwing it in our teeth that we sold king charles to cromwell so we just shook hands and said goodbye and here is the permit  they spent a long evening talking over the past  i wonder if i shall ever see you again ronald mrs anderson said with tears in her eyes as they rose to say goodbye  you need nor fear about that janet woman her husband said ronald and malcolm aye fall on their legs and we shall see them back again like two bad pennies besides he went on more seriously there will be an end of these savage doings in the north before long loyal men in scotland are crying out everywhere against them and the feeling in england will be just as strong when the truth is known there and you will see that before long there will be a general pardon granted to all except the leaders fortunately ronald and malcolm are not likely to be in the list of exceptions and before a year is up they will be able to come back if they will without fear of being tapped on the shoulder by a kings officer  i shall come back again if i can you may be sure ronald said of course i do not know yet what my father and mothers plans may be but for myself i shall always look upon scotland as my home and come back to it as soon as i have an opportunity  you do not intend to stay in the french army  certainly not after the treatment my father has received i have no inclination to serve france the chief reason why scotchmen have entered her service has been that they were driven from home and that they looked to france for aid to place the stuarts on the throne again now that the time has come france has done nothing to aid and has seen the stuart cause go down without striking a blow to assist it i consider that cause is lost for ever and shall never again draw my sword against the house of hanover nor have i had any reason for loving france after living in a free country like scotland who could wish to live in a country where one mans will is all powerful  where the people are still no better than serfs  where the nobles treat the law as made only for them  where as in my fathers case a man may not even marry according to his own will without incurring the risk of a lifes imprisonment no i have had enough of france and if ever i get the opportunity i shall return to scotland to live  the next morning early ronald and malcolm embarked on board a ship their permits were closely scrutinized before the vessel started and a thorough search was made before she was allowed to sail when the officers were satisfied that no fugitives were concealed on board they returned to shore and the vessel started on her voyage for london    chapter xx happy days   on arriving in london after ten days voyage ronald and malcolm obtained garments of the ordinary cut the one attired himself as an english gentleman the other in a garb suitable to a confidential attendant or steward and after a stay of two or three days they made their way by coach down to southampton  here they remained for a week and then effected a bargain with the captain of a fishing lugger to set them on shore in france as the two countries were at war this could only be done by landing them at night at some quiet spot on the french coast the lugger cruised about a couple of days and then choosing a quiet night when there was a mist on the water she ran in as closely as she dared then the boat was lowered and malcolm and ronald were rowed to shore and landed a few miles south of boulogne  when it was light they made their way to a village here but few questions were asked them for many refugees from scotland and england were crossing to france as they had been well provided with funds by andrew they posted to paris and on arriving there put up at the inn where they had stopped on the occasion of their first visit  we must be careful malcolm said how we stir out until we know how things stand the first thing to do is to find out whether the regiment is still in paris  this they were not long in doing as their host was able to inform them at once that it had left the capital several months before and on comparing dates they found that its departure had followed within a day or two that of their own flight from paris  it was no doubt meant as a punishment ronald said on colonel hume for acting as my second in that affair with the duke i hope that no further ill befell him  his mind was set easy on this score by the news that colonel hume had accompanied his regiment on asking after marshal saxe they learned that he was away on the frontier where he had been carrying on the war with great success antwerp mons namur and charleroi all having been captured  the king was in person with the army this being the case ronald saw that it was of no use remaining in paris as he was without friend or protector there and he dared not rejoin his regiment until he learned whether the kings anger was as hot as ever he therefore started at once with malcolm and travelled down to la grenouille  it was a joyful meeting between him and his parents who were in the greatest anxiety respecting him for although he had written several times communication was uncertain owing to the war the only chance of sending letters being by such french vessels as arrived at scottish ports after running the gauntlet with english cruisers some of these had been captured on the way back and only two of ronalds letters had arrived safely the last of these had been written a few days after the battle of falkirk and ronald had then stated that he no longer had any hope of the final success of the expedition they had received the news of the defeat at culloden and had since passed nearly three months of painful suspense relieved only by the arrival of ronald himself he found his mother looking well and happy his father had somewhat recovered from his rheumatism and looked a younger man by some years than when he saw him last  he will recover fast now the countess said but he has worried about you night and day ronald i hope that you will stay with us for a time we have seen so little of you yet  ronald learned that a few days after his flight an officer had appeared at the chateau with the royal order for his arrest and it was from him that his parents had first learned the news of his duel with the duke of chateaurouge and its result  i could hardly believe my ears ronald his father said to think that my son scarce a man yet should have killed in fair fight one of the first duellists in france it seemed almost incredible malcolm told me that you were a first rate swordsman but this seemed extraordinary indeed the officer remained here for three days and then convinced that you had not made in this direction left us a day or two afterwards we received the letter you wrote us from nantes saying that you were starting for scotland with the prince i grumbled sorely over my rheumatism i can tell you which prevented my drawing my sword once more for the stuarts but it was no use my thinking of it  no indeed the countess said and i can tell you ronald that had he been ever so well i should not have let him go after being separated from ones husband for sixteen years one is not going to let him run off to figure as a knight errant at his pleasure  your friend colonel hume wrote to us the colonel said with a smile at his wifes word giving us details of the duel and speaking of your conduct in the highest terms he said that at present the king was furious but that he hoped in time he would get over it colonel hume had seen marshal saxe who had promised on the first opportunity to speak to the king and to open his eyes to the character of his late favourite and to tell him of the attempts which the duke had made to prevent the royal orders for our release being carried out and to remove you by assassination two months ago he wrote again to us from antwerp which had just fallen saying that marshal saxe had bid him tell us that the king was in a much more favourable disposition and that he had taken the opportunity when his majesty was in a good humour to tell him the whole circumstances of your journey with the orders for our release and that in consequence the king had made other inquiries respecting the late duke and had acknowledged that he had been greatly deceived as to his character at the same time as your name had been by the kings order removed from the list of officers of the scottish dragoons immediately after the duel he recommended that should you return to france you should not put yourself in the kings way or appear at all in public for the present  the marshal colonel hume wrote has made your affair a personal matter and he as is his habit in war will persevere until he succeeds his reputation and influence are higher than ever and are daily rising be assured that when the campaign is over and he reaps all the honours to which he is entitled he will push your claim as before  in the first week in october the suspense from which they had suffered as to the fate of prince charles was relieved by the news that on the 29th of september he had safely landed at the little port of roscoff near morlaix he made his way to paris and ronald accompanied by malcolm took horse at once and rode there to pay his respects to the prince and congratulate him on his escape the prince received him with great warmth and cordiality and from his own lips ronald learned the story of his adventures  he had eight days after culloden embarked for the cluster of islets to which the common name of long island is applied after wandering from place to place and suffering greatly from hunger he gained south uist where his wants were relieved by clanranald the english suspecting or learning that he was there landed two thousand men on the island and commenced an active search for him he must have been detected had not flora macdonald  stepdaughter of a captain in a militia regiment which formed part of the troops who had landed  upon being appealed to by lady clanranald nobly undertaken to save him  she obtained from her stepfather a passport to proceed to skye with a manservant and a maid charles was dressed in female clothes and passed as betty bourk while a faithful highlander neil meachan acted as her servant they started at night in an open boat and disembarked in skye skye was ever a hostile country as its chief sir alexander macdonald who had at first wavered was now a warm supporter of the hanoverians and was with the duke of cumberland nevertheless flora appealed to his wife lady margaret a daughter of the earl of eglinton and informed her that her attendant was prince charles in disguise lady margaret nobly responded to her appeal her own house was full of militia officers and she intrusted charles to the charge of macdonald of kingsburgh her husbands kinsman and factor who took the party to his house  the next day charles took leave of flora macdonald with warm expressions of gratitude and passed over to the isle of rasay in the disguise of a male servant thence he made his way to the mainland where on landing he was compelled to lie in concealment for two days cooped up within a line of sentries after many dangers he took refuge in a mountain cave inhabited by seven robbers who treated him with the greatest kindness and supplied his wants for the three weeks he remained with them after many other adventures he joined his faithful adherents cluny and locheil who were in hiding in a retreat on the side of mount benalder and here he lived in comparative comfort until he heard that two french vessels under the direction of colonel warren of dillons regiment had anchored in lochnanuagh  travelling by night he made his way to that place and embarked on the 20th of september attended by locheil colonel roy stuart and about a hundred other fugitives who had learned of the arrival of the french vessels it was almost precisely the spot at which he had disembarked fourteen months before a fog concealed the vessel as she passed through the british fleet lying to intercept her and they reached roscoff after a nine days voyage  such was the tale which prince charles told to ronald he had after culloden entirely recovered his high spirits and had borne all his fatigues and hardships with the greatest cheerfulness and good humour making light of hunger fatigue and danger ronald only remained two days in paris and then returned home  in october the campaign of flanders ended with the complete defeat of prince charles of lorraine at rancaux and marshal saxe returned to paris where he was received with enthusiasm by the population the royal residence of chambord was granted him for life and he was proclaimed marshal general of the kings armies a fortnight later colonel leslie received a letter from him saying that he had received his majestys command that he with the countess and his son should present themselves in paris and that he was happy to say that the kings disposition was most favourable they set off at once on their arrival there they called upon marshal saxe who greeted the colonel as an old friend and refused to listen to the warm expression of gratitude of leslie and the countess  say nothing about it madam he exclaimed your son won my heart and i was only too glad to be of service to him and my old comrade here what is the use of a man winning victories if he cannot lend a helping hand to his friends  the next day they went down to versailles where marshal saxe presented them to the king in a private audience louis received them graciously  i fear countess that you and your husband have been treated with some harshness but our royal ear was deceived by one in whom we had confidence your husband and yourself were wrong in marrying without the consent and against the will of your father and such marriages cannot be permitted but at the request of marshal saxe who has done so much for france that i cannot refuse anything he asks i have now consented to pardon and overlook the past and have ordered my chancellor to prepare an order reinstating you in all the possessions and estates of the countess your mother i hope that i shall often see you together with your husband and son both of whom have done good service as soldiers of france at my court and now that i see you he said with a gracious smile i cannot but feel how great a loss our court has suffered by your long absence from it  upon leaving the kings private chamber and entering the great audience hall colonel hume came up and grasped the hand of his old friend and was introduced by him to his wife while many of the courtiers who were either connections or friends of the family of the countess also gathered round them for the news that she was restored to royal favour had spread quickly the countess knew how small was the real value of such advances but she felt that it was best for her husband and sons sake to receive them amicably for a few weeks they remained in paris taking part in the brilliant fetes which celebrated the success of the french arms and they then retired to the handsome chateau which was now the property of the countess  here they lived quietly for two years making occasional visits to paris at the end of that time ronald received a letter from andrew anderson to whom he had written several times since his return to france he told him that he had just heard that glenlyon and the rest of the property which had been confiscated after the rising of 1715 was for sale it had been bestowed upon a neighbouring chief who had been active in the hanoverian cause he was now dead without leaving issue and his wife an english lady was anxious to dispose of the property and return to england  i do not know whether your father is disposed to buy back his estates andrew wrote but i hear that a general amnesty will very shortly be issued to all who took part in the insurrection saving only certain notorious persons the public are sick of bloodshed there have been upwards of eighty trials and executions besides the hundreds who were slaughtered in the highlands besides this thousands have been transported but public opinion is now so strong and persons of all shades of politics are so disgusted with the brutal ferocity which has been shown that it is certain government will ere long be compelled to pass an act of amnesty in the meantime if it should be your fathers wish to purchase the property i can buy it in my name the priced asked is very low the income arising from it is stated to be about four hundred a year and four thousand pounds will be accepted for it i understand that as the late owner took no part in the insurrection and joined the duke of cumberland when he came north the property is in good condition and the clansmen have escaped the harrying which befell all those who sided with charles stuart  ronald at once laid the letter before his father who after reading it through passed it without a word to the countess  you would like to return to scotland she asked quietly when she read it do not hesitate to tell me dear if you would it is no matter to me whether we live there or here so long as i have you and ronald with me  colonel leslie was silent  for ronalds sake she went on perhaps it would be better so you are both of opinion that the cause of the stuarts is lost for ever and he is determined that he will never again take part in any rising he does not care again to enter the french army nor indeed is there any reason why scotchmen should do so now that they no longer look for the aid of the king of france to set the stuarts on the english throne i myself have no ties here my fifteen years of seclusion have separated me altogether from my family and although they are willing enough to be civil now i cannot forget that all those years they did nothing towards procuring our liberty the king has so far given way that he has restored me my mothers estates but it was only because he could not refuse marshal saxe and he does not like french lands to be held by strangers therefore i feel sure that were i to ask his permission to sell my estates and to retire with you to scotland he would at once grant my request  no amelie it would not be fair to accept your generous offer  but it would be no sacrifice she urged i have little reason to love france and i can assure you i should be just as happy in your country as in my own  but it would be exile the colonel said  no more exile than you and ronald are suffering here besides i suppose we should get as many comforts in scotland as here in france of course our estates here will fetch a sum many times larger than that which would purchase glenlyon and we need not live all our time among the mountains you tell me of but can go sometimes to edinburgh or even to london even if you did not wish it i should say it would be far better to do so for ronalds sake you have lived so long in france that you may have become a frenchman but it is not so with ronald  it was not until two or three days later that the discussion came to an end and the countess had her way colonel leslie had resisted stoutly but his heart beat at the thought of returning to the home of his youth and ending his days among the clansmen who had followed him and his fathers before him ronald had taken no part whatever in the debate but his mother read in his eyes the delight which the thought of returning to scotland occasioned him as soon as this was settled they went to paris and as the countess had foreseen the king was pleased at once to give his consent to her disposing of her lands on his approval of the purchaser  no difficulty was experienced on this score as a noble whose lands adjoined her own offered at once to purchase them as soon as this was arranged instructions were sent to andrew to purchase not only the glenlyon property but the other estates of its late owner  in due time a letter was received from andrew saying that he had arranged for the purchase of the whole for the sum of thirteen thousand pounds and the money was at once sent over through a dutch banking house very shortly afterwards at the end of 1747 the act of general amnesty was passed and as ronalds name was not among those excluded from its benefits they at once prepared to return to scotland the journey was facilitated by the fact that shortly after the passing of the act peace was concluded between england and france  accompanied by malcolm colonel leslie the countess and ronald sailed for scotland the colonel and his wife remained in edinburgh while ronald and malcolm went to glasgow where andrew had in readiness all the papers transferring the estates purchased in his name to colonel leslie who shortly afterwards journeyed north with his wife and son and took possession of his ancestral home amid the enthusiastic delight of the clansmen who had never ceased to regret the absence of him whom they considered as their rightful chief  there is little more to tell colonel leslie lived but a few years after returning home and ronald then succeeded him as leslie of glenlyon he had before this married the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman and passed his time between glenlyon and edinburgh varied by an occasional visit to london  the countess never regretted her native land but happy in the affection of her son and daughter in law and their children lived happily with them until nearly the end of the century malcolm remained the faithful and trusty friend of the family and his brother and his wife were occasionally persuaded to pay a visit to glenlyon where their kindness to ronald as a child was never forgotten happily the rising of 45 was the last effort on behalf of the stuarts scotland accepted the decision as final and the union between the two countries became close and complete henceforth scotchmen went no longer to fight in the armies of france but took service in that of their own country and more than one of ronalds grandsons fought stoutly in spain under wellington
