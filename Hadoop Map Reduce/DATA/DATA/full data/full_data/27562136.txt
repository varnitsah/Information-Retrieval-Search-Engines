twain      seventieth birthday     introduction  these speeches will address themselves to the minds and hearts of those who read them but not with the effect they had with those who heard them clemens himself would have said not with half the effect i have noted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value of the authors words and he was a great actor as well as a great author he was a most consummate actor with this difference from other actors that he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the fancies to which his voice and action gave the color of life representation is the art of other actors his art was creative as well as representative it was nothing at second hand  i never heard clemens speak when i thought he quite failed some burst or spurt redeemed him when he seemed flagging short of the goal and whoever else was in the running he came in ahead his nearfailures were the error of a rare trust to the spontaneity in which other speakers confide or are believed to confide when they are on their feet he knew that from the beginning of oratory the orators spontaneity was for the silence and solitude of the closet where he mused his words to an imagined audience that this was the use of orators from demosthenes and cicero up and down he studied every word and syllable and memorized them by a system of mnemonics peculiar to himself consisting of an arbitrary arrangement of things on a tableknives forks saltcellars inkstands pens boxes or whatever was at handwhich stood for points and clauses and climaxes and were at once indelible diction and constant suggestion he studied every tone and every gesture and he forecast the result with the real audience from its result with that imagined audience therefore it was beautiful to see him and to hear him he rejoiced in the pleasure he gave and the blows of surprise which he dealt and because he had his end in mind he knew when to stop  i have been talking of his method and manner the matter the reader has here before him and it is good matter glad honest kind just                                               w  d  howells       preface  from the preface to the english edition of mark twains sketches  if i were to sell the reader a barrel of molasses and he instead of sweetening his substantial dinner with the same at judicious intervals should eat the entire barrel at one sitting and then abuse me for making him sick i would say that he deserved to be made sick for not knowing any better how to utilize the blessings this world affords and if i sell to the reader this volume of nonsense and he instead of seasoning his graver reading with a chapter of it now and then when his mind demands such relaxation unwisely overdoses himself with several chapters of it at a single sitting he will deserve to be nauseated and he will have nobody to blame but himself if he is there is no more sin in publishing an entire volume of nonsense than there is in keeping a candystore with no hardware in it it lies wholly with the customer whether he will injure himself by means of either or will derive from them the benefits which they will afford him if he uses their possibilities judiciously  respectfully submitted  the author                                mark twains speeches     the story of a speech            an address delivered in 1877 and a review of it twentynine           years later  the original speech was delivered at a dinner           given by the publishers of the atlantic monthly in honor of the           seventieth anniversary o f the birth of john greenleaf           whittier at the hotel brunswick boston december 17 1877  this is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk therefore i will drop lightly into history myself standing here on the shore of the atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary billows i am reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago when i had just succeeded in stirring up a little nevadian literary puddle myself whose spumeflakes were beginning to blow thinly californiaward i started an inspection tramp through the southern mines of california i was callow and conceited and i resolved to try the virtue of my nom de guerre  i very soon had an opportunity i knocked at a miners lonely log cabin in the foothills of the sierras just at nightfall it was snowing at the time a jaded melancholy man of fifty barefooted opened the door to me when he heard my nom de guerre he looked more dejected than before he let me inpretty reluctantly i thoughtand after the customary bacon and beans black coffee and hot whiskey i took a pipe this sorrowful man had not said three words up to this time now he spoke up and said in the voice of one who is secretly suffering youre the fourthim going to move the fourth what said i the fourth littery man that has been here in twentyfour hoursim going to move you dont tell me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson and mr oliver wendell holmesconsound the lot  you can easily believe i was interested i supplicatedthree hot whiskeys did the restand finally the melancholy miner began said he  they came here just at dark yesterday evening and i let them in of course said they were going to the yosemite they were a rough lot but thats nothing everybody looks rough that travels afoot mr emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap redheaded mr holmes was as fat as a balloon he weighed as much as three hundred and had double chins all the way down to his stomach mr longfellow was built like a prizefighter his head was cropped and bristly like as if he had a wig made of hairbrushes his nose lay straight down his face like a finger with the end joint tilted up they had been drinking i could see that and what queer talk they used mr holmes inspected this cabin then he took me by the buttonhole and says he            through the deep caves of thought           i hear a voice that sings           build thee more stately mansions           o my soul  says i i cant afford it mr holmes and moreover i dont want to blamed if i liked it pretty well either coming from a stranger that way however i started to get out my bacon and beans when mr emerson came and looked on awhile and then he takes me aside by the buttonhole and says            give me agates for my meat           give me cantharids to eat           from air and ocean bring me foods           from all zones and altitudes  says i mr emerson if youll excuse me this aint no hotel you see it sort of riled mei warnt used to the ways of littery swells but i went on asweating over my work and next comes mr longfellow and buttonholes me and interrupts me says he            honor be to mudjekeewis           you shall hear how paupukkeewis  but i broke in and says i beg your pardon mr longfellow if youll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and let me get this grub ready youll do me proud well sir after theyd filled up i set out the jug mr holmes looks at it and then he fires up all of a sudden and yells            flash out a stream of bloodred wine           for i would drink to other days  by george i was getting kind of worked up i dont deny it i was getting kind of worked up i turns to mr holmes and says i looky here my fat friend im arunning this shanty and if the court knows herself youll take whiskey straight or youll go dry thems the very words i said to him now i dont want to sass such famous littery people but you see they kind of forced me there aint nothing onreasonable bout me i dont mind a passel of guests atreadin on my tail three or four times but when it comes to standing on it its different and if the court knows herself i says youll take whiskey straight or youll go dry well between drinks theyd swell around the cabin and strike attitudes and spout and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corneron trust i began to notice some pretty suspicious things mr emerson dealt looked at his hand shook his head says            i am the doubter and the doubt  and camly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout says he            they reckon ill who leave me out           they know not well the subtle ways i keep           i pass and deal again  hangd if he didnt go ahead and do it too oh he was a cool one well in about a minute things were running pretty tight but all of a sudden i see by mr emersons eye he judged he had em he had already corralled two tricks and each of the others one so now he kind of lifts a little in his chair and says            i tire of globes and aces           too long the game is played and down he fetched a right bower mr longfellow smiles as sweet as pie and says            thanks thanks to thee my worthy friend           for the lesson thou hast taught and blamed if he didnt down with another right bower emerson claps his hand on his bowie longfellow claps his on his revolver and i went under a bunk there was going to be trouble but that monstrous holmes rose up wobbling his double chins and says he order gentlemen the first man that draws ill lay down on him and smother him all quiet on the potomac you bet  they were pretty howcomeyouso by now and they begun to blow emerson says the nobbiest thing i ever wrote was barbara frietchie says longfellow it dont begin with my biglow papers says holmes my thanatopsis lays over em both they mighty near ended in a fight then they wished they had some more companyand mr emerson pointed to me and says            is yonder squalid peasant all           that this proud nursery could breed  he was awhetting his bowie on his bootso i let it pass well sir next they took it into their heads that they would like some music so they made me stand up and sing when johnny comes marching home till i droppedat thirteen minutes past four this morning thats what ive been through my friend when i woke at seven they were leaving thank goodness and mr longfellow had my only boots on and hisn under his arm says i hold on there evangeline what are you going to do with them he says going to make tracks with em because            lives of great men all remind us           we can make our lives sublime           and departing leave behind us           footprints on the sands of time  as i said mr twain you are the fourth in twentyfour hoursand im going to move i aint suited to a littery atmosphere  i said to the miner why my dear sir these were not the gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage these were impostors  the miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while then said he ah impostors were they are you  i did not pursue the subject and since then i have not travelled on my nom de guerre enough to hurt such was the reminiscence i was moved to contribute mr chairman in my enthusiasm i may have exaggerated the details a little but you will easily forgive me that fault since i believe it is the first time i have ever deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this                         from mark twains autobiography                                               january 11 1906  answer to a letter received this morning       dear mrs hi am forever your debtor for reminding me of that      curious passage in my life  during the first year or two after it      happened i could not bear to think of it  my pain and shame were      so intense and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled      established and confirmed that i drove the episode entirely from my      mindand so all these twentyeight or twentynine years i have      lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was coarse      vulgar and destitute of humor  but your suggestion that you and      your family found humor in it twentyeight years ago moved me to      look into the matter  so i commissioned a boston typewriter to      delve among the boston papers of that bygone time and send me a copy      of it       it came this morning and if there is any vulgarity about it i am      not able to discover it  if it isnt innocently and ridiculously      funny i am no judge  i will see to it that you get a copy   what i have said to mrs h is true i did suffer during a year or two from the deep humiliations of that episode but at last in 1888 in venice my wife and i came across mr and mrs a p c of concord massachusetts and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but death terminates the cs were very bright people and in every way charming and companionable we were together a month or two in venice and several months in rome afterward and one day that lamented break of mine was mentioned and when i was on the point of lathering those people for bringing it to my mind when i had gotten the memory of it almost squelched i perceived with joy that the cs were indignant about the way that my performance had been received in boston they poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty attitude of the people who were present at that performance and about the boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the matter that position was that i had been irreverent beyond belief beyond imagination very well i had accepted that as a fact for a year or two and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever i thought of itwhich was not frequently if i could help it whenever i thought of it i wondered how i ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a thing well the cs comforted me but they did not persuade me to continue to think about the unhappy episode i resisted that i tried to get it out of my mind and let it die and i succeeded until mrs hs letter came it had been a good twentyfive years since i had thought of that matter and when she said that the thing was funny i wondered if possibly she might be right at any rate my curiosity was aroused and i wrote to boston and got the whole thing copied as above set forth  i vaguely remember some of the details of that gatheringdimly i can see a hundred peopleno perhaps fiftyshadowy figures sitting at tables feeding ghosts now to me and nameless forevermore i dont know who they were but i can very distinctly see seated at the grand table and facing the rest of us mr emerson supernaturally grave unsmiling mr whittier grave lovely his beautiful spirit shining out of his face mr longfellow with his silken white hair and his benignant face dr oliver wendell holmes flashing smiles and affection and all goodfellowship everywhere like a rosediamond whose facets are being turned toward the light first one way and then anothera charming man and always fascinating whether he was talking or whether he was sitting still what he would call still but what would be more or less motion to other people i can see those figures with entire distinctness across this abyss of time  one other feature is clearwillie winter for these past thousand years dramatic editor of the new york tribune and still occupying that high post in his old age was there he was much younger then than he is now and he showed it it was always a pleasure to me to see willie winter at a banquet during a matter of twenty years i was seldom at a banquet where willie winter was not also present and where he did not read a charming poem written for the occasion he did it this time and it was up to standard dainty happy choicely phrased and as good to listen to as music and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of heart and brain  now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable celebration of mr whittiers seventieth birthdaybecause i got up at that point and followed winter with what i have no doubt i supposed would be the gem of the eveningthe gay oration above quoted from the boston paper i had written it all out the day before and had perfectly memorized it and i stood up there at my genial and happy and selfsatisfied ease and began to deliver it those majestic guests that row of venerable and still active volcanoes listened as did everybody else in the house with attentive interest well i delivered myself ofwell say the first two hundred words of my speech i was expecting no returns from that part of the speech but this was not the case as regarded the rest of it i arrived now at the dialogue the old miner said you are the fourth im going to move the fourth what said i he answered the fourth littery man that has been here in twentyfour hours i am going to move why you dont tell me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson mr oliver wendell holmes consound the lot  now then the houses attention continued but the expression of interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost i wondered what the trouble was i didnt know i went on but with difficultyi struggled along and entered upon that miners fearful description of the bogus emerson the bogus holmes the bogus longfellow always hopingbut with a gradually perishing hope that somebodywould laugh or that somebody would at least smile but nobody did i didnt know enough to give it up and sit down i was too new to public speaking and so i went on with this awful performance and carried it clear through to the end in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with horror it was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if i had been making these remarks about the deity and the rest of the trinity there is no milder way in which to describe the petrified condition and the ghastly expression of those people  when i sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat i shall never be as dead again as i was then i shall never be as miserable again as i was then i speak now as one who doesnt know what the condition of things may be in the next world but in this one i shall never be as wretched again as i was then howells who was near me tried to say a comforting word but couldnt get beyond a gasp there was no usehe understood the whole size of the disaster he had good intentions but the words froze before they could get out it was an atmosphere that would freeze anything if benvenuto cellinis salamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put into cellinis autobiography there was a frightful pause there was an awful silence a desolating silence then the next man on the list had to get upthere was no help for it that was bishopbishop had just burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel which had appeared in the atlantic monthly a place which would make any novel respectable and any author noteworthy in this case the novel itself was recognized as being without extraneous help respectable bishop was away up in the public favor and he was an object of high interest consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air we may say our american millions were standing from maine to texas and from alaska to florida holding their breath their lips parted their hands ready to applaud when bishop should get up on that occasion and for the first time in his life speak in public it was under these damaging conditions that he got up to make good as the vulgar say i had spoken several times before and that is the reason why i was able to go on without dying in my tracks as i ought to have donebut bishop had had no experience he was up facing those awful deitiesfacing those other people those strangersfacing human beings for the first time in his life with a speech to utter no doubt it was well packed away in his memory no doubt it was fresh and usable until i had been heard from i suppose that after that and under the smothering pall of that dreary silence it began to waste away and disappear out of his head like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog and presently there wasnt any fog left he didnt go onhe didnt last long it was not many sentences after his first before he began to hesitate and break and lose his grip and totter and wobble and at last he slumped down in a limp and mushy pile  well the programme for the occasion was probably not more than onethird finished but it ended there nobody rose the next man hadnt strength enough to get up and everybody looked so dazed so stupefied paralyzed it was impossible for anybody to do anything or even try nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere howells mournfully and without words hitched himself to bishop and me and supported us out of the room it was very kindhe was most generous he towed us tottering away into same room in that building and we sat down there i dont know what my remark was now but i know the nature of it it was the kind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help your case but howells was honesthe had to say the heartbreaking things he did say that there was no help for this calamity this shipwreck this cataclysm that this was the most disastrous thing that had ever happened in anybodys historyand then he added that is for youand consider what you have done for bishop it is bad enough in your case you deserve to suffer you have committed this crime and you deserve to have all you are going to get but here is an innocent man bishop had never done you any harm and see what you have done to him he can never hold his head up again the world can never look upon bishop as being a live person he is a corpse  that is the history of that episode of twentyeight years ago which pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two whenever it forced its way into my mind  now then i take that speech up and examine it as i said it arrived this morning from boston i have read it twice and unless i am an idiot it hasnt a single defect in it from the first word to the last it is just as good as good can be it is smart it is saturated with humor there isnt a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it anywhere what could have been the matter with that house it is amazing it is incredible that they didnt shout with laughter and those deities the loudest of them all could the fault have been with me did i lose courage when i saw those great men up there whom i was going to describe in such a strange fashion if that happened if i showed doubt that can account for it for you cant be successfully funny if you show that you are afraid of it well i cant account for it but if i had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back here now on the platform at carnegie hall i would take that same old speech deliver it word for word and melt them till theyd run all over that stage oh the fault must have been with me it is not in the speech at all       plymouth rock and the pilgrims            address at the first annual dinner n e  society           philadelphia december 22 1881            on calling upon mr clemens to make response           president rollins said            this sentiment has been assigned to one who was never exactly           born in new england nor perhaps were any of his ancestors           he is not technically therefore of new england descent           under the painful circumstances in which he has found himself           however he has done the best he couldhe has had all his           children born there and has made of himself a new england           ancestor  he is a selfmade man  more than this and better           even in cheerful hopeful helpful literature he is of new           england ascent  to ascend there in any thing thats reasonable           is difficult forconfidentially with the door shutwe all           know that they are the brightest ablest sons of that goodly           land who never leave it and it is among and above them that           mr twain has made his brilliant and permanent ascentbecome           a man of mark  i rise to protest i have kept still for years but really i think there is no sufficient justification for this sort of thing what do you want to celebrate those people forthose ancestors of yours of 1620the mayflower tribe i mean what do you want to celebrate them for your pardon the gentleman at my left assures me that you are not celebrating the pilgrims themselves but the landing of the pilgrims at plymouth rock on the 22d of december so you are celebrating their landing why the other pretext was thin enough but this is thinner than ever the other was tissue tinfoil fishbladder but this is goldleaf celebrating their lauding what was there remarkable about it i would like to know what can you be thinking of why those pilgrims had been at sea three or four months it was the very middle of winter it was as cold as death off cape cod there why shouldnt they come ashore if they hadnt landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact it would have been a case of monumental leatherheadedness which the world would not willingly let die if it had been you gentlemen you probably wouldnt have landed but you have no shadow of right to be celebrating in your ancestors gifts which they did not exercise but only transmitted why to be celebrating the mere landing of the pilgrimsto be trying to make out that this most natural and simple and customary procedure was an extraordinary circumstancea circumstance to be amazed at and admired aggrandized and glorified at orgies like this for two hundred and sixty yearshang it a horse would have known enough to land a horsepardon again the gentleman on my right assures me that it was not merely the landing of the pilgrims that we are celebrating but the pilgrims themselves so we have struck an inconsistency hereone says it was the landing the other says it was the pilgrims it is an inconsistency characteristic of your intractable and disputatious tribe for you never agree about anything but boston well then what do you want to celebrate those pilgrims for they were a mighty hard lotyou know it i grant you without the slightest unwillingness that they were a deal more gentle and merciful and just than were the people of europe of that day i grant you that they are better than their predecessors but what of thatthat is nothing people always progress you are better than your fathers and grandfathers were this is the first time i have ever aimed a measureless slander at the departed for i consider such things improper yes those among you who have not been in the penitentiary if such there be are better than your fathers and grandfathers were but is that any sufficient reason for getting up annual dinners and celebrating you no by no meansby no means well i repeat those pilgrims were a hard lot they took good care of themselves but they abolished everybody elses ancestors i am a borderruffian from the state of missouri i am a connecticut yankee by adoption in me you have missouri morals connecticut culture this gentlemen is the combination which makes the perfect man but where are my ancestors whom shall i celebrate where shall i find the raw material  my first american ancestor gentlemen was an indianan early indian your ancestors skinned him alive and i am an orphan not one drop of my blood flows in that indians veins today i stand here lone and forlorn without an ancestor they skinned him i do not object to that if they needed his fur but alive gentlemenalive they skinned him aliveand before company that is what rankles think how he must have felt for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed if he had been a bird it would have been all right and no violence done to his feelings because he would have been considered dressed but he was not a bird gentlemen he was a man and probably one of the most undressed men that ever was i ask you to put yourselves in his place i ask it as a favor i ask it as a tardy act of justice i ask it in the interest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors i ask it that the world may contemplate with vision unobstructed by disguising swallowtails and white cravats the spectacle which the true new england society ought to present cease to come to these annual orgies in this hollow modern mockerythe surplusage of raiment come in character come in the summer grace come in the unadorned simplicity come in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors provided for mine  later ancestors of mine were the quakers william robinson marmaduke stevenson et al your tribe chased them put of the country for their religions sake promised them death if they came back for your ancestors had forsaken the homes they loved and braved the perils of the sea the implacable climate and the savage wilderness to acquire that highest and most precious of boons freedom for every man on this broad continent to worship according to the dictates of his own conscienceand they were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous quakers to interfere with it your ancestors broke forever the chains of political slavery and gave the vote to every man in this wide land excluding nonenone except those who did not belong to the orthodox church your ancestorsyes they were a hard lot but nevertheless they gave us religious liberty to worship as they required us to worship and political liberty to vote as the church required and so i the bereft one i the forlorn one am here to do my best to help you celebrate them right  the quaker woman elizabeth hooton was an ancestress of mine your people were pretty severe with her you will confess that but poor thing i believe they changed her opinions before she died and took her into their fold and so we have every reason to presume that when she died she went to the same place which your ancestors went to it is a great pity for she was a good woman roger williams was an ancestor of mine i dont really remember what your people did with him but they banished him to rhode island anyway and then i believe recognizing that this was really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme they took pity on him and burned him they were a hard lot all those salem witches were ancestors of mine your people made it tropical for them yes they did by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal with them that there hasnt been a witch and hardly a halter in our family from that day to this and that is one hundred and eightynine years the first slave brought into new england out of africa by your progenitors was an ancestor of minefor i am of a mixed breed an infinitely shaded and exquisite mongrel im not one of your sham meerschaums that you can color in a week no my complexion is the patient art of eight generations well in my own time i had acquired a

i honor and appreciate your pilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves perhaps and i endorse and adopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine oncea man of sturdy opinions of sincere make of mind and not given to flattery he said people may talk as they like about that pilgrim stock but after alls said and done it would be pretty hard to improve on those people and as for me i dont mind coming out flatfooted and saying there aint any way to improve on themexcept having them born in missouri       compliments and degrees            delivered at the lotos club january 11 1908            in introducing mr clemens frank r  lawrence the president           of the lotos club recalled the fact that the first club dinner           in the present clubhouse some fourteen years ago was in           honor of mark twain  i wish to begin this time at the beginning lest i forget it altogether that is to say i wish to thank you for this welcome that you are giving and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago and which i forgot to thank you for at that time i also wish to thank you for the welcome you gave me fourteen years ago which i also forgot to thank you for at the time  i hope you will continue this custom to give me a dinner every seven years before i join the hosts in the other worldi do not know which world  mr lawrence and mr porter have paid me many compliments it is very difficult to take compliments i do not care whether you deserve the compliments or not it is just as difficult to take them the other night i was at the engineers club and enjoyed the sufferings of mr carnegie they were complimenting him there there it was all compliments and none of them deserved they say that you cannot live by bread alone but i can live on compliments  i do not make any pretence that i dislike compliments the stronger the better and i can manage to digest them i think i have lost so much by not making a collection of compliments to put them away and take them out again once in a while when in england i said that i would start to collect compliments and i began there and i have brought some of them along  the first one of these liesi wrote them down and preserved themi think they are mighty good and extremely just it is one of hamilton mabies compliments he said that la salle was the first one to make a voyage of the mississippi but mark twain was the first to chart light and navigate it for the whole world  if that had been published at the time that i issued that book life on the mississippi it would have been money in my pocket i tell you it is a talent by itself to pay compliments gracefully and have them ring true its an art by itself  here is another compliment by albert bigelow paine my biographer he is writing four octavo volumes about me and he has been at my elbow two and onehalf years  i just suppose that he does not know me but says he knows me he says mark twain is not merely a great writer a great philosopher a great man he is the supreme expression of the human being with his strength and his weakness what a talent for compression it takes a genius in compression to compact as many facts as that  w d howells spoke of me as first of hartford and ultimately of the solar system not to say of the universe  you know how modest howells is if it can be proved that my fame reaches to neptune and saturn that will satisfy even me you know how modest and retiring howells seems to be but deep down he is as vain as i am  mr howells had been granted a degree at oxford whose gown was red he had been invited to an exercise at columbia and upon inquiry had been told that it was usual to wear the black gown later he had found that three other men wore bright gowns and he had lamented that he had been one of the black mass and not a red torch  edison wrote the average american loves his family if he has any love left over for some other person he generally selects mark twain  now heres the compliment of a little montana girl which came to me indirectly she was in a room in which there was a large photograph of me after gazing at it steadily for a time she said  weve got a john the baptist like that she also said only ours has more trimmings  i suppose she meant the halo now here is a goldminers compliment it is fortytwo years old it was my introduction to an audience to which i lectured in a log schoolhouse there were no ladies there i wasnt famous then they didnt know me only the miners were there with their breeches tucked into their boottops and with clay all over them they wanted some one to introduce me and they selected a miner who protested saying  i dont know anything about this man anyhow i only know two things about him one is he has never been in jail and the other is i dont know why  theres one thing i want to say about that english trip i knew his majesty the king of england long years ago and i didnt meet him for the first time then one thing that i regret was that some newspapers said i talked with the queen of england with my hat on i dont do that with any woman i did not put it on until she asked me to then she told me to put it on and its a command there i thought i had carried my american democracy far enough so i put it on i have no use for a hat and never did have  who was it who said that the police of london knew me why the police know me everywhere there never was a day over there when a policeman did not salute me and then put up his hand and stop the traffic of the world they treated me as though i were a duchess  the happiest experience i had in england was at a dinner given in the building of the punch publication a humorous paper which is appreciated by all englishmen it was the greatest privilege ever allowed a foreigner i entered the diningroom of the building where those men get together who have been running the paper for over fifty years we were about to begin dinner when the toastmaster said just a minute there ought to be a little ceremony then there was that meditating silence for a while and out of a closet there came a beautiful little girl dressed in pink holding in her hand a copy of the previous weeks paper which had in it my cartoon it broke me all up i could not even say thank you that was the prettiest incident of the dinner the delight of all that wonderful table when she was about to go i said my child you are not going to leave me i have hardly got acquainted with you she replied you know ive got to go they never let me come in here before and they never will again that is one of the beautiful incidents that i cherish       at the conclusion of his speech and while the diners were still      cheering him colonel porter brought forward the redandgray gown      of the oxford doctor and mr clemens was made to don it      the diners rose to their feet in their enthusiasm with the      mortarboard on his head and looking down admiringly at himself      mr twain said  i like that gown i always did like red the redder it is the better i like it i was born for a savage now whoever saw any red like this there is no red outside the arteries of an archangel that could compare with this i know you all envy me i am going to have luncheon shortly with ladies just ladies i will be the only lady of my sex present and i shall put on this gown and make those ladies look dim       books authors and hats            address at the pilgrims club luncheon given in honor of mr           clemens at the savoy hotel london june 25 1907            mr birrell mp chiefsecretary for ireland in introducing           mr clemens said we all love mark twain and we are here to           tell him so  one more pointall the world knows it and that           is why it is dangerous to omit itour guest is a distinguished           citizen of the great republic beyond the seas  in america his           huckleberry finn and his tom sawyer are what robinson           crusoe and tom browns school days have been to us  they           are racy of the soil  they are books to which it is impossible           to place any period of termination  i will not speak of the           classicsreminiscences of much evil in our early lives  we do           not meet here today as critics with our appreciations and           depreciations our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords           i am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence           will think of mark twain  posterity will take care of itself           will read what it wants to read will forget what it chooses to           forget and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical           mumblings and jumblings  let us therefore be content to say to           our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves           and for our children to say what he has been to us  i           remember in liverpool in 1867 first buying the copy which i           still preserve of the celebrated jumping frog  it had a few           words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those           days was called the wild humorist of the pacific slope and a           few lines later down the moralist of the main  that was           some forty years ago  here he is still the humorist still           the moralist  his humor enlivens and enlightens his morality           and his morality is all the better for his humor  that is one           of the reasons why we love him  i am not here to mention any           book of histhat is a subject of dispute in my family circle           which is the best and which is the next bestbut i must put in           a word lest i should not be true to myselfa terrible thing           for his joan of arc a book of chivalry of nobility and of           manly sincerity for which i take this opportunity of thanking           him  but you can all drink this toast each one of you with           his own intention  you can get into it what meaning you like           mark twain is a man whom english and americans do well to           honor  he is the true consolidator of nations  his delightful           humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national           prejudices  his truth and his honor his love of truth and           his love of honor overflow all boundaries  he has made the           world better by his presence  we rejoice to see him here           long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty           honest human affection  pilgrims i desire first to thank those undergraduates of oxford when a man has grown so old as i am when he has reached the verge of seventytwo years there is nothing that carries him back to the dreamland of his life to his boyhood like recognition of those young hearts up yonder and so i thank them out of my heart i desire to thank the pilgrims of new york also for their kind notice and message which they have cabled over here mr birrell says he does not know how he got here but he will be able to get away all righthe has not drunk anything since he came here i am glad to know about those friends of his otway and chattertonfresh new names to me i am glad of the disposition he has shown to rescue them from the evils of poverty and if they are still in london i hope to have a talk with them for a while i thought he was going to tell us the effect which my book had upon his growing manhood i thought he was going to tell us how much that effect amounted to and whether it really made him what he now is but with the discretion born of parliamentary experience he dodged that and we do not know now whether he read the book or not he did that very neatly i could not do it any better myself  my books have had effects and very good ones too here and there and some others not so good there is no doubt about that but i remember one monumental instance of it years and years ago professor norton of harvard was over here and when he came back to boston i went out with howells to call on him norton was allied in some way by marriage with darwin  mr norton was very gentle in what he had to say and almost delicate and he said mr clemens i have been spending some time with mr darwin in england and i should like to tell you something connected with that visit you were the object of it and i myself would have been very proud of it but you may not be proud of it at any rate i am going to tell you what it was and to leave to you to regard it as you please mr darwin took me up to his bedroom and pointed out certain things therepitcherplants and so on that he was measuring and watching from day to dayand he said the chambermaid is permitted to do what she pleases in this room but she must never touch those plants and never touch those books on that table by that candle with those books i read myself to sleep every night those were your own books i said there is no question to my mind as to whether i should regard that as a compliment or not i do regard it as a very great compliment and a very high honor that that great mind laboring for the whole human race should rest itself on my books i am proud that he should read himself to sleep with them  now i could not keep that to myselfi was so proud of it as soon as i got home to hartford i called up my oldest friendand dearest enemy on occasionthe rev joseph twichell my pastor and i told him about that and of course he was full of interest and venom those people who get no compliments like that feel like that he went off he did not issue any applause of any kind and i did not hear of that subject for some time but when mr darwin passed away from this life and some time after darwins life and letters came out the rev mr twichell procured an early copy of that work and found something in it which he considered applied to me he came over to my houseit was snowing raining sleeting but that did not make any difference to twichell he produced the book and turned over and over until he came to a certain place when he said here look at this letter from mr darwin to sir joseph hooker what mr darwin saidi give you the idea and not the very wordswas this i do not know whether i ought to have devoted my whole life to these drudgeries in natural history and the other sciences or not for while i may have gained in one way i have lost in another once i had a fine perception and appreciation of high literature but in me that quality is atrophied that was the reason said mr twichell he was reading your books  mr birrell has touched lightlyvery lightly but in not an uncomplimentary wayon my position in this world as a moralist i am glad to have that recognition too because i have suffered since i have been in this town in the first place right away when i came here from a newsman going around with a great red highly displayed placard in the place of an apron he was selling newspapers and there were two sentences on that placard which would have been all right if they had been punctuated but they ran those two sentences together without a comma or anything and that would naturally create a wrong impression because it said mark twain arrives ascot cup stolen no doubt many a person was misled by those sentences joined together in that unkind way i have no doubt my character has suffered from it i suppose i ought to defend my character but how can i defend it i can say here and nowand anybody can see by my face that i am sincere that i speak the truththat i have never seen that cup i have not got the cupi did not have a chance to get it i have always had a good character in that way i have hardly ever stolen anything and if i did steal anything i had discretion enough to know about the value of it first i do not steal things that are likely to get myself into trouble i do not think any of us do that i know we all take thingsthat is to be expectedbut really i have never taken anything certainly in england that amounts to any great thing i do confess that when i was here seven years ago i stole a hat but that did not amount to anything it was not a good hat and was only a clergymans hat anyway  i was at a luncheon party and archdeacon wilberforce was there also i dare say he is archdeacon nowhe was a canon thenand he was serving in the westminster battery if that is the proper termi do not know as you mix military and ecclesiastical things together so much he left the luncheon table before i did he began this i did steal his hat but he began by taking mine i make that interjection because i would not accuse archdeacon wilberforce of stealing my hati should not think of it i confine that phrase to myself he merely took my hat and with good judgment tooit was a better hat than his he came out before the luncheon was over and sorted the hats in the hall and selected one which suited it happened to be mine he went off with it when i came out byandby there was no hat there which would go on my head except his which was left behind my head was not the customary size just at that time i had been receiving a good many very nice and complimentary attentions and my head was a couple of sizes larger than usual and his hat just suited me the bumps and corners were all right intellectually there were results pleasing to mepossibly so to him he found out whose hat it was and wrote me saying it was pleasant that all the way home whenever he met anybody his gravities his solemnities his deep thoughts his eloquent remarks were all snatched up by the people he met and mistaken for brilliant humorisms  i had another experience it was not unpleasing i was received with a deference which was entirely foreign to my experience by everybody whom i met so that before i got home i had a much higher opinion of myself than i have ever had before or since and there is in that very connection an incident which i remember at that old date which is rather melancholy to me because it shows how a person can deteriorate in a mere seven years it is seven years ago i have not that hat now i was going down pallmall or some other of your big streets and i recognized that that hat needed ironing i went into a big shop and passed in my hat and asked that it might be ironed they were courteous very courteous even courtly they brought that hat back to me presently very sleek and nice and i asked how much there was to pay they replied that they did not charge the clergy anything i have cherished the delight of that moment from that day to this it was the first thing i did the other day to go and hunt up that shop and hand in my hat to have it ironed i said when it came back how much to pay they said ninepence in seven years i have acquired all that worldliness and i am sorry to be back where i was seven years ago  but now i am chaffing and chaffing and chaffing here and i hope you will forgive me for that but when a man stands on the verge of seventytwo you know perfectly well that he never reached that place without knowing what this life is heartbreaking bereavement and so our reverence is for our dead we do not forget them but our duty is toward the living and if we can be cheerful cheerful in spirit cheerful in speech and in hope that is a benefit to those who are around us  my own history includes an incident which will always connect me with england in a pathetic way for when i arrived here seven years ago with my wife and my daughterwe had gone around the globe lecturing to raise money to clear off a debtmy wife and one of my daughters started across the ocean to bring to england our eldest daughter she was twenty four years of age and in the bloom of young womanhood and we were unsuspecting when my wife and daughterand my wife has passed from this life sincewhen they had reached mid atlantic a cablegramone of those heartbreaking cablegrams which we all in our days have to experiencewas put into my hand it stated that that daughter of ours had gone to her long sleep and so as i say i cannot always be cheerful and i cannot always be chaffing i must sometimes lay the cap and bells aside and recognize that i am of the human race like the rest and must have my cares and griefs and therefore i noticed what mr birrell saidi was so glad to hear him say itsomething that was in the nature of these verses here at the top of this                he lit our life with shafts of sun                and vanquished pain                thus two great nations stand as one                in honoring twain  i am very glad to have those verses i am very glad and very grateful for what mr birrell said in that connection i have received since i have been here in this one week hundreds of letters from all conditions of people in englandmen women and childrenand there is in them compliment praise and above all and better than all there is in them a note of affection praise is well compliment is well but affectionthat is the last and final and most precious reward that any man can win whether by character or achievement and i am very grateful to have that reward all these letters make me feel that here in englandas in americawhen i stand under the english flag i am not a stranger i am not an alien but at home       dedication speech            at the dedication of the college of the city of new york           may 16 1908            mr clemens wore his gown as doctor of laws oxford university           ambassador bryce and mr choate had made the formal addresses  how difficult indeed is the higher education mr choate needs a little of it he is not only short as a statistician of new york but he is off far off in his mathematics the four thousand citizens of greater new york indeed  but i dont think it was wise or judicious on the part of mr choate to show this higher education he has obtained he sat in the lap of that great education i was there at the time and see the resultthe lamentable result maybe if he had had a sandwich here to sustain him the result would not have been so serious  for seventytwo years i have been striving to acquire that higher education which stands for modesty and diffidence and it doesnt work  and then look at ambassador bryce who referred to his alma mater oxford he might just as well have included me well i am a later production  if i am the latest graduate i really and sincerely hope i am not the final flower of its seven centuries i hope it may go on for seven ages longer       die schrecken der deutschen sprache the horrors of the german language            address to the vienna press club november 21 1897           delivered in german here in literal translation  it has me deeply touched my gentlemen here so hospitably received to be from colleagues out of my own profession in this from my own home so far distant land my heart is full of gratitude but my poverty of german words forces me to greater economy of expression excuse you my gentlemen that i read off what i you say will but he didnt read  the german language speak i not good but have numerous connoisseurs me assured that i her write like an angel maybemaybei know not have till now no acquaintance with the angels had that comes laterwhen it the dear god pleaseit has no hurry  since long my gentlemen have i the passionate longing nursed a speech on german to hold but one has me not permitted men who no feeling for the art had laid me ever hindrance in the way and made naught my desiresometimes by excuses often by force always said these men to me keep you still your highness silence for gods sake seek another way and means yourself obnoxious to make  in the present case as usual it is me difficult become for me the permission to obtain the committee sorrowed deeply but could me the permission not grant on account of a law which from the concordia demands she shall the german language protect du liebe zeit how so had one to me this say couldmightdaredshould i am indeed the truest friend of the german languageand not only now but from long sinceyes before twenty years already and never have i the desire had the noble language to hurt to the contrary only wished she to improvei would her only reform it is the dream of my life been i have already visits by the various german governments paid and for contracts prayed i am now to austria in the same task come i would only some changes effect i would only the language methodthe luxurious elaborate construction compress the eternal parenthesis suppress do away with annihilate the introduction of more than thirteen subjects in one sentence forbid the verb so far to the front pull that one it without a telescope discover can with one word my gentlemen i would your beloved language simplify so that my gentlemen when you her for prayer need one her yonderup understands  i beseech you from me yourself counsel to let execute these mentioned reforms then will you an elegant language possess and afterward when you some thing say will will you at least yourself understand what you said had but often nowadays when you a milelong sentence from you given and you yourself somewhat have rested then must you have a touching inquisitiveness have yourself to determine what you actually spoken have before several days has the correspondent of a local paper a sentence constructed which hundred and twelve words contain and therein were seven parentheses smuggled in and the subject seven times changed think you only my gentlemen in the course of the voyage of a single sentence must the poor persecuted fatigued subject seven times change position  now when we the mentioned reforms execute will it no longer so bad be doch noch eins i might gladly the separable verb also a little bit reform i might none do let what schiller did he has the whole history of the thirty years war between the two members of a separable verb inpushed that has even germany itself aroused and one has schiller the permission refused the history of the hundred years war to composegod be it thanked after all these reforms established be will will the german language the noblest and the prettiest on the world be  since to you now my gentlemen the character of my mission known is beseech i you so friendly to be and to me your valuable help grant mr potzl has the public believed make would that i to vienna come am in order the bridges to clog up and the traffic to hinder while i observations gather and note allow you yourselves but not from him deceived my frequent presence on the bridges has an entirely innocent ground yonder gives it the necessary space yonder can one a noble long german sentence elaborate the bridgerailing along and his whole contents with one glance overlook on the one end of the railing pasted i the first member of a separable verb and the final member cleave i to the other endthen spread the body of the sentence between it out usually are for my purposes the bridges of the city long enough when i but potzls writings study will i ride out and use the glorious endless imperial bridge but this is a calumny potzl writes the prettiest german perhaps not so pliable as the mine but in many details much better excuse you these flatteries these are well deserved  now i my speech executeno i would say i bring her to the close i am a foreignerbut here under you have i it entirely forgotten and so again and yet again proffer i you my heartiest thanks       german for the hungarians            address at the jubilee celebration of the emancipation of the           hungarian press  march 26 1899            the ministry and members of parliament were present  the           subject was the ausgleichi e the arrangement for the           apportionment of the taxes between hungary and austria           paragraph 14 of the ausgleich fixes the proportion each country           must pay to the support of the army  it is the paragraph which           caused the trouble and prevented its renewal  now that we are all here together i think it will be a good idea to arrange the ausgleich if you will act for hungary i shall be quite willing to act for austria and this is the very time for it there couldnt be a better for we are all feeling friendly fairminded and hospitable now and full of admiration for each other full of confidence in each other full of the spirit of welcome full of the grace of forgiveness and the disposition to let bygones be bygones  let us not waste this golden this beneficent this providential opportunity i am willing to make any concession you want just so we get it settled i am not only willing to let grain come in free i am willing to pay the freight on it and you may send delegates to the reichsrath if you like all i require is that they shall be quiet peaceable people like your own deputies and not disturb our proceedings  if you want the gegenseitigengeldbeitragendenverhaltnismassigkeiten rearranged and readjusted i am ready for that i will let you off at twentyeight per centtwentyseveneven twentyfive if you insist for there is nothing illiberal about me when i am out on a diplomatic debauch  now in return for these concessions i am willing to take anything in reason and i think we may consider the business settled and the ausgleich ausgegloschen at last for ten solid years and we will sign the papers in blank and do it here and now  well i am unspeakably glad to have that ausgleich off my hands it has kept me awake nights for anderthalbjahr  but i never could settle it before because always when i called at the foreign office in vienna to talk about it there wasnt anybody at home and that is not a place where you can go in and see for yourself whether it is a mistake or not because the person who takes care of the front door there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the free spirit of investigation to think the ausgleich is abgemacht at last it is a grand and beautiful consummation and i am glad i came  the way i feel now i do honestly believe i would rather be just my own humble self at this moment than paragraph 14       a new german word            to aid a local charity mr clemens appeared before a           fashionable audience in vienna march 10 1899 reading his           sketch the lucerne girl and describing how he had been           interviewed and ridiculed  he said in part  i have not sufficiently mastered german to allow my using it with impunity my collection of fourteensyllable german words is still incomplete but i have just added to that collection a jewela veritable jewel i found it in a telegram from linz and it contains ninetyfive letters   personaleinkommensteuerschatzungskommissionsmitgliedsreisekostenrechnungs erganzungsrevisionsfund  if i could get a similar word engraved upon my tombstone i should sleep beneath it in peace       unconscious plagiarism            delivered at the dinner given by the publishers of the           atlantic monthly to oliver wendell holmes in honor of his           seventieth birthday august 29 1879  i would have travelled a much greater distance than i have come to witness the paying of honors to doctor holmes for my feeling toward him has always been one of peculiar warmth when one receives a letter from a great man for the first time in his life it is a large event to him as all of you know by your own experience you never can receive letters enough from famous men afterward to obliterate that one or dim the memory of the pleasant surprise it was and the gratification it gave you lapse of time cannot make it commonplace or cheap  well the first great man who ever wrote me a letter was our guestoliver wendell holmes he was also the first great literary man i ever stole anything fromand that is how i came to write to him and he to me when my first book was new a friend of mine said to me the dedication is very neat yes i said i thought it was my friend said i always admired it even before i saw it in the innocents abroad i naturally said what do you mean where did you ever see it before well i saw it first some years ago as doctor holmess dedication to his songs in many keys of course my first impulse was to prepare this mans remains for burial but upon reflection i said i would reprieve him for a moment or two and give him a chance to prove his assertion if he could we stepped into a bookstore and he did prove it i had really stolen that dedication almost word for word i could not imagine how this curious thing had happened for i knew one thingthat a certain amount of pride always goes along with a teaspoonful of brains and that this pride protects a man from deliberately stealing other peoples ideas that is what a teaspoonful of brains will do for a manand admirers had often told me i had nearly a basketfulthough they were rather reserved as to the size of the basket  however i thought the thing out and solved the mystery two years before i had been laid up a couple of weeks in the sandwich islands and had read and reread doctor holmess poems till my mental reservoir was filled up with them to the brim the dedication lay on the top and handy so byandby i unconsciously stole it perhaps i unconsciously stole the rest of the volume too for many people have told me that my book was pretty poetical in one way or another well of course i wrote doctor holmes and told him i hadnt meant to steal and he wrote back and said in the kindest way that it was all right and no harm done and added that he believed we all unconsciously worked over ideas gathered in reading and hearing imagining they were original with ourselves he stated a truth and did it in such a pleasant way and salved over my sore spot so gently and so healingly that i was rather glad i had committed the crime far the sake of the letter i afterward called on him and told him to make perfectly free with any ideas of mine that struck him as being good protoplasm for poetry he could see by that that there wasnt anything mean about me so we got along right from the start i have not met doctor holmes many times since and lately he saidhowever i am wandering wildly away from the one thing which i got on my feet to do that is to make my compliments to you my fellowteachers of the great public and likewise to say that i am right glad to see that doctor holmes is still in his prime and full of generous life and as age is not determined by years but by trouble and infirmities of mind and body i hope it may be a very long time yet before any one can truthfully say he is growing old       the weather            address at the new england societys seventy first           annual dinner new york city  the next toast was the oldest inhabitantthe weather of new england                     who can lose it and forget it                     who can have it and regret it                     be interposer twixt us twain                                         merchant of venice  i reverently believe that the maker who made us all makes everything in new england but the weather i dont know who makes that but i think it must be raw apprentices in the weatherclerks factory who experiment and learn how in new england for board and clothes and then are promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article and will take their custom elsewhere if they dont get it there is a sumptuous variety about the new england weather that compels the strangers admirationand regret the weather is always doing something there always attending strictly to business always getting up new designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go but it gets through more business in spring than in any other season in the spring i have counted one hundred and thirtysix different kinds of weather inside of fourandtwenty hours it was i that made the fame and fortune of that man that had that marvellous collection of weather on exhibition at the centennial that so astounded the foreigners he was going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the climes i said dont you do it you come to new england on a favorable spring day i told him what we could do in the way of style variety and quantity well he came and he made his collection in four days as to variety why he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather that he had never heard of before and as to quantity well after he had picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way he not only had weather enough but weather to spare weather to hire out weather to sell to deposit weather to invest weather to give to the poor the people of new england are by nature patient and forbearing but there are some things which they will not stand every year they kill a lot of poets for writing about beautiful spring these are generally casual visitors who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else and cannot of course know how the natives feel about spring and so the first thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has permanently gone by old probabilities has a mighty reputation for accurate prophecy and thoroughly well deserves it you take up the paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what todays weather is going to be on the pacific down south in the middle states in the wisconsin region see him sail along in the joy and pride of his power till he gets to new england and then see his tail drop he doesnt know what the weather is going to be in new england well he mulls over it and by andby he gets out something about like this probably northeast to southwest winds varying to the southward and westward and eastward and points between high and low barometer swapping around from place to place probable areas of rain snow hail and drought succeeded or preceded by earthquakes with thunder and lightning then he jots down his postscript from his wandering mind to cover accidents but it is possible that the programme may be wholly changed in the mean time yes one of the brightest gems in the new england weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it there is only one thing certain about it you are certain there is going to be plenty of ita perfect grand review but you never can tell which end of the procession is going to move first you fix up for the drought you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out and two to one you get drowned you make up your mind that the earthquake is due you stand from under and take hold of something to steady yourself and the first thing you know you get struck by lightning these are great disappointments but they cant be helped the lightning there is peculiar it is so convincing that when it strikes a thing it doesnt leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whetherwell youd think it was something valuable and a congressman had been there and the thunder when the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and saw and key up the instruments for the performance strangers say why what awful thunder you have here but when the baton is raised and the real concert begins youll find that stranger down in the cellar with his head in the ashbarrel now as to the size of the weather in new englandlengthways i mean it is utterly disproportioned to the size of that little country half the time when it is packed as full as it can stick you will see that new england weather sticking out beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles over the neighboring states she cant hold a tenth part of her weather you can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to do it i could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the new england weather but i will give but a single specimen i like to hear rain on a tin roof so i covered part of my roof with tin with an eye to that luxury well sir do you think it ever rains on that tin no sir skips it every time mind in this speech i have been trying merely to do honor to the new england weatherno language could do it justice but after all there is at least one or two things about that weather or if you please effects produced by it which we residents would not like to part with if we hadnt our bewitching autumn foliage we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for all its bullying vagariesthe icestorm when a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the topice that is as bright and clear as crystal when every bough and twig is strung with icebeads frozen dewdrops and the whole tree sparkles cold and white like the shah of persias diamond plume then the wind waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red from red to green and green to goldthe tree becomes a spraying fountain a very explosion of dazzling jewels and it stands there the acme the climax the supremest possibility in art or nature of bewildering intoxicating intolerable magnificence one cannot make the words too strong       the babies  the babies            delivered at the banquet in chicago given by the army of the           tennessee to their first commander general u s grant           november 1879            the fifteenth regular toast was the babiesas they comfort           us in our sorrows let us not forget them in our festivities  i like that we have not all had the good fortune to be ladies we have not all been generals or poets or statesmen but when the toast works down to the babies we stand on common ground it is a shame that for a thousand years the worlds banquets have utterly ignored the baby as if he didnt amount to anything if you will stop and think a minuteif you will go back fifty or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first babyyou will remember that he amounted to a good deal and even something over you soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation he took entire command you became his lackey his mere bodyservant and you had to stand around too he was not a commander who made allowances for time distance weather or anything else you had to execute his order whether it was possible or not and there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics and that was the doublequick he treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect and the bravest of you didnt dare to say a word you could face the deathstorm at donelson and vicksburg and give back blow for blow but when he clawed your whiskers and pulled your hair and twisted your nose you had to take it when the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries and advanced with steady tread but when he turned on the terrors of his war whoop you advanced in the other direction and mighty glad of the chance too when he called for soothingsyrup did you venture to throw out any sideremarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman no you got up and got it when he ordered his pap bottle and it was not warm did you talk back not you you went to work and warmed it you even descended so far in your menial office as to take a suck at that warm insipid stuff yourself to see if it was rightthree parts water to one of milk a touch of sugar to modify the colic and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs i can taste that stuff yet and how many things you learned as you went along sentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying that when the baby smiles in his sleep it is because the angels are whispering to him very pretty but too thinsimply wind on the stomach my friends if the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual hour two oclock in the morning didnt you rise up promptly and remark with a mental addition which would not improve a sundayschool book much that that was the very thing you were about to propose yourself oh you were under good discipline and as you went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform you not only prattled undignified babytalk but even tuned up your martial voices and tried to singrock aby baby in the treetop for instance what a spectacle far an army of the tennessee and what an affliction for the neighbors too for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes military music at three in the morning and when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two or three hours and your little velvet head intimated that nothing suited him like exercise and noise what did you do you simply went on until you dropped in the last ditch the idea that a baby doesnt amount to anything why one baby is just a house and a front yard full by itself one baby can furnish more business than you and your whole interior department can attend to he is enterprising irrepressible brimful of lawless activities do what you please you cant make him stay on the reservation sufficient unto the day is one baby as long as you are in your right mind dont you ever pray for twins twins amount to a permanent riot and there aint any real difference between triplets and an insurrection  yes it was high time for a toastmaster to recognize the importance of the babies think what is in store for the present crop fifty years from now we shall all be dead i trust and then this flag if it still survive and let us hope it may will be floating over a republic numbering 200000000 souls according to the settled laws of our increase our present schooner of state will have grown into a political leviathana great eastern the cradled babies of today will be on deck let them be well trained for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands among the three or four million cradles now rocking in the land are some which this nation would preserve for ages as sacred things if we could know which ones they are in one of these cradles the unconscious farragut of the future is at this moment teething think of it and putting in a world of dead earnest unarticulated but perfectly justifiable profanity over it too in another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining milky way with but a languid interest poor little chapand wondering what has become of that other one they call the wetnurse in another the future great historian is lyingand doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly mission is ended in another the future president is busying himself with no profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so early and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some 60000 future officeseekers getting ready to furnish him occasion to grapple with that same old problem a second time and in still one more cradle some where under the flag the future illustrious commanderinchief of the american armies is so little burdened with his approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to get his big toe into his mouthan achievement which meaning no disrespect the illustrious guest of this evening turned his entire attention to some fiftysix years ago and if the child is but a prophecy of the man there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded       our children and great discoveries            delivered at the authors club new york  our childrenyoursandmine they seem like little things to talk aboutour children but little things often make up the sum of human lifethats a good sentence i repeat it little things often produce great things now to illustrate take sir isaac newtoni presume some of you have heard of mr newton well once when sir isaac newtona mere ladgot over into the mans apple orchardi dont know what he was doing therei didnt come all the way from hartford to question mr newtons honestybut when he was therein the main orchardhe saw an apple fall and he was attracted toward it and that led to the discoverynot of mr newton but of the great law of attraction and gravitation  and there was once another great discovererive forgotten his name and i dont remember what he discovered but i know it was something very important and i hope you will all tell your children about it when you get home well when the great discoverer was once loafn around down in virginia and aputtin in his time flirting with pocahontasoh captain john smith that was the mans nameand while he and poca were sitting in mr powhatans garden he accidentally put his arm around her and picked something simple weed which proved to be tobaccoand now we find it in every christian family shedding its civilizing influence broadcast throughout the whole religious community  now there was another great man i cant think of his name either who used to loaf around and watch the great chandelier in the cathedral at pisa which set him to thinking about the great law of gunpowder and eventually led to the discovery of the cottongin  now i dont say this as an inducement for our young men to loaf around like mr newton and mr galileo and captain smith but they were once little babies two days old and they show what little things have sometimes accomplished       educating theatregoers            the children of the educational alliance gave a performance of           the prince and the pauper on the afternoon of april 14 1907           in the theatre of the alliance building in east broadway  the           audience was composed of nearly one thousand children of the           neighborhood  mr clemens mr howells and mr daniel frohman           were among the invited guests  i have not enjoyed a play so much so heartily and so thoroughly since i played miles hendon twentytwo years ago i used to play in this piece the prince and the pauper with my children who twentytwo years ago were little youngsters one of my daughters was the prince and a neighbors daughter was the pauper and the children of other neighbors played other parts but we never gave such a performance as we have seen here today it would have been beyond us  my late wife was the dramatist and stagemanager our coachman was the stagemanager second in command we used to play it in this simple way and the one who used to bring in the crown on a cushionhe was a little fellow thenis now a clergyman way up highsix or seven feet highand growing higher all the time we played it well but not as well as you see it here for you see it done by practically trained professionals  i was especially interested in the scene which we have just had for miles hendon was my part i did it as well as a person could who never remembered his part the children all knew their parts they did not mind if i did not know mine i could thread a needle nearly as well as the player did whom you saw today the words of my part i could supply on the spot the words of the song that miles hendon sang here i did not catch but i was great in that song            then mr clemens hummed a bit of doggerel that the reporter           made out as this                     there was a woman in her town                     she loved her husband well                     but another man just twice as well            how is that demanded mr clemens  then resuming  it was so fresh and enjoyable to make up a new set of words each time that i played the part  if i had a thousand citizens in front of me i would like to give them information but you children already know all that i have found out about the educational alliance its like a man living within thirty miles of vesuvius and never knowing about a volcano its like living for a lifetime in buffalo eighteen miles from niagara and never going to see the falls so i had lived in new york and knew nothing about the educational alliance  this theatre is a part of the work and furnishes pure and clean plays this theatre is an influence everything in the world is accomplished by influences which train and educate when you get to be seventyone and a half as i am you may think that your education is over but it isnt  if we had forty theatres of this kind in this city of four millions how they would educate and elevate we should have a body of educated theatregoers  it would make better citizens honest citizens one of the best gifts a millionaire could make would be a theatre here and a theatre there it would make of you a real republic and bring about an educational level       the educational theatre            on november 19 1907 mr clemens entertained a party of six or           seven hundred of his friends inviting them to witness the           representation of the prince and the pauper flayed by boys           and girls of the east side at the childrens educational           theatre new york  just a word or two to let you know how deeply i appreciate the honor which the children who are the actors and frequenters of this cozy playhouse have conferred upon me they have asked me to be their ambassador to invite the hearts and brains of new york to come down here and see the work they are doing i consider it a grand distinction to be chosen as their intermediary between the children and myself there is an indissoluble bond of friendship  i am proud of this theatre and this performanceproud because i am naturally vainvain of myself and proud of the children  i wish we could reach more children at one time i am glad to see that the children of the east side have turned their backs on the bowery theatres to come to see the pure entertainments presented here  this childrens theatre is a great educational institution i hope the time will come when it will be part of every public school in the land i may be pardoned in being vain i was born vain i guess at this point the stagemanagers whistle interrupted mr clemens that settles it theres my cue to stop i was to talk until the whistle blew but it blew before i got started it takes me longer to get started than most people i guess i was born at slow speed my time is up and if youll keep quiet for two minutes ill tell you something about miss herts the woman who conceived this splendid idea she is the originator and the creator of this theatre educationally this institution coins the gold of young hearts into external good             on april 23 1908 he spoke again at the same place  i will be strictly honest with you i am only fit to be honorary president it is not to be expected that i should be useful as a real president but when it comes to things ornamental i of course have no objection there is of course no competition i take it as a very real compliment because there are thousands of children who have had a part in this request it is promotion in truth  it is a thing worth doing that is done here you have seen the children play you saw how little sally reformed her burglar she could reform any burglar she could reform me this is the only school in which can be taught the highest and most difficult lessonsmorals in other schools the way of teaching morals is revolting here the children who come in thousands live through each part  they are terribly anxious for the villain to get his bullet and that i take to be a humane and proper sentiment they spend freely the ten cents that is not saved without a struggle it comes out of the candy money and the money that goes for chewinggum and other necessaries of life they make the sacrifice freely this is the only school which they are sorry to leave       poets as policemen            mr clemens was one of the speakers at the lotos club dinner to           governor odell march 24 1900  the police problem was           referred to at length  let us abolish policemen who carry clubs and revolvers and put in a squad of poets armed to the teeth with poems on spring and love i would be very glad to serve as commissioner not because i think i am especially qualified but because i am too tired to work and would like to take a rest  howells would go well as my deputy he is tired too and needs a rest badly  i would start in at once to elevate purify and depopulate the redlight district i would assign the most soulful poets to that district all heavily armed with their poems take chauncey depew as a sample i would station them on the corners after they had rounded up all the depraved people of the district so they could not escape and then have them read from their poems to the poor unfortunates the plan would be very effective in causing an emigration of the depraved element       puddnhead wilson dramatized            when mr clemens arrived from europe in 1895 one of the first           things he did was to see the dramatization of puddnhead           wilson  the audience becoming aware of the fact that mr           clemens was in the house called upon him for a speech  never in my life have i been able to make a speech without preparation and i assure you that this position in which i find myself is one totally unexpected  i have been hemmed in all day by william dean howells and other frivolous persons and i have been talking about everything in the world except that of which speeches are constructed then too seven days on the water is not conducive to speechmaking i will only say that i congratulate mr mayhew he has certainly made a delightful play out of my rubbish his is a charming gift confidentially i have always had an idea that i was well equipped to write plays but i have never encountered a manager who has agreed with me       daly theatre            address at a dinner after the one hundredth performance of           the taming of the shrew            mr clemens made the following speech which he incorporated           afterward in following the equator  i am glad to be here this is the hardest theatre in new york to get into even at the front door i never got in without hard work i am glad we have got so far in at last two or three years ago i had an appointment to meet mr daly on the stage of this theatre at eight oclock in the evening well i got on a train at hartford to come to new york and keep the appointment all i had to do was to come to the back door of the theatre on sixth avenue i did not believe that i did not believe it could be on sixth avenue but that is what dalys note saidcome to that door walk right in and keep the appointment it looked very easy it looked easy enough but i had not much confidence in the sixth avenue door  well i was kind of bored on the train and i bought some newspapersnew haven newspapersand there was not much news in them so i read the advertisements there was one advertisement of a benchshow i had heard of benchshows and i often wondered what there was about them to interest people i had seen benchshowslectured to benchshows in factbut i didnt want to advertise them or to brag about them well i read on a little and learned that a benchshow was not a benchshowbut dogs not benches at allonly dogs i began to be interested and as there was nothing else to do i read every bit of the advertisement and learned that the biggest thing in this show was a st bernard dog that weighed one hundred and fortyfive pounds before i got to new york i was so interested in the benchshows that i made up my mind to go to one the first chance i got down on sixth avenue near where that back door might be i began to take things leisurely i did not like to be in too much of a hurry there was not anything in sight that looked like a back door the nearest approach to it was a cigar store so i went in and bought a cigar not too expensive but it cost enough to pay for any information i might get and leave the dealer a fair profit well i did not like to be too abrupt to make the man think me crazy by asking him if that was the way to dalys theatre so i started gradually to lead up to the subject asking him first if that was the way to castle garden when i got to the real question and he said he would show me the way i was astonished he sent me through a long hallway and i found myself in a back yard then i went through a long passageway and into a little room and there before my eyes was a big st bernard dog lying on a bench there was another door beyond and i went there and was met by a big fierce man with a fur cap on and coat off who remarked phwat do yez want i told him i wanted to see mr daly yez cant see mr daly this time of night he responded i urged that i had an appointment with mr daly and gave him my card which did not seem to impress him much yez cant get in and yez cant shmoke here throw away that cigar if yez want to see mr daly yez ll have to be after going to the front door and buy a ticket and then if yez have luck and hes around that way yez may see him i was getting discouraged but i had one resource left that had been of good service in similar emergencies firmly but kindly i told him my name was mark twain and i awaited results there was none he was not fazed a bit phweres your order to see mr daly he asked i handed him the note and he examined it intently my friend i remarked you can read that better if you hold it the other side up but he took no notice of the suggestion and finally asked wheres mr dalys name there it is i told him on the top of the page thats all right he said thats where he always puts it but i dont see the w in his name and he eyed me distrustfully finally he asked phwat do yez want to see mr daly for business business yes it was my only hope phwat kindtheatres that was too much no what kind of shows then benchshows it was risky but i was desperate benchshows is itwhere the big mans face changed and he began to look interested new haven new haven it is ah thats going to be a fine show im glad to see you did you see a big dog in the other room yes how much do you think that dog weighs one hundred and fortyfive pounds look at that now hes a good judge of dogs and no mistake he weighs all of one hundred and thirtyeight sit down and shmokego on and shmoke your cigar ill tell mr daly you are here in a few minutes i was on the stage shaking hands with mr daly and the big man standing around glowing with satisfaction come around in front said mr daly and see the performance i will put you into my own box and as i moved away i heard my honest friend mutter well he desarves it       the dress of civilized woman  a large part of the daughter of civilization is her dressas it should be some civilized women would lose half their charm without dress and some would lose all of it the daughter of modern civilization dressed at her utmost best is a marvel of exquisite and beautiful art and expense all the lands all the climes and all the arts are laid under tribute to furnish her forth her linen is from belfast her robe is from paris her lace is from venice or spain or france her feathers are from the remote regions of southern africa her furs from the remoter region of the iceberg and the aurora her fan from japan her diamonds from brazil her bracelets from california her pearls from ceylon her cameos from rome she has gems and trinkets from buried pompeii and others that graced comely egyptian forms that have been dust and ashes now for forty centuries her watch is from geneva her card case is from china her hair is fromfromi dont know where her hair is from i never could find out that is her other hairher public hair her sunday hair i dont mean the hair she goes to bed with  and that reminds me of a trifle any time you want to you can glance around the carpet of a pullman car and go and pick up a hairpin but not to save your life can you get any woman in that car to acknowledge that hairpin now isnt that strange but its true the woman who has never swerved from castiron veracity and fidelity in her whole life will when confronted with this crucial test deny her hairpin she will deny that hairpin before a hundred witnesses i have stupidly got into more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a hairpin in a pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life       dress reform and copyright            when the present copyright law was under discussion mr           clemens appeared before the committee  he had sent speaker           cannon the following letter            dear uncle josephplease get me the thanks of congress not           next week but right away  it is very necessary  do accomplish           this for your affectionate old friend right awayby           persuasion if you can by violence if you must for it is           imperatively necessary that i get on the floor of the house for           two or three hours and talk to the members man by man in           behalf of support encouragement and protection of one of the           nations most valuable assets and industriesits literature           i have arguments with mealso a barrel with liquid in it            give me a chance  get me the thanks of congress  dont wait           for othersthere isnt time furnish them to me yourself and           let congress ratify later  i have stayed away and let congress           alone for seventyone years and am entitled to the thanks           congress knows this perfectly well and i have long felt hurt           that this quite proper and earned expression of gratitude has           been merely felt by the house and never publicly uttered            send me an order on the sergeantatarms quick  when shall i           come                                    with love and a benediction                                                        mark twain             while waiting to appear before the committee mr clemens           talked to the reporters  why dont you ask why i am wearing such apparently unseasonable clothes ill tell you i have found that when a man reaches the advanced age of seventyone years as i have the continual sight of dark clothing is likely to have a depressing effect upon him lightcolored clothing is more pleasing to the eye and enlivens the spirit now of course i cannot compel every one to wear such clothing just for my especial benefit so i do the next best thing and wear it myself  of course before a man reaches my years the fear of criticism might prevent him from indulging his fancy i am not afraid of that i am decidedly for pleasing color combinations in dress i like to see the womens clothes say at the opera what can be more depressing than the sombre black which custom requires men to wear upon state occasions a group of men in evening clothes looks like a flock of crows and is just about as inspiring  after all what is the purpose of clothing are not clothes intended primarily to preserve dignity and also to afford comfort to their wearer now i know of nothing more uncomfortable than the presentday clothes of men the finest clothing made is a persons own skin but of course society demands something more than this  the bestdressed man i have ever seen however was a native of the sandwich islands who attracted my attention thirty years ago now when that man wanted to don especial dress to honor a public occasion or a holiday why he occasionally put on a pair of spectacles otherwise the clothing with which god had provided him sufficed  of course i have ideas of dress reform for one thing why not adopt some of the womens styles goodness knows they adopt enough of ours take the peekaboo waist for instance it has the obvious advantages of being cool and comfortable and in addition it is almost always made up in pleasing colors which cheer and do not depress  it is true that i dressed the connecticut yankee at king arthurs court in a plughat but lets see that was twentyfive years ago then no man was considered fully dressed until he donned a plughat nowadays i think that no man is dressed until he leaves it home why when i left home yesterday they trotted out a plughat for me to wear  you must wear it they told me why just think of going to washington without a plughat but i said no i would wear a derby or nothing why i believe i could walk along the streets of new yorki never dobut still i think i couldand i should never see a welldressed man wearing a plughat if i did i should suspect him of something i dont know just what but i would suspect him  why when i got up on the second story of that pennsylvania ferryboat coming down here yesterday i saw howells coming along he was the only man on the boat with a plughat and i tell you he felt ashamed of himself he said he had been persuaded to wear it against his better sense but just think of a man nearly seventy years old who has not a mind of his own on such matters  are you doing any work now the youngest and most serious reporter asked  work i retired from work on my seventieth birthday since then i have been putting in merely twentysix hours a day dictating my autobiography which as john phoenix said in regard to his autograph may be relied upon as authentic as it is written exclusively by me but it is not to be published in full until i am thoroughly dead i have made it as caustic fiendish and devilish as possible it will fill many volumes and i shall continue writing it until the time comes for me to join the angels it is going to be a terrible autobiography it will make the hair of some folks curl but it cannot be published until i am dead and the persons mentioned in it and their children and grandchildren are dead it is something awful  can you tell us the names of some of the notables that are here to see you off  i dont know i am so shy my shyness takes a peculiar phase i never look a person in the face the reason is that i am afraid they may know me and that i may not know them which makes it very embarrassing for both of us i always wait for the other person to speak i know lots of people but i dont know who they are it is all a matter of ability to observe things i never observe anything now i gave up the habit years ago you should keep a habit up if you want to become proficient in it for instance i was a pilot once but i gave it up and i do not believe the captain of the minneapolis would let me navigate his ship to london still if i think that he is not on the job i may go up on the bridge and offer him a few suggestions       college girls            five hundred undergraduates under the auspices of the womans           university club new york welcomed mr clemens as their guest           april 3 1906 and gave him the freedom of the club which the           chairman explained was freedom to talk individually to any girl           present  ive worked for the public good thirty years so for the rest of my life i shall work for my personal contentment i am glad miss neron has fed me for there is no telling what iniquity i might wander into on an empty stomachi mean an empty mind  i am going to tell you a practical story about how once upon a time i was blinda story i should have been using all these months but i never thought about telling it until the other night and now it is too late for on the nineteenth of this month i hope to take formal leave of the platform forever at carnegie hallthat is take leave so far as talking for money and for people who have paid money to hear me talk i shall continue to infest the platform on these conditionsthat there is nobody in the house who has paid to hear me that i am not paid to be heard and that there will be none but young women students in the audience here mr clemens told the story of how he took a girl to the theatre while he was wearing tight boots which appears elsewhere in this volume and ended by saying and now let this be a lesson to youi dont know what kind of a lesson ill let you think it out       girls  in my capacity of publisher i recently received a manuscript from a teacher which embodied a number of answers given by her pupils to questions propounded these answers show that the children had nothing but the sound to go bythe sense was perfectly empty here are some of their answers to words they were asked to define auriferouspertaining to an orifice ammoniathe food of the gods equestrianone who asks questions parasitea kind of umbrella ipecacaman who likes a good dinner and here is the definition of an ancient word honored by a great party republicana sinner mentioned in the bible and here is an innocent deliverance of a zoological kind there are a good many donkeys in the theological gardens here also is a definition which really isnt very bad in its way demagoguea vessel containing beer and other liquids here too is a sample of a boys composition on girls which i must say i rather like  girls are very stuckup and dignified in their manner and behaveyour they think more of dress than anything and like to play with dowls and rags they cry if they see a cow in a far distance and are afraid of guns they stay at home all the time and go to church every sunday they are always sick they are always furry and making fun of boys hands and they say how dirty they cant play marbles i pity them poor things they make fun of boys and then turn round and love them i dont belave they ever kiled a cat or anything they look out every nite and say oh ant the moon lovelythir is one thing i have not told and that is they always now their lessons bettern boys       the ladies            delivered at the anniversary festival 1872 of the scottish           corporation of london            mr clemens replied to the toast the ladies  i am proud indeed of the distinction of being chosen to respond to this especial toast to the ladies or to women if you please for that is the preferable term perhaps it is certainly the older and therefore the more entitled to reverence i have noticed that the bible with that plain blunt honesty which is such a conspicuous characteristic of the scriptures is always particular to never refer to even the illustrious mother of all mankind as a lady but speaks of her as a woman it is odd but you will find it is so i am peculiarly proud of this honor because i think that the toast to women is one which by right and by every rule of gallantry should take precedence of all othersof the army of the navy of even royalty itselfperhaps though the latter is not necessary in this day and in this land for the reason that tacitly you do drink a broad general health to all good women when you drink the health of the queen of england and the princess of wales i have in mind a poem just now which is familiar to you all familiar to everybody and what an inspiration that was and how instantly the present toast recalls the verses to all our minds when the most noble the most gracious the purest and sweetest of all poets says                           woman  o womaner                          wom  however you remember the lines and you remember how feelingly how daintily how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up before you feature by feature the ideal of a true and perfect woman and how as you contemplate the finished marvel your homage grows into worship of the intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere breath mere words and you call to mind now as i speak how the poet with stern fidelity to the history of all humanity delivers this beautiful child of his heart and his brain over to the trials and sorrows that must come to all sooner or later that abide in the earth and how the pathetic story culminates in that apostropheso wild so regretful so full of mournful retrospection the lines run thus                          alasalasaalas                          alasalas and so on i do not remember the rest but taken together it seems to me that poem is the noblest tribute to woman that human genius has ever brought forthand i feel that if i were to talk hours i could not do my great theme completer or more graceful justice than i have now done in simply quoting that poets matchless words the phases of the womanly nature are infinite in their variety take any type of woman and you shall find in it something to respect something to admire something to love and you shall find the whole joining you heart and hand who was more patriotic than joan of arc who was braver who has given us a grander instance of selfsacrificing devotion ah you remember you remember well what a throb of pain what a great tidal wave of grief swept over us all when joan of arc fell at waterloo who does not sorrow for the loss of sappho the sweet singer of israel who among us does not miss the gentle ministrations the softening influences the humble piety of lucretia borgia who can join in the heartless libel that says woman is extravagant in dress when he can look back and call to mind our simple and lowly mother eve arrayed in her modification of the highland costume sir women have been soldiers women have been painters women have been poets as long as language lives the name of cleopatra will live and not because she conquered george iiibut because she wrote those divine lines                     let dogs delight to bark and bite                     for god hath made them so  the story of the world is adorned with the names of illustrious ones of our own sexsome of them sons of st andrew tooscott bruce burns the warrior wallace ben nevisthe gifted ben lomond and the great new scotchman ben disraelimr benjamin disraeli at that time prime minister of england had just been elected lord rector of glasgow university and had made a speech which gave rise to a world of discussionout of the great plains of history tower whole mountain ranges of sublime women the queen of sheba josephine semiramis sairey gamp the list is endlessbut i will not call the mighty roll the names rise up in your own memories at the mere suggestion luminous with the glory of deeds that cannot die hallowed by the loving worship of the good and the true of all epochs and all climes suffice it for our pride and our honor that we in our day have added to it such names as those of grace darling and florence nightingale woman is all that she should be gentle patient longsuffering trustful unselfish full of generous impulses it is her blessed mission to comfort the sorrowing plead for the erring encourage the faint of purpose succor the distressed uplift the fallen befriend the friendlessin a word afford the healing of her sympathies and a home in her heart for all the bruised and persecuted children that knock at its hospitable door and when i say god bless her there is none among us who has known the ennobling affection of a wife or the steadfast devotion of a mother but in his heart will say amen       womans press club            on october 27 1900 the new york womans press club gave a tea           in carnegie hall  mr clemens was the guest of honor  if i were asked an opinion i would call this an ungrammatical nation there is no such thing as perfect grammar and i dont always speak good grammar myself but i have been foregathering for the past few days with professors of american universities and ive heard them all say things like this he dont like to do it there was a stir oh youll hear that tonight if you listen or he would have liked to have done it youll catch some educated americans saying that when these men take pen in hand they write with as good grammar as any but the moment they throw the pen aside they throw grammatical morals aside with it  to illustrate the desirability and possibility of concentration i must tell you a story of my little sixyearold daughter the governess had been teaching her about the reindeer and as the custom was she related it to the family she reduced the history of that reindeer to two or three sentences when the governess could not have put it into a page she said the reindeer is a very swift animal a reindeer once drew a sled four hundred miles in two hours she appended the comment this was regarded as extraordinary and concluded when that reindeer was done drawing that sled four hundred miles in two hours it died  as a final instance of the force of limitations in the development of concentration i must mention that beautiful creature helen keller whom i have known for these many years i am filled with the wonder of her knowledge acquired because shut out from all distraction if i could have been deaf dumb and blind i also might have arrived at something       votes for women            at the annual meeting of the hebrew technical school for girls           held in the temple emmanuel january 20 1901            mr clemens was introduced by president meyer who said in           one of mr clemenss works he expressed his opinion of men           saying he had no choice between hebrew and gentile black men           or white to him all men were alike  but i never could find           that he expressed his opinion of women perhaps that opinion           was so exalted that he could not express it  we shall now be           called to hear what he thinks of women  ladies and gentlemenit is a small help that i can afford but it is just such help that one can give as coming from the heart through the mouth the report of mr meyer was admirable and i was as interested in it as you have been why im twice as old as he and ive had so much experience that i would say to him when he makes his appeal for help dont make it for today or tomorrow but collect the money on the spot  we are all creatures of sudden impulse we must be worked up by steam as it were get them to write their wills now or it may be too late byandby fifteen or twenty years ago i had an experience i shall never forget i got into a church which was crowded by a sweltering and panting multitude the city missionary of our townhartfordmade a telling appeal for help he told of personal experiences among the poor in cellars and top lofts requiring instances of devotion and help the poor are always good to the poor when a person with his millions gives a hundred thousand dollars it makes a great noise in the world but he does not miss it its the widows mite that makes no noise but does the best work  i remember on that occasion in the hartford church the collection was being taken up the appeal had so stirred me that i could hardly wait for the hat or plate to come my way i had four hundred dollars in my pocket and i was anxious to drop it in the plate and wanted to borrow more but the plate was so long in coming my way that the feverheat of beneficence was going down lower and lowergoing down at the rate of a hundred dollars a minute the plate was passed too late when it finally came to me my enthusiasm had gone down so much that i kept my four hundred dollarsand stole a dime from the plate so you see time sometimes leads to crime  oh many a time have i thought of that and regretted it and i adjure you all to give while the fever is on you  referring to womans sphere in life ill say that woman is always right for twentyfive years ive been a womans rights man i have always believed long before my mother died that with her gray hairs and admirable intellect perhaps she knew as much as i did perhaps she knew as much about voting as i  i should like to see the time come when women shall help to make the laws i should like to see that whiplash the ballot in the hands of women as for this citys government i dont want to say much except that it is a shamea shame but if i should live twentyfive years longerand there is no reason why i shouldnti think ill see women handle the ballot if women had the ballot today the state of things in this town would not exist  if all the women in this town had a vote today they would elect a mayor at the next election and they would rise in their might and change the awful state of things now existing here       womanan opinion            address at an early banquet of the washington           correspondents club            the twelfth toast was as follows womanthe pride of any           profession and the jewel of ours  mr presidenti do not know why i should be singled out to receive the greatest distinction of the eveningfor so the office of replying to the toast of woman has been regarded in every age i do not know why i have received his distinction unless it be that i am a trifle less homely than the other members of the club but be this as it may mr president i am proud of the position and you could not have chosen any one who would have accepted it more gladly or labored with a heartier goodwill to do the subject justice than ibecause sir i love the sex i love all the women irrespective of age or color  human intellect cannot estimate what we owe to woman sir she sews on our buttons she mends our clothes she ropes us in at the church fairs she confides in us she tells us whatever she can find out about the little private affairs of the neighbors she gives us good advice and plenty of it she soothes our aching brows she bears our childrenours as a general thing in all relations of life sir it is but a just and graceful tribute to woman to say of her that she is a brick  wheresoever you place woman sirin whatever position or estateshe is an ornament to the place she occupies and a treasure to the world here mr clemens paused looked inquiringly at his hearers and remarked that the applause should come in at this point it came in he resumed his eulogy look at cleopatra look at desdemonalook at florence nightingalelook at joan of arclook at lucretia borgia disapprobation expressed well said mr clemens scratching his head doubtfully suppose we let lucretia slide look at joyce hethlook at mother eve you need not look at her unless you want to but said mr clemens reflectively after a pause eve was ornamental sirparticularly before the fashions changed i repeat sir look at the illustrious names of history look at the widow machreelook at lucy stonelook at elizabeth cady stantonlook at george francis train and sir i say it with bowed head and deepest venerationlook at the mother of washington she raised a boy that could not tell a liecould not tell a lie but he never had any chance it might have been different if he had belonged to the washington newspaper correspondents club  i repeat sir that in whatever position you place a woman she is an ornament to society and a treasure to the world as a sweetheart she has few equals and no superiors as a cousin she is convenient as a wealthy grandmother with an incurable distemper she is precious as a wetnurse she has no equal among men  what sir would the people of the earth be without woman they would be scarce sir almighty scarce then let us cherish her let us protect her let us give her our support our encouragement our sympathy ourselvesif we get a chance  but jesting aside mr president woman is lovable gracious kind of heart beautifulworthy of all respect of all esteem of all deference not any here will refuse to drink her health right cordially in this bumper of wine for each and every one has personally known and loved and honored the very best one of them allhis own mother       advice to girls            in 1907 a young girl whom mr clemens met on the steamer           minnehaha called him grandpa and he called her his           granddaughter  she was attending st timothys school at           catonsville maryland and mr clemens promised her to see her           graduate  he accordingly made the journey from new york on           june 10 1909 and delivered a short address  i dont know what to tell you girls to do mr martin has told you everything you ought to do and now i must give you some donts  there are three things which come to my mind which i consider excellent advice  first girls dont smokethat is dont smoke to excess i am seventythree and a half years old and have been smoking seventythree of them but i never smoke to excessthat is i smoke in moderation only one cigar at a time  second dont drinkthat is dont drink to excess  third dont marryi mean to excess  honesty is the best policy that is an old proverb but you dont want ever to forget it in your journey through life       taxes and morals  address delivered in new york january 22 1906            at the twentyfifth anniversary of the founding of tuskeegee           institute by booker washington mr choate presided and in           introducing mr clemens made fun of him because he made play           his work and that when he worked hardest he did so lying in           bed  i came here in the responsible capacity of policeman to watch mr choate this is an occasion of grave and serious importance and it seems necessary for me to be present so that if he tried to work off any statement that required correction reduction refutation or exposure there would be a tried friend of the public to protect the house he has not made one statement whose veracity fails to tally exactly with my own standard i have never seen a person improve so this makes me thankful and proud of a country that can produce such mentwo such men and all in the same country we cant be with you always we are passing away and thenwell everything will have to stop i reckon it is a sad thought but in spirit i shall still be with you choate tooif he can  every born american among the eighty millions let his creed or destitution of creed be what it may is indisputably a christianto this degree that his moral constitution is christian  there are two kinds of christian morals one private and the other public these two are so distinct so unrelated that they are no more akin to each other than are archangels and politicians during three hundred and sixtythree days in the year the american citizen is true to his christian private morals and keeps undefiled the nations character at its best and highest then in the other two days of the year he leaves his christian private morals at home and carries his christian public morals to the tax office and the polls and does the best he can to damage and undo his whole years faithful and righteous work without a blush he will vote for an unclean boss if that boss is his partys moses without compunction he will vote against the best man in the whole land if he is on the other ticket every year in a number of cities and states he helps put corrupt men in office whereas if he would but throw away his christian public morals and carry his christian private morals to the polls he could promptly purify the public service and make the possession of office a high and honorable distinction  once a year he lays aside his christian private morals and hires a ferryboat and piles up his bonds in a warehouse in new jersey for three days and gets out his christian public morals and goes to the tax office and holds up his hands and swears he wishes he may nevernever if hes got a cent in the world so help him the next day the list appears in the papersa column and a quarter of names in fine print and every man in the list a billionaire and member of a couple of churches i know all those people i have friendly social and criminal relations with the whole lot of them they never miss a sermon when they are sos to be around and they never miss swearingoff day whether they are sos to be around or not  i used to be an honest man i am crumbling noi have crumbled when they assessed me at 75000 a fortnight ago i went out and tried to borrow the money and couldnt then when i found they were letting a whole crop of millionaires live in new york at a third of the price they were charging me i was hurt i was indignant and said this is the last feather i am not going to run this town all by myself in that momentin that memorable momenti began to crumble in fifteen minutes the disintegration was complete in fifteen minutes i had become just a mere moral sandpile and i lifted up my hand along with those seasoned and experienced deacons and swore off every rag of personal property ive got in the world clear down to cork leg glass eye and what is left of my wig  those tax officers were moved they were profoundly moved they had long been accustomed to seeing hardened old grafters act like that and they could endure the spectacle but they were expecting better things of me a chartered professional moralist and they were saddened  i fell visibly in their respect and esteem and i should have fallen in my own except that i had already struck bottom and there wasnt any place to fall to  at tuskeegee they will jump to misleading conclusions from insufficient evidence along with doctor parkhurst and they will deceive the student with the superstition that no gentleman ever swears  look at those good millionaires arent they gentlemen well they swear only once in a year maybe but theres enough bulk to it to make up for the lost time and do they lose anything by it no they dont they save enough in three minutes to support the family seven years when they swear do we shudder nounless they say damn then we do it shrivels us all up yet we ought not to feel so about it because we all sweareverybody including the ladies including doctor parkhurst that strong and brave and excellent citizen but superficially educated  for it is not the word that is the sin it is the spirit back of the word when an irritated lady says oh the spirit back of it is damn and that is the way it is going to be recorded against her it always makes me so sorry when i hear a lady swear like that but if she says damn and says it in an amiable nice way it isnt going to be recorded at all  the idea that no gentleman ever swears is all wrong he can swear and still be a gentleman if he does it in a nice and benevolent and affectionate way the historian john fiske whom i knew well and loved was a spotless and most noble and upright christian gentleman and yet he swore once not exactly that maybe still hebut i will tell you about it  one day when he was deeply immersed in his work his wife came in much moved and profoundly distressed and said i am sorry to disturb you john but i must for this is a serious matter and needs to be attended to at once  then lamenting she brought a grave accusation against their little son she said he has been saying his aunt mary is a fool and his aunt martha is a damned fool mr fiske reflected upon the matter a minute then said oh well its about the distinction i should make between them myself  mr washington i beg you to convey these teachings to your great and prosperous and most beneficent educational institution and add them to the prodigal mental and moral riches wherewith you equip your fortunate proteges for the struggle of life       tammany and croker            mr clemens made his debut as a campaign orator on october 7           1901 advocating the election of seth low for mayor not as a           republican but as a member of the acorns which he described           as a third party having no political affiliation but was           concerned only in the selection of the best candidates and the           best member  great britain had a tammany and a croker a good while ago this tammany was in india and it began its career with the spread of the english dominion after the battle of plassey its first boss was clive a sufficiently crooked person sometimes but straight as a yard stick when compared with the corkscrew crookedness of the second boss warren hastings  that oldtime tammany was the east india companys government and had its headquarters at calcutta ostensibly it consisted of a great council of four persons of whom one was the governorgeneral warren hastings really it consisted of one personwarren hastings for by usurpation he concentrated all authority in himself and governed the country like an autocrat  ostensibly the court of directors sitting in london and representing the vast interests of the stockholders was supreme in authority over the calcutta great council whose membership it appointed and removed at pleasure whose policies it dictated and to whom it conveyed its will in the form of sovereign commands but whenever it suited hastings he ignored even that august bodys authority and conducted the mighty affairs of the british empire in india to suit his own notions  at his mercy was the daily bread of every official every trader every clerk every civil servant big and little in the whole huge india companys machine and the man who hazarded his bread by any failure of subserviency to the boss lost it  now then let the supreme masters of british india the giant corporation of the india company of london stand for the voters of the city of new york let the great council of calcutta stand for tammany let the corrupt and moneygrubbing great hive of serfs which served under the indian tammanys rod stand for new york tammanys serfs let warren hastings stand for richard croker and it seems to me that the parallel is exact and complete and so let us be properly grateful and thank god and our good luck that we didnt invent tammany  edmund burke regarded by many as the greatest orator of all times conducted the case against warren hastings in that renowned trial which lasted years and which promises to keep its renown for centuries to come i wish to quote some of the things he said i wish to imagine him arraigning mr croker and tammany before the voters of new york city and pleading with them for the overthrow of that combined iniquity of the 5th of november and will substitute for my lords read fellowcitizens for kingdom read city for parliamentary process read political campaign for two houses read two parties and so it reads  fellowcitizens i must look upon it as an auspicious circumstance to this cause in which the honor of the city is involved that from the first commencement of our political campaign to this the hour of solemn trial not the smallest difference of opinion has arisen between the two parties  you will see in the progress of this cause that there is not only a long connected systematic series of misdemeanors but an equally connected system of maxims and principles invented to justify them upon both of these you must judge  it is not only the interest of the city of new york now the most considerable part of the city of the americans which is concerned but the credit and honor of the nation itself will be decided by this decision            at a later meeting of the acorn club mr clemens said  tammany is dead and theres no use in blackguarding a corpse  the election makes me think of a story of a man who was dying he had only two minutes to live so he sent for a clergyman and asked him where is the best place to go to he was undecided about it so the minister told him that each place had its advantagesheaven for climate and hell for society       municipal corruption            address at the city club dinner january 41901            bishop potter told how an alleged representative of tammany           hall asked him in effect if he would cease his warfare upon the           police department if a certain captain and inspector were           dismissed  he replied that he would never be satisfied until           the man at the top and the system which permitted evils in           the police department were crushed  the bishop has just spoken of a condition of things which none of us can deny and which ought not to exist that is the lust of gaina lust which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish its ends but we may be sure of one thing and that is that this sort of thing is not universal if it were this country would not be you may put this down as a fact that out of every fifty men fortynine are clean then why is it you may ask that the fortynine dont have things the way they want them ill tell you why it is a good deal has been said here tonight about what is to be accomplished by organization thats just the thing its because the fiftieth fellow and his pals are organized and the other fortynine are not that the dirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time  you may say organize organize organize but there may be so much organization that it will interfere with the work to be done the bishop here had an experience of that sort and told all about it downtown the other night he was painting a barnit was his own barnand yet he was informed that his work must stop he was a nonunion painter and couldnt continue at that sort of job  now all these conditions of which you complain should be remedied and i am here to tell you just how to do it ive been a statesman without salary for many years and i have accomplished great and widespread good i dont know that it has benefited anybody very much even if it was good but i do know that it hasnt harmed me very much and is hasnt made me any richer  we hold the balance of power put up your best men for office and we shall support the better one with the election of the best man for mayor would follow the selection of the best man for police commissioner and chief of police  my first lesson in the craft of statesmanship was taken at an early age fiftyone years ago i was fourteen years old and we had a society in the town i lived in patterned after the freemasons or the ancient order of united farmers or some such thingjust what it was patterned after doesnt matter it had an inside guard and an outside guard and a pastgrand warden and a lot of such things so as to give dignity to the organization and offices to the members  generally speaking it was a pretty good sort of organization and some of the very best boys in the village includingbut i mustnt get personal on an occasion like thisand the society would have got along pretty well had it not been for the fact that there were a certain number of the members who could be bought they got to be an infernal nuisance every time we had an election the candidates had to go around and see the purchasable members the price per vote was paid in doughnuts and it depended somewhat on the appetites of the individuals as to the price of the votes  this thing ran along until some of us the really very best boys in the organization decided that these corrupt practices must stop and for the purpose of stopping them we organized a third party we had a name but we were never known by that name those who didnt like us called us the antidoughnut party but we didnt mind that  we said call us what you please the name doesnt matter we are organized for a principle byandby the election came around and we made a big mistake we were triumphantly beaten that taught us a lesson then and there we decided never again to nominate anybody for anything we decided simply to force the other two parties in the society to nominate their very best men although we were organized for a principle we didnt care much about that principles arent of much account anyway except at electiontime after that you hang them up to let them season  the next time we had an election we told both the other parties that wed beat any candidates put up by any one of them of whom we didnt approve in that election we did business we got the man we wanted i suppose they called us the antidoughnut party because they couldnt buy us with their doughnuts they didnt have enough of them most reformers arrive at their price sooner or later and i suppose we would have had our price but our opponents werent offering anything but doughnuts and those we spurned  now it seems to me that an antidoughnut party is just what is wanted in the present emergency i would have the antidoughnuts felt in every city and hamlet and school district in this state and in the united states i was an antidoughnut in my boyhood and im an antidoughnut still the modern designation is mugwump there used to be quite a number of us mugwumps but i think im the only one left i had a vote this fall and i began to make some inquiries as to what i had better do with it  i dont know anything about finance and i never did but i know some pretty shrewd financiers and they told me that mr bryan wasnt safe on any financial question i said to myself then that it wouldnt do for me to vote for bryan and i rather thoughti know nowthat mckinley wasnt just right on this philippine question and so i just didnt vote for anybody ive got that vote yet and ive kept it clean ready to deposit at some other election it wasnt cast for any wildcat financial theories and it wasnt cast to support the man who sends our boys as volunteers out into the philippines to get shot down under a polluted flag       municipal government  address at the annual dinner of the st nicholas society new york december 6 1900            doctor mackay in his response to the toast st nicholas           referred to mr clemens sayingmark twain is as true a           preacher of true righteousness as any bishop priest or           minister of any church today because he moves men to forget           their faults by cheerful welldoing instead of making them sour           and morbid by everlastingly bending their attention to the           seamy and sober side of life  mr chairman and gentlemen of the st nicholas societythese are indeed prosperous days for me night before last in a speech the bishop of the diocese of new york complimented me for my contribution to theology and tonight the reverend doctor mackay has elected me to the ministry i thanked bishop potter then for his compliment and i thank doctor mackay now for that promotion i think that both have discerned in me what i long ago discerned but what i was afraid the world would never learn to recognize  in this absence of nine years i find a great improvement in the city of new york i am glad to speak on that as a toastthe city of new york some say it has improved because i have been away others and i agree with them say it has improved because i have come back we must judge of a city as of a man by its external appearances and by its inward character in externals the foreigner coming to these shores is more impressed at first by our skyscrapers they are new to him he has not done anything of the sort since he built the tower of babel the foreigner is shocked by them  in the daylight they are ugly they arewell too chimneyfied and too snaggylike a mouth that needs attention from a dentist like a cemetery that is all monuments and no gravestones but at night seen from the river where they are columns towering against the sky all sparkling with light they are fairylike they are beauty more satisfactory to the soul and more enchanting than anything that man has dreamed of since the arabian nights we cant always have the beautiful aspect of things let us make the most of our sights that are beautiful and let the others go when your foreigner makes disagreeable comments on new york by daylight float him down the river at night  what has made these skyscrapers possible is the elevator the cigarbox which the european calls a lift needs but to be compared with our elevators to be appreciated the lift stops to reflect between floors that is all right in a hearse but not in elevators the american elevator acts like the mans patent purgeit worked as the inventor said this purge doesnt waste any time fooling around it attends strictly to business  that newyorkers have the cleanest quickest and most admirable system of street railways in the world has been forced upon you by the abnormal appreciation you have of your hackman we ought always to be grateful to him for that service nobody else would have brought such a system into existence for us we ought to build him a monument we owe him one as much as we owe one to anybody let it be a tall one nothing permanent of course build it of plaster say then gaze at it and realize how grateful we arefor the time beingand then pull it down and throw it on the ashheap thats the way to honor your public heroes  as to our streets i find them cleaner than they used to be i miss those dear old landmarks the symmetrical mountain ranges of dust and dirt that used to be piled up along the streets for the wind and rain to tear down at their pleasure yes new york is cleaner than bombay i realize that i have been in bombay that i now am in new york that it is not my duty to flatter bombay but rather to flatter new york  compared with the wretched attempts of london to light that city new york may fairly be said to be a welllighted city why londons attempt at good lighting is almost as bad as londons attempt at rapid transit there is just one good system of rapid transit in londonthe tube and that of course had been put in by americans perhaps after a while those americans will come back and give new york also a good underground system perhaps they have already begun i have been so busy since i came back that i havent had time as yet to go down cellar  but it is by the laws of the city it is by the manners of the city it is by the ideals of the city it is by the customs of the city and by the municipal government which all these elements correct support and foster by which the foreigner judges the city it is by these that he realizes that new york may indeed hold her head high among the cities of the world it is by these standards that he knows whether to class the city higher or lower than the other municipalities of the world  gentlemen you have the best municipal government in the worldthe purest and the most fragrant the very angels envy you and wish they could establish a government like it in heaven you got it by a noble fidelity to civic duty you got it by stern and everwatchful exertion of the great powers with which you are charged by the rights which were handed down to you by your forefathers by your manly refusal to let base men invade the high places of your government and by instant retaliation when any public officer has insulted you in the citys name by swerving in the slightest from the upright and full performance of his duty it is you who have made this city the envy of the cities of the world god will bless you for itgod will bless you for it why when you approach the final restingplace the angels of heaven will gather at the gates and cry out  here they come show them to the archangels box and turn the limelight on them      china and the philippines            at a dinner given in the waldorfastoria hotel december 1900            winston spencer churchill was introduced by mr clemens  for years ive been a selfappointed missionary to bring about the union of america and the motherland they ought to be united behold america the refuge of the oppressed from everywhere who can pay fifty dollars admissionany one except a chinamanstanding up for human rights everywhere even helping china let people in free when she wants to collect fifty dollars upon them and how unselfishly england has wrought for the open door for all and how piously america has wrought for that open door in all cases where it was not her own  yes as a missionary ive sung my songs of praise and yet i think that england sinned when she got herself into a war in south africa which she could have avoided just as we sinned in getting into a similar war in the philippines mr churchill by his father is an englishman by his mother he is an americanno doubt a blend that makes the perfect man england and america yes we are kin and now that we are also kin in sin there is nothing more to be desired the harmony is complete the blend is perfect       theoretical morals            the new vagabonds club of london made up of the leading           younger literary men of the day gave a dinner in honor of mr           and mrs clemens july 8 1899  it has always been difficultleave that word difficultnot exceedingly difficult but just difficult nothing more than that not the slightest shade to add to thatjust difficultto respond properly in the right phraseology when compliments are paid to me but it is more than difficult when the compliments are paid to a better than imy wife  and while i am not here to testify against myselfi cant be expected to do so a prisoner in your own country is not admitted to do soas to which member of the family wrote my books i could say in general that really i wrote the books myself my wife puts the facts in and they make it respectable my modesty wont suffer while compliments are being paid to literature and through literature to my family i cant get enough of them  i am curiously situated tonight it so rarely happens that i am introduced by a humorist i am generally introduced by a person of grave walk and carriage that makes the proper background of gravity for brightness i am going to alter to suit and haply i may say some humorous things  when you start with a blaze of sunshine and upburst of humor when you begin with that the proper office of humor is to reflect to put you into that pensive mood of deep thought to make you think of your sins if you wish half an hour to fly humor makes me reflect now tonight it sets the thinking machinery in motion always when i am thinking there come suggestions of what i am and what we all are and what we are coming to a sermon comes from my lips always when i listen to a humorous speech  i seize the opportunity to throw away frivolities to say something to plant the seed and make all better than when i came in mr grossmiths remarks there was a subtle something suggesting my favorite theory of the difference between theoretical morals and practical morals i try to instil practical morals in the place of theatricali mean theoretical but as an addenduman annexsomething added to theoretical morals  when your chairman said it was the first time he had ever taken the chair he did not mean that he had not taken lots of other things he attended my first lecture and took notes this indicated the mans disposition there was nothing else flying round so he took notes he would have taken anything he could get  i can bring a moral to bear here which shows the difference between theoretical morals and practical morals theoretical morals are the sort you get on your mothers knee in good books and from the pulpit you gather them in your head and not in your heart they are theory without practice without the assistance of practice to perfect them it is difficult to teach a child to be honest dont steal  i will teach you how it should be done lead you into temptation teach you how to steal so that you may recognize when you have stolen and feel the proper pangs it is no good going round and bragging you have never taken the chair  as by the fires of experience so by commission of crime you learn real morals commit all the crimes familiarize yourself with all sins take them in rotation there are only two or three thousand of them stick to it commit two or three every day and byandby you will be proof against them when you are through you will be proof against all sins and morally perfect you will be vaccinated against every possible commission of them this is the only way  i will read you a written statement upon the subject that i wrote three years ago to read to the sabbathschools here the lecturer turned his pockets out but without success no i have left it at home still it was a mere statement of fact illustrating the value of practical morals produced by the commission of crime  it was in my boyhood just a statement of fact reading is only more formal merely facts merely pathetic facts which i can state so as to be understood it relates to the first time i ever stole a watermelon that is i think it was the first time anyway it was right along there somewhere  i stole it out of a farmers wagon while he was waiting on another customer stole is a harsh term i withdrewi retired that watermelon i carried it to a secluded corner of a lumberyard i broke it open it was greenthe greenest watermelon raised in the valley that year  the minute i saw it was green i was sorry and began to reflectreflection is the beginning of reform if you dont reflect when you commit a crime then that crime is of no use it might just as well have been committed by some one else you must reflect or the value is lost you are not vaccinated against committing it again  i began to reflect i said to myself what ought a boy to do who has stolen a green watermelon what would george washington do the father of his country the only american who could not tell a lie what would he do there is only one right high noble thing for any boy to do who has stolen a watermelon of that class he must make restitution he must restore that stolen property to its rightful owner i said i would do it when i made that good resolution i felt it to be a noble uplifting obligation i rose up spiritually stronger and refreshed i carried that watermelon backwhat was left of itand restored it to the farmer and made him give me a ripe one in its place  now you see that this constant impact of crime upon crime protects you against further commission of crime it builds you up a man cant become morally perfect by stealing one or a thousand green watermelons but every little helps  i was at a great school yesterday st pauls where for four hundred years they have been busy with brains and building up england by producing pepys miltons and marlboroughs six hundred boys left to nothing in the world but theoretical morality i wanted to become the professor of practical morality but the high master was away so i suppose i shall have to go on making my living the same old wayby adding practical to theoretical morality  what are the glory that was greece the grandeur that was rome compared to the glory and grandeur and majesty of a perfected morality such as you see before you  the new vagabonds are old vagabonds undergoing the old sort of reform you drank my health i hope i have not been unuseful take this system of morality to your hearts take it home to your neighbors and your graves and i hope that it will be a long time before you arrive there       laymans sermon            the young mens christian association asked mr clemens to           deliver a lay sermon at the majestic theatre new york march           4 1906  more than five thousand young men tried to get into           the theatre and in a short time traffic was practically           stopped in the adjacent streets  the police reserves had to be           called out to thin the crowd  doctor fagnani had said           something before about the police episode and mr clemens took           it up  i have been listening to what was said here and there is in it a lesson of citizenship you created the police and you are responsible for them one must pause therefore before criticising them too harshly they are citizens just as we are a little of citizenship ought to be taught at the mothers knee and in the nursery citizenship is what makes a republic monarchies can get along without it what keeps a republic on its legs is good citizenship  organization is necessary in all things it is even necessary in reform i was an organization myself oncefor twelve hours i was in chicago a few years ago about to depart for new york there were with me mr osgood a publisher and a stenographer i picked out a stateroom on a train the principal feature of which was that it contained the privilege of smoking the train had started but a short time when the conductor came in and said that there had been a mistake made and asked that we vacate the apartment i refused but when i went out on the platform osgood and the stenographer agreed to accept a section they were too modest  now i am not modest i was born modest but it didnt last i asserted myself insisted upon my rights and finally the pullman conductor and the train conductor capitulated and i was left in possession  i went into the diningcar the next morning for breakfast ordinarily i only care for coffee and rolls but this particular morning i espied an importantlooking man on the other side of the car eating broiled chicken i asked for broiled chicken and i was told by the waiter and later by the diningcar conductor that there was no broiled chicken there must have been an argument for the pullman conductor came in and remarked if he wants broiled chicken give it to him if you havent got it on the train stop somewhere it will be better for all concerned i got the chicken  it is from experiences such as these that you get your education of life and you string them into jewels or into tinware as you may choose i have received recently several letters asking my counsel or advice the principal request is for some incident that may prove helpful to the young there were a lot of incidents in my career to help me alongsometimes they helped me along faster than i wanted to go  here is such a request it is a telegram from joplin missouri and it reads in what one of your works can we find the definition of a gentleman  i have not answered that telegram either i couldnt it seems to me that if any man has just merciful and kindly instincts he would be a gentleman for he would need nothing else in the world  i received the other day a letter from my old friend william dean howellshowells the head of american literature no one is able to stand with him he is an old old friend of mine and he writes me tomorrow i shall be sixtynine years old why i am surprised at howells writing that i have known him longer than that im sorry to see a man trying to appear so young lets see howells says now i see you have been burying patrick i suppose he was old too  no he was never oldpatrick he came to us thirtysix years ago he was my coachman on the morning that i drove my young bride to our new home he was a young irishman slender tall lithe honest truthful and he never changed in all his life he really was with us but twentyfive years for he did not go with us to europe but he never regarded that as separation as the children grew up he was their guide he was all honor honesty and affection he was with us in new hampshire with us last summer and his hair was just as black his eyes were just as blue his form just as straight and his heart just as good as on the day we first met in all the long years patrick never made a mistake he never needed an order he never received a command he knew i have been asked for my idea of an ideal gentleman and i give it to you patrick mcaleer       university settlement society            after the serious addresses were made seth low introduced mr           clemens at the settlement house february 2 1901  the older we grow the greater becomes our wonder at how much ignorance one can contain without bursting ones clothes ten days ago i did not know anything about the university settlement except what id read in the pamphlets sent me now after being here and hearing mrs hewitt and mrs thomas it seems to me i know of nothing like it at all its a charity that carries no humiliation with it marvellous it is to think of schools where you dont have to drive the children in but drive them out it was not so in my day  downstairs just now i saw a dancing lesson going on you must pay a cent for a lesson you cant get it for nothing thats the reason i never learned to dance  but it was the pawnbrokers shop you have here that interested me mightily ive known something about pawnbrokers shops in my time but here you have a wonderful plan the ordinary pawnbroker charges thirtysix per cent a year for a loan and ive paid more myself but here a man or woman in distress can obtain a loan for one per cent a month its wonderful  ive been interested in all ive heard today especially in the romances recounted by mrs thomas which reminds me that i have a romance of my own in my autobiography which i am building for the instruction of the world  in san francisco many years ago when i was a newspaper reporter perhaps i should say i had been and was willing to be a pawnbroker was taking care of what property i had there was a friend of mine a poet out of a job and he was having a hard time of it too there was passage in it but i guess ive got to keep that for the autobiography  well my friend the poet thought his life was a failure and i told him i thought it was and then he said he thought he ought to commit suicide and i said all right which was disinterested advice to a friend in trouble but like all such advice there was just a little bit of selfinterest back of it for if i could get a scoop on the other newspapers i could get a job  the poet could be spared and so largely for his own good and partly for mine i kept the thing in his mind which was necessary as wouldbe suicides are very changeable aid hard to hold to their purpose he had a preference for a pistol which was an extravagance for we hadnt enough between us to hire a pistol a fork would have been easier  and so he concluded to drown himself and i said it was an excellent ideathe only trouble being that he was so good a swimmer so we went down to the beach i went along to see that the thing was done right then something most romantic happened there came in on the sea something that had been on its way for three years it rolled in across the broad pacific with a message that was full of meaning to that poor poet and cast itself at his feet it was a lifepreserver this was a complication and then i had an ideahe never had any especially when he was going to write poetry i suggested that we pawn the lifepreserver and get a revolver  the pawnbroker gave us an old derringer with a bullet as big as a hickory nut when he heard that it was only a poet that was going to kill himself he did not quibble well we succeeded in sending a bullet right through his head it was a terrible moment when he placed that pistol against his forehead and stood for an instant i said oh pull the trigger and he did and cleaned out all the gray matter in his brains it carried the poetic faculty away and now hes a useful member of society  now therefore i realize that theres no more beneficent institution than this penny fund of yours and i want all the poets to know this i did think about writing you a check but now i think ill send you a few copies of what one of your little members called strawberry finn       public education association            address at a meeting of the berkeley lyceum new york           november 23 1900  i dont suppose that i am called here as an expert on education for that would show a lack of foresight on your part and a deliberate intention to remind me of my shortcomings  as i sat here looking around for an idea it struck me that i was called for two reasons one was to do good to me a poor unfortunate traveller on the worlds wide ocean by giving me a knowledge of the nature and scope of your society and letting me know that others beside myself have been of some use in the world the other reason that i can see is that you have called me to show by way of contrast what education can accomplish if administered in the right sort of doses  your worthy president said that the school pictures which have received the admiration of the world at the paris exposition have been sent to russia and this was a compliment from that governmentwhich is very surprising to me why it is only an hour since i read a cablegram in the newspapers beginning russia proposes to retrench i was not expecting such a thunderbolt and i thought what a happy thing it will be for russians when the retrenchment will bring home the thirty thousand russian troops now in manchuria to live in peaceful pursuits i thought this was what germany should do also without delay and that france and all the other nations in china should follow suit  why should not china be free from the foreigners who are only making trouble on her soil if they would only all go home what a pleasant place china would be for the chinese we do not allow chinamen to come here and i say in all seriousness that it would be a graceful thing to let china decide who shall go there  china never wanted foreigners any more than foreigners wanted chinamen and on this question i am with the boxers every time the boxer is a patriot he loves his country better than he does the countries of other people i wish him success the boxer believes in driving us out of his country i am a boxer too for i believe in driving him out of our country  when i read the russian despatch further my dream of world peace vanished it said that the vast expense of maintaining the army had made it necessary to retrench and so the government had decided that to support the army it would be necessary to withdraw the appropriation from the public schools this is a monstrous idea to us  we believe that out of the public school grows the greatness of a nation  it is curious to reflect how history repeats itself the world over why i remember the same thing was done when i was a boy on the mississippi river there was a proposition in a township there to discontinue public schools because they were too expensive an old farmer spoke up and said if they stopped the schools they would not save anything because every time a school was closed a jail had to be built  its like feeding a dog on his own tail hell never get fat i believe it is better to support schools than jails  the work of your association is better and shows more wisdom than the czar of russia and all his people this is not much of a compliment but its the best ive got in stock       education and citizenship            on the evening of may 14 1908 the alumni of the college of           the city of new york celebrated the opening of the new college           buildings at a banquet in the waldorf astoria  mr clemens           followed mayor mcclellan  i agreed when the mayor said that there was not a man within hearing who did not agree that citizenship should be placed above everything else even learning  have you ever thought about this is there a college in the whole country where there is a chair of good citizenship there is a kind of bad citizenship which is taught in the schools but no real good citizenship taught there are some which teach insane citizenship bastard citizenship but that is all patriotism yes but patriotism is usually the refuge of the scoundrel he is the man who talks the loudest  you can begin that chair of citizenship in the college of the city of new york you can place it above mathematics and literature and that is where it belongs  we used to trust in god i think it was in 1863 that some genius suggested that it be put upon the gold and silver coins which circulated among the rich they didnt put it on the nickels and coppers because they didnt think the poor folks had any trust in god  good citizenship would teach accuracy of thinking and accuracy of statement now that motto on the coin is an overstatement those congressmen had no right to commit this whole country to a theological doctrine but since they did congress ought to state what our creed should be  there was never a nation in the world that put its whole trust in god it is a statement made on insufficient evidence leaving out the gamblers the burglars and the plumbers perhaps we do put our trust in god after a fashion but after all it is an overstatement  if the cholera or black plague should come to these shores perhaps the bulk of the nation would pray to be delivered from it but the rest would put their trust in the health board of the city of new york  i read in the papers within the last day or two of a poor young girl who they said was a leper did the people in that populous section of the country where she wasdid they put their trust in god the girl was afflicted with the leprosy a disease which cannot be communicated from one person to another  yet instead of putting their trust in god they harried that poor creature shelterless and friendless from place to place exactly as they did in the middle ages when they made lepers wear bells so that people could be warned of their approach and avoid them perhaps those people in the middle ages thought they were putting their trust in god  the president ordered the removal of that motto from the coin and i thought that it was well i thought that overstatement should not stay there but i think it would better read within certain judicious limitations we trust in god and if there isnt enough room on the coin for this why enlarge the coin  now i want to tell a story about jumping at conclusions it was told to me by bram stoker and it concerns a christening there was a little clergyman who was prone to jump at conclusions sometimes one day he was invited to officiate at a christening he went there sat the relativesintelligentlooking relatives they were the little clergymans instinct came to him to make a great speech he was given to flights of oratory that waya very dangerous thing for often the wings which take one into clouds of oratorical enthusiasm are wax and melt up there and down you come  but the little clergyman couldnt resist he took the child in his arms and holding it looked at it a moment it wasnt much of a child it was little like a sweetpotato then the little clergyman waited impressively and then i see in your countenances he said disappointment of him i see you are disappointed with this baby why because he is so little my friends if you had but the power of looking into the future you might see that great things may come of little things there is the great ocean holding the navies of the world which comes from little drops of water no larger than a womans tears there are the great constellations in the sky made up of little bits of stars oh if you could consider his future you might see that he might become the greatest poet of the universe the greatest warrior the world has ever known greater than caesar than hannibal thanerer turning to the fatherwhats his name  the father hesitated then whispered back his name well his name is mary ann       courage            at a beefsteak dinner given by artists caricaturists and           humorists of new york city april 18 1908 mr clemens mr h           h rogers and mr patrick mccarren were the guests of honor           each wore a white apron and each made a short speech  in the matter of courage we all have our limits  there never was a hero who did not have his bounds i suppose it may be said of nelson and all the others whose courage has been advertised that there came times in their lives when their bravery knew it had come to its limit  i have found mine a good many times sometimes this was expectedoften it was unexpected i know a man who is not afraid to sleep with a rattlesnake but you could not get him to sleep with a safetyrazor  i never had the courage to talk across a long narrow room i should be at the end of the room facing all the audience if i attempt to talk across a room i find myself turning this way and that and thus at alternate periods i have part of the audience behind me you ought never to have any part of the audience behind you you never can tell what they are going to do  ill sit down       the dinner to mr choate            at a dinner given in honor of ambassador joseph h choate at           the lotos club november 24 7902            the speakers among others were senator depew william henry           white speaker thomas reed and mr choate  mr clemens spoke           in part as follows  the greatness of this country rests on two anecdotes the first one is that of washington and his hatchet representing the foundation of true speaking which is the characteristic of our people the second one is an old one and ive been waiting to hear it tonight but as nobody has told it yet i will tell it  youve heard it before and youll hear it many many times more it is an anecdote of our guest of the time when he was engaged as a young man with a gentle hebrew in the process of skinning the client the main part in that business is the collection of the bill for services in skinning the man services is the term used in that craft for the operation of that kinddiplomatic in its nature  choatescorespondentmade out a bill for 500 for his services so called but choate told him he had better leave the matter to him and the next day he collected the bill for the services and handed the hebrew 5000 saying thats your half of the loot and inducing that memorable response almost thou persuadest me to be a christian  the deepthinkers didnt merely laugh when that happened they stopped to think and said theres a rising man he must be rescued from the law and consecrated to diplomacy the commercial advantages of a great nation lie there in that mans keeping we no longer require a man to take care of our moral character before the world washington and his anecdote have done that we require a man to take care of our commercial prosperity  mr choate has carried that trait with him and as mr carnegie has said he has worked like a mole underground  we see the result when american railroad iron is sold so cheap in england that the poorest family can have it he has so beguiled that cabinet of england  he has been spreading the commerce of this nation and has depressed english commerce in the same ratio this was the principle underlying that anecdote and the wise men saw it the principle of give and takegive one and take tenthe principle of diplomacy       on stanley and livingstone            mr clemens was entertained at dinner by the whitefriars club           london at the mitre tavern on the evening of august 6 1872           in reply to the toast in his honor he said  gentlemeni thank you very heartily indeed for this expression of kindness toward me what i have done for england and civilization in the arduous affairs which i have engaged in that is good that is so smooth that i will say it again and againwhat i have done for england and civilization in the arduous part i have performed i have done with a singlehearted devotion and with no hope of reward i am proud i am very proud that it was reserved for me to find doctor livingstone and for mr stanley to get all the credit i hunted for that man in africa all over seventyfive or one hundred parishes thousands and thousands of miles in the wilds and deserts all over the place sometimes riding negroes and sometimes travelling by rail i didnt mind the rail or anything else so that i didnt come in for the tar and feathers i found that man at ujijia place you may remember if you have ever been thereand it was a very great satisfaction that i found him just in the nick of time i found that poor old man deserted by his niggers and by his geographers deserted by all of his kind except the gorillasdejected miserable famishing absolutely famishingbut he was eloquent just as i found him he had eaten his last elephant and he said to me god knows where i shall get another he had nothing to wear except his venerable and honorable naval suit and nothing to eat but his diary  but i said to him it is all right i have discovered you and stanley will be here by the fouroclock train and will discover you officially and then we will turn to and have a reglar good time i said cheer up for stanley has got corn ammunition glass beads hymnbooks whiskey and everything which the human heart can desire he has got all kinds of valuables including telegraphpoles and a few cartloads of money by this time communication has been made with the land of bibles and civilization and property will advance and then we surveyed all that country from ujiji through unanogo and other places to unyanyembe i mention these names simply for your edification nothing moredo not expect itparticularly as intelligence to the royal geographical society and then having filled up the old man we were all too full for utterance and departed we have since then feasted on honors  stanley has received a snuffbox and i have received considerable snuff he has got to write a book and gather in the rest of the credit and i am going to levy on the copyright and to collect the money nothing comes amiss to mecash or credit but seriously i do feel that stanley is the chief man and an illustrious one and i do applaud him with all my heart whether he is an american or a welshman by birth or one or both matters not to me so far as i am personally concerned i am simply here to stay a few months and to see english people and to learn english manners and customs and to enjoy myself so the simplest thing i can do is to thank you for the toast you have honored me with and for the remarks you have made and to wish health and prosperity to the whitefriars club and to sink down to my accustomed level       henry m stanley            address delivered in boston november 1886            mr clemens introduced mr stanley  ladies and gentlemen if any should ask why is it that you are here as introducer of the lecturer i should answer that i happened to be around and was asked to perform this function i was quite willing to do so and as there was no sort of need of an introduction anyway it could be necessary only that some person come forward for a moment and do an unnecessary thing and this is quite in my line now to introduce so illustrious a name as henry m stanley by any detail of what the man has done is clear aside from my purpose that would be stretching the unnecessary to an unconscionable degree when i contrast what i have achieved in my measurably brief life with what he has achieved in his possibly briefer one the effect is to sweep utterly away the tenstory edifice of my own selfappreciation and leave nothing behind but the cellar when you compare these achievements of his with the achievements of really great men who exist in history the comparison i believe is in his favor i am not here to disparage columbus  no i wont do that but when you come to regard the achievements of these two men columbus and stanley from the standpoint of the difficulties they encountered the advantage is with stanley and against columbus now columbus started out to discover america well he didnt need to do anything at all but sit in the cabin of his ship and hold his grip and sail straight on and america would discover itself here it was barring his passage the whole length and breadth of the south american continent and he couldnt get by it hed got to discover it but stanley started out to find doctor livingstone who was scattered abroad as you may say over the length and breadth of a vast slab of africa as big as the united states  it was a blind kind of search he was the worst scattered of men but i will throw the weight of this introduction upon one very peculiar feature of mr stanleys character and that is his indestructible americanisman americanism which he is proud of and in this day and time when it is the custom to ape and imitate english methods and fashion it is like a breath of fresh air to stand in the presence of this untainted american citizen who has been caressed and complimented by half of the crowned heads of europe who could clothe his body from his head to his heels with the orders and decorations lavished upon him and yet when the untitled myriads of his own country put out their hands in welcome to him and greet him well done through the congress of the united states that is the crown that is worth all the rest to him he is a product of institutions which exist in no other country on earthinstitutions that bring out all that is best and most heroic in a man i introduce henry m stanley       dinner to mr jerome            a dinner to express their confidence in the integrity and good           judgment of districtattorney jerome was given at delmonicos           by over three hundred of his admirers on the evening of may 7           1909  indeed that is very sudden i was not informed that the verdict was going to depend upon my judgment but that makes not the least difference in the world when you already know all about it it is not any matter when you are called upon to express it you can get up and do it and my verdict has already been recorded in my heart and in my head as regards mr jerome and his administration of the criminal affairs of this county  i agree with everything mr choate has said in his letter regarding mr jerome i agree with everything mr shepard has said and i agree with everything mr jerome has said in his own commendation and i thought mr jerome was modest in that if he had been talking about another officer of this county he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did  i voted for mr jerome in those old days and i should like to vote for him again if he runs for any office i moved out of new york and that is the reason i suppose i cannot vote for him again there may be some way but i have not found it out but now i am a farmera farmer up in connecticut and winning laurels those people already speak with such high favor admiration of my farming and they say that i am the only man that has ever come to that region who could make two blades of grass grow where only three grew before  well i cannot vote for him you see that as it stands now i cannot i am crippled in that way and to that extent for i would ever so much like to do it i am not a congress and i cannot distribute pensions and i dont know any other legitimate way to buy a vote but if i should think of any legitimate way i shall make use of it and then i shall vote for mr jerome       henry irving            the dramatic and literary society of london gave a welcomehome           dinner to sir henry irving at the savoy hotel london june 9           1900  in proposing the toast of the drama mr clemens said  i find my task a very easy one i have been a dramatist for thirty years i have had an ambition in all that time to overdo the work of the spaniard who said he left behind him four hundred dramas when he died i leave behind me four hundred and fifteen and am not yet dead  the greatest of all the arts is to write a drama it is a most difficult thing it requires the highest talent possible and the rarest gifts no there is another talent that ranks with itfor anybody can write a dramai had four hundred of thembut to get one accepted requires real ability and i have never had that felicity yet  but human nature is so constructed we are so persistent that when we know that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks about it we go on exploiting that talent year after year as i have done i shall go on writing dramas and some day the impossible may happen but i am not looking for it  in writing plays the chief thing is novelty the world grows tired of solid forms in all the arts i struck a new idea myself years ago i was not surprised at it i was always expecting it would happen a person who has suffered disappointment for many years loses confidence and i thought i had better make inquiries before i exploited my new idea of doing a drama in the form of a dream so i wrote to a great authority on knowledge of all kinds and asked him whether it was new  i could depend upon him he lived in my dear home in americathat dear home dearer to me through taxes he sent me a list of plays in which that old device had been used and he said that there was also a modern lot he travelled back to china and to a play dated two thousand six hundred years before the christian era he said he would follow it up with a list of the previous plays of the kind and in his innocence would have carried them back to the flood  that is the most discouraging thing that has ever happened to me in my dramatic career i have done a world of good in a silent and private way and have furnished sir henry irving with plays and plays and plays what has he achieved through that influence see where he stands nowon the summit of his art in two worlds and it was i who put him therethat partly put him there  i need not enlarge upon the influence the drama has exerted upon civilization it has made good morals entertaining i am to be followed by mr pinero i conceive that we stand at the head of the profession he has not written as many plays as i have but he has lead that godgiven talent which i lack of working hem off on the manager i couple his name with this toast and add the hope that his influence will be supported in exercising his masterly handicraft in that great gift and that he will long live to continue his fine work       dinner to hamilton w mabie            address delivered april 29 1901            in introducing mr clemens doctor van dyke said            the longer the speaking goes on tonight the more i wonder how           i got this job and the only explanation i can give for it is           that it is the same kind of compensation for the number of           articles i have sent to the outlook to be rejected by hamilton           w mabie  there is one man here tonight that has a job cut           out for him that none of you would have hada man whose humor           has put a girdle of light around the globe and whose sense of           humor has been an example for all five continents  he is going           to speak to you  gentlemen you know him best as mark twain  mr chairman and gentlementhis man knows now how it feels to be the chief guest and if he has enjoyed it he is the first man i have ever seen in that position that did enjoy it and i know by sideremarks which he made to me before his ordeal came upon him that he was feeling as some of the rest of us have felt under the same circumstances he was afraid that he would not do himself justice but he didto my surprise it is a most serious thing to be a chief guest on an occasion like this and it is admirable it is fine it is a great compliment to a man that he shall come out of it so gloriously as mr mabie came out of it tonightto my surprise he did it well  he appears to be editor of the outlook and notwithstanding that i have every admiration because when everything is said concerning the outlook after all one must admit that it is frank in its delinquencies that it is outspoken in its departures from fact that it is vigorous in its mistaken criticisms of men like me i have lived in this world a long long time and i know you must not judge a man by the editorials that he puts in his paper a man is always better than his printed opinions a man always reserves to himself on the inside a purity and an honesty and a justice that are a credit to him whereas the things that he prints are just the reverse  oh yes you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper even in an ordinary secular paper a man must observe some care about it he must be better than the principles which he puts in print and that is the case with mr mabie why to see what he writes about me and the missionaries you would think he did not have any principles but that is mr mabie in his public capacity mr mabie in his private capacity is just as clean a man as i am  in this very room a month or two ago some people admired that portrait some admired this but the great majority fastened on that and said there is a portrait that is a beautiful piece of art when that portrait is a hundred years old it will suggest what were the manners and customs in our time just as they talk about mr mabie tonight in that enthusiastic way pointing out the various virtues of the man and the grace of his spirit and all that so was that portrait talked about they were enthusiastic just as we men have been over the character and the work of mr mabie and when they were through they said that portrait fine as it is that work beautiful as it is that piece of humanity on that canvas gracious and fine as it is does not rise to those perfections that exist in the man himself come up mr alexander the reference was to james w alexander who happened to be sittingbeneath the portrait of himself on the wall now i should come up and show myself but he cannot do it he cannot do it he was born that way he was reared in that way let his modesty be an example and i wish some of you had it too but that is just what i have been sayingthat portrait fine as it is is not as fine as the man it represents and all the things that have been said about mr mabie and certainly they have been very nobly worded and beautiful still fall short of the real mabie       introducing nye and riley            james whitcomb riley and edgar wilson nye bill nye were to           give readings in tremont temple boston november 1888  mr           clemens was induced to introduce messrs riley and nye  his           appearance on the platform was a surprise to the audience and           when they recognized him there was a tremendous demonstration  i am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you and at the same time get acquainted with them myself i have seen them more than once for a moment but have not had the privilege of knowing them personally as intimately as i wanted to i saw them first a great many years ago when mr barnum had them and they were just fresh from siam the ligature was their best hold then the literature became their best hold later when one of them committed an indiscretion and they had to cut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff  in that old former time this one was chang that one was eng the sympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary it was so fine so strong so subtle that what the one ate the other digested when one slept the other snored if one sold a thing the other scooped the usufruct this independent and yet dependent action was observable in all the details of their daily lifei mean this quaint and arbitrary distribution of originating cause and resulting effect between the twobetween i may say this dynamo and the other always motor or in other words that the one was always the creating force the other always the utilizing force no no for while it is true that within certain welldefined zones of activity the one was always dynamo and the other always motor within certain other welldefined zones these positions became exactly reversed  for instance in moral matters mr chang riley was always dynamo mr eng nye was always motor for while mr chang riley had a highin fact an abnormally high and fine moral sense he had no machinery to work it with whereas mr eng nye who hadnt any moral sense at all and hasnt yet was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a noble deed through if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable terms outside  in intellectual matters on the other hand mr eng nye was always dynamo mr chang riley was always motor mr eng nye had a stately intellect but couldnt make it go mr chang riley hadnt but could that is to say that while mr chang riley couldnt think things himself he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and weaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material  thus working together they made a strong team laboring together they could do miracles but break the circuit and both were impotent it has remained so to this day they must travel together hoe and plant and plough and reap and sell their public together or theres no result  i have made this explanation this analysis this vivisection so to speak in order that you may enjoy these delightful adventurers understandingly when mr eng nyes deep and broad and limpid philosophies flow by in front of you refreshing all the regions round about with their gracious floods you will remember that it isnt his water its the other mans and he is only working the pump and when mr chang riley enchants your ear and soothes your spirit and touches your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetryas sweet and as genuine as any that his friends the birds and the bees make about his other friends the woods and the flowersyou will remember while placing justice where justice is due that it isnt his music but the other manshe is only turning the crank  i beseech for these visitors a fair field a singleminded oneeyed umpire and a score bulletin barren of gooseeggs if they earn itand i judge they will and hope they will mr james whitcomb chang riley will now go to the bat       dinner to whitelaw reid            address at the dinner in honor of ambassador reid given by the           pilgrims club of new york on february 19 1908  i am very proud to respond to this toast as it recalls the proudest day of my life the delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my visit to oxford i shall cherish until i die in that long and distinguished career of mine i value that degree above all other honors when the ship landed even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave an english cheer nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those four weeks no one could pass by me without taking my hand even the policemen ive been in all the principal capitals of christendom in my life and have always been an object of interest to policemen sometimes there was suspicion in their eyes but not always with their puissant hand they would hold up the commerce of the world to let me pass  i noticed in the papers this afternoon a despatch from washington saying that congress would immediately pass a bill restoring to our gold coinage the motto in god we trust im glad of that im glad of that i was troubled when that motto was removed sure enough the prosperities of the whole nation went down in a heap when we ceased to trust in god in that conspicuously advertised way i knew there would be trouble and if pierpont morgan hadnt stepped inbishop lawrence may now add to his message to the old country that we are now trusting in god again so we can discharge mr morgan from his office with honor  mr reid said an hour or so ago something about my ruining my activities last summer they are not ruined they are renewed i am stronger nowmuch stronger i suppose that the spiritual uplift i received increased my physical power more than anything i ever had before i was dancing last night at 130 oclock  mr choate has mentioned mr reids predecessors mr choates head is full of history and some of it is true too i enjoyed hearing him tell about the list of the men who had the place before he did he mentioned a long list of those predecessors people i never heard of before and elected five of them to the presidency by his own vote im glad and proud to find mr reid in that high position because he didnt look it when i knew him forty years ago i was talking to reid the other day and he showed me my autograph on an old paper twenty years old i didnt know i had an autograph twenty years ago nobody ever asked me for it  i remember a dinner i had long ago with whitelaw reid and john hay at reids expense i had another last summer when i was in london at the embassy that choate blackguards so id like to live there  some people say they couldnt live on the salary but i could live on the salary and the nation together some of us dont appreciate what this country can do theres john hay reid choate and me this is the only country in the world where youth talent and energy can reach such heights it shows what we could do without means and what people can do with talent and energy when they find it in people like us  when i first came to new york they were all struggling young men and i am glad to see that they have got on in the world i knew john hay when i had no white hairs in my head and more hair than reid has now those were days of joy and hope reid and hay were on the staff of the tribune i went there once in that old building and i looked all around and i finally found a door ajar and looked in it wasnt reid or hay there but it was horace greeley those were in the days when horace greeley was a king that was the first time i ever saw him and the last  i was admiring him when he stopped and seemed to realize that there was a fine presence there somewhere he tried to smile but he was out of smiles he looked at me a moment and said  what in hdo you want  he began with that word h thats a long word and a profane word i dont remember what the word was now but i recognized the power of it i had never used that language myself but at that moment i was converted it has been a great refuge for me in time of trouble if a man doesnt know that language he cant express himself on strenuous occasions when you have that word at your command let trouble come  but later hay rose and you know what summit whitelaw reid has reached and you see me those two men have regulated troubles of nations and conferred peace upon mankind and in my humble way of which i am quite vain i was the principal moral force in all those great international movements these great men illustrated what i say look at us great peoplewe all come from the dregs of society thats what can be done in this country thats what this country does for you  choate herehe hasnt got anything to say but he says it just the same and he can do it so felicitously too i said long ago he was the handsomest man america ever produced may the progress of civilization always rest on such distinguished men as it has in the past       rogers and railroads            at a banquet given mr h h rogers by the business men of           norfolk va celebrating the opening of the virginian railway           april 3 1909            toastmaster            i have often thought that when the time comes which must come           to all of us when we reach that great way in the great beyond           and the question is propounded what have you done to gain           admission into this great realm if the answer could be           sincerely made i have made men laugh it would be the surest           passport to a welcome entrance  we have here tonight one who           has made millions laughnot the loud laughter that bespeaks           the vacant mind but the laugh of intelligent mirth that helps           the human heart and the human mind  i refer of course to           doctor clemens  i was going to say mark twain his literary           title which is a household phrase in more homes than that of           any other man and you know him best by that dear old title  i thank you mr toastmaster for the compliment which you have paid me and i am sure i would rather have made people laugh than cry yet in my time i have made some of them cry and before i stop entirely i hope to make some more of them cry i like compliments i deal in them myself i have listened with the greatest pleasure to the compliments which the chairman has paid to mr rogers and that road of his tonight and i hope some of them are deserved  it is no small distinction to a man like that to sit here before an intelligent crowd like this and to be classed with napoleon and caesar why didnt he say that this was the proudest day of his life napoleon and caesar are dead and they cant be here to defend themselves but im here  the chairman said and very truly that the most lasting thing in the hands of man are the roads which caesar built and it is true that he built a lot of them and they are there yet  yes caesar built a lot of roads in england and you can find them but rogers has only built one road and he hasnt finished that yet i like to hear my old friend complimented but i dont like to hear it overdone  i didnt go around today with the others to see what he is doing i will do that in a quiet time when there is not anything going on and when i shall not be called upon to deliver intemperate compliments on a railroad in which i own no stock  they proposed that i go along with the committee and help inspect that dump down yonder i didnt go i saw that dump i saw that thing when i was coming in on the steamer and i didnt go because i was diffident sentimentally diffident about going and looking at that thing againthat great long bony thing it looked just like mr rogerss foot  the chairman says mr rogers is full of practical wisdom and he is it is intimated here that he is a very ingenious man and he is a very competent financier maybe he is now but it was not always so i know lots of private things in his life which people dont know and i know how he started and it was not a very good start i could have done better myself the first time he crossed the atlantic he had just made the first little strike in oil and he was so young he did not like to ask questions he did not like to appear ignorant to this day he dont like to appear ignorant but he can look as ignorant as anybody on board the ship they were betting on the run of the ship betting a couple of shillings or half a crown and they proposed that this youth from the oil regions should bet on the run of the ship he did not like to ask what a halfcrown was and he didnt know but rather than be ashamed of himself he did bet half a crown on the run of the ship and in bed he could not sleep he wondered if he could afford that outlay in case he lost he kept wondering over it and said to himself a kings crown must be worth 20000 so half a crown would cost 10000 he could not afford to bet away 10000 on the run of the ship so he went up to the stakeholder and gave him 150 to let him off  i like to hear mr rogers complimented i am not stingy in compliments to him myself why i did it today when i sent his wife a telegram to comfort her that is the kind of person i am i knew she would be uneasy about him i knew she would be solicitous about what he might do down here so i did it to quiet her and to comfort her i said he was doing well for a person out of practice there is nothing like it he is like i used to be there were times when i was carelesscareless in my dress when i got older you know how uncomfortable your wife can get when you are going away without her superintendence once when my wife could not go with me she always went with me when she couldi always did meet that kind of luck i was going to washington once a long time ago in mr clevelands first administration and she could not go but in her anxiety that i should not desecrate the house she made preparation she knew that there was to be a reception of those authors at the white house at seven oclock in the evening she said if i should tell you now what i want to ask of you you would forget it before you get to washington and therefore i have written it on a card and you will find it in your dressvest pocket when you are dressing at the arlingtonwhen you are dressing to see the president i never thought of it again until i was dressing and i felt in that pocket and took it out and it said in a kind of imploring way dont wear your arctics in the white house  you complimented mr rogers on his energy his foresightedness complimented him in various ways and he has deserved those compliments although i say it myself and i enjoy them all there is one side of mr rogers that has not been mentioned if you will leave that to me i will touch upon that there was a note in an editorial in one of the norfolk papers this morning that touched upon that very thing that hidden side of mr rogers where it spoke of helen keller and her affection for mr rogers to whom she dedicated her life book and she has a right to feel that way because without the public knowing anything about it he rescued if i may use that term that marvellous girl that wonderful southern girl that girl who was stone deaf blind and dumb from scarletfever when she was a baby eighteen months old and who now is as well and thoroughly educated as any woman on this planet at twentynine years of age she is the most marvellous person of her sex that has existed on this earth since joan of arc  that is not all mr rogers has done but you never see that side of his character because it is never protruding but he lends a helping hand daily out of that generous heart of his you never hear of it he is supposed to be a moon which has one side dark and the other bright but the other side though you dont see it is not dark it is bright and its rays penetrate and others do see it who are not god  i would take this opportunity to tell something that i have never been allowed to tell by mr rogers either by my mouth or in print and if i dont look at him i can tell it now  in 1893 when the publishing company of charles l webster of which i was financial agent failed it left me heavily in debt if you will remember what commerce was at that time you will recall that you could not sell anything and could not buy anything and i was on my back my books were not worth anything at all and i could not give away my copyrights mr rogers had long enough vision ahead to say your books have supported you before and after the panic is over they will support you again and that was a correct proposition he saved my copyrights and saved me from financial ruin he it was who arranged with my creditors to allow me to roam the face of the earth for four years and persecute the nations thereof with lectures promising that at the end of four years i would pay dollar for dollar that arrangement was made otherwise i would now be living outofdoors under an umbrella and a borrowed one at that  you see his white mustache and his head trying to get white he is always trying to look like mei dont blame him for that these are only emblematic of his character and that is all i say without exception hair and all he is the whitest man i have ever known       the oldfashioned printer            address at the typothetae dinner given at delmonicos           january 18 1886 commemorating the birthday of           benjamin franklin            mr clemens responded to the toast the compositor  the chairmans historical reminiscences of gutenberg have caused me to fall into reminiscences for i myself am something of an antiquity all things change in the procession of years and it may be that i am among strangers it may be that the printer of today is not the printer of thirtyfive years ago i was no stranger to him i knew him well i built his fire for him in the winter mornings i brought his water from the village pump i swept out his office i picked up his type from under his stand and if he were there to see i put the good type in his case and the broken ones among the hell matter and if he wasnt there to see i dumped it all with the pi on the imposingstonefor that was the furtive fashion of the cub and i was a cub i wetted down the paper saturdays i turned it sundaysfor this was a country weekly i rolled i washed the rollers i washed the forms i folded the papers i carried them around at dawn thursday mornings the carrier was then an object of interest to all the dogs in town if i had saved up all the bites i ever received i could keep m pasteur busy for a year i enveloped the papers that were for the mailwe had a hundred town subscribers and three hundred and fifty country ones the town subscribers paid in groceries and the country ones in cabbages and cordwoodwhen they paid at all which was merely sometimes and then we always stated the fact in the paper and gave them a puff and if we forgot it they stopped the paper every man on the town list helped edit the thingthat is he gave orders as to how it was to be edited dictated its opinions marked out its course for it and every time the boss failed to connect he stopped his paper we were just infested with critics and we tried to satisfy them all over we had one subscriber who paid cash and he was more trouble than all the rest he bought us once a year body and soul for two dollars he used to modify our politics every which way and he made us change our religion four times in five years if we ever tried to reason with him he would threaten to stop his paper and of course that meant bankruptcy and destruction that man used to write articles a column and a half long leaded long primer and sign them junius or veritas or vox populi or some other highsounding rot and then after it was set up he would come in and say he had changed his mindwhich was a gilded figure of speech because he hadnt anyand order it to be left out we couldnt afford bogus in that office so we always took the leads out altered the signature credited the article to the rival paper in the next village and put it in well we did have one or two kinds of bogus whenever there was a barbecue or a circus or a baptizing we knocked off for half a day and then to make up for short matter we would turn over adsturn over the whole page and duplicate it the other bogus was deep philosophical stuff which we judged nobody ever read so we kept a galley of it standing and kept on slapping the same old batches of it in every now and then till it got dangerous also in the early days of the telegraph we used to economize on the news we picked out the items that were pointless and barren of information and stood them on a galley and changed the dates and localities and used them over and over again till the public interest in them was worn to the bone we marked the ads but we seldom paid any attention to the marks afterward so the life of a td ad and a tf ad was equally eternal i have seen a td notice of a sheriffs sale still booming serenely along two years after the sale was over the sheriff dead and the whole circumstance become ancient history most of the yearly ads were patentmedicine stereotypes and we used to fence with them  i can see that printingoffice of prehistoric times yet with its horse bills on the walls its d boxes clogged with tallow because we always stood the candle in the k box nights its towel which was not considered soiled until it could stand alone and other signs and symbols that marked the establishment of that kind in the mississippi valley and i can see also the tramping jour who flitted by in the summer and tarried a day with his wallet stuffed with one shirt and a hatful of handbills for if he couldnt get any type to set he would do a temperance lecture his way of life was simple his needs not complex all he wanted was plate and bed and money enough to get drunk on and he was satisfied but it may be as i have said that i am among strangers and sing the glories of a forgotten age to unfamiliar ears so i will make even and stop       society of american authors            on november 15 1900 the society gave a reception to mr           clemens who came with his wife and daughter  so many members           surrounded the guests that mr clemens asked is this genuine           popularity or is it all a part of a prearranged programme  mr chairman ladies and gentlemenit seems a most difficult thing for any man to say anything about me that is not complimentary i dont know what the charm is about me which makes it impossible for a person to say a harsh thing about me and say it heartily as if he was glad to say it  if this thing keeps on it will make me believe that i am what these kind chairmen say of me in introducing me judge ransom spoke of my modesty as if he was envious of me i would like to have one man come out flatfooted and say something harsh and disparaging of me even if it were true i thought at one time as the learned judge was speaking that i had found that man but he wound up like all the others by saying complimentary things  i am constructed like everybody else and enjoy a compliment as well as any other fool but i do like to have the other side presented and there is another side i have a wicked side estimable friends who know all about it would tell you and take a certain delight in telling you things that i have done and things further that i have not repented  the real life that i live and the real life that i suppose all of you live is a life of interior sin that is what makes life valuable and pleasant to lead a life of undiscovered sin that is true joy  judge ransom seems to have all the virtues that he ascribes to me but oh my if you could throw an xray through him we are a pair i have made a lifestudy of trying to appear to be what he seems to think i am everybody believes that i am a monument of all the virtues but it is nothing of the sort i am living two lives and it keeps me pretty busy  some day there will be a chairman who will forget some of these merits of mine and then he will make a speech  i have more personal vanity than modesty and twice as much veracity as the two put together  when that fearless and forgetful chairman is found there will be another story told at the press club recently i thought that i had found him he started in in the way that i knew i should be painted with all sincerity and was leading to things that would not be to my credit but when he said that he never read a book of mine i knew at once that he was a liar because he never could have had all the wit and intelligence with which he was blessed unless he had read my works as a basis  i like compliments i like to go home and tell them all over again to the members of my family they dont believe them but i like to tell them in the home circle all the same i like to dream of them if i can  i thank everybody for their compliments but i dont think that i am praised any more than i am entitled to be       readingroom opening            on october 13 1900 mr clemens made his last address           preceding his departure for america at kensal rise london  i formally declare this readingroom open and i think that the legislature should not compel a community to provide itself with intelligent food but give it the privilege of providing it if the community so desires  if the community is anxious to have a readingroom it would put its hand in its pocket and bring out the penny tax i think it a proof of the healthy moral financial and mental condition of the community if it taxes itself for its mental food  a readingroom is the proper introduction to a library leading up through the newspapers and magazines to other literature what would we do without newspapers  look at the rapid manner in which the news of the galveston disaster was made known to the entire world this reminds me of an episode which occurred fifteen years ago when i was at church in hartford connecticut  the clergyman decided to make a collection for the survivors if any he did not include me among the leading citizens who took the plates around for collection i complained to the governor of his lack of financial trust in me and he replied i would trust you myselfif you had a bellpunch  you have paid me many compliments and i like to listen to compliments i indorse all your chairman has said to you about the union of england and america he also alluded to my name of which i am rather fond  a little girl wrote me from new zealand in a letter i received yesterday stating that her father said my proper name was not mark twain but samuel clemens but that she knew better because clemens was the name of the man who sold the patent medicine and his name was not mark she was sure it was mark twain because mark is in the bible and twain is in the bible  i was very glad to get that expression of confidence in my origin and as i now know my name to be a scriptural one i am not without hopes of making it worthy       literature            address at the royal literary fund banquet london may 4 1900            anthony hope introduced mr clemens to make the response to the           toast literature  mr hope has been able to deal adequately with this toast without assistance from me still i was born generous if he had advanced any theories that needed refutation or correction i would have attended to them and if he had made any statements stronger than those which he is in the habit of making i would have dealt with them  in fact i was surprised at the mildness of his statements i could not have made such statements if i had preferred to because to exaggerate is the only way i can approximate to the truth you cannot have a theory without principles principles is another name for prejudices i have no prejudices in politics religion literature or anything else  i am now on my way to my own country to run for the presidency because there are not yet enough candidates in the field and those who have entered are too much hampered by their own principles which are prejudices  i propose to go there to purify the political atmosphere i am in favor of everything everybody is in favor of what you should do is to satisfy the whole nation not half of it for then you would only be half a president  there could not be a broader platform than mine i am in favor of anything and everythingof temperance and intemperance morality and qualified immorality gold standard and free silver  i have tried all sorts of things and that is why i want to by the great position of ruler of a country i have been in turn reporter editor publisher author lawyer burglar i have worked my way up and wish to continue to do so  i read today in a magazine article that christendom issued last year fiftyfive thousand new books consider what that means fiftyfive thousand new books meant fiftyfour thousand new authors we are going to have them all on our hands to take care of sooner or later therefore double your subscriptions to the literary fund       disappearance of literature            address at the dinner of the nineteenth century club at           sherrys new york november 20 1900            mr clemens spoke to the toast the disappearance of           literature  doctor gould presided and in introducing           mr clemens said that he the speaker when in germany had to           do a lot of apologizing for a certain literary man who was           taking what the germans thought undue liberties with their           language  it wasnt necessary for your chairman to apologize for me in germany it wasnt necessary at all instead of that he ought to have impressed upon those poor benighted teutons the service i rendered them their language had needed untangling for a good many years nobody else seemed to want to take the job and so i took it and i flatter myself that i made a pretty good job of it the germans have an inhuman way of cutting up their verbs now a verb has a hard time enough of it in this world when its all together its downright inhuman to split it up but thats just what those germans do they take part of a verb and put it down here like a stake and they take the other part of it and put it away over yonder like another stake and between these two limits they just shovel in german i maintain that there is no necessity for apologizing for a man who helped in a small way to stop such mutilation  we have heard a discussion tonight on the disappearance of literature thats no new thing thats what certain kinds of literature have been doing for several years the fact is my friends that the fashion in literature changes and the literary tailors have to change their cuts or go out of business professor winchester here if i remember fairly correctly what he said remarked that few if any of the novels produced today would live as long as the novels of walter scott that may be his notion maybe he is right but so far as i am concerned i dont care if they dont  professor winchester also said something about there being no modern epics like paradise lost i guess hes right he talked as if he was pretty familiar with that piece of literary work and nobody would suppose that he never had read it i dont believe any of you have ever read paradise lost and you dont want to thats something that you just want to take on trust its a classic just as professor winchester says and it meets his definition of a classicsomething that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read  professor trent also had a good deal to say about the disappearance of literature he said that scott would outlive all his critics i guess thats true the fact of the business is youve got to be one of two ages to appreciate scott when youre eighteen you can read ivanhoe and you want to wait until you are ninety to read some of the rest it takes a pretty wellregulated abstemious critic to live ninety years  but as much as these two gentlemen have talked about the disappearance of literature they didnt say anything about my books maybe they think theyve disappeared if they do that just shows their ignorance on the general subject of literature i am not as young as i was several years ago and maybe im not so fashionable but id be willing to take my chances with mr scott tomorrow morning in selling a piece of literature to the century publishing company and i havent got much of a pull here either i often think that the highest compliment ever paid to my poor efforts was paid by darwin through president eliot of harvard college at least eliot said it was a compliment and i always take the opinion of great men like college presidents on all such subjects as that  i went out to cambridge one day a few years ago and called on president eliot in the course of the conversation he said that he had just returned from england and that he was very much touched by what he considered the high compliment darwin was paying to my books and he went on to tell me something like this  do you know that there is one room in darwins house his bedroom where the housemaid is never allowed to touch two things one is a plant he is growing and studying while it grows it was one of those insectdevouring plants which consumed bugs and beetles and things for the particular delectation of mr darwin and the other some books that lie on the night table at the head of his bed they are your books mr clemens and mr darwin reads them every night to lull him to sleep  my friends i thoroughly appreciated that compliment and considered it the highest one that was ever paid to me to be the means of soothing to sleep a brain teeming with bugs and squirming things like darwins was something that i had never hoped for and now that he is dead i never hope to be able to do it again       the new york press club dinner            at the annual dinner november 13 1900            col william l brown the former editor of the daily news as           president of the club introduced mr clemens as the principal           ornament of american literature  i must say that i have already begun to regret that i left my gun at home ive said so many times when a chairman has distressed me with just such compliments that the next time such a thing occurs i will certainly use a gun on that chairman it is my privilege to compliment him in return you behold before you a very very old man a cursory glance at him would deceive the most penetrating his features seem to reveal a person dead to all honorable instinctsthey seem to bear the traces of all the known crimes instead of the marks of a life spent for the most part and now altogether in the sundayschool of a life that may well stand as an example to all generations that have risen or will rizi mean to say will rise his private character is altogether suggestive of virtues which to all appearances he has got if you examine his past history you will find it as deceptive as his features because it is marked all over with waywardness and misdemeanormere effects of a great spirit upon a weak bodymere accidents of a great career in his heart he cherishes every virtue on the list of virtues and he practises them allsecretlyalways secretly you all know him so well that there is no need for him to be introduced here gentlemen colonel brown       the alphabet and simplified spelling            address at the dinner given to mr carnegie at the dedication           of the new york engineers club december 9 1907            mr clemens was introduced by the president of the club who           quoting from the mark twain autobiography recalled the day           when the distinguished writer came to new york with 3 in small           change in his pockets and a 10 bill sewed in his clothes  it seems to me that i was around here in the neighborhood of the public library about fifty or sixty years ago i dont deny the circumstance although i dont see how you got it out of my autobiography which was not to be printed until i am dead unless im dead now i had that 3 in change and i remember well the 10 which was sewed in my coat i have prospered since now i have plenty of money and a disposition to squander it but i cant one of those trust companies is taking care of it  now as this is probably the last time that i shall be out after nightfall this winter i must say that i have come here with a mission and i would make my errand of value  many compliments have been paid to mr carnegie tonight i was expecting them they are very gratifying to me  i have been a guest of honor myself and i know what mr carnegie is experiencing now it is embarrassing to get compliments and compliments and only compliments particularly when he knows as well as the rest of us that on the other side of him there are all sorts of things worthy of our condemnation  just look at mr carnegies face it is fairly scintillating with fictitious innocence you would think looking at him that he had never committed a crime in his life but nolook at his pestiferious simplified spelling you cant any of you imagine what a crime that has been torquemada was nothing to mr carnegie that old fellow shed some blood in the inquisition but mr carnegie has brought destruction to the entire race i know he didnt mean it to be a crime but it was just the same hes got us all so we cant spell anything  the trouble with him is that he attacked orthography at the wrong end he meant well but he attacked the symptoms and not the cause of the disease he ought to have gone to work on the alphabet theres not a vowel in it with a definite value and not a consonant that you can hitch anything to look at the hs distributed all around theres gherkin what are you going to do with the h in that what the devils the use of h in gherkin id like to know its one thing i admire the english for they just dont mind anything about them at all  but look at the pneumatics and the pneumonias and the rest of them a real reform would settle them once and for all and wind up by giving us an alphabet that we wouldnt have to spell with at all instead of this present silly alphabet which i fancy was invented by a drunken thief why there isnt a man who doesnt have to throw out about fifteen hundred words a day when he writes his letters because he cant spell them its like trying to do a st vituss dance with wooden legs  now ill bet there isnt a man here who can spell pterodactyl not even the prisoner at the bar id like to hear him try oncebut not in public for its too near sunday when all extravagant histrionic entertainments are barred id like to hear him try in private and when he got through trying to spell pterodactyl you wouldnt know whether it was a fish or a beast or a bird and whether it flew on its legs or walked with its wings the chances are that he would give it tusks and make it lay eggs  lets get mr carnegie to reform the alphabet and well pray for himif hell take the risk if we had adequate competent vowels with a system of accents giving to each vowel its own soul and value so every shade of that vowel would be shown in its accent there is not a word in any tongue that we could not spell accurately that would be competent adequate simplified spelling in contrast to the clipping the hair punching the carbuncles and the cancers which go by the name of simplified spelling if i ask you what bow spells you cant tell me unless you know which bow i mean and it is the same with row bore and the whole family of words which were born out of lawful wedlock and dont know their own origin  now if we had an alphabet that was adequate and competent instead of inadequate and incompetent things would be different spelling reform has only made it baldheaded and unsightly there is the whole tribe of them row and read and leada whole family who dont know who they are i ask you to pronounce sow and you ask me what kind of a one  if we had a sane determinate alphabet instead of a hospital of comminuted eunuchs you would know whether one referred to the act of a man casting the seed over the ploughed land or whether one wished to recall the lady hog and the future ham  its a rotten alphabet i appoint mr carnegie to get after it and leave simplified spelling alone  simplified spelling brought about sunspots the san francisco earthquake and the recent business depression which we would never have had if spelling had been left all alone  now i hope i have soothed mr carnegie and made him more comfortable than he would have been had he received only compliment after compliment and i wish to say to him that simplified spelling is all right but like chastity you can carry it too far       spelling and pictures            address at the annual dinner of the associated press at the           waldorfastoria september 18 1906  i am here to make an appeal to the nations in behalf of the simplified spelling i have come here because they cannot all be reached except through you there are only two forces that can carry light to all the corners of the globeonly twothe sun in the heavens and the associated press down here i may seem to be flattering the sun but i do not mean it so i am meaning only to be just and fair all around you speak with a million voices no one can reach so many races so many hearts and intellects as youexcept rudyard kipling and he cannot do it without your help if the associated press will adopt and use our simplified forms and thus spread them to the ends of the earth covering the whole spacious planet with them as with a garden of flowers our difficulties are at an end  every day of the three hundred and sixtyfive the only pages of the worlds countless newspapers that are read by all the human beings and angels and devils that can read are these pages that are built out of associated press despatches and so i beg you i beseech youoh i implore you to spell them in our simplified forms do this daily constantly persistently for three monthsonly three monthsit is all i ask the infallible resultvictory victory all down the line for by that time all eyes here and above and below will have become adjusted to the change and in love with it and the present clumsy and ragged forms will be grotesque to the eye and revolting to the soul and we shall be rid of phthisis and phthisic and pneumonia and pneumatics and diphtheria and pterodactyl and all those other insane words which no man addicted to the simple christian life can try to spell and not lose some of the bloom of his piety in the demoralizing attempt do not doubt it we are chameleons and our partialities and prejudices change places with an easy and blessed facility and we are soon wonted to the change and happy in it we do not regret our old yellow fangs and snags and tushes after we have worn nice fresh uniform store teeth a while  do i seem to be seeking the good of the world that is the idea it is my public attitude privately i am merely seeking my own profit we all do it but it is sound and it is virtuous for no public interest is anything other or nobler than a massed accumulation of private interests in 1883 when the simplifiedspelling movement first tried to make a noise i was indifferent to it morei even irreverently scoffed at it what i needed was an objectlesson you see it is the only way to teach some people very well i got it at that time i was scrambling along earning the familys bread on magazine work at seven cents a word compound words at single rates just as it is in the dark present i was the property of a magazine a sevencent slave under a boileriron contract one day there came a note from the editor requiring me to write ten pageson this revolting text considerations concerning the alleged subterranean holophotal extemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous superimbrication of the ornithorhyncus as foreshadowed by the unintelligibility of its plesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects  ten pages of that each and every word a seventeenjointed vestibuled railroad train seven cents a word i saw starvation staring the family in the face i went to the editor and i took a stenographer along so as to have the interview down in black and white for no magazine editor can ever remember any part of a business talk except the part thats got graft in it for him and the magazine i said read that text jackson and let it go on the record read it out loud he read it considerations concerning the alleged subterranean holophotal extemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous superimbrication of the ornithorhyncus as foreshadowed by the unintelligibility of its plesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects  i said you want ten pages of those rumbling great long summer thunderpeals and you expect to get them at seven cents a peal  he said a words a word and seven cents is the contract what are you going to do about it  i said jackson this is coldblooded oppression whats an average english word  he said six letters  i said nothing of the kind thats french and includes the spaces between the words an average english word is four letters and a half by hard honest labor ive dug all the large words out of my vocabulary and shaved it down till the average is three letters and a half i can put one thousand and two hundred words on your page and theres not another man alive that can come within two hundred of it my page is worth eightyfour dollars to me it takes exactly as long to fill your magazine page with long words as it does with short onesfour hours now then look at the criminal injustice of this requirement of yours i am careful i am economical of my time and labor for the familys sake ive got to be so so i never write metropolis for seven cents because i can get the same money for city i never write policeman because i can get the same price for cop and so on and so on i never write valetudinarian at all for not even hunger and wretchedness can humble me to the point where i will do a word like that for seven cents i wouldnt do it for fifteen examine your obscene text please count the words  he counted and said it was twentyfour i asked him to count the letters he made it two hundred and three  i said now i hope you see the whole size of your crime with my vocabulary i would make sixty words out of those two hundred and five letters and get four dollars and twenty cents for it whereas for your inhuman twentyfour i would get only one dollar and sixtyeight cents ten pages of these skyscrapers of yours would pay me only about three hundred dollars in my simplified vocabulary the same space and the same labor would pay me eight hundred and forty dollars i do not wish to work upon this scandalous job by the piece i want to be hired by the year he coldly refused i said  then for the sake of the family if you have no feeling for me you ought at least to allow me overtime on that word extemporaneousness again he coldly refused i seldom say a harsh word to any one but i was not master of myself then and i spoke right out and called him an anisodactylous plesiosaurian conchyliaceous ornithorhyncus and rotten to the heart with holoaophotal subterranean extemporaneousness god forgive me for that wanton crime he lived only two hours  from that day to this i have been a devoted and hardworking member of the heavenborn institution the international association for the prevention of cruelty to authors and now i am laboring with carnegies simplified committee and with my heart in the work  now then let us look at this mighty question reasonably rationally sanelyyes and calmly not excitedly what is the real function the essential function the supreme function of language isnt it merely to convey ideas and emotions certainly then if we can do it with words of fonetic brevity and compactness why keep the present cumbersome forms but can we yes i hold in my hand the proof of it here is a letter written by a woman right out of her heart of hearts i think she never saw a spellingbook in her life the spelling is her own there isnt a waste letter in it anywhere it reduces the fonetics to the last gaspit squeezes the surplusage out of every wordtheres no spelling that can begin with it on this planet outside of the white house and as for the punctuation there isnt any it is all one sentence eagerly and breathlessly uttered without break or pause in it anywhere the letter is absolutely genuinei have the proofs of that in my possession i cant stop to spell the words for you but you can take the letter presently and comfort your eyes with it i will read the letter  miss dear freind i took some close into the armerry and give them to you to send too the suffrers out to california and i hate to treble you but i got to have one of them back it was a black oll wolle shevyott with a jacket to mach trimed kind of fancy no 38 burst measure and palsy menterry acrost the front and the color i woodent trubble you but it belonged to my brothers wife and she is mad about it i thoght she was willin but she want she says she want done with it and she was going to wear it a spell longer she ant so free harted as what i am and she has got more to do with than i have having a husband to work and slave for her i gels you remember me i am shot and stout and light complected i torked with you quite a spell about the suffrars and said it was orful about that erth quake i shoodent wondar if they had another one rite off seeine general condision of the country is kind of explossive i hate to take that black dress away from the suffrars but i will hunt round and see if i can get another one if i can i will call to the armerry for it if you will jest lay it asside so no more at present from your true freind  i liked your appearance very much  now you see what simplified spelling can do  it can convey any fact you need to convey and it can pour out emotions like a sewer i beg you i beseech you to adopt our spelling and print all your despatches in it  now i wish to say just one entirely serious word  i have reached a time of life seventy years and a half where none of the concerns of this world have much interest for me personally i think i can speak dispassionately upon this matter because in the little while that i have got to remain here i can get along very well with these oldfashioned forms and i dont propose to make any trouble about it at all i shall soon be where they wont care how i spell so long as i keep the sabbath  there are eightytwo millions of us people that use this orthography and it ought to be simplified in our behalf but it is kept in its present condition to satisfy one million people who like to have their literature in the old form that looks to me to be rather selfish and we keep the forms as they are while we have got one million people coming in here from foreign countries every year and they have got to struggle with this orthography of ours and it keeps them back and damages their citizenship for years until they learn to spell the language if they ever do learn this is merely sentimental argument  people say it is the spelling of chaucer and spencer and shakespeare and a lot of other people who do not know how to spell anyway and it has been transmitted to us and we preserved it and wish to preserve it because of its ancient and hallowed associations  now i dont see that there is any real argument about that if that argument is good then it would be a good argument not to banish the flies and the cockroaches from hospitals because they have been there so long that the patients have got used to them and they feel a tenderness for them on account of the associations why it is like preserving a cancer in a family because it is a family cancer and we are bound to it by the test of affection and reverence and old mouldy antiquity  i think that this declaration to improve this orthography of ours is our family cancer and i wish we could reconcile ourselves to have it cut out and let the family cancer go  now you see before you the wreck and ruin of what was once a young person like yourselves i am exhausted by the heat of the day i must take what is left of this wreck and run out of your presence and carry it away to my home and spread it out there and sleep the sleep of the righteous there is nothing much left of me but my age and my righteousness but i leave with you my love and my blessing and may you always keep your youth       books and burglars            address to the redding conn library association           october 28 1908  suppose this library had been in operation a few weeks ago and the burglars who happened along and broke into my housetaking a lot of things they didnt need and for that matter which i didnt needhad first made entry into this institution  picture them seated here on the floor poring by the light of their darklanterns over some of the books they found and thus absorbing moral truths and getting a moral uplift the whole course of their lives would have been changed as it was they kept straight on in their immoral way and were sent to jail  for all we know they may next be sent to congress  and speaking of burglars let us not speak of them too harshly now i have known so many burglarsnot exactly known but so many of them have come near me in my various dwellingplaces that i am disposed to allow them credit for whatever good qualities they possess  chief among these and indeed the only one i just now think of is their great care while doing business to avoid disturbing peoples sleep  noiseless as they may be while at work however the effect of their visitation is to murder sleep later on  now we are prepared for these visitors all sorts of alarm devices have been put in the house and the ground for half a mile around it has been electrified the burglar who steps within this danger zone will set loose a bedlam of sounds and spring into readiness for action our elaborate system of defences as for the fate of the trespasser do not seek to know that he will never be heard of more        authors club            address at the dinner given in honor of mr clemens london           june 1899            mr clemens was introduced by sir walter besant  it does not embarrass me to hear my books praised so much it only pleases and delights me i have not gone beyond the age when embarrassment is possible but i have reached the age when i know how to conceal it it is such a satisfaction to me to hear sir walter besant who is much more capable than i to judge of my work deliver a judgment which is such a contentment to my spirit  well i have thought well of the books myself but i think more of them now it charms me also to hear sir spencer walpole deliver a similar judgment and i shall treasure his remarks also i shall not discount the praises in any possible way when i report them to my family they shall lose nothing there are however certain heredities which come down to us which our writings of the present day may be traced to i for instance read the walpole letters when i was a boy i absorbed them gathered in their grace wit and humor and put them away to be used byandby one does that so unconsciously with things one really likes i am reminded now of what use those letters have been to me  they must not claim credit in america for what was really written in another form so long ago they must only claim that i trimmed this that and the other and so changed their appearance as to make them seem to be original you now see what modesty i have in stock but it has taken long practice to get it there  but i must not stand here talking i merely meant to get up and give my thanks for the pleasant things that preceding speakers have said of me i wish also to extend my thanks to the authors club for constituting me a member at a reasonable price per year and for giving me the benefit of your legal adviser  i believe you keep a lawyer i have always kept a lawyer too though i have never made anything out of him it is service to an author to have a lawyer there is something so disagreeable in having a personal contact with a publisher so it is better to work through a lawyerand lose your case i understand that the publishers have been meeting together also like us i dont know what for but possibly they are devising new and mysterious ways for remunerating authors i only wish now to thank you for electing me a member of this clubi believe i have paid my duesand to thank you again for the pleasant things you have said of me  last february when rudyard kipling was ill in america the sympathy which was poured out to him was genuine and sincere and i believe that which cost kipling so much will bring england and america closer together i have been proud and pleased to see this growing affection and respect between the two countries i hope it will continue to grow and please god it will continue to grow i trust we authors will leave to posterity if we have nothing else to leave a friendship between england and america that will count for much i will now confess that i have been engaged for the past eight days in compiling a publication i have brought it here to lay at your feet i do not ask your indulgence in presenting it but for your applause  here it is since england and america may be joined together in kipling may they not be severed in twain       booksellers            address at banquet on wednesday evening may 20 1908 of the           american booksellers association which included most of the           leading booksellers of america held at the rooms of the aldine           association new york  this annual gathering of booksellers from all over america comes together ostensibly to eat and drink but really to discuss business therefore i am required to talk shop i am required to furnish a statement of the indebtedness under which i lie to you gentlemen for your help in enabling me to earn my living for something over forty years i have acquired my bread by print beginning with the innocents abroad followed at intervals of a year or so by roughing it tom sawyer gilded age and so on for thirtysix years my books were sold by subscription you are not interested in those years but only in the four which have since followed the books passed into the hands of my present publishers at the beginning of 1900 and you then became the providers of my diet i think i may say without flattering you that you have done exceedingly well by me exceedingly well is not too strong a phrase since the official statistics show that in four years you have sold twice as many volumes of my venerable books as my contract with my publishers bound you and them to sell in five years to your sorrow you are aware that frequently much too frequently when a book gets to be five or ten years old its annual sale shrinks to two or three hundred copies and after an added ten or twenty years ceases to sell but you sell thousands of my mossbacked old books every yearthe youngest of them being books that range from fifteen to twentyseven years old and the oldest reaching back to thirtyfive and forty  by the terms of my contract my publishers had to account to me for 50000 volumes per year for five years and pay me for them whether they sold them or not it is at this point that you gentlemen come in for it was your business to unload 250000 volumes upon the public in five years if you possibly could have you succeeded yes you haveand more for in four years with a year still to spare you have sold the 250000 volumes and 240000 besides  your sales have increased each year in the first year you sold 90328 in the second year 104851 in the third 133975 in the fourth yearwhich was last yearyou sold 160000 the aggregate for the four years is 500000 volumes lacking 11000  of the oldest book the innocents abroadnow forty years oldyou sold upward of 46000 copies in the four years of roughing itnow thirtyeight years old i thinkyou sold 40334 of tom sawyer 41000 and so on  and there is one thing that is peculiarly gratifying to me the personal recollections of joan of arc is a serious book i wrote it for love and never expected it to sell but you have pleasantly disappointed me in that matter in your hands its sale has increased each year in 1904 you sold 1726 copies in 1905 2445 in 1906 5381 and last year 6574       mark twains first appearance            on october 5 1906 mr clemens following a musical recital by           his daughter in norfolk conn addressed her audience on the           subject of stagefright  he thanked the people for making           things as easy as possible for his daughters american debut as           a contralto and then told of his first experience before the           public  my heart goes out in sympathy to any one who is making his first appearance before an audience of human beings by a direct process of memory i go back forty years less one monthfor im older than i look  i recall the occasion of my first appearance san francisco knew me then only as a reporter and i was to make my bow to san francisco as a lecturer i knew that nothing short of compulsion would get me to the theatre so i bound myself by a hardandfast contract so that i could not escape i got to the theatre fortyfive minutes before the hour set for the lecture my knees were shaking so that i didnt know whether i could stand up if there is an awful horrible malady in the world it is stagefrightand seasickness they are a pair i had stagefright then for the first and last time i was only seasick once too it was on a little ship on which there were two hundred other passengers iwassick i was so sick that there wasnt any left for those other two hundred passengers  it was dark and lonely behind the scenes in that theatre and i peeked through the little peekholes they have in theatre curtains and looked into the big auditorium that was dark and empty too byandby it lighted up and the audience began to arrive  i had got a number of friends of mine stalwart men to sprinkle themselves through the audience armed with big clubs every time i said anything they could possibly guess i intended to be funny they were to pound those clubs on the floor then there was a kind lady in a box up there also a good friend of mine the wife of the governor she was to watch me intently and whenever i glanced toward her she was going to deliver a gubernatorial laugh that would lead the whole audience into applause  at last i began i had the manuscript tucked under a united states flag in front of me where i could get at it in case of need but i managed to get started without it i walked up and downi was young in those days and needed the exerciseand talked and talked  right in the middle of the speech i had placed a gem i had put in a moving pathetic part which was to get at the hearts and souls of my hearers when i delivered it they did just what i hoped and expected they sat silent and awed i had touched them then i happened to glance up at the box where the governors wife wasyou know what happened  well after the first agonizing five minutes my stagefright left me never to return i know if i was going to be hanged i could get up and make a good showing and i intend to but i shall never forget my feelings before the agony left me and i got up here to thank you for her for helping my daughter by your kindness to live through her first appearance and i want to thank you for your appreciation of her singing which is bytheway hereditary       morals and memory            mr clemens was the guest of honor at a reception held at           barnard college columbia university march 7 1906 by the           barnard union  one of the young ladies presented mr clemens           and thanked him for his amiability in coming to make them an           address  she closed with the expression of the great joy it           gave her fellowcollegians because we all love you  if any one here loves me she has my sincere thanks nay if any one here is so good as to love mewhy ill be a brother to her she shall have my sincere warm unsullied affection when i was coming up in the car with the very kind young lady who was delegated to show me the way she asked me what i was going to talk about and i said i wasnt sure i said i had some illustrations and i was going to bring them in i said i was certain to give those illustrations but that i hadnt the faintest notion what they were going to illustrate  now ive been thinking it over in this forest glade indicating the woods of arcady on the scene setting and ive decided to work them in with something about morals and the caprices of memory that seems to me to be a pretty good subject you see everybody has a memory and its pretty sure to have caprices and of course everybody has morals  its my opinion that every one i know has morals though i wouldnt like to ask i know i have but id rather teach them than practice them any day give them to othersthats my motto then you never have any use for them when youre left without now speaking of the caprices of memory in general and of mine in particular its strange to think of all the tricks this little mental process plays on us here were endowed with a faculty of mind that ought to be more supremely serviceable to us than them all and what happens this memory of ours stores up a perfect record of the most useless facts and anecdotes and experiences and all the things that we ought to knowthat we need to knowthat wed profit by knowingit casts aside with the careless indifference of a girl refusing her true lover its terrible to think of this phenomenon i tremble in all my members when i consider all the really valuable things that ive forgotten in seventy yearswhen i meditate upon the caprices of my memory  theres a bird out in california that is one perfect symbol of the human memory ive forgotten the birds name just because it would be valuable for me to know itto recall it to your own minds perhaps  but this fool of a creature goes around collecting the most ridiculous things you can imagine and storing them up he never selects a thing that could ever prove of the slightest help to him but he goes about gathering iron forks and spoons and tin cans and broken mousetrapsall sorts of rubbish that is difficult for him to carry and yet be any use when he gets it why that bird will go by a gold watch to bring back one of those patent cakepans  now my mind is just like that and my mind isnt very different from yoursand so our minds are just like that bird we pass by what would be of inestimable value to us and pack our memories with the most trivial odds and ends that never by any chance under any circumstances whatsoever could be of the slightest use to any one  now things that i have remembered are constantly popping into my head and i am repeatedly startled by the vividness with which they recur to me after the lapse of years and their utter uselessness in being remembered at all  i was thinking over some on my way up here they were the illustrations i spoke about to the young lady on the way up and ive come to the conclusion curious though it is that i can use every one of these freaks of memory to teach you all a lesson im convinced that each one has its moral and i think its my duty to hand the moral on to you  now i recall that when i was a boy i was a good boyi was a very good boy why i was the best boy in my school i was the best boy in that little mississippi town where i lived the population was only about twenty million you may not believe it but i was the best boy in that stateand in the united states for that matter  but i dont know why i never heard any one say that but myself i always recognized it but even those nearest and dearest to me couldnt seem to see it my mother especially seemed to think there was something wrong with that estimate and she never got over that prejudice  now when my mother got to be eightyfive years old her memory failed her she forgot little threads that hold lifes patches of meaning together she was living out west then and i went on to visit her  i hadnt seen my mother in a year or so and when i got there she knew my face knew i was married knew i had a family and that i was living with them but she couldnt for the life of her tell my name or who i was so i told her i was her boy  but you dont live with me she said  no said i im living in rochester  what are you doing there  going to school  large school  very large  all boys  all boys  and how do you stand said my mother  im the best boy in that school i answered  well said my mother with a return of her old fire id like to know what the other boys are like  now one point in this story is the fact that my mothers mind went back to my school days and remembered my little youthful selfprejudice when shed forgotten everything else about me  the other point is the moral theres one there that you will find if you search for it  now heres something else i remember its about the first time i ever stole a watermelon stole is a strong word stole stole no i dont mean that it was the first time i ever withdrew a watermelon it was the first time i ever extracted a watermelon that is exactly the word i wantextracted it is definite it is precise it perfectly conveys my idea its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning i am looking for you know we never extract our own teeth  and it was not my watermelon that i extracted i extracted that watermelon from a farmers wagon while he was inside negotiating with an other customer i carried that watermelon to one of the secluded recesses of the lumberyard and there i broke it open  it was a green watermelon  well do you know when i saw that i began to feel sorrysorrysorry it seemed to me that i had done wrong i reflected deeply i reflected that i was youngi think i was just eleven but i knew that though immature i did not lack moral advancement i knew what a boy ought to do who had extracted a watermelonlike that  i considered george washington and what action he would have taken under similar circumstances then i knew there was just one thing to make me feel right inside and that wasrestitution  so i said to myself i will do that i will take that green watermelon back where i got it from and the minute i had said it i felt that great moral uplift that comes to you when youve made a noble resolution  so i gathered up the biggest fragments and i carried them back to the farmers wagon and i restored the watermelonwhat was left of it and i made him give me a good one in place of it too  and i told him he ought to be ashamed of himself going around working off his worthless old green watermelons on trusting purchasers who had to rely on him how could they tell from the outside whither the melons were good or not that was his business and if he didnt reform i told him id see that he didnt get any more of my tradenor anybody elses i knew if i could help it  you know that man was as contrite as a revivalists last convert he said he was all broken up to think id gotten a green watermelon he promised the he would never carry another green watermelon if he starved for it and he drove offa better man  now do you see what i did for that man he was on a downward path and i rescued him but all i got out of it was a watermelon  yet id rather have that memoryjust that memory of the good i did for that depraved farmerthan all the material gain you can think of look at the lesson he got i never got anything like that from it but i ought to be satisfied i was only eleven years old but i secured everlasting benefit to other people  the moral in this is perfectly clear and i think theres one in they next memory im going to tell you about  to go back to my childhood theres another little incident that comes to me from which you can draw even another moral its about one of the times i went fishing you see in our house there was a sort of family prejudice against going fishing if you hadnt permission but it would frequently be bad judgment to ask so i went fishing secretly as it wereway up the mississippi it was an exquisitely happy trip i recall with a very pleasant sensation  well while i was away there was a tragedy in our town a stranger stopping over on his way east from california was stabbed to death in an unseemly brawl  now my father was justice of the peace and because he was justice of the peace he was coroner and since he was coroner he was also constable and being constable he was sheriff and out of consideration for his holding the office of sheriff he was likewise county clerk and a dozen other officials i dont think of just this minute  i thought he had power of life or death only he didnt use it over other boys he was sort of an austere man somehow i didnt like being round him when id done anything he disapproved of so thats the reason i wasnt often around  well when this gentleman got knifed they communicated with the proper authority the coroner and they laid the corpse out in the coroners officeour front sittingroomin preparation for the inquest the next morning  about 9 or 10 oclock i got back from fishing it was a little too late for me to be received by my folks so i took my shoes off and slipped noiselessly up the back way to the sittingroom i was very tired and i didnt wish to disturb my people so i groped my way to the sofa and lay down  now i didnt know anything of what had happened during my absence but i was sort of nervous on my own accountafraid of being caught and rather dubious about the morning affair and i had been lying there a few moments when my eyes gradually got used to the darkness and i became aware of something on the other side of the room  it was something foreign to the apartment it had an uncanny appearance and i sat up looking very hard and wondering what in heaven this long formless viciouslooking thing might be  first i thought id go and see then i thought never mind that  mind you i had no cowardly sensations whatever but it didnt seem exactly prudent to investigate but i somehow couldnt keep my eyes off the thing and the more i looked at it the more disagreeably it grew on me but i was resolved to play the man so i decided to turn over and count a hundred and let the patch of moonlight creep up and show me what the dickens it was  i turned over and tried to count but i couldnt keep my mind on it i kept thinking of that grewsome mass i was losing count all the time and going back and beginning over again oh no i wasnt frightenedjust annoyed but by the time id gotten to the century mark i turned cautiously over and opened my eyes with great fortitude  the moonlight revealed to me a marblewhite human hand well maybe i wasnt embarrassed but then that changed to a creepy feeling again and i thought id try the counting again i dont know how many hours or weeks it was that i lay there counting hard but the moonlight crept up that white arm and it showed me a lead face and a terrible wound over the heart  i could scarcely say that i was terrorstricken or anything like that but somehow his eyes interested me so that i went right out of the window i didnt need the sash but it seemed easier to take it than leave it behind  now let that teach you a lessoni dont know just what it is but at seventy years old i find that memory of peculiar value to me i have been unconsciously guided by it all these years things that seemed pigeonholed and remote are a perpetual influence yes youre taught in so many ways and youre so felicitously taught when you dont know it  heres something else that taught me a good deal  when i was seventeen i was very bashful and a sixteenyearold girl came to stay a week with us she was a peach and i was seized with a happiness not of this world  one evening my mother suggested that to entertain her i take her to the theatre i didnt really like to because i was seventeen and sensitive about appearing in the streets with a girl i couldnt see my way to enjoying my delight in public but we went  i didnt feel very happy i couldnt seem to keep my mind on the play i became conscious after a while that that was due less to my lovely company than my boots they were sweet to look upon as smooth as skin but fitted ten time as close i got oblivious to the play and the girl and the other people and everything but my boots untili hitched one partly off the sensation was sensuously perfect i couldnt help it i had to get the other off partly then i was obliged to get them off altogether except that i kept my feet in the legs so they couldnt get away  from that time i enjoyed the play but the first thing i knew the curtain came down like that without my notice andi hadnt any boots on whats more they wouldnt go on i tugged strenuously and the people in our row got up and fussed and said things until the peach and i simply had to move on  we movedthe girl on one arm and the boots under the other  we walked home that way sixteen blocks with a retinue a mile long every time we passed a lamppost death gripped one at the throat but we got homeand i had on white socks  if i live to be nine hundred and ninetynine years old i dont suppose i could ever forget that walk i remember it about as keenly as the chagrin i suffered on another occasion  at one time in our domestic history we had a colored butler who had a failing he could never remember to ask people who came to the door to state their business so i used to suffer a good many calls unnecessarily  one morning when i was especially busy he brought me a card engraved with a name i did not know so i said what does he wish to see me for and sylvester said ah couldnt ask him sah he wuz a genlinun return instantly i thundered and inquire his mission ask him whats his game well sylvester returned with the announcement that he had lightningrods to sell indeed said i things are coming to a fine pass when lightningrod agents send up engraved cards he has pictures added sylvester pictures indeed he maybe peddling etchings has he a russia leather case but sylvester was too frightened to remember i said i am going down to make it hot for that upstart  i went down the stairs working up my temper all the way when i got to the parlor i was in a fine frenzy concealed beneath a veneer of frigid courtesy and when i looked in the door sure enough he had a russia leather case in his hand but i didnt happen to notice that it was our russia leather case  and if youd believe me that man was sitting with a whole gallery of etchings spread out before him but i didnt happen to notice that they were our etchings spread out by some member of my family for some unguessed purpose  very curtly i asked the gentleman his business with a surprised timid manner he faltered that he had met my wife and daughter at onteora and they had asked him to call fine lie i thought and i froze him  he seemed to be kind of nonplussed and sat there fingering the etchings in the case until i told him he neednt bother because we had those that pleased him so much that he leaned over in an embarrassed way to pick up another from the floor but i stopped him i said weve got that too he seemed pitifully amazed but i was congratulating myself on my great success  finally the gentleman asked where mr winton lived hed met him in the mountains too so i said id show him gladly and i did on the spot and when he was gone i felt queer because there were all his etchings spread out on the floor  well my wife came in and asked me who had been in i showed her the card and told her all exultantly to my dismay she nearly fainted she told me he had been a most kind friend to them in the country and had forgotten to tell me that he was expected our way and she pushed me out of the door and commanded me to get over to the wintons in a hurry and get him back  i came into the drawingroom where mrs winton was sitting up very stiff in a chair beating me at my own game well i began to put another light on things before many seconds mrs winton saw it was time to change her temperature in five minutes i had asked the man to luncheon and she to dinner and so on  we made that fellow change his trip and stay a week and we gave him the time of his life why i dont believe we let him get sober the whole time  i trust that you will carry away some good thought from these lessons i have given you and that the memory of them will inspire you to higher things and elevate you to plans far above the oldandand  and i tell you one thing young ladies ive had a better time with you today than with that peach fiftythree years ago       queen victoria            address to the british schools and universities club at           delmonicos monday may 25 in honor of queen victorias           birthday            mr clemens told the story of his duel with a rival editor how           he practised firing at a barn door and failed to hit it but a           friend of his took off the head of a little bird at thirtyfive           yards and attributed the shot to mark twain  the duel did not           take place  mr clemens continued as follows  it also happened that i was the means of stopping duelling in nevada for a law was passed sending all duellists to jail for two years and the governor hearing of my marksmanship said that if he got me i should go to prison for the full term thats why i left nevada and i have not been there since  you do me a high honor indeed in selecting me to speak of my country in this commemoration of the birthday of that noble lady whose life was consecrated to the virtues and the humanities and to the promotion of lofty ideals and was a model upon which many a humbler life was formed and made beautiful while she lived and upon which many such lives will still be formed in the generations that are to comea life which finds its just image in the star which falls out of its place in the sky and out of existence but whose light still streams with unfaded lustre across the abysses of space long after its fires have been extinguished at their source  as a woman the queen was all that the most exacting standards could require as a farreaching and effective beneficent moral force she had no peer in her time among either monarchs or commoners as a monarch she was without reproach in her great office we may not venture perhaps to say so sweeping a thing as this in cold blood about any monarch that preceded her upon either her own throne or upon any other it is a colossal eulogy but it is justified  in those qualities of the heart which beget affection in all sorts and conditions of men she was rich surprisingly rich and for this she will still be remembered and revered in the faroff ages when the political glories of her reign shall have faded from vital history and fallen to a place in that scrapheap of unverifiable odds and ends which we call tradition which is to say in briefer phrase that her name will live always and with it her charactera fame rare in the history of thrones dominions principalities and powers since it will not rest upon harvested selfish and sordid ambitions but upon love earned and freely vouchsafed she mended broken hearts where she could but she broke none  what she did for us in america in our time of storm and stress we shall not forget and whenever we call it to mind we shall always remember the wise and righteous mind that guided her in it and sustained and supported herprince alberts we need not talk any idle talk here tonight about either possible or impossible war between the two countries there will be no war while we remain sane and the son of victoria and albert sits upon the throne in conclusion i believe i may justly claim to utter the voice of my country in saying that we hold him in deep honor and also in cordially wishing him a long life and a happy reign       joan of arc            address at the dinner of the society of illustrators given at           the aldine association club december 22 1905            just before mr clemens made his speech a young woman attired           as joan of arc with a page bearing her flag of battle           courtesied reverently and tendered mr clemens a laurel wreath           on a satin pillow  he tried to speak but his voice failed           from excess of emotion i thank you he finally exclaimed           and pulling him self together he began his speech  now there is an illustration pointing to the retreating joan of arc that is exactly what i wantedprecisely what i wantedwhen i was describing to myself joan of arc after studying her history and her character for twelve years diligently  that was the productnot the conventional joan of arc wherever you find the conventional joan of arc in history she is an offence to anybody who knows the story of that wonderful girl  why she wasshe was almost supreme in several details she had a marvellous intellect she had a great heart had a noble spirit was absolutely pure in her character her feeling her language her words her everythingshe was only eighteen years old  now put that heart into such a breasteighteen years oldand give it that masterly intellect which showed in the face and furnish it with that almost godlike spirit and what are you going to have the conventional joan of arc not by any means that is impossible i cannot comprehend any such thing as that  you must have a creature like that young and fair and beautiful girl we just saw and her spirit must look out of the eyes the figure should bethe figure should be in harmony with all that but oh what we get in the conventional picture and it is always the conventional picture  i hope you will allow me to say that your guild when you take the conventional you have got it at secondhand certainly if you had studied and studied then you might have something else as a result but when you have the common convention you stick to that  you cannot prevail upon the artist to do it he always gives you a joan of arcthat lovely creature that started a great career at thirteen but whose greatness arrived when she was eighteen and merely because she was a girl he can not see the divinity in her and so he paints a peasant a coarse and lubberly figurethe figure of a cottonbale and he clothes that in the coarsest raiment of the peasant region just like a fish woman her hair cropped short like a russian peasant and that face of hers which should be beautiful and which should radiate all the glories which are in the spirit and in her heart that expression in that face is always just the fixed expression of a ham  but now mr beard has intimated a moment ago and so has sir purdonclarke also that the artist the illustrator does not often get the idea of the man whose book he is illustrating here is a very remarkable instance of the other thing in mr beard who illustrated a book of mine you may never have heard of it i will tell you about it nowa yankee in king arthurs court  now beard got everything that i put into that book and a little more besides those pictures of beards in that bookoh from the first page to the last is one vast sardonic laugh at the trivialities the servilities of our poor human race and also at the professions and the insolence of priestcraft and kingcraftthose creatures that make slaves of themselves and have not the manliness to shake it off beard put it all in that book i meant it to be there i put a lot of it there and beard put the rest  what publisher of mine in hartford had an eye for the pennies and he saved them he did not waste any on the illustrations he had a very good artistwilliamswho had never taken a lesson in drawing everything he did was original the publisher hired the cheapest woodengraver he could find and in my early books you can see a trace of that you can see that if williams had had a chance he would have made some very good pictures he had a good heart and good intentions  i had a character in the first book he illustratedthe innocents abroad that was a boy seventeen or eighteen years oldjack van nostranda new york boy who to my mind was a very remarkable creature he and i tried to get williams to understand that boy and make a picture of jack that would be worthy of jack  jack was a most singular combination he was born and reared in new york here he was as delicate in his feelings as clean and pure and refined in his feelings as any lovely girl that ever was but whenever he expressed a feeling he did it in bowery slang and it was a most curious combinationthat delicacy of his and that apparent coarseness there was no coarseness inside of jack at all and jack in the course of seventeen or eighteen years had acquired a capital of ignorance that was marvellousignorance of various things not of all things for instance he did not know anything about the bible he had never been in sundayschool jack got more out of the holy land than anybody else because the others knew what they were expecting but it was a land of surprises to him  i said in the book that we found him watching a turtle on a log stoning that turtle and he was stoning that turtle because he had read that the song of the turtle was heard in the land and this turtle wouldnt sing it sounded absurd but it was charged on jack as a fact and as he went along through that country he had a proper foil in an old rebel colonel who was superintendent and head engineer in a large sundayschool in wheeling west virginia that man was full of enthusiasm wherever he went and would stand and deliver himself of speeches and jack would listen to those speeches of the colonel and wonder  jack had made a trip as a child almost across this continent in the first overland stagecoach that mans name who ran that line of stageswell i declare that name is gone well names will go  hallidayah thats the nameben halliday your uncle turning to mr carnegie that was the fellowben hallidayand jack was full of admiration at the prodigious speed that that line of stages madeand it was good speedone hundred and twentyfive miles a day going day and night and it was the event of jacks life and there at the fords of the jordan the colonel was inspired to a speech he was always making a speech so he called us up to him he called up five sinners and three saints it has been only lately that mr carnegie beatified me and he said here are the fords of the jordana monumental place at this very point when moses brought the children of israel throughhe brought the children of israel from egypt through the desert you see themhe guarded them through that desert patiently patiently during forty years and brought them to this spot safe and sound there you seethere is the scene of what moses did  and jack said moses who  oh he says jack you ought not to ask that moses the great lawgiver moses the great patriot moses the great warrior moses the great guide who as i tell you brought these people through these three hundred miles of sand in forty years and landed there safe and sound  jack said theres nothin in that three hundred miles in forty years ben halliday would have snaked em through in thirtysix hours  well i was speaking of jacks innocence and it was beautiful jack was not ignorant on all subjects that boy was a deep student in the history of anglosaxon liberty and he was a patriot all the way through to the marrow there was a subject that interested him all the time other subjects were of no concern to jack but that quaint inscrutable innocence of his i could not get williams to put into the picture  yes williams wanted to do it he said i will make him as innocent as a virgin he thought a moment and then said i will make him as innocent as an unborn virgin which covered the ground  i was reminded of jack because i came across a letter today which is over thirty years old that jack wrote jack was doomed to consumption he was very long and slim poor creature and in a year or two after he got back from that excursion to the holy land he went on a ride on horseback through colorado and he did not last but a year or two  he wrote this letter not to me but to a friend of mine and he said i have ridden horsebackthis was three years afteri hate ridden horseback four hundred miles through a desert country where you never see anything but cattle now and then and now and then a cattle stationten miles apart twenty miles apart now you tell clemens that in all that stretch of four hundred miles i have seen only two booksthe bible and innocents abroad tell clemens the bible was in a very good condition  i say that he had studied and he had the real saxon liberty the acquirement of our liberty and jack used to repeat some versesi dont know where they came from but i thought of them today when i saw that letterthat that boy could have been talking of himself in those quoted lines from that unknown poet                 for he had sat at sidneys feet                and walked with him in plain apart                and through the centuries heard the beat                of freedoms march through cromwells heart  and he was that kind of a boy he should have lived and yet he should not have lived because he died at that early agehe couldnt have been more than twentyhe had seen all there was to see in the world that was worth the trouble of living in it he had seen all of this world that is valuable he had seen all of this world that was illusion and illusion is the only valuable thing in it he had arrived at that point where presently the illusions would cease and he would have entered upon the realities of life and god help the man that has arrived at that point       accident insuranceetc

insurance centre has extended to all lands and given us the name of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in handthe colts arms company making the destruction of our race easy and convenient our lifeinsurance citizens paying for the victims when they pass away mr batterson perpetuating their memory with his stately monuments and our fireinsurance comrades taking care of their hereafter i am glad to assist in welcoming our guestfirst because he is an englishman and i owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his fellowcountrymen and secondly because he is in sympathy with insurance and has been the means of making many other men cast their sympathies in the same direction  certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the insurance line of businessespecially accident insurance ever since i have been a director in an accidentinsurance company i have felt that i am a better man life has seemed more precious accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect distressing special providences have lost half their horror i look upon a cripple now with affectionate interestas an advertisement i do not seem to care for poetry any more i do not care for politicseven agriculture does not excite me but to me now there is a charm about a railway collision that is unspeakable  there is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance i have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into affluence by the simple boon of a broken leg i have had people come to me on crutches with tears in their eyes to bless this beneficent institution in all my experience of life i have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly mutilated mans face when he feels in his vest pocket with his remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right and i have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another splintered customers face when he found he couldnt collect on a wooden leg  i will remark here by way of advertisement that that noble charity which we have named the hartford accident insurance company is an institution which is peculiarly to be depended upon a man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom no man pan take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the year is out now there was one indigent man who had been disappointed so often with other companies that he had grown disheartened his appetite left him he ceased to smilesaid life was but a weariness three weeks ago i got him to insure with us and now he is the brightest happiest spirit in this landhas a good steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day and travels around on a shutter  i will say in conclusion that my share of the welcome to our guest is none the less hearty because i talk so much nonsense and i know that i curl say the same far the rest of the speakers       osteopathy            on february 27 1901 mr clemens appeared before the assembly           committee in albany new york in favor of the seymour bill           legalizing the practice of osteopathy  mr chairman and gentlemendr van fleet is the gentleman who gave me the character i have heard my character discussed a thousand times before you were born sir and shown the iniquities in it and you did not get more than half of them  i was touched and distressed when they brought that part of a child in here and proved that you cannot take a child to pieces in that way what remarkable names those diseases have it makes me envious of the man that has them all i have had many diseases and am thankful for all i have had  one of the gentlemen spoke of the knowledge of something else found in sweden a treatment which i took it is i suppose a kindred thing there is apparently no great difference between them i was a year and a half in london and sweden in the hands of that grand old man mr kildren  i cannot call him a doctor for he has not the authority to give a certificate if a patient should die but fortunately they dont  the state stands as a mighty gibraltar clothed with power it stands between me and my body and tells me what kind of a doctor i must employ when my soul is sick unlimited spiritual liberty is given me by the state now then it doesnt seem logical that the state shall depart from this great policy the health of the soul and change about and take the other position in the matter of smaller consequencethe health of the body  the bell bill limitations would drive the osteopaths out of the state oh dear me when you drive somebody out of the state you create the same condition as prevailed in the garden of eden  you want the thing that you cant have i didnt care much about the osteopaths but as soon as i found they were going to drive them out i got in a state of uneasiness and i cant sleep nights now  i know how adam felt in the garden of eden about the prohibited apple adam didnt want the apple till he found out he couldnt have it just as he would have wanted osteopathy if he couldnt have it  whose property is my body probably mine i so regard it if i experiment with it who must be answerable i not the state if i choose injudiciously does the state die oh no  i was the subject of my mothers experiment she was wise she made experiments cautiously she didnt pick out just any child in the flock no she chose judiciously she chose one she could spare and she couldnt spare the others i was the choice child of the flock so i had to take all of the experiments  in 1844 kneipp filled the world with the wonder of the water cure mother wanted to try it but on sober second thought she put me through a bucket of icewater was poured over to see the effect then i was rubbed down with flannels sheet was dipped in the water and i was put to bed i perspired so much that mother put a lifepreserver to bed with me  but this had nothing but a spiritual effect on me and i didnt care for that when they took off the sheet it was yellow from the output of my conscience the exudation of sin it purified me spiritually and it remains until this day  i have experimented with osteopathy and allopathy i took a chance at the latter for old times sake for three tines when a boy mothers new methods got me so near deaths door she had to call in the family physician to pull me out  the physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests of the public isnt there a little touch of selfinterest back of it all it seems to me there is and i dont claim to have all the virtuesonly nine or ten of them  i was born in the banner state and by banner state i mean missouri osteopathy was born in the same state and both of us are getting along reasonably well at a time during my younger days my attention was attracted to a picture of a house which bore the inscription christ disputing with the doctors  i could attach no other meaning to it than that christ was actually quarreling with the doctors so i asked an old slave who was a sort of a herb doctor in a small wayunlicensed of coursewhat the meaning of the picture was what had has done i asked and the colored man replied humph he aint got no license       watersupply            mr clemens visited albany on february 21 and 28 1901 the           privileges of the floor were granted and he was asked to make a           short address to the senate  mr president and gentlemeni do not know how to thank you sufficiently for this high honor which you are conferring upon me i have for the second time now enjoyed this kind of prodigal hospitalityin the other house yesterday today in this one i am a modest man and diffident about appearing before legislative bodies and yet utterly an entirely appreciative of a courtesy like this when it is extended to me and i thank you very much for it  if i had the privilege which unfortunately i have not got of suggesting things to the legislators in my individual capacity i would so enjoy the opportunity that i would not charge anything for it at all i would do that without a salary i would give them the benefit of my wisdom and experience in legislative bodies and if i could have had the privilege for a few minutes of giving advice to the other house i should have liked to but of course i could not undertake it as they did not ask me to do itbut if they had only asked me  now that the house is considering a measure which is to furnish a watersupply to the city of new york why permit me to say i live in new york myself i know all about its ways its desires and its residents andif i had the privilegei should have urged them not to weary themselves over a measure like that to furnish water to the city of new york for we never drink it  but i will not venture to advise this body as i only venture to advise bodies who are not present       mistaken identity  address at the annual ladies day papyrus club boston  ladies and gentlemeni am perfectly astonishedastonishedladies and gentlemenastonished at the way history repeats itself i find myself situated at this moment exactly and precisely as i was once before years ago to a jot to a tittleto a very hair there isnt a shade of difference it is the most astonishing coincidence that everbut wait i will tell you the former instance and then you will see it for yourself years ago i arrived one day at salamanca new york eastward bound must change cars there and take the sleeper train there were crowds of people there and they were swarming into the long sleeper train and packing it full and it was a perfect purgatory of dust and confusion and gritting of teeth and soft sweet and low profanity i asked the young man in the ticketoffice if i could have a sleepingsection and he answered no with a snarl that shrivelled me up like burned leather i went off smarting under this insult to my dignity and asked another local official supplicatingly if i couldnt have some poor little corner somewhere in a sleepingcar but he cut me short with a venomous no you cant every corner is full now dont bother me any more and he turned his back and walked off my dignity was in a state now which cannot be described i was so ruffled thatwell i said to my companion if these people knew who i am they but my companion cut me short theredont talk such folly he said if they did know who you are do you suppose it would help your highmightiness to a vacancy in a train which has no vacancies in it  this did not improve my condition any to speak of but just then i observed that the colored porter of a sleepingcar had his eye on me i saw his dark countenance light up he whispered to the uniformed conductor punctuating with nods and jerks toward me and straightway this conductor came forward oozing politeness from every pore  can i be of any service to you he asked will you have a place in the sleeper  yes i said and much oblige me too give me anythinganything will answer  we have nothing left but the big family stateroom he continued with two berths and a couple of armchairs in it but it is entirely at your disposal here tom take these satchels aboard  then he touched his hat and we and the colored tom moved along i was bursting to drop just one little remark to my companion but i held in and waited tom made us comfortable in that sumptuous great apartment and then said with many bows and a perfect affluence of smiles  now is dey anything you want sah case you kin have jes anything you wants it dont make no difference what it is  can i have some hot water and a tumbler at nine tonightblazing hot i asked you know about the

wrong end up an inside out for to get it for you dats so and he disappeared  well i tilted my head back hooked my thumbs in my armholes smiled a smile on my companion and said gently  well what do you say now  my companion was not in the humor to respond and didnt the next moment that smiling black face was thrust in at the crack of the door and this speech followed  laws bless you sah i knowed you in a minute i told de conductah so laws i knowed you de minute i sot eyes on you  is that so my boy handing him a quadruple fee who am i  jenuel mcclellan and he disappeared again  my companion said vinegarishly well well what do you say now right there comes in the marvellous coincidence i mentioned a while agoviz i was speechless and that is my condition now perceive it       cats and candy            the following address was delivered at a social meeting of           literary men in new york in 1874  when i was fourteen i was living with my parents who were very poorand correspondently honest we had a youth living with us by the name of jim wolfe he was an excellent fellow seventeen years old and very diffident he and i slept togethervirtuously and one bitter winters night a cousin maryshes married now and gonegave what they call a candypulling in those days in the west and they took the saucers of hot candy outside of the house into the snow under a sort of old bower that came from the eavesit was a sort of an ell then all covered with vinesto cool this hot candy in the snow and they were all sitting there in the mean time we were gone to bed we were not invited to attend this party we were too young  the young ladies and gentlemen were assembled there and jim and i were in bed there was about four inches of snow on the roof of this ell and our windows looked out on it and it was frozen hard a couple of tomcatsit is possible one might have been of the opposite sexwere assembled on the chimney in the middle of this ell and they were growling at a fearful rate and switching their tails about and going on and we couldnt sleep at all  finally jim said for two cents id go out and snake them cats off that chimney so i said of course you would he said well i would i have a mighty good notion to do it says i of course you have certainly you have you have a great notion to do it i hoped he might try it but i was afraid he wouldnt  finally i did get his ambition up and he raised the window and climbed out on the icy roof with nothing on but his socks and a very short shirt he went climbing along on all fours on the roof toward the chimney where the cats were in the mean time these young ladies and gentlemen were enjoying themselves down under the eaves and when jim got almost to that chimney he made a pass at the cats and his heels flew up and he shot down and crashed through those vines and lit in the midst of the ladies and gentlemen and sat down in those hot saucers of candy  there was a stampede of course and he came upstairs dropping pieces of chinaware and candy all the way up and when he got up therenow anybody in the world would have gone into profanity or something calculated to relieve the mind but he didnt he scraped the candy off his legs nursed his blisters a little and said i could have ketched them cats if i had had on a good ready  does any reader know what a ready was in 1840 dw       obituary poetry            address at the actors fund fair philadelphia in 1895  ladies and gentlementheer thiserwelcome occasion gives me aneropportunity to make anerexplanation that i have long desired to deliver myself of i rise to the highest honors before a philadelphia audience in the course of my checkered career i have on divers occasions been chargedermaliciously with a more or less serious offence it is in reply to one of the moreerimportant of these that i wish to speak more than once i have been accused of writing obituary poetry in the philadelphia ledger  i wish right here to deny that dreadful assertion i will admit that once when a compositor in the ledger establishment i did set up some of that poetry but for a worse offence than that no indictment can be found against me i did not write that poetryat least not all of it       cigars and tobacco  my friends for some years now have remarked that i am an inveterate consumer of tobacco that is true but my habits with regard to tobacco have changed i have no doubt that you will say when i have explained to you what my present purpose is that my taste has deteriorated but i do not so regard it  whenever i held a smokingparty at my house i found that my guests had always just taken the pledge  let me tell you briefly the history of my personal relation to tobacco it began i think when i was a lad and took the form of a quid which i became expert in tucking under my tongue afterward i learned the delights of the pipe and i suppose there was no other youngster of my age who could more deftly cut plug tobacco so as to make it available for pipesmoking  well time ran on and there came a time when i was able to gratify one of my youthful ambitionsi could buy the choicest havana cigars without seriously interfering with my income i smoked a good many changing off from the havana cigars to the pipe in the course of a days smoking  at last it occurred to me that something was lacking in the havana cigar it did not quite fulfil my youthful anticipations i experimented i bought what was called a seedleaf cigar with a connecticut wrapper after a while i became satiated of these and i searched for something else the pittsburg stogy was recommended to me it certainly had the merit of cheapness if that be a merit in tobacco and i experimented with the stogy  then once more i changed off so that i might acquire the subtler flavor of the wheeling toby now that palled and i looked around new york in the hope of finding cigars which would seem to most people vile but which i am sure would be ambrosial to me i couldnt find any they put into my hands some of those little things that cost ten cents a box but they are a delusion  i said to a friend i want to know if you can direct me to an honest tobacco merchant who will tell me what is the worst cigar in the new york market excepting those made for chinese consumptioni want real tobacco if you will do this and i find the man is as good as his word i will guarantee him a regular market for a fair amount of his cigars  we found a tobacco dealer who would tell the truthwho if a cigar was bad would boldly say so he produced what he called the very worst cigars he had ever had in his shop he let me experiment with one then and there the test was satisfactory  this was after all the real thing i negotiated for a box of them and took them away with me so that i might be sure of having them handy when i want them  i discovered that the worst cigars so called are the best for me after all       billiards            mr clemens attended a billiard tourney on the evening of april           24 1906 and was called on to tell a story  the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition once when i was an underpaid reporter in virginia city whenever i wished to play billiards i went out to look for an easy mark one day a stranger came to town and opened a billiard parlor i looked him over casually when he proposed a game i answered all right  just knock the balls around a little so that i can get your gait he said and when i had done so he remarked i will be perfectly fair with you ill play you lefthanded i felt hurt for he was crosseyed freckled and had red hair and i determined to teach him a lesson he won first shot ran out took my halfdollar and all i got was the opportunity to chalk my cue  if you can play like that with your left hand i said id like to see you play with your right  i cant he said im lefthanded       the union right or wrong            reminiscences of nevada  i can assure you ladies and gentlemen that nevada had lively newspapers in those days  my great competitor among the reporters was boggs of the union an excellent reporter  once in three or four months he would get a little intoxicated but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker although always ready to damp himself a little with the enemy  he had the advantage of me in one thing he could get the monthly publicschool report and i could not because the principal hated my sheetthe enterprise  one snowy night when the report was due i started out sadly wondering how i was to get it  presently a few steps up the almost deserted street i stumbled on boggs and asked him where he was going  after the school report  ill go along with you  no sir ill excuse you  have it your own way  a saloonkeepers boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch and boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully  he gazed fondly after the boy and saw him start up the enterprise stairs  i said  i wish you could help me get that school business but since you cant i must run up to the union office and see if i can get a proof of it after its set up though i dont begin to suppose i can good night  hold on a minute i dont mind getting the report and sitting around with the boys a little while you copy it if youre willing to drop down to the principals with me  now you talk like a human being come along  we ploughed a couple of blocks through the snow got the reporta short documentand soon copied it in our office  meantime boggs helped himself to the punch  i gave the manuscript back to him and we started back to get an inquest  at four oclock in the morning when we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion the proprietor of the union strode in and asked if anybody had heard anything of boggs or the school report  we stated the case and all turned out to help hunt for the delinquent  we found him standing on a table in a saloon with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the other haranguing a gang of corned miners on the iniquity of squandering the public money on education when hundreds and hundreds of honest hardworking men were literally starving for whiskey  he had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for hours  we dragged him away and put him into bed  of course there was no school report in the union and boggs held me accountable though i was innocent of any intention or desire to compass its absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the misfortune had occurred but we were perfectly friendly  the day the next school report was due the proprietor of the tennessee mine furnished us a buggy and asked us to go down and write something about the propertya very common request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people  the mine was a hole in the ground ninety feet deep and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and being lowered with a windlass  the workmen had just gone off somewhere to dinner  i was not strong enough to lower boggss bulk so i took an unlighted candle in my teeth made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope implored boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of him and then swung out over the shaft  i reached the bottom muddy and bruised about the elbows but safe  i lit the candle made an examination of the rock selected some specimens and shouted to boggs to hoist away  no answer  presently a head appeared in the circle of daylight away aloft and a voice came down  are you all set  all sethoist away  are you comfortable  perfectly  could you wait a little  oh certainlyno particular hurry  wellgoodbye  why where are you going  after the school report  and he did  i stayed down there an hour and surprised the workmen when they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock  i walked home toofive milesuphill  we had no school report next morningbut the union had       an ideal french address       extract from paris notes in tom sawyer abroad etc  i am told that a french sermon is like a french speechit never names an historical event but only the date of it if you are not up in dates you get left a french speech is something like this  comrades citizens brothers noble parts of the only sublime and perfect nation let us not forget that the 21st january cast off our chains that the 10th august relieved us of the shameful presence of foreign spies that the 5th september was its own justification before heaven and humanity that the 18th brumaire contained the seeds of its own punishment that the 14th july was the mighty voice of liberty proclaiming the resurrection the new day and inviting the oppressed peoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of france and live and let us here record our everlasting curse against the man of the 2d december and declare in thunder tones the native tones of france that but for him there had been no 17th mardi in history no 12th october nor 9th january no 22d april no 16th november no 30th september no 2d july no 14th february no 29th june no 15th august no 31st maythat but for him france the pure the grand the peerless had had a serene and vacant almanac today  i have heard of one french sermon which closed in this odd yet eloquent way  my hearers we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th january the results of the vast crime of the 13th january have been in just proportion to the magnitude of the act itself but for it there had been no 30th novembersorrowful spectacle the grisly deed of the 16th june had not been done but for it nor had the man of the 16th june known existence to it alone the 3d september was due also the fatal 12th october shall we then be grateful for the 13th january with its freight of death for you and me and all that breathe yes my friends for it gave us also that which had never come but for it and it alonethe blessed 25th december  it may be well enough to explain the man of the 13th january is adam the crime of that date was the eating of the apple the sorrowful spectacle of the 30th november was the expulsion from eden the grisly deed of the 16th june was the murder of abel the act of the 3d september was the beginning of the journey to the land of nod the 12th day of october the last mountaintops disappeared under the flood when you go to church in france you want to take your almanac with youannotated       statistics            extract from the history of the savage club            during that period of gloom when domestic bereavement had           forced mr clemens and his dear ones to secure the privacy they           craved until their wounds should heal his address was known to           only a very few of his closest friends  one old friend in new           york after vain efforts to get his address wrote him a letter           addressed as follows                      mark twain                          god knows where                                    try london            the letter found him and mr clemens replied to the letter           expressing himself surprised and complimented that the person           who was credited with knowing his whereabouts should take so           much interest in him adding had the letter been addressed to           the care of the other party i would naturally have expected           to receive it without delay            his correspondent tried again and addressed the second letter                      mark twain                          the devil knows where                               try london            this found him also no less promptly            on june 9 1899 he consented to visit the savage club london           on condition that there was to be no publicity and no speech           was to be expected from him  the toastmaster in proposing the           health of their guest said that as a scotchman and therefore           as a born expert he thought mark twain had little or no claim           to the title of humorist  mr clemens had tried to be funny           but had failed and his true role in life was statistics that           he was a master of statistics and loved them for their own           sake and it would be the easiest task he ever undertook if he           would try to count all the real jokes he had ever made  while           the toastmaster was speaking the members saw mr clemenss           eyes begin to sparkle and his cheeks to flush  he jumped up           and made a characteristic speech  perhaps i am not a humorist but i am a firstclass foola simpleton for up to this moment i have believed chairman macalister to be a decent person whom i could allow to mix up with my friends and relatives the exhibition he has just made of himself reveals him to be a scoundrel and a knave of the deepest dye i have been cruelly deceived and it serves me right for trusting a scotchman yes i do understand figures and i can count i have counted the words in macalisters drivel i certainly cannot call it a speech and there were exactly three thousand four hundred and thirtynine i also carefully counted the liesthere were exactly three thousand four hundred and thirtynine therefore i leave macalister to his fate  i was sorry to have my name mentioned as one of the great authors because they have a sad habit of dying off chaucer is dead spencer is dead so is milton so is shakespeare and i am not feeling very well myself       galveston orphan bazaar            address at a fair held at the waldorfastoria new york in           october 1900 in aid of the orphans at galveston  i expected that the governor of texas would occupy this place first and would speak to you and in the course of his remarks would drop a text for me to talk from but with the proverbial obstinacy that is proverbial with governors they go back on their duties and he has not come here and has not furnished me with a text and i am here without a text i have no text except what you furnish me with your handsome faces andbut i wont continue that for i could go on forever about attractive faces beautiful dresses and other things but after all compliments should be in order in a place like this  i have been in new york two or three days and have been in a condition of strict diligence night and day the object of this diligence being to regulate the moral and political situation on this planetput it on a sound basisand when you are regulating the conditions of a planet it requires a great deal of talk in a great many kinds of ways and when you have talked a lot the emptier you get and get also in a position of corking when i am situated like that with nothing to say i feel as though i were a sort of fraud i seem to be playing a part and please consider i am playing a part for want of something better and this is not unfamiliar to me i have often done this before  when i was here about eight years ago i was coming up in a car of the elevated road very few people were in that car and on one end of it there was no one except on the opposite seat where sat a man about fifty years old with a most winning face and an elegant eyea beautiful eye and i took him from his dress to be a master mechanic a man who had a vocation he had with him a very fine little child of about four or five years i was watching the affection which existed between those two i judged he was the grandfather perhaps it was really a pretty child and i was admiring her and as soon as he saw i was admiring her he began to notice me  i could see his admiration of me in his eye and i did what everybody else would doadmired the child four times as much knowing i would get four times as much of his admiration things went on very pleasantly i was making my way into his heart  byandby when he almost reached the station where he was to get off he got up crossed over and he said now i am going to say something to you which i hope you will regard as a compliment and then he went on to say i have never seen mark twain but i have seen a portrait of him and any friend of mine will tell you that when i have once seen a portrait of a man i place it in my eye and store it away in my memory and i can tell you now that you look enough like mark twain to be his brother now he said i hope you take this as a compliment yes you are a very good imitation but when i come to look closer you are probably not that man  i said i will be frank with you in my desire to look like that excellent character i have dressed for the character i have been playing a part  he said that is all right that is all right you look very well on the outside but when it comes to the inside you are not in it with the original  so when i come to a place like this with nothing valuable to say i always play a part but i will say before i sit down that when it comes to saying anything here i will express myself in this way i am heartily in sympathy with you in your efforts to help those who were sufferers in this calamity and in your desire to heap those who were rendered homeless and in saying this i wish to impress on you the fact that i am not playing a part       san francisco earthquake            after the address at the robert fulton fund meeting june 19           1906 mr clemens talked to the assembled reporters about the           san francisco earthquake  i havent been there since 1868 and that great city of san francisco has grown up since my day when i was there she had one hundred and eighteen thousand people and of this number eighteen thousand were chinese i was a reporter on the virginia city enterprise in nevada in 1862 and stayed there i think about two years when i went to san francisco and got a job as a reporter on the call i was there three or four years  i remember one day i was walking down third street in san francisco it was a sleepy dull sunday afternoon and no one was stirring suddenly as i looked up the street about three hundred yards the whole side of a house fell out the street was full of bricks and mortar at the same time i was knocked against the side of a house and stood there stunned for a moment  i thought it was an earthquake nobody else had heard anything about it and no one said earthquake to me afterward but i saw it and i wrote it nobody else wrote it and the house i saw go into the street was the only house in the city that felt it ive always wondered if it wasnt a little performance gotten up for my especial entertainment by the nether regions       charity and actors            address at the actors fund fair in the metropolitan           opera house new york may 6 1907            mr clemens in his white suit formally declared the fair           open  mr daniel frohman in introducing mr clemens said            we intend to make this a banner week in the history of the           fund which takes an interest in every one on the stage be he           actor singer dancer or workman  we have spent more than           40000 during the past year  charity covers a multitude of           sins but it also reveals a multitude of virtues  at the           opening of the former fair we had the assistance of edwin booth           and joseph jefferson  in their place we have today that           american institution and apostle of wide humanitymark twain  as mr frohman has said charity reveals a multitude of virtues this is true and it is to be proved here before the week is over mr frohman has told you something of the object and something of the character of the work he told me he would do thisand he has kept his word i had expected to hear of it through the newspapers i wouldnt trust anything between frohman and the newspapersexcept when its a case of charity  you should all remember that the actor has been your benefactor many and many a year when you have been weary and downcast he has lifted your heart out of gloom and given you a fresh impulse you are all under obligation to him this is your opportunity to be his benefactorto help provide for him in his old age and when he suffers from infirmities  at this fair no one is to be persecuted to buy if you offer a twentydollar bill in payment for a purchase of 1 you will receive 19 in change there is to be no robbery here there is to be no creed hereno religion except charity we want to raise 250000and that is a great task to attempt  the president has set the fair in motion by pressing the button in washington now your good wishes are to be transmuted into cash  by virtue of the authority in me vested i declare the fair open i call the ball game let the transmuting begin       russian republic  the american auxiliary movement to aid the cause of freedom in russia was launched on the evening of april 11 1906 at the club a house 3 fifth avenue with mr clemens and maxim gorky as the principal spokesmen mr clemens made an introductory address presenting mr gorky  if we can build a russian republic to give to the persecuted people of the tsars domain the same measure of freedom that we enjoy let us go ahead and do it we need not discuss the methods by which that purpose is to be attained let us hope that fighting will be postponed or averted for a while but if it must come  i am most emphatically in sympathy with the movement now on foot in russia to make that country free i am certain that it will be successful as it deserves to be any such movement should have and deserves our earnest and unanimous cooperation and such a petition for funds as has been explained by mr hunter with its just and powerful meaning should have the utmost support of each and every one of us anybody whose ancestors were in this country when we were trying to free ourselves from oppression must sympathize with those who now are trying to do the same thing in russia  the parallel i have just drawn only goes to show that it makes no difference whether the oppression is bitter or not men with red warm blood in their veins will not endure it but will seek to cast it off if we keep our hearts in this matter russia will be free       russian sufferers            on december 18 1905 an entertainment was given at the casino           for the benefit of the russian sufferers  after the           performance mr clemens spoke  ladies and gentlemenit seems a sort of cruelty to inflict upon an audience like this our rude english tongue after we have heard that divine speech flowing in that lucid gallic tongue  it has always been a marvel to methat french language it has always been a puzzle to me how beautiful that language is how expressive it seems to be how full of grace it is  and when it comes from lips like those how eloquent and how liquid it is and oh i am always deceivedi always think i am going to understand it  oh it is such a delight to me such a delight to me to meet madame bernhardt and laugh hand to hand and heart to heart with her  i have seen her play as we all have and oh that is divine but i have always wanted to know madame bernhardt herselfher fiery self i have wanted to know that beautiful character  why she is the youngest person i ever saw except myselffor i always feel young when i come in the presence of young people  i have a pleasant recollection of an incident so many years agowhen madame bernhardt came to hartford where i lived and she was going to play and the tickets were three dollars and there were two lovely womena widow and her daughterneighbors of ours highly cultivated ladies they were their tastes were fine and elevated but they were very poor and they said well we must not spend six dollars on a pleasure of the mind a pleasure of the intellect we must spend it if it must go at all to furnish to somebody bread to eat  and so they sorrowed over the fact that they had to give up that great pleasure of seeing madame bernhardt but there were two neighbors equally highly cultivated and who could not afford bread and those goodhearted joneses sent that six dollarsdeprived themselves of itand sent it to those poor smiths to buy bread with and those smiths took it and bought tickets with it to see madame bernhardt  oh yes some people have tastes and intelligence also  now i was going to make a speechi supposed i was but i am not it is late late and so i am going to tell a story and there is this advantage about a story anyway that whatever moral or valuable thing you put into a speech why it gets diffused among those involuted sentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding out what that valuable thing was that you were trying to confer upon it but dear me you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone of that story and you are bound to get itit flashes it flames it is the jewel in the toads headyou dont overlook that  now if i am going to talk on such a subject as for instance the lost opportunityoh the lost opportunity anybody in this house who has reached the turn of lifesixty or seventy or even fifty or along therewhen he goes back along his history there he finds it milestoned all the way with the lost opportunity and you know how pathetic that is  you younger ones cannot know the full pathos that lies in those wordsthe lost opportunity but anybody who is old who has really lived and felt this life he knows the pathos of the lost opportunity  now i will tell you a story whose moral is that whose lesson is that whose lament is that  i was in a village which is a suburb of new bedford several years agowell new bedford is a suburb of fair haven or perhaps it is the other way in any case it took both of those towns to make a great centre of the great whaling industry of the first half of the nineteenth century and i was up there at fair haven some years ago with a friend of mine  there was a dedication of a great townhall a public building and we were there in the afternoon this great building was filled like this great theatre with rejoicing villagers and my friend and i started down the centre aisle he saw a man standing in that aisle and he said now look at that bronzed veteranat that mahoganyfaced man now tell me do you see anything about that mans face that is emotional do you see anything about it that suggests that inside that man anywhere there are fires that can be started would you ever imagine that that is a human volcano  why no i said i would not he looks like a wooden indian in front of a cigar store  very well said my friend i will show you that there is emotion even in that unpromising place i will just go to that man and i will just mention in the most casual way an incident in his life that man is getting along toward ninety years old he is past eighty i will mention an incident of fifty or sixty years ago now just watch the effect and it will be so casual that if you dont watch you wont know when i do say that thingbut you just watch the effect  he went on down there and accosted this antiquity and made a remark or two i could not catch up they were so casual i could not recognize which one it was that touched that bottom for in an instant that old man was literally in eruption and was filling the whole place with profanity of the most exquisite kind you never heard such accomplished profanity i never heard it also delivered with such eloquence  i never enjoyed profanity as i enjoyed it thenmore than if i had been uttering it myself there is nothing like listening to an artistall his passions passing away in lava smoke thunder lightning and earthquake  then this friend said to me now i will tell you about that about sixty years ago that man was a young fellow of twentythree and had just come home from a three years whaling voyage he came into that village of his happy and proud because now instead of being chief mate he was going to be master of a whaleship and he was proud and happy about it  then he found that there had been a kind of a cold frost come upon that town and the whole region roundabout for while he had been away the father mathew temperance excitement had come upon the whole region therefore everybody had taken the pledge there wasnt anybody for miles and miles around that had not taken the pledge  so you can see what a solitude it was to this young man who was fond of his grog and he was just an outcast because when they found he would not join father mathews society they ostracized him and he went about that town three weeks day and night in utter lonelinessthe only human being in the whole place who ever took grog and he had to take it privately  if you dont know what it is to be ostracized to be shunned by your fellowman may you never know it then he recognized that there was something more valuable in this life than grog and that is the fellowship of your fellowman and at last he gave it up and at nine oclock one night he went down to the father mathew temperance society and with a broken heart he said put my name down for membership in this society  and then he went away crying and at earliest dawn the next morning they came for him and routed him out and they said that new ship of his was ready to sail on a three years voyage in a minute he was on board that ship and gone  and he saidwell he was not out of sight of that town till he began to repent but he had made up his mind that he would not take a drink and so that whole voyage of three years was a three years agony to that man because he saw all the time the mistake he had made  he felt it all through he had constant reminders of it because the crew would pass him with their grog come out on the deck and take it and there was the torturous smell of it  he went through the whole three years of suffering and at last coming into port it was snowy it was cold he was stamping through the snow two feet deep on the deck and longing to get home and there was his crew torturing him to the last minute with hot grog but at last he had his reward he really did get to shore at fast and jumped and ran and bought a jug and rushed to the societys office and said to the secretary  take my name off your membership books and do it right away i have got a three years thirst on  and the secretary said it is not necessary you were blackballed       watterson and twain as rebels            address at the celebration of abraham lincolns 92nd birthday           anniversary carnegie hall february 11 1901 to raise funds           for the lincoln memorial university at cumberland gap tenn  ladies and gentlementhe remainder of my duties as presiding chairman here this evening are but twoonly two one of them is easy and the other difficult that is to say i must introduce the orator and then keep still and give him a chance the name of henry watterson carries with it its own explanation it is like an electric light on top of madison square garden you touch the button and the light flashes up out of the darkness you mention the name of henry watterson and your minds are at once illuminated with the splendid radiance of his fame and achievements a journalist a soldier an orator a statesman a rebel yes he was a rebel and better still now he is a reconstructed rebel  it is a curious circumstance a circumstance brought about without any collusion or prearrangement that he and i both of whom were rebels related by blood to each other should be brought here together this evening bearing a tribute in our hands and bowing our heads in reverence to that noble soul who for three years we tried to destroy i dont know as the fact has ever been mentioned before but it is a fact nevertheless colonel watterson and i were both rebels and we are blood relations i was a second lieutenant in a confederate company for a whileoh i could have stayed on if i had wanted to i made myself felt i left tracks all around the country i could have stayed on but it was such weather i never saw such weather to be outofdoors in in all my life  the colonel commanded a regiment and did his part i suppose to destroy the union he did not succeed yet if he had obeyed me he would have done so i had a plan and i fully intended to drive general grant into the pacific oceanif i could get transportation i told colonel watterson about it i told him what he had to do what i wanted him to do was to surround the eastern army and wait until i came up but he was insubordinate he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a second lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that and what was the consequence the union was preserved this is the first time i believe that that secret has ever been revealed  no one outside of the family circle i think knew it before but there the facts are watterson saved the union yes he saved the union and yet there he sits and not a step has been taken or a movement made toward granting him a pension that is the way things are done it is a case where some blushing ought to be done you ought to blush and i ought to blush and hewell hes a little out of practice now       robert fulton fund            address made on the evening of april 19 1906            mr clemens had been asked to address the association by gen           frederick d grant president  he was offered a fee of 1000           but refused it saying            i shall be glad to do it but i must stipulate that you keep           the 1000 and add it to the memorial fund as my contribution           to erect a monument in new york to the memory of the man who           applied steam to navigation            at this meeting mr clemens made this formal announcement from           the platform            this is my last appearance on the paid platform  i shall not           retire from the gratis platform until i am buried and courtesy           will compel me to keep still and not disturb the others  now           since i must i shall say goodbye  i see many faces in this           audience well known to me  they are all my friends and i feel           that those i dont know are my friends too  i wish to           consider that you represent the nation and  that in saying           goodbye to you i am saying goodbye to the nation  in the           great name of humanity let me say this final word i offer an           appeal in behalf of that vast pathetic multitude of fathers           mothers and helpless little children  they were sheltered and           happy two days ago  now they are wandering forlorn hopeless           and homeless the victims of a great disaster  so i beg of           you i beg of you to open your hearts and open your purses and           remember san francisco the smitten city  i wish to deliver a historical address ive been studying the history oferalet me seea then he stopped in confusion and walked over to gen fred d grant who sat at the head of the platform he leaned over an a whisper and then returned to the front of the stage and continued oh yes ive been studying robert fulton ive been studying a biographical sketch of robert fulton the inventor oferalets seeah yes the inventor of the electric telegraph and the morse sewingmachine also i understand he invented the airdiriapshaw i have it at lastthe dirigible balloon yes the dirigiblebut it is a difficult word and i dont see why anybody should marry a couple of words like that when they dont want to be married at all and are likely to quarrel with each other all the time i should put that couple of words under the ban of the united states supreme court under its decision of a few days ago and take em out and drown em  i used to know fulton it used to do me good to see him dashing through the town on a wild broncho  and fulton was born inerawell it doesnt make much difference where he was born does it i remember a man who came to interview me once to get a sketch of my life i consulted with a frienda practical manbefore he came to know how i should treat him  whenever you give the interviewer a fact he said give him another fact that will contradict it then hell go away with a jumble that he cant use at all be gentle be sweet smile like an idiotjust be natural thats what my friend told me to do and i did it  where were you born asked the interviewer  wellera i began i was born in alabama or alaska or the sandwich islands i dont know where but right around there somewhere and you had better put it down before you forget it  but you werent born in all those places he said  well ive offered you three places take your choice theyre all at the same price  how old are you he asked  i shall be nineteen in june i said  why theres such a discrepancy between your age and your looks he said  oh thats nothing i said i was born discrepantly  then we got to talking about my brother samuel and he told me my explanations were confusing  i suppose he is dead i said some said that he was dead and some said that he wasnt  did you bury him without knowing whether he was dead or not asked the reporter  there was a mystery said i we were twins and one day when we were two weeks oldthat is he was one week old and i was one week oldwe got mixed up in the bathtub and one of us drowned we never could tell which one of us had a strawberry birthmark on the back of his hand there it is on my hand this is the one that was drowned theres no doubt about it  wheres the mystery he said  why dont you see how stupid it was to bury the wrong twin i answered i didnt explain it any more because he said the explanation confused him to me it is perfectly plain  but to get back to fulton im going along like an old man i used to know who used to start to tell a story about his grandfather he had an awfully retentive memory and he never finished the story because he switched off into something else he used to tell about how his grandfather one day went into a pasture where there was a ram the old man dropped a silver dime in the grass and stooped over to pick it up the ram was observing him and took the old mans action as an invitation  just as he was going to finish about the ram this friend of mine would recall that his grandfather had a niece who had a glass eye she used to loan that glass eye to another lady friend who used it when she received company the eye didnt fit the friends face and it was loose and whenever she winked it would turn aver  then he got on the subject of accidents and he would tell a story about how he believed accidents never happened  there was an irishman coming down a ladder with a hod of bricks he said and a dutchman was standing on the ground below the irishman fell on the dutchman and killed him accident never if the dutchman hadnt been there the irishman would have been killed why didnt the irishman fall on a dog which was next to the dutchman because the dog would have seen him coming  then hed get off from the dutchman to an uncle named reginald wilson reginald went into a carpet factory one day and got twisted into the machinerys belt he went excursioning around the factory until he was properly distributed and was woven into sixtynine yards of the best threeply carpet his wife bought the carpet and then she erected a monument to his memory it read                            sacred to the memory                                    of              sixtynine yards of the best threeply carpet                   containing the mortal remainders of                              reginald wilson                          go thou and do likewise  and so an he would ramble about telling the story of his grandfather until we never were told whether he found the tencent piece or whether something else happened       fulton day jamestown            address delivered september 23 1907            lieutenantgovernor ellyson of virginia in introducing mr           clemens said            the people have come here to bring a tribute of affectionate           recollection for the man who has contributed so much to the           progress of the world and the happiness of mankind  as mr           clemens came down to the platform the applause became louder           and louder until mr clemens held out his hand for silence           it was a great triumph and it was almost a minute after the           applause ceased before mr clemens could speak  he attempted           it once and when the audience noticed his emotion it cheered           again loudly  ladies and gentlemeni am but human and when you give me a reception like that i am obliged to wait a little while i get my voice when you appeal to my head i dont feel it but when you appeal to my heart i do feel it  we are here to celebrate one of the greatest events of american history and not only in american history but in the worlds history  indeed it wasthe application of steam by robert fulton  it was a world eventthere are not many of them it is peculiarly an american event that is true but the influence was very broad in effect we should regard this day as a very great american holiday we have not many that are exclusively american holidays we have the fourth of july which we regard as an american holiday but it is nothing of the kind i am waiting for a dissenting voice all great efforts that led up to the fourth of july were made not by americans but by english residents of america subjects of the king of england  they fought all the fighting that was done they shed and spilt all the blood that was spilt in securing to us the invaluable liberties which are incorporated in the declaration of independence but they were not americans they signed the declaration of independence no americans name is signed to that document at all there never was an american such as you and i are until after the revolution when it had all been fought out and liberty secured after the adoption of the constitution and the recognition of the independence of america by all powers  while we revere the fourth of julyand let us always revere it and the liberties it conferred upon usyet it was not an american event a great american day  it was an american who applied that steam successfully there are not a great many world events and we have our full share the telegraph telephone and the application of steam to navigationthese are great american events  today i have been requested or i have requested myself not to confine myself to furnishing you with information but to remind you of things and to introduce one of the nations celebrants  admiral harrington here is going to tell you all that i have left untold i am going to tell you all that i know and then he will follow up with such rags and remnants as he can find and tell you what he knows  no doubt you have heard a great deal about robert fulton and the influences that have grown from his invention but the little steamboat is suffering neglect  you probably do not know a great deal about that boat it was the most important steamboat in the world i was there and saw it admiral harrington was there at the time it need not surprise you for he is not as old as he looks that little boat was interesting in every way the size of it the boat was one consults admiral he said ten feet long the breadth of that boat consults admiral two hundred feet you see the first and most important detail is the length then the breadth and then the depth the depth of that boat was consults againthe admiral says it was a flat boat then her tonnageyou know nothing about a boat until you know two more things her speed and her tonnage we know the speed she made she made four milesand sometimes five miles it was on her initial trip on august 11 1807 that she made her initial trip when she went from consults admiral jersey cityto chicago thats right she went by way of albany now comes the tonnage of that boat tonnage of a boat means the amount of displacement displacement means the amount of water a vessel can shove in a day the tonnage of man is estimated by the amount of whiskey he can displace in a day  robert fulton named the clermont in honor of his bride that is clermont was the name of the countyseat  i feel that it surprises you that i know so much in my remarks of welcome of admiral harrington i am not going to give him compliments compliments always embarrass a man you do not know anything to say it does not inspire you with words there is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment i have been complimented myself a great many times and they always embarrass mei always feel that they have not said enough  the admiral and myself have held public office and were associated together a great deal a friendly way in the time of pocahontas that incident where pocahontas saves the life of smith from her father powhatans club was gotten up by the admiral and myself to advertise jamestown  at that time the admiral and myself did not have the facilities of advertising that you have  i have known admiral harrington in all kinds of situationsin public service on the platform and in the chaingang now and thenbut it was a mistake a case of mistaken identity i do not think it is at all a necessity to tell you admiral harringtons public history you know that it is in the histories i am not here to tell you anything about his public life but to expose his private life  i am something of a poet when the great poet laureate tennyson died and i found that the place was open i tried to get itbut i did not get it anybody can write the first line of a poem but it is a very difficult task to make the second line rhyme with the first when i was down in australia there were two towns named johnswood and param i made this rhyme                 the people of johnswood are pious and good                the people of param they dont care a  i do not want to compliment admiral harrington but as long as such men as he devote their lives to the public service the credit of the country will never cease i will say that the same high qualities the same moral and intellectual attainments the same graciousness of manner of conduct of observation and expression have caused admiral harrington to be mistaken for meand i have been mistaken for him  a mutual compliment can go no further and i now have the honor and privilege of introducing to you admiral harrington       lotos club dinner in honor of mark twain            address at the first formal dinner in the new clubhouse           november 11 1893            in introducing the guest of the evening mr lawrence said            tonight the old faces appear once more amid new surroundings           the place where last we met about the table has vanished and           tonight we have our first lotos dinner in a home that is all           our own  it is peculiarly fitting that the board should now be           spread in honor of one who has been a member of the club for           full a score of years and it is a happy augury for the future           that our fellowmember whom we assemble to greet should be the           bearer of a most distinguished name in the world of letters           for the lotos club is ever at its best when paying homage to           genius in literature or in art  is there a civilized being who           has not heard the name of mark twain  we knew him long years           ago before he came out of the boundless west brimful of wit           and eloquence with no reverence for anything and went abroad           to educate the untutored european in the subtleties of the           american joke  the world has looked on and applauded while he           has broken many images  he has led us in imagination all over           the globe  with him as our guide we have traversed alike the           mississippi and the sea of galilee  at his bidding we have           laughed at a thousand absurdities  by a laborious process of           reasoning he has convinced us that the egyptian mummies are           actually dead  he has held us spellbound upon the plain at the           foot of the great sphinx and we have joined him in weeping           bitter tears at the tomb of adam  tonight we greet him in the           flesh  what name is there in literature that can be likened to           his  perhaps some of the distinguished gentlemen about this           table can tell us but i know of none  himself his only           parallel  mr president gentlemen and my fellowmembers of the lotos clubi have seldom in my lifetime listened to compliments so felicitously phrased or so well deserved i return thanks for them from a full heart and an appreciative spirit and i will say this in selfdefence while i am charged with having no reverence for anything i wish to say that i have reverence for the man who can utter such truths and i also have a deep reverence and a sincere one for a club that can do such justice to me to be the chief guest of such a club is something to be envied and if i read your countenances rightly i am envied i am glad to see this club in such palatial quarters i remember it twenty years ago when it was housed in a stable  now when i was studying for the ministry there were two or three things that struck my attention particularly at the first banquet mentioned in history that other prodigal son who came back from his travels was invited to stand up and have his say they were all there his brethren david and goliath ander and if he had had such experience as i have had he would have waited until those other people got through talking he got up and testified to all his failings now if he had waited before telling all about his riotous living until the others had spoken he might not have given himself away as he did and i think that i would give myself away if i should go on i think id better wait until the others hand in their testimony then if it is necessary for me to make an explanation i will get up and explain and if i cannot do that ill deny it happened            later in the evening mr clemens made another speech replying           to a fire of short speeches by charles dudley warner charles           a dana seth low general porter and many others each           welcoming the guest of honor  i dont see that i have a great deal to explain i got off very well considering the opportunities that these other fellows had i dont see that mr low said anything against me and neither did mr dana however i will say that i never heard so many lies told in one evening as were told by mr mckelwayand i consider myself very capable but even in his case when he got through i was gratified by finding how much he hadnt found out by accident he missed the very things that i didnt want to have said and now gentlemen about americanism  i have been on the continent of europe for two and a half years i have met many americans there some sojourning for a short time only others making protracted stays and it has been very gratifying to me to find that nearly all preserved their americanism i have found they all like to see the flag fly and that their hearts rise when they see the stars and stripes i met only one lady who had forgotten the land of her birth and glorified monarchical institutions  i think it is a great thing to say that in two and a half years i met only one person who had fallen a victim to the shamsi think we may call them shamsof nobilities and of heredities she was entirely lost in them after i had listened to her for a long time i said to her at least you must admit that we have one merit we are not like the chinese who refuse to allow their citizens who are tired of the country to leave it thank god we dont       copyright            with mr howells edward everett hale thomas nelson page and           a number of other authors mr clemens appeared before the           committee december 6 1906  the new copyright bill           contemplated an authors copyright for the term of his life and           for fifty years thereafter applying also for the benefit of           artists musicians and others but the authors did most of the           talking  f d millet made a speech for the artists and john           philip sousa for the musicians            mr clemens was the last speaker of the day and its chief           feature  he made a speech the serious parts of which created           a strong impression and the humorous parts set the senators           and representatives in roars of laughter  i have read this bill at least i have read such portions as i could understand nobody but a practised legislator can read the bill and thoroughly understand it and i am not a practised legislator  i am interested particularly and especially in the part of the bill which concerns my trade i like that extension of copyright life to the authors life and fifty years afterward i think that would satisfy any reasonable author because it would take care of his children let the grandchildren take care of themselves that would take care of my daughters and after that i am not particular i shall then have long been out of this struggle independent of it indifferent to it  it isnt objectionable to me that all the trades and professions in the united states are protected by the bill i like that they are all important and worthy and if we can take care of them under the copyright law i should like to see it done i should like to see oyster culture added and anything else  i am aware that copyright must have a limit because that is required by the constitution of the united states which sets aside the earlier constitution which we call the decalogue the decalogue says you shall not take away from any man his profit i dont like to be obliged to use the harsh term what the decalogue really says is thou shaft not steal but i am trying to use more polite language  the laws of england and america do take it away do select but one class the people who create the literature of the land they always talk handsomely about the literature of the land always what a fine great monumental thing a great literature is and in the midst of their enthusiasm they turn around and do what they can to discourage it  i know we must have a limit but fortytwo years is too much of a limit i am quite unable to guess why there should be a limit at all to the possession of the product of a mans labor there is no limit to real estate  doctor bale has suggested that a man might just as well after discovering a coalmine and working it fortytwo years have the government step in and take it away  what is the excuse it is that the author who produced that book has had the profit of it long enough and therefore the government takes a profit which does not belong to it and generously gives it to the 88000000 of people but it doesnt do anything of the kind it merely takes the authors property takes his childrens bread and gives the publisher double profit he goes on publishing the book and as many of his confederates as choose to go into the conspiracy do so and they rear families in affluence  and they continue the enjoyment of those illgotten gains generation after generation forever for they never die in a few weeks or months or years i shall be out of it i hope under a monument i hope i shall not be entirely forgotten and i shall subscribe to the monument myself but i shall not be caring what happens if there are fifty years left of my copyright my copyright produces annually a good deal more than i can use but my children can use it i can get along i know a lot of trades but that goes to my daughters who cant get along as well as i can because i have carefully raised them as young ladies who dont know anything and cant do anything i hope congress will extend to them the charity which they have failed to get from me  why if a man who is not even mad but only strenuousstrenuous about racesuicideshould come to me and try to get me to use my large political and ecclesiastical influence to get a bill passed by this congress limiting families to twentytwo children by one mother i should try to calm him down i should reason with him i should say to him leave it alone leave it alone and it will take care of itself only one couple a year in the united states can reach that limit if they have reached that limit let them go right on let them have all the liberty they want in restricting that family to twentytwo children you are merely conferring discomfort and unhappiness on one family per year in a nation of 88000000 which is not worth while  it is the very same with copyright one author per year produces a book which can outlive the fortytwoyear limit thats all this nation cant produce two authors a year that can do it the thing is demonstrably impossible all that the limited copyright can do is to take the bread out of the mouths of the children of that one author per year  i made an estimate some years ago when i appeared before a committee of the house of lords that we had published in this country since the declaration of independence 220000 books they have all gone they had all perished before they were ten years old it is only one book in 1000 that can outlive the fortytwo year limit therefore why put a limit at all you might as well limit the family to twentytwo children  if you recall the americans in the nineteenth century who wrote books that lived fortytwo years you will have to begin with cooper you can follow with washington irving harriet beecher stowe edgar allan poe and there you have to wait a long time you come to emerson and you have to stand still and look further you find howells and t b aldrich and then your numbers begin to run pretty thin and you question if you can name twenty persons in the united states whoin a whole century have written books that would live fortytwo years why you could take them all and put them on one bench there pointing add the wives and children and you could put the result on two or three more benches  one hundred personsthat is the little insignificant crowd whose breadandbutter is to be taken away for what purpose for what profit to anybody you turn these few books into the hands of the pirate and of the legitimate publisher too and they get the profit that should have gone to the wife and children  when i appeared before that committee of the house of lords the chairman asked me what limit i would propose i said perpetuity i could see some resentment in his manner and he said the idea was illogical for the reason that it has long ago been decided that there can be no such thing as property in ideas i said there was property in ideas before queen annes time they had perpetual copyright he said what is a book a book is just built from base to roof on ideas and there can be no property in it  i said i wished he could mention any kind of property on this planet that had a pecuniary value which was not derived from an idea or ideas  he said real estate i put a supposititious case a dozen englishmen who travel through south africa and camp out and eleven of them see nothing at all they are mentally blind but there is one in the party who knows what this harbor means and what the lay of the land means to him it means that some day a railway will go through here and there on that harbor a great city will spring up that is his idea and he has another idea which is to go and trade his last bottle of scotch whiskey and his last horseblanket to the principal chief of that region and buy a piece of land the size of pennsylvania  that was the value of an idea that the day would come when the cape to cairo railway would be built  every improvement that is put upon the real estate is the result of an idea in somebodys head the skyscraper is another idea the railroad is another the telephone and all those things are merely symbols which represent ideas an andiron a washtub is the result of an idea that did not exist before  so if as that gentleman said a book does consist solely of ideas that is the best argument in the world that it is property and should not be under any limitation at all we dont ask for that fifty years from now we shall ask for it  i hope the bill will pass without any deleterious amendments i do seem to be extraordinarily interested in a whole lot of arts and things that i have got nothing to do with it is a part of my generous liberal nature i cant help it i feel the same sort of charity to everybody that was manifested by a gentleman who arrived at home at two oclock in the morning from the club and was feeling so perfectly satisfied with life so happy and so comfortable and there was his house weaving weaving weaving around he watched his chance and by and by when the steps got in his neighborhood he made a jump and climbed up and got on the portico  and the house went on weaving and weaving and weaving but he watched the door and when it came around his way he plunged through it he got to the stairs and when he went up on all fours the house was so unsteady that he could hardly make his way but at last he got to the top and raised his foot and put it on the top step but only the toe hitched on the step and he rolled down and fetched up on the bottom step with his arm around the newelpost and he said  god pity the poor sailors out at sea on a night like this       in aid of the blind            address at a public meeting of the new york association for           promoting the interests of the blind at the waldorf astoria           march 29 1906  if you detect any awkwardness in my movements and infelicities in my conduct i will offer the explanation that i never presided at a meeting of any kind before in my life and that i do find it out of my line i supposed i could do anything anybody else could but i recognize that experience helps and i do feel the lack of that experience i dont feel as graceful and easy as i ought to be in order to impress an audience i shall not pretend that i know how to umpire a meeting like this and i shall just take the humble place of the essex band  there was a great gathering in a small new england town about twentyfive years ago i remember that circumstance because there was something that happened at that time it was a great occasion they gathered in the militia and orators and everybody from all the towns around it was an extraordinary occasion  the little local paper threw itself into ecstasies of admiration and tried to do itself proud from beginning to end it praised the orators the militia and all the bands that came from everywhere and all this in honest country newspaper detail but the writer ran out of adjectives toward the end having exhausted his whole magazine of praise and glorification he found he still had one band left over he had to say something about it and he said the essex band done the best it could  i am an essex band on this occasion and i am going to get through as well as inexperience and good intentions will enable me i have got all the documents here necessary to instruct you in the objects and intentions of this meeting and also of the association which has called the meeting but they are too voluminous i could not pack those statistics into my head and i had to give it up i shall have to just reduce all that mass of statistics to a few salient facts there are too many statistics and figures for me i never could do anything with figures never had any talent for mathematics never accomplished anything in my efforts at that rugged study and today the only mathematics i know is multiplication and the minute i get away up in that as soon as i reach nine times seven  mr clemens lapsed into deep thought for a moment he was trying to figure out nine times seven but it was a hopeless task and he turned to st clair mckelway who sat near him mr mckelway whispered the answer and the speaker resumed  ive got it now its eightyfour well i can get that far all right with a little hesitation after that i am uncertain and i cant manage a statistic  this association for the  mr clemens was in another dilemma again he was obliged to turn to mr mckelway  oh yes for promoting the interests of the blind its a long name if i could i would write it out for you and let you take it home and study it but i dont know how to spell it and mr carnegie is down in virginia somewhere well anyway the object of that association which has been recently organized five months ago in fact is in the hands of very very energetic intelligent and capable people and they will push it to success very surely and all the more surely if you will give them a little of your assistance out of your pockets  the intention the purpose is to search out all the blind and find work for them to do so that they may earn their own bread now it is dismal enough to be blindit is dreary dreary life at best but it can be largely ameliorated by finding something for these poor blind people to do with their hands the time passes so heavily that it is never day or night with them it is always night and when they have to sit with folded hands and with nothing to do to amuse or entertain or employ their minds it is drearier and drearier  and then the knowledge they have that they must subsist on charity and so often reluctant charity it would renew their lives if they could have something to do with their hands and pass their time and at the same time earn their bread and know the sweetness of the bread which is the result of the labor of ones own hands they need that cheer and pleasure it is the only way you can turn their night into day to give them happy hearts the only thing you can put in the place of the blessed sun that you can do in the way i speak of  blind people generally who have seen the light know what it is to miss the light those who have gone blind since they were twenty years oldtheir lives are unendingly dreary but they can be taught to use their hands and to employ themselves at a great many industries that association from which this draws its birth in cambridge massachusetts has taught its blind to make many things they make them better than most people and more honest than people who have the use of their eyes the goods they make are readily salable people like them and so they are supporting themselves and it is a matter of cheer cheer they pass their time now not too irksomely as they formerly did  what this association needs and wants is 15000 the figures are set down and what the money is for and there is no graft in it or i would not be here and they hope to beguile that out of your pockets and you will find affixed to the programme an opportunity that little blank which you will fill out and promise so much money now or tomorrow or some time then there is another opportunity which is still better and that is that you shall subscribe an annual sum  i have invented a good many useful things in my time but never anything better than that of getting money out of people who dont want to part with it it is always for good objects of course this is the plan when you call upon a person to contribute to a great and good object and you think he should furnish about 1000 he disappoints you as like as not much the best way to work him to supply that thousand dollars is to split it into parts and contribute say a hundred dollars a year or fifty or whatever the sum maybe let him contribute ten or twenty a year he doesnt feel that but he does feel it when you call upon him to contribute a large amount when you get used to it you would rather contribute than borrow money  i tried it in helen kellers case mr hutton wrote me in 1896 or 1897 when i was in london and said the gentleman who has been so liberal in taking care of helen keller has died without making provision for her in his will and now they dont know what to do they were proposing to raise a fund and he thought 50000 enough to furnish an income of 2400 or 2500 a year for the support of that wonderful girl and her wonderful teacher miss sullivan now mrs macy i wrote to mr hutton and said go on get up your fund it will be slow but if you want quick work i propose this system the system i speak of of asking people to contribute such and such a sum from year to year and drop out whenever they please and he would find there wouldnt be any difficulty people wouldnt feel the burden of it and he wrote back saying he had raised the 2400 a year indefinitely by that system in a single afternoon we would like to do something just like that tonight we will take as many checks as you care to give you can leave your donations in the big room outside  i knew once what it was to be blind i shall never forget that experience i have been as blind as anybody ever was for three or four hours and the sufferings that i endured and the mishaps and the accidents that are burning in my memory make my sympathy rise when i feel for the blind and always shall feel i once went to heidelberg on an excursion i took a clergyman along with me the rev joseph twichell of hartford who is still among the living despite that fact i always travel with clergymen when i can it is better for them it is better for me and any preacher who goes out with me in stormy weather and without a lightning rod is a good one the reverend twichell is one of those people filled with patience and endurance two good ingredients for a man travelling with me so we got along very well together in that old town they have not altered a house nor built one in 1500 years we went to the inn and they placed twichell and me in a most colossal bedroom the largest i ever saw or heard of it was as big as this room  i didnt take much notice of the place i didnt really get my bearings i noticed twichell got a german bed about two feet wide the kind in which youve got to lie on your edge because there isnt room to lie on your back and he was way down south in that big room and i was way up north at the other end of it with a regular sahara in between  we went to bed twichell went to sleep but then he had his conscience loaded and it was easy for him to get to sleep i couldnt get to sleep it was one of those torturing kinds of lovely summer nights when you hear various kinds of noises now and then a mouse away off in the southwest you throw things at the mouse that encourages the mouse but i couldnt stand it and about two oclock i got up and thought i would give it up and go out in the square where there was one of those tinkling fountains and sit on its brink and dream full of romance  i got out of bed and i ought to have lit a candle but i didnt think of it until it was too late it was the darkest place that ever was there has never been darkness any thicker than that it just lay in cakes  i thought that before dressing i would accumulate my clothes i pawed around in the dark and found everything packed together on the floor except one sock i couldnt get on the track of that sock it might have occurred to me that maybe it was in the wash but i didnt think of that i went excursioning on my hands and knees presently i thought i am never going to find it ill go back to bed again that is what i tried to do during the next three hours i had lost the bearings of that bed i was going in the wrong direction all the time byandby i came in collision with a chair and that encouraged me  it seemed to me as far as i could recollect there was only a chair here and there and yonder five or six of them scattered over this territory and i thought maybe after i found that chair i might find the next one well i did and i found another and another and another i kept going around on my hands and knees having those sudden collisions and finally when i banged into another chair i almost lost my temper and i raised up garbed as i was not for public exhibition right in front of a mirror fifteen or sixteen feet high  i hadnt noticed the mirror didnt know it was there and when i saw myself in the mirror i was frightened out of my wits i dont allow any ghosts to bite me and i took up a chair and smashed at it a million pieces then i reflected thats the way i always do and its unprofitable unless a man has had much experience that way and has clear judgment and i had judgment and i would have had to pay for that mirror if i hadnt recollected to say it was twichell who broke it  then i got down on my hands and knees and went on another exploring expedition  as far as i could remember there were six chairs in that oklahoma and one table a great big heavy table not a good table to hit with your head when rushing madly along in the course of time i collided with thirtyfive chairs and tables enough to stock that diningroom out there it was a hospital for decayed furniture and it was in a worse condition when i got through with it i went on and on and at last got to a place where i could feel my way up and there was a shelf i knew that wasnt in the middle of the room up to that time i was afraid i had gotten out of the city  i was very careful and pawed along that shelf and there was a pitcher of water about a foot high and it was at the head of twichells bed but i didnt know it i felt that pitcher going and i grabbed at it but it didnt help any and came right down in twichells face and nearly drowned him but it woke him up i was grateful to have company on any terms he lit a match and there i was way down south when i ought to have been back up yonder my bed was out of sight it was so far away you needed a telescope to find it twichell comforted me and i scrubbed him off and we got sociable  but that night wasnt wasted i had my pedometer on my leg twichell and i were in a pedometer match twichell had longer legs than i the only way i could keep up was to wear my pedometer to bed i always walk in my sleep and on this occasion i gained sixteen miles on him after all i never found that sock i never have seen it from that day to this but that adventure taught me what it is to be blind that was one of the most serious occasions of my whole life yet i never can speak of it without somebody thinking it isnt serious you try it and see how serious it is to be as the blind are and i was that night  mr clemens read several letters of regret he then introduced joseph h choate saying  it is now my privilege to present to you mr choate i dont have to really introduce him i dont have to praise him or to flatter him i could say truly that in the fortyseven years i have been familiarly acquainted with him he has always been the handsomest man america has ever produced and i hope and believe he will hold the belt fortyfive years more he has served his country ably faithfully and brilliantly he stands at the summit at the very top in the esteem and regard of his countrymen and if i could say one word which would lift him any higher in his countrymens esteem and affection i would say that word whether it was true or not       dr mark twain farmeopath            address at the annual dinner of the new york postgraduate           medical school and hospital january 21 1909            the president dr  george n  miller in introducing mr           clemens referred to his late experience with burglars  gentlemen and doctorsi am glad to be among my own kind tonight i was once a sharpshooter but now i practise a much higher and equally as deadly a profession it wasnt so very long ago that i became a member of your cult and for the time ive been in the business my record is one that cant be scoffed at  as to the burglars i am perfectly familiar with these people i have always had a good deal to do with burglarsnot officially but through their attentions to me i never suffered anything at the hands of a burglar they have invaded my house time and time again they never got anything then those people who burglarized our house in septemberwe got back the plated ware they took off we jailed them and i have been sorry ever since they did us a great service they scared off all the servants in the place  i consider the childrens theatre of which i am president and the postgraduate medical school as the two greatest institutions in the country this school in bringing its twenty thousand physicians from all parts of the country bringing them up to date and sending them back with renewed confidence has surely saved hundreds of thousands of lives which otherwise would have been lost  i have been practising now for seven months when i settled on my farm in connecticut in june i found the community very thinly settledand since i have been engaged in practice it has become more thinly settled still this gratifies me as indicating that i am making an impression on my community i suppose it is the same with all of you  i have always felt that i ought to do something for you and so i organized a redding connecticut branch of the postgraduate school i am only a country farmer up there but i am doing the best i can  of course the practice of medicine and surgery in a remote country district has its disadvantages but in my case i am happy in a division of responsibility i practise in conjunction with a horsedoctor a sexton and an undertaker the combination is airtight and once a man is stricken in our district escape is impossible for him  these four of usthree in the regular profession and the fourth an undertakerare all good men there is bill ferguson the redding undertaker bill is there in every respect he is a little lukewarm on general practice and writes his name with a rubber stamp like my old southern friend he is one of the finest planters anywhere  then there is jim ruggles the horsedoctor ruggles is one of the best men i have got he also is not much on general medicine but he is a fine horsedoctor ferguson doesnt make any money off him  you see the combination started this way when i got up to redding and had become a doctor i looked around to see what my chances were for aiding in the great work the first thing i did was to determine what manner of doctor i was to be being a connecticut farmer i naturally consulted my farmacopia and at once decided to become a farmeopath  then i got circulating about and got in touch with ferguson and ruggles ferguson joined readily in my ideas but ruggles kept saying that while it was all right for an undertaker to get aboard he couldnt see where it helped horses  well we started to find out what was the trouble with the community and it didnt take long to find out that there was just one disease and that was racesuicide and driving about the countryside i was told by my fellowfarmers that it was the only rational human and valuable disease but it is cutting into our profits so that well either have to stop it or well have to move  weve had some funny experiences up there in redding not long ago a fellow came along with a rolling gait and a distressed face we asked him what was the matter we always hold consultations on every case as there isnt business enough for four he said he didnt know but that he was a sailor and perhaps that might help us to give a diagnosis we treated him for that and i never saw a man die more peacefully  that same afternoon my dog tige treed an african gentleman we chained up the dog and then the gentleman came down and said he had appendicitis we asked him if he wanted to be cut open and he said yes that hed like to know if there was anything in it so we cut him open and found nothing in him but darkness so we diagnosed his case as infidelity because he was dark inside tige is a very clever dog and aids us greatly  the other day a patient came to me and inquired if i was old doctor clemens  as a practitioner i have given a great deal of my attention to brights disease i have made some rules for treating it that may be valuable listen  rule 1 when approaching the bedside of one whom an allwise presidenti mean an allwise providencewell anyway its the same thinghas seen fit to afflict with diseasewell the rule is simple even if it is oldfashioned  rule 2 ive forgotten just what it is but  rule 3 this is always indispensable bleed your patient       missouri university speech            address delivered june 4 1902 at columbia mo            when the name of samuel l clemens was called the humorist           stepped forward put his hand to his hair and apparently           hesitated  there was a dead silence for a moment  suddenly           the entire audience rose and stood in silence  some one began           to spell out the word missouri with an interval between the           letters  all joined in  then the house again became silent           mr clemens broke the spell  as you are all standing he drawled in his characteristic voice i guess i suppose i had better stand too  then came a laugh and loud cries for a speech as the great humorist spoke of his recent visit to hannibal his old home his voice trembled  you cannot know what a strain it was on my emotions he said in fact when i found myself shaking hands with persons i had not seen for fifty years and looking into wrinkled faces that were so young and joyous when i last saw them i experienced emotions that i had never expected and did not know were in me i was profoundly moved anal saddened to think that this was the last time perhaps that i would ever behold those kind old faces and dear old scenes of childhood  the humorist then changed to a lighter mood and for a time the audience was in a continual roar of laughter he was particularly amused at the eulogy on himself read by gardiner lathrop in conferring the degree he has a fine opportunity to distinguish himself said mr clemens by telling the truth about me  i have seen it stated in print that as a boy i had been guilty of stealing peaches apples and watermelons i read a story to this effect very closely not long ago and i was convinced of one thing which was that the man who wrote it was of the opinion that it was wrong to steal and that i had not acted right in doing so i wish now however to make an honest statement which is that i do not believe in all my checkered career i stole a ton of peaches  one night i stolei mean i removeda watermelon from a wagon while the owner was attending to another customer i crawled off to a secluded spot where i found that it was green it was the greenest melon in the mississippi valley then i began to reflect i began to be sorry i wondered what george washington would have done had he been in my place i thought a long time and then suddenly felt that strange feeling which comes to a man with a good resolution and i took up that watermelon and took it back to its owner i handed him the watermelon and told him to reform he took my lecture much to heart and when he gave me a good one in place of the green melon i forgave him  i told him that i would still be a customer of his and that i cherished no illfeeling because of the incidentthat would remain green in my memory       business            the alumni of eastman college gave their annual banquet           march 30 1901 at the y m c a building mr james g           cannon of the fourth national bank made the first speech of           the evening after which mr clemens was introduced by mr           bailey as the personal friend of tom sawyer who was one of the           types of successful business men  mr cannon has furnished me with texts enough to last as slow a speaker as myself all the rest of the night i took exception to the introducing of mr cannon as a great financier as if he were the only great financier present i am a financier but my methods are not the same as mr cannons  i cannot say that i have turned out the great business man that i thought i was when i began life but i am comparatively young yet and may learn i am rather inclined to believe that what troubled me was that i got the bighead early in the game i want to explain to you a few points of difference between the principles of business as i see them and those that mr cannon believes in  he says that the primary rule of business success is loyalty to your employer thats all rightas a theory what is the matter with loyalty to yourself as nearly as i can understand mr cannons methods there is one great drawback to them he wants you to work a great deal diligence is a good thing but taking things easy is much morerestful my idea is that the employer should be the busy man and the employee the idle one the employer should be the worried man and the employee the happy one and why not he gets the salary my plan is to get another man to do the work for me in that theres more repose what i want is repose first last and all the time  mr cannon says that there are three cardinal rules of business success they are diligence honesty and truthfulness well diligence is all right let it go as a theory honesty is the best policywhen there is money in it but truthfulness is one of the most dangerouswhy this man is misleading you  i had an experience today with my wife which illustrates this i was acknowledging a belated invitation to another dinner for this evening which seemed to have been sent about ten days ago it only reached me this morning i was mortified at the discourtesy into which i had been brought by this delay and wondered what was being thought of me by my hosts as i had accepted your invitation of course i had to send regrets to my other friends  when i started to write this note my wife came up and stood looking over my shoulder women always want to know what is going on said she should not that read in the third person i conceded that it should put aside what i was writing and commenced over again that seemed to satisfy her and so she sat down and let me proceed i thenfinished my first noteand so sent what i intended i never could have done this if i had let my wife know the truth about it here is what i wrote       to the ohio societyi have at this moment received a most kind      invitation eleven days old from mr southard president and a      like one ten days old from mr bryant president of the press      club  i thank the society cordially for the compliment of these      invitations although i am booked elsewhere and cannot come       but oh i should like to know the name of the lightning express by      which they were forwarded for i owe a friend a dozen chickens and      i believe it will be cheaper to send eggs instead and let them      develop on the road                     sincerely yours                                         mark twain   i want to tell you of some of my experiences in business and then i will be in a position to lay down one general rule for the guidance of those who want to succeed in business my first effort was about twentyfive years ago i took hold of an inventioni dont know now what it was all about but some one came to me tend told me it was a good thing and that there was lots of money in it he persuaded me to invest 15000 and i lived up to my beliefs by engaging a man to develop it to make a long story short i sunk 40000 in it  then i took up the publication of a book i called in a publisher and said to him i want you to publish this book along lines which i shall lay down i am the employer and you are the employee i am going to show them some new kinks in the publishing business and i want you to draw on me for money as you go along which he did he drew on me for 56000 then i asked him to take the book and call it off but he refused to do that  my next venture was with a machine for doing something or other i knew less about that than i did about the invention but i sunk 170000 in the business and i cant for the life of me recollect what it was the machine was to do  i was still undismayed you see one of the strong points about my business life was that i never gave up i undertook to publish general grants book and made 140000 in six months my axiom is to succeed in business avoid my example       carnegie the benefactor            at the dinner given in honor of andrew carnegie by the lotos           club march 17 1909 mr clemens appeared in a white suit from           head to feet  he wore a white doublebreasted coat white           trousers and white shoes  the only relief was a big black           cigar which he confidentially informed the company was not           from his usual stack bought at 3 per barrel  the state of missouri has for its coat of arms a barrelhead with two missourians one on each side of it and mark the mottounited we stand divided we fall mr carnegie this evening has suffered from compliments it is interesting to hear what people will say about a man why at the banquet given by this club in my honor mr carnegie had the inspiration for which the club is now honoring him if dunfermline contributed so much to the united states in contributing mr carnegie what would have happened if all scotland had turned out these dunfermline folk have acquired advantages in coming to america  doctor mckelway paid the top compliment the cumulation when he said of mr carnegie  there is a man who wants to pay more taxes than he is charged richard watson gilder did very well for a poet he advertised his magazine he spoke of hiring mr carnegiethe next thing he will be trying to hire me  if i undertookto pay compliments i would do it stronger than any others have done it for what mr carnegie wants are strong compliments now the other side of seventy i have preserved as my chiefest virtue modesty       on poetry veracity and suicide            address at a dinner of the manhattan dickens fellowship           new york city february 7 1906            this dinner was in commemoration of the ninetyfourth           anniversary of the birth of charles dickens  on an other           occasion mr clemens told the same story with variations and a           different conclusion to the university settlement society  i always had taken an interest in young people who wanted to become poets i remember i was particularly interested in one budding poet when i was a reporter his name was butter  one day he came to me and said disconsolately that he was going to commit suicidehe was tired of life not being able to express his thoughts in poetic form butter asked me what i thought of the idea  i said i would that it was a good idea you can do me a friendly turn you go off in a private place and do it there and ill get it all you do it and ill do as much for you some time  at first he determined to drown himself drowning is so nice and clean and writes up so well in a newspaper  but things neer do go smoothly in weddings suicides or courtships only there at the edge of the water where butter was to end himself lay a lifepreservera big round canvas one which would float after the scrapiron was soaked out of it  butter wouldnt kill himself with the lifepreserver in sight and so i had an idea i took it to a pawnshop and soaked it for a revolver the pawnbroker didnt think much of the exchange but when i explained the situation he acquiesced we went up on top of a high building and this is what happened to the poet  he put the revolver to his forehead and blew a tunnel straight through his head the tunnel was about the size of your finger you could look right through it the job was complete there was nothing in it  well after that that man never could write prose but he could write poetry he could write it after he had blown his brains out there is lots of that talent all over the country but the trouble is they dont develop it  i am suffering now from the fact that i who have told the truth a good many times in my life have lately received more letters than anybody else urging me to lead a righteous life i have more friends who want to see me develop on a high level than anybody else  young john d rockefeller two weeks ago taught his bible class all about veracity and why it was better that everybody should always keep a plentiful supply on hand some of the letters i have received suggest that i ought to attend his class and learn too why i know mr rockefeller and he is a good fellow he is competent in many ways to teach a bible class but when it comes to veracity he is only thirtyfive years old im seventy years old i have been familiar with veracity twice as long as he  and the story about george washington and his little hatchet has also been suggested to me in these lettersin a fugitive way as if i needed some of george washington and his hatchet in my constitution why dear me they overlook the real point in that story the point is not the one that is usually suggested and you can readily see that  the point is not that george said to his father yes father i cut down the cheerytree i cant tell a lie but that the little boyonly seven years oldshould have his sagacity developed under such circumstances he was a boy wise beyond his years his conduct then was a prophecy of later years yes i think he was the most remarkable man the country ever producedup to my time anyway  now then little george realized that circumstantial evidence was against him he knew that his father would know from the size of the chips that no fullgrown hatchet cut that tree down and that no man would have haggled it so he knew that his father would send around the plantation and inquire for a small boy with a hatchet and he had the wisdom to come out and confess it now the idea that his father was overjoyed when he told little george that he would rather have him cut down a thousand cheerytrees than tell a lie is all nonsense what did he really mean why that he was absolutely astonished that he had a son who had the chance to tell a lie and didnt  i admire old georgeif that was his namefor his discernment he knew when he said that his son couldnt tell a lie that he was stretching it a good deal he wouldnt have to go to john d rockefellers bible class to find that out the way the old george washington story goes down it doesnt do anybody any good it only discourages people who can tell a lie       welcome home            address at the dinner in his honor at the lotos club           november 10 1900  in august 1895 just before sailing for australia mr clemens issued the following statement  it has been reported that i sacrificed for the benefit of the creditors the property of the publishing firm whose financial backer i was and that i am now lecturing for my own benefit  this is an error i intend the lectures as well as the property for the creditors the law recognizes no mortgage on a mans brains and a merchant who has given up all he has may take advantage of the laws of insolvency and may start free again for himself but i am not a business man and honor is a harder master than the law it cannot compromise for less than one hundred cents on a dollar and its debts are never outlawed  i had a twothirds interest in the publishing firm whose capital i furnished if the firm had prospered i would have expected to collect twothirds of the profits as it is i expect to pay all the debts my partner has no resources and i do not look for assistance to my wife whose contributions in cash from her own means have nearly equalled the claims of all the creditors combined she has taken nothing on the contrary she has helped and intends to help me to satisfy the obligations due to the rest of the creditors  it is my intention to ask my creditors to accept that as a legal discharge and trust to my honor to pay the other fifty per cent as fast as i can earn it from my reception thus far on my lecturing tour i am confident that if i live i can pay off the last debt within four years  after which at the age of sixtyfour i can make a fresh and unincumbered start in life i am going to australia india and south africa and next year i hope to make a tour of the great cities of the united states  i thank you all out of my heart for this fraternal welcome and it seems almost too fine almost too magnificent for a humble missourian such as i am far from his native haunts on the banks of the mississippi yet my modesty is in a degree fortified by observing that i am not the only missourian who has been honored here tonight for i see at this very tablehere is a missourian indicating mr mckelway and there is a missourian indicating mr depew and there is another missourianand hendrix and clemens and last but not least the greatest missourian of them allhere he sitstom reed who has always concealed his birth till now and since i have been away i know what has been happening in his case he has deserted politics and now is leading a creditable life he has reformed and god prosper him and i judge by a remark which he made upstairs awhile ago that he had found a new business that is utterly suited to his make and constitution and all he is doing now is that he is around raising the average of personal beauty  but i am grateful to the president for the kind words which he has said of me and it is not for me to say whether these praises were deserved or not i prefer to accept them just as they stand without concerning myself with the statistics upon which they have been built but only with that large matter that essential matter the goodfellowship the kindliness the magnanimity and generosity that prompted their utterance well many things have happened since i sat here before and now that i think of it the presidents reference to the debts which were left by the bankrupt firm of charles l webster  co gives me an opportunity to say a word which i very much wish to say not for myself but for ninetyfive men and women whom i shall always hold in high esteem and in pleasant remembrancethe creditors of that firm they treated me well they treated me handsomely there were ninetysix of them and by not a fingers weight did ninetyfive of them add to the burden of that time for me ninetyfive out of the ninetysixthey didnt indicate by any word or sign that they were anxious about their money they treated me well and i shall not forget it i could not forget it if i wanted to many of them said dont you worry dont you hurry thats what they said why if i could have that kind of creditors always and that experience i would recognize it as a personal loss to be out of debt i owe those ninetyfive creditors a debt of homage and i pay it now in such measure as one may pay so fine a debt in mere words yes they said that very thing i was not personally acquainted with ten of them and yet they said dont you worry and dont you hurry i know that phrase by heart and if all the other music should perish out of the world it would still sing to me i appreciate that i am glad to say this word people say so much about me and they forget those creditors they were handsomer than i wasor tom reed  oh you have been doing many things in this time that i have been absent you have done lots of things some that are well worth remembering too now we have fought a righteous war since i have gone and that is rare in historya righteous war is so rare that it is almost unknown in history but by the grace of that war we set cuba free and we joined her to those three or four nations that exist on this earth and we started out to set those poor filipinos free too and why why why that most righteous purpose of ours has apparently miscarried i suppose i never shall know  but we have made a most creditable record in china in these daysour sound and levelheaded administration has made a most creditable record over there and there are some of the powers that cannot say that by any means the yellow terror is threatening this world today it is looming vast and ominous on that distant horizon i do not know what is going to be the result of that yellow terror but our government has had no hand in evoking it and lets be happy in that and proud of it  we have nursed free silver we watched by its cradle we have done the best we could to raise that child but those pestiferous republicans havewell they keep giving it the measles every chance they get and we never shall raise that child well thats no mattertheres plenty of other things to do and we must think of something else well we have tried a president four years criticised him and found fault with him the whole time and turned around a day or two ago with votes enough to spare to elect another o consistency consistency thy namei dont know what thy name isthompson will doany name will dobut you see there is the fact there is the consistency then we have tried for governor an illustrious rough rider and we liked him so much in that great office that now we have made him vicepresidentnot in order that that office shall give him distinction but that he may confer distinction upon that office and its needed tooits needed and now for a while anyway we shall not be stammering and embarrassed when a stranger asks us what is the name of the vicepresident this one is known this one is pretty well known pretty widely known and in some quarters favorably i am not accustomed to dealing in these fulsome compliments and i am probably overdoing it a little butwell my old affectionate admiration for governor roosevelt has probably betrayed me into the complimentary excess but i know him and you know him and if you give him rope enoughi mean ifoh yes he will justify that compliment leave it just as it is and now we have put in his place mr odell another rough rider i suppose all the fat things go to that profession now why i could have been a rough rider myself if i had known that this political klondike was going to open up and i would have been a rough rider if i could have gone to war on an automobile but not on a horse no i know the horse too well i have known the horse in war and in peace and there is no place where a horse is comfortable the horse has too many caprices and he is too much given to initiative he invents too many new ideas no i dont want anything to do with a horse  and then we have taken chauncey depew out of a useful and active life and made him a senatorembalmed him corked him up and i am not grieving that man has said many a true thing about me in his time and i always said something would happen to him look at that pointing to mr depew gilded mummy he has made my life a sorrow to me at many a banquet on both sides of the ocean and now he has got it perish the hand that pulls that cork  all these things have happened all these things have come to pass while i have been away and it just shows how little a mugwump can be missed in a cold unfeeling world even when he is the last one that is lefta grand old party all by himself and there is another thing that has happened perhaps the most imposing event of them all the institution called the daughters of thecrownthe daughters of the royal crownhas established itself and gone into business now theres an american idea for you theres an idea born of god knows what kind of specialized insanity but not softening of the brainyou cannot soften a thing that doesnt existthe daughters of the royal crown nobody eligible but american descendants of charles ii dear me how the fancy product of that old harem still holds out  well i am truly glad to foregather with you again and partake of the bread and salt of this hospitable house once more seven years ago when i was your guest here when i was old and despondent you gave me the grip and the word that lift a man up and make him glad to be alive and now i come back from my exile young again fresh and alive and ready to begin life once more and your welcome puts the finishing touch upon my restored youth and makes it real to me and not a gracious dream that must vanish with the morning i thank you       an undelivered speech            the steamship st paul was to have been launched from cramps           shipyard in philadelphia on march 25 1895  after the           launching a luncheon was to have been given at which mr           clemens was to make a speech  just before the final word was           given a reporter asked mr clemens for a copy of his speech to           be delivered at the luncheon  to facilitate the work of the           reporter he loaned him a typewritten copy of the speech  it           happened however that when the blocks were knocked away the           big ship refused to budge and no amount of labor could move           her an inch  she had stuck fast upon the ways  as a result           the launching was postponed for a week or two but in the mean           time mr clemens had gone to europe  years after a reporter           called on mr clemens and submitted the manuscript of the           speech which was as follows  day after tomorrow i sail for england in a ship of this line the paris it will be my fourteenth crossing in three years and a half therefore my presence here as you see is quite natural quite commercial i am interested in ships they interest me more now than hotels do when a new ship is launched i feel a desire to go and see if she will be good quarters for me to live in particularly if she belongs to this line for it is by this line that i have done most of my ferrying  people wonder why i go so much well i go partly for my health partly to familiarize myself with the road i have gone over the same road so many times now that i know all the whales that belong along the route and latterly it is an embarrassment to me to meet them for they do not look glad to see me but annoyed and they seem to say here is this old derelict again  earlier in life this would have pained me and made me ashamed but i am older now and when i am behaving myself and doing right i do not care for a whales opinion about me when we are young we generally estimate an opinion by the size of the person that holds it but later we find that that is an uncertain rule for we realize that there are times when a hornets opinion disturbs us more than an emperors  i do not mean that i care nothing at all for a whales opinion for that would be going to too great a length of course it is better to have the good opinion of a whale than his disapproval but my position is that if you cannot have a whales good opinion except at some sacrifice of principle or personal dignity it is better to try to live without it that is my idea about whales  yes i have gone over that same route so often that i know my way without a compass just by the waves i know all the large waves and a good many of the small ones also the sunsets i know every sunset and where it belongs just by its color necessarily then i do not make the passage now for scenery that is all gone by  what i prize most is safety and in the second place swift transit and handiness these are best furnished by the american line whose watertight compartments have no passage through them no doors to be left open and consequently no way for water to get from one of them to another in time of collision if you nullify the peril which collisions threaten you with you nullify the only very serious peril which attends voyages in the great liners of our day and makes voyaging safer than staying at home  when the paris was halftorn to pieces some years ago enough of the atlantic ebbed and flowed through one end of her during her long agony to sink the fleets of the world if distributed among them but she floated in perfect safety and no life was lost in time of collision the rock of gibraltar is not safer than the paris and other great ships of this line this seems to be the only great line in the world that takes a passenger from metropolis to metropolis without the intervention of tugs and barges or bridgestakes him through without breaking bulk so to speak  on the english side he lands at a dock on the dock a special train is waiting in an hour and threequarters he is in london nothing could be handier if your journey were from a sandpit on our side to a lighthouse on the other you could make it quicker by other lines but that is not the case the journey is from the city of new york to the city of london and no line can do that journey quicker than this one nor anywhere near as conveniently and handily and when the passenger lands on our side he lands on the american side of the river not in the provinces as a very learned man said on the last voyage he is head quartermaster of the new york land garboard streak of the middle watch  when we land a passenger on the american side theres nothing betwix him and his hotel but hell and the hackman  i am glad with you and the nation to welcome the new ship she is another pride another consolation for a great country whose mighty fleets have all vanished and which has almost forgotten what it is to fly its flag to sea i am not sure as to which st paul she is named for some think it is the one that is on the upper mississippi but the head quartermaster told me it was the one that killed goliath but it is not important no matter which it is let us give her hearty welcome and godspeed       sixtyseventh birthday            at the metropolitan club new york november 28 1902            address at a dinner given in honor of mr clemens by colonel           harvey president of harper  brothers  i think i ought to be allowed to talk as long as i want to for the reason that i have cancelled all my winters engagements of every kind for good and sufficient reasons and am making no new engagements for this winter and therefore this is the only chance i shall have to disembowel my skull for a yearclose the mouth in that portrait for a year i want to offer thanks and homage to the chairman for this innovation which he has introduced here which is an improvement as i consider it on the oldfashioned style of conducting occasions like this that was bad that was a bad bad bad arrangement under that old custom the chairman got up and made a speech he introduced the prisoner at the bar and covered him all over with compliments nothing but compliments not a thing but compliments never a slur and sat down and left that man to get up and talk without a text you cannot talk on compliments that is not a text no modest person and i was born one can talk on compliments a man gets up and is filled to the eyes with happy emotions but his tongue is tied he has nothing to say he is in the condition of doctor rices friend who came home drunk and explained it to his wife and his wife said to him john when you have drunk all the whiskey you want you ought to ask for sarsaparilla he said yes but when i have drunk all the whiskey i want i cant say sarsaparilla and so i think it is much better to leave a man unmolested until the testimony and pleadings are all in otherwise he is dumbhe is at the sarsaparilla stage  before i get to the higgledypiggledy point as mr howells suggested i do i want to thank you gentlemen for this very high honor you are doing me and i am quite competent to estimate it at its value i see around me captains of all the illustrious industries most distinguished men there are more than fifty here and i believe i know thirtynine of them well i could probably borrow money fromfrom the others anyway it is a proud thing to me indeed to see such a distinguished company gather here on such an occasion as this when there is no foreign prince to be fetedwhen you have come here not to do honor to hereditary privilege and ancient lineage but to do reverence to mere moral excellence and elemental veracityand dear me how old it seems to make me i look around me and i see three or four persons i have known so many many years i have known mr secretary hayjohn hay as the nation and the rest of his friends love to call himi have known john hay and tom reed and the reverend twichell close upon thirtysix years close upon thirtysix years i have known those venerable men i have known mr howells nearly thirtyfour years and i knew chauncey depew before he could walk straight and before he learned to tell the truth twentyseven years ago i heard him make the most noble and eloquent and beautiful speech that has ever fallen from even his capable lips tom reed said that my principal defect was inaccuracy of statement well suppose that that is true whats the use of telling the truth all the time i never tell the truth about tom reedbut that is his defect truth he speaks the truth always tom reed has a good heart and he has a good intellect but he hasnt any judgment why when tom reed was invited to lecture to the ladies society for the procreation or procrastination or something of morals i dont know what it wasadvancement i suppose of pure moralshe had the immortal indiscretion to begin by saying that some of us cant be optimists but by judiciously utilizing the opportunities that providence puts in our way we can all be bigamists you perceive his limitations anything he has in his mind he states if he thinks it is true well that was true but that was no place to say itso they fired him out  a lot of accounts have been settled here tonight for me i have held grudges against some of these people but they have all been wiped out by the very handsome compliments that have been paid me even wayne macveaghi have had a grudge against him many years the first time i saw wayne macveagh was at a private dinnerparty at charles a danas and when i got there he was clattering along and i tried to get a word in here and there but you know what wayne macveagh is when he is started and i could not get in five words to his oneor one word to his five i struggled along and struggled along andwell i wanted to tell and i was trying to tell a dream i had had the night before and it was a remarkable dream a dream worth peoples while to listen to a dream recounting sam jones the revivalists reception in heaven i was on a train and was approaching the celestial waystationi had a through ticketand i noticed a man sitting alongside of me asleep and he had his ticket in his hat he was the remains of the archbishop of canterbury i recognized him by his photograph i had nothing against him so i took his ticket and let him have mine he didnt objecthe wasnt in a condition to objectand presently when the train stopped at the heavenly stationwell i got off and he went on by requestbut there they all were the angels you know millions of them every one with a torch they had arranged for a torchlight procession they were expecting the archbishop and when i got off they started to raise a shout but it didnt materialize i dont know whether they were disappointed i suppose they had a lot of superstitious ideas about the archbishop and what he should look like and i didnt fill the bill and i was trying to explain to saint peter and was doing it in the german tongue because i didnt want to be too explicit well i found it was no use i couldnt get along for wayne macveagh was occupying the whole place and i said to mr dana what is the matter with that man who is that man with the long tongue whats the trouble with him that long lank cadaver old oilderrick out of a jobwho is that well now mr dana said you dont want to meddle with him you had better keep quiet just keep quiet because thats a bad man talk he was born to talk dont let him get out with you hell skin you i said i have been skinned skinned and skinned for years there is nothing left he said oh youll find there is that man is the very seed and inspiration of that proverb which says no matter how close you skin an onion a clever man can always peel it again well i reflected and i quieted down that would never occur to tom reed hes got no discretion well macveagh is just the same man he hasnt changed a bit in all those years he has been peeling mr mitchell lately thats the kind of man he is  mr howellsthat poem of his is admirable thats the way to treat a person howells has a peculiar gift for seeing the merits of people and he has always exhibited them in my favor howells has never written anything about me that i couldnt read six or seven times a day he is always just and always fair he has written more appreciatively of me than any one in this world and published it in the north american review he did me the justice to say that my intentionshe italicized thatthat my intentions were always good that i wounded peoples conventions rather than their convictions now i wouldnt want anything handsomer than that said of me i would rather wait with anything harsh i might have to say till the convictions become conventions bangs has traced me all the way down he cant find that honest man but i will look for him in the lookingglass when i get home it was intimated by the colonel that it is new england that makes new york and builds up this country and makes it great overlooking the fact that theres a lot of people here who came from elsewhere like john hay from away out west and howells from ohio and st clair mckelway and me from missouri and we are doing what we can to build up new york a littleelevate it why when i was living in that village of hannibal missouri on the banks of the mississippi and hay up in the town of warsaw also on the banks of the mississippi river it is an emotional bit of the mississippi and when it is low water you have to climb up to it on a ladder and when it floods you have to hunt for it with a deepsea leadbut it is a great and beautiful country in that old time it was a paradise for simplicityit was a simple simple life cheap but comfortable and full of sweetness and there was nothing of this rage of modern civilization there at all it was a delectable land i went out there last june and i met in that town of hannibal a schoolmate of mine john briggs whom i had not seen for more than fifty years i tell you that was a meeting that pal whom i had known as a little boy long ago and knew now as a stately man three or four inches over six feet and browned by exposure to many climes he was back there to see that old place again we spent a whole afternoon going about here and there and yonder and hunting up the scenes and talking of the crimes which we had committed so long ago it was a heartbreaking delight full of pathos laughter and tears all mixed together and we called the roll of the boys and girls that we picnicked and sweethearted with so many years ago and there were hardly half a dozen of them left the rest were in their graves and we went up there on the summit of that hill a treasured place in my memory the summit of holidays hill and looked out again over that magnificent panorama of the mississippi river sweeping along league after league a level green paradise on one side and retreating capes and promontories as far as you could see on the other fading away in the soft rich lights of the remote distance i recognized then that i was seeing now the most enchanting river view the planet could furnish i never knew it when i was a boy it took an educated eye that had travelled over the globe to know and appreciate it and john said can you point out the place where bear creek used to be before the railroad came i said yes it ran along yonder and can you point out the swimminghole yes out there and he said can you point out the place where we stole the skiff well i didnt know which one he meant such a wilderness of events had intervened since that day more than fifty years ago it took me more than five minutes to call back that little incident and then i did call it back it was a white skiff and we painted it red to allay suspicion and the saddest saddest man came alonga stranger he wasand he looked that red skiff over so pathetically and he said well if it werent for the complexion id know whose skiff that was he said it in that pleading way you know that appeals for sympathy and suggestion we were full of sympathy for him but we werent in any condition to offer suggestions i can see him yet as he turned away with that same sad look on his face and vanished out of history forever i wonder what became of that man i know what became of the skiff well it was a beautiful life a lovely life there was no crime merely little things like pillaging orchards and watermelonpatches and breaking the sabbathwe didnt break the sabbath often enough to signifyonce a week perhaps but we were good boys good presbyterian boys all presbyterian boys and loyal and all that anyway we were good presbyterian boys when the weather was doubtful when it was fair we did wander a little from the fold  look at john hay and me there we were in obscurity and look where we are now consider the ladder which he has climbed the illustrious vocations he has servedand vocations is the right word he has in all those vocations acquitted himself with high credit and honor to his country and to the mother that bore him scholar soldier diplomat poet historiannow see where we are he is secretary of state and i am a gentleman it could not happen in any other country our institutions give men the positions that of right belong to them through merit all you men have won your places not by heredities and not by family influence or extraneous help but only by the natural gifts god gave you at your birth made effective by your own energies this is the country to live in  now there is one invisible guest here a part of me is present the larger part the better part is yonder at her home that is my wife and she has a good many personal friends here and i think it wont distress any one of them to know that although she is going to be confined to that bed for many months to come from that nervous prostration there is not any danger and she is coming along very welland i think it quite appropriate that i should speak of her i knew her for the first time just in the same year that i first knew john hay and tom reed and mr twichellthirtysix years agoand she has been the best friend i have ever had and that is saying a good deal she has reared meshe and twichell togetherand what i am i owe to them twichell why it is such a pleasure to look upon twichells face for fiveandtwenty years i was under the rev mr twichells tuition i was in his pastorate occupying a pew in his church and held him in due reverence that man is full of all the graces that go to make a person companionable and beloved and wherever twichell goes to start a church the people flock there to buy the land they find real estate goes up all around the spot and the envious and the thoughtful always try to get twichell to move to their neighborhood and start a church and wherever you see him go you can go and buy land there with confidence feeling sure that there will be a double price for you before very long i am not saying this to flatter mr twichell it is the fact many and many a time i have attended the annual sale in his church and bought up all the pews on a marginand it would have been better for me spiritually and financially if i had stayed under his wing  i have tried to do good in this world and it is marvellous in how many different ways i have done good and it is comfortable to reflectnow theres mr rogersjust out of the affection i bear that man many a time i have given him points in finance that he had never thought ofand if he could lay aside envy prejudice and superstition and utilize those ideas in his business it would make a difference in his bank account  well i like the poetry i like all the speeches and the poetry too i liked doctor van dykes poem i wish i could return thanks in proper measure to you gentlemen who have spoken and violated your feelings to pay me compliments some were merited and some you overlooked it is true and colonel harvey did slander every one of you and put things into my mouth that i never said never thought of at all  and now my wife and i out of our single heart return you our deepest and most grateful thanks andyesterday was her birthday       to the whitefriars            address at the dinner given by the whitefriars club in honor of           mr clemens london june 20 1899            the whitefriars club was founded by dr samuel johnson and mr           clemens was made an honorary member in 1874  the members are           representative of literary and journalistic london  the toast           of our guest was proposed by louis f austin of the           illustrated london news and in the course of some humorous           remarks he referred to the vow and to the imaginary woes of the           friars as the members of the club style themselves  mr chairman and brethren of the vowin whatever the vow is for although i have been a member of this club for fiveand twenty years i dont know any more about what that vow is than mr austin seems to but what ever the vow is i dont care what it is i have made a thousand vows  there is no pleasure comparable to making a vow in the presence of one who appreciates that vow in the presence of men who honor and appreciate you for making the vow and men who admire you for making the vow  there is only one pleasure higher than that and that is to get outside and break the vow a vow is always a pledge of some kind or other for the protection of your own morals and principles or somebody elses and generally by the irony of fate it is for the protection of your own morals  hence we have pledges that make us eschew tobacco or wine and while you are taking the pledge there is a holy influence about that makes you feel you are reformed and that you can never be so happy again in this world untilyou get outside and take a drink  i had forgotten that i was a member of this clubit is so long ago but now i remember that i was here fiveandtwenty years ago and that i was then at a dinner of the whitefriars club and it was in those old days when you had just made two great finds all london was talking about nothing else than that they had found livingstone and that the lost sir roger tichborne had been foundand they were trying him for it  and at the dinner chairman i do not know who he wasfailed to come to time the gentleman who had been appointed to pay me the customary compliments and to introduce me forgot the compliments and did not know what they were  and george augustus sala came in at the last moment just when i was about to go without compliments altogether and that man was a gifted man they just called on him instantaneously while he was going to sit down to introduce the stranger and sala made one of those marvellous speeches which he was capable of making i think no man talked so fast as sala did one did not need wine while he was making a speech the rapidity of his utterance made a man drunk in a minute an incomparable speech was that an impromptu speech andan impromptu speech is a seldom thing and he did it so well  he went into the whole history of the united states and made it entirely new to me he filled it with episodes and incidents that washington never heard of and he did it so convincingly that although i knew none of it had happened from that day to this i do not know any history but salas  i do not know anything so sad as a dinner where you are going to get up and say something byandby and you do not know what it is you sit and wonder and wonder what the gentleman is going to say who is going to introduce you you know that if he says something severe that if he will deride you or traduce you or do anything of that kind he will furnish you with a text because anybody can get up and talk against that  anybody can get up and straighten out his character but when a gentleman gets up and merely tells the truth about you what can you do  mr austin has done well he has supplied so many texts that i will have to drop out a lot of them and that is about as difficult as when you do not have any text at all now he made a beautiful and smooth speech without any difficulty at all and i could have done that if i had gone on with the schooling with which i began i see here a gentleman on my left who was my master in the art of oratory more than twentyfive years ago  when i look upon the inspiring face of mr depew it carries me a long way back an old and valued friend of mine is he and i saw his career as it came along and it has reached pretty well up to now when he by another miscarriage of justice is a united states senator but those were delightful days when i was taking lessons in oratory  my other master the ambassadoris not here yet under those two gentlemen i learned to make afterdinner speeches and it was charming  you know the new england dinner is the great occasion on the other side of the water it is held every year to celebrate the landing of the pilgrims those pilgrims were a lot of people who were not needed in england and you know they had great rivalry and they were persuaded to go elsewhere and they chartered a ship called mayflower and set sail and i have heard it said that they pumped the atlantic ocean through that ship sixteen times  they fell in over there with the dutch from rotterdam amsterdam and a lot of other places with profane names and it is from that gang that mr depew is descended  on the other hand mr choate is descended from those puritans who landed on a bitter night in december every year those people used to meet at a great banquet in new york and those masters of mind in oratory had to make speeches it was doctor depews business to get up there and apologise for the dutch and mr choate had to get up later and explain the crimes of the puritans and grand beautiful times we used to have  it is curious that after that long lapse of time i meet the whitefriars again some looking as young and fresh as in the old days others showing a certain amount of wear and tear and here after all this time i find one of the masters of oratory and the others named in the list  and here we three meet again as exiles on one pretext or another and you will notice that while we are absent there is a pleasing tranquillity in americaa building up of public confidence we are doing the best we can for our country i think we have spent our lives in serving our country and we never serve it to greater advantage than when we get out of it  but impromptu speakingthat is what i was trying to learn that is a difficult thing i used to do it in this way i used to begin about a week ahead and write out my impromptu speech and get it by heart then i brought it to the new england dinner printed on a piece of paper in my pocket so that i could pass it to the reporters all cut and dried and in order to do an impromptu speech as it should be done you have to indicate the places for pauses and hesitations i put them all in it and then you want the applause in the right places  when i got to the place where it should come in if it did not come in i did not care but i had it marked in the paper and these masters of mind used to wonder why it was my speech came out in the morning in the first person while theirs went through the butchery of synopsis  i do that kind of speech i mean an offhand speech and do it well and make no mistake in such a way to deceive the audience completely and make that audience believe it is an impromptu speechthat is art  i was frightened out of it at last by an experience of doctor hayes he was a sort of nansen of that day he had been to the north pole and it made him celebrated he had even seen the polar bear climb the pole  he had made one of those magnificent voyages such as nansen made and in those days when a man did anything which greatly distinguished him for the moment he had to come on to the lecture platform and tell all about it  doctor hayes was a great magnificent creature like nansen superbly built he was to appear in boston he wrote his lecture out and it was his purpose to read it from manuscript but in an evil hour he concluded that it would be a good thing to preface it with something rather handsome poetical and beautiful that he could get off by heart and deliver as if it were the thought of the moment  he had not had my experience and could not do that he came on the platform held his manuscript down and began with a beautiful piece of oratory he spoke something like this  when a lonely human being a pigmy in the midst of the architecture of nature stands solitary on those icy waters and looks abroad to the horizon and sees mighty castles and temples of eternal ice raising up their pinnacles tipped by the pencil of the departing sun  here a man came across the platform and touched him on the shoulder and said one minute and then to the audience  is mrs john smith in the house her husband has slipped on the ice and broken his leg  and you could see the mrs john smiths get up everywhere and drift out of the house and it made great gaps everywhere then doctor hayes began again when a lonely man a pigmy in the architecture the janitor came in again and shouted it is not mrs john smith it is mrs john jones  then all the mrs jones got up and left once more the speaker started and was in the midst of the sentence when he was interrupted again and the result was that the lecture was not delivered but the lecturer interviewed the janitor afterward in a private room and of the fragments of the janitor they took twelve basketsful  now i dont want to sit down just in this way i have been talking with so much levity that i have said no serious thing and you are really no better or wiser although robert buchanan has suggested that i am a person who deals in wisdom i have said nothing which would make you better than when you came here  i should be sorry to sit down without having said one serious word which you can carry home and relate to your children and the old people who are not able to get away  and this is just a little maxim which has saved me from many a difficulty and many a disaster and in times of tribulation and uncertainty has come to my rescue as it shall to yours if you observe it as i do day and night  i always use it in an emergency and you can take it home as a legacy from me and it is when in doubt tell the truth       the ascot gold cup            the news of mr clemenss arrival in england in june 1907 was           announced in the papers with big headlines  immediately           following the announcement was the newsalso with big           headlinesthat the ascot gold cup had been stolen the same           day  the combination mark twain arrivesascot cup stolen           amused the public  the lord mayor of london gave a banquet at           the mansion house in honor of mr clemens  i do assure you that i am not so dishonest as i look i have been so busy trying to rehabilitate my honor about that ascot cup that i have had no time to prepare a speech  i was not so honest in former days as i am now but i have always been reasonably honest well you know how a man is influenced by his surroundings once upon a time i went to a public meeting where the oratory of a charitable worker so worked on my feelings that in common with others i would have dropped something substantial in the hatif it had come round at that moment  the speaker had the power of putting those vivid pictures before one we were all affected that was the moment for the hat i would have put two hundred dollars in before he had finished i could have put in four hundred dollars i felt i could have filled up a blank checkwith somebody elses nameand dropped it in  well now another speaker got up and in fifteen minutes damped my spirit and during the speech of the third speaker all my enthusiasm went away when at last the hat came round i dropped in ten centsand took out twentyfive  i came over here to get the honorary degree from oxford and i would have encompassed the seven seas for an honor like thatthe greatest honor that has ever fallen to my share i am grateful to oxford for conferring that honor upon me and i am sure my country appreciates it because first and foremost it is an honor to my country  and now i am going home again across the sea i am in spirit young but in the flesh old so that it is unlikely that when i go away i shall ever see england again but i shall go with the recollection of the generous and kindly welcome i have had  i suppose i must say goodbye i say it not with my lips only but from the heart       the savage club dinner            a portrait of mr clemens signed by all the members of the           club attending the dinner was presented to him july 6 1907           and in submitting the toast the health of mark twain mr j           scott stokes recalled the fact that he had read parts of doctor           clemenss works to harold frederic during frederics last           illness  mr chairman and fellowsavagesi am very glad indeed to have that portrait i think it is the best one that i have ever had and there have been opportunities before to get a good photograph i have sat to photographers twentytwo times today those sittings added to those that have preceded them since i have been in europeif we average at that ratemust have numbered one hundred to two hundred sittings out of all those there ought to be some good photographs this is the best i have had and i am glad to have your honored names on it i did not know harold frederic personally but i have heard a great deal about him and nothing that was not pleasant and nothing except such things as lead a man to honor another man and to love him i consider that it is a misfortune of mine that i have never had the luck to meet him and if any book of mine read to him in his last hours made those hours easier for him and more comfortable i am very glad and proud of that i call to mind such a case many years ago of an english authoress well known in her day who wrote such beautiful child tales touching and lovely in every possible way in a little biographical sketch of her i found that her last hours were spent partly in reading a book of mine until she was no longer able to read that has always remained in my mind and i have always cherished it as one of the good things of my life i had read what she had written and had loved her for what she had done  stanley apparently carried a book of mine feloniously away to africa and i have not a doubt that it had a noble and uplifting influence there in the wilds of africabecause on his previous journeys he never carried anything to read except shakespeare and the bible i did not know of that circumstance i did not know that he had carried a book of mine i only noticed that when he came back he was a reformed man i knew stanley very well in those old days stanley was the first man who ever reported a lecture of mine and that was in st louis when i was down there the next time to give the same lecture i was told to give them something fresh as they had read that in the papers i met stanley here when he came back from that first expedition of his which closed with the finding of livingstone you remember how he would break out at the meetings of the british association and find fault with what people said because stanley had notions of his own and could not contain them they had to come out or break him upand so he would go round and address geographical societies he was always on the warpath in those days and people always had to have stanley contradicting their geography for them and improving it but he always came back and sat drinking beer with me in the hotel up to two in the morning and he was then one of the most civilized human beings that ever was  i saw in a newspaper this evening a reference to an interview which appeared in one of the papers the other day in which the interviewer said that i characterized mr birrells speech the other day at the pilgrims club as bully now if you will excuse me i never use slang to an interviewer or anybody else that distresses me whatever i said about mr birrells speech was said in english as good english as anybody uses if i could not describe mr birrells delightful speech without using slang i would not describe it at all i would close my mouth and keep it closed much as it would discomfort me  now that comes of interviewing a man in the first person which is an altogether wrong way to interview him it is entirely wrong because none of you i or anybody else could interview a mancould listen to a man talking any length of time and then go off and reproduce that talk in the first person it cant be done what results is merely that the interviewer gives the substance of what is said and puts it in his own language and puts it in your mouth it will always be either better language than you use or worse and in my case it is always worse i have a great respect for the english language i am one of its supporters its promoters its elevators i dont degrade it a slip of the tongue would be the most that you would get from me i have always tried hard and faithfully to improve my english and never to degrade it i always try to use the best english to describe what i think and what i feel or what i dont feel and what i dont think  i am not one of those who in expressing opinions confine themselves to facts i dont know anything that mars good literature so completely as too much truth facts contain a deal of poetry but you cant use too many of them without damaging your literature i love all literature and as long as i am a doctor of literaturei have suggested to you for twenty years i have been diligently trying to improve my own literature and now by virtue of the university of oxford i mean to doctor everybody elses  now i think i ought to apologize for my clothes at home i venture things that i am not permitted by my family to venture in foreign parts i was instructed before i left home and ordered to refrain from white clothes in england i meant to keep that command fair and clean and i would have done it if i had been in the habit of obeying instructions but i cant invent a new process in life right away i have not had white clothes on since i crossed the ocean until now  in these three or four weeks i have grown so tired of gray and black that you have earned my gratitude in permitting me to come as i have i wear white clothes in the depth of winter in my home but i dont go out in the streets in them i dont go out to attract too much attention i like to attract some and always i would like to be dressed so that i may be more conspicuous than anybody else  if i had been an ancient briton i would not have contented myself with blue paint but i would have bankrupted the rainbow i so enjoy gay clothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me when i go to the opera to see that while women look like a flowerbed the men are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress these are two or three reasons why i wish to wear white clothes when i find myself in assemblies like this with everybody in black clothes i know i possess something that is superior to everybody elses clothes are never clean you dont know whether they are clean or not because you cant see  here or anywhere you must scour your head every two or three days or it is full of grit your clothes must collect just as much dirt as your hair if you wear white clothes you are clean and your cleaning bill gets so heavy that you have to take care i am proud to say that i can wear a white suit of clothes without a blemish for three days if you need any further instruction in the matter of clothes i shall be glad to give it to you i hope i have convinced some of you that it is just as well to wear white clothes as any other kind i do not want to boast i only want to make you understand that you are not clean  as to age the fact that i am nearly seventytwo years old does not clearly indicate how old i am because part of every dayit is with me as with you you try to describe your age and you cannot do it sometimes you are only fifteen sometimes you are twentyfive it is very seldom in a day that i am seventytwo years old i am older now sometimes than i was when i used to rob orchards a thing which i would not do todayif the orchards were watched i am so glad to be here tonight i am so glad to renew with the savages that now ancient time when i first sat with a company of this club in london in 1872 that is a long time ago but i did stay with the savages a night in london long ago and as i had come into a very strange land and was with friends as i could see that has always remained in my mind as a peculiarly blessed evening since it brought me into contact with men of my own kind and my own feelings  i am glad to be here and to see you all again because it is very likely that i shall not see you again it is easier than i thought to come across the atlantic i have been received as you know in the most delightfully generous way in england ever since i came here it keeps me choked up all the time everybody is so generous and they do seem to give you such a hearty welcome nobody in the world can appreciate it higher than i do it did not wait till i got to london but when i came ashore at tilbury the stevedores on the dock raised the first welcomea good and hearty welcome from the men who do the heavy labor in the world and save you and me having to do it they are the men who with their hands build empires and make them prosper it is because of them that the others are wealthy and can live in luxury they received me with a hurrah that went to my heart they are the men that build civilization and without them no civilization can be built so i came first to the authors and creators of civilization and i blessedly end this happy meeting with the savages who destroy it       general miles and the dog            mr clemens was the guest of honor at a dinner given by the           pleiades club at the hotel brevoort december 22 1907  the           toastmaster introduced the guest of the evening with a high           tribute to his place in american literature saying that he was           dear to the hearts of all americans  it is hard work to make a speech when you have listened to compliments from the powers in authority a compliment is a hard text to preach to when the chairman introduces me as a person of merit and when he says pleasant things about me i always feel like answering simply that what he says is true that it is all right that as far as i am concerned the things he said can stand as they are but you always have to say something and that is what frightens me  i remember out in sydney once having to respond to some complimentary toast and my one desire was to turn in my tracks like any other wormand run for it i was remembering that occasion at a later date when i had to introduce a speaker hoping then to spur his speech by putting him in joke on the defensive i accused him in my introduction of everything i thought it impossible for him to have committed when i finished there was an awful calm i had been telling his life history by mistake  one must keep up ones character earn a character first if you can and if you cant then assume one from the code of morals i have been following and revising and revising for seventytwo years i remember one detail all my life i have been honestcomparatively honest i could never use money i had not made honestlyi could only lend it  last spring i met general miles again and he commented on the fact that we had known each other thirty years he said it was strange that we had not met years before when we had both been in washington at that point i changed the subject and i changed it with art but the facts are these  i was then under contract for my innocents abroad but did not have a cent to live on while i wrote it so i went to washington to do a little journalism there i met an equally poor friend william davidson who had not a single vice unless you call it a vice in a scot to love scotch together we devised the first and original newspaper syndicate selling two letters a week to twelve newspapers and getting 1 a letter that 24 a week would have been enough for usif we had not had to support the jug  but there was a day when we felt that we must have 3 right away3 at once that was how i met the general it doesnt matter now what we wanted so much money at one time for but that scot and i did occasionally want it the scot sent me out one day to get it he had a great belief in providence that scottish friend of mine he said the lord will provide  i had given up trying to find the money lying about and was in a hotel lobby in despair when i saw a beautiful unfriended dog the dog saw me too and at once we became acquainted then general miles came in admired the dog and asked me to price it i priced it at 3 he offered me an opportunity to reconsider the value of the beautiful animal but i refused to take more than providence knew i needed the general carried the dog to his room  then came in a sweet little middleaged man who at once began looking around the lobby  did you lose a dog i asked he said he had  i think i could find it i volunteered for a small sum  how much he asked and i told him 3  he urged me to accept more but i did not wish to outdo providence then i went to the generals room and asked for the dog back he was very angry and wanted to know why i had sold him a dog that did not belong to me  thats a singular question to ask me sir i replied didnt you ask me to sell him you started it and he let me have him i gave him back his 3 and returned the dog collect to its owner that second 3 i earned home to the scot and we enjoyed it but the first 3 the money i got from the general i would have had to lend  the general seemed not to remember my part in that adventure and i never had the heart to tell him about it       when in doubt tell the truth            mark twains speech at the dinner of the freundschaft           society march 9 1906 had as a basis the words of           introduction used by toastmaster frank who referring to           puddnhead wilson used the phrase when in doubt tell the           truth  mr chairman mr putzel and gentlemen of the freundschaftthat maxim i did invent but never expected it to be applied to me i did say when you are in doubt but when i am in doubt myself i use more sagacity  mr grout suggested that if i have anything to say against mr putzel or any criticism of his career or his character i am the last person to come out on account of that maxim and tell the truth that is altogether a mistake  i do think it is right for other people to be virtuous so that they can be happy hereafter but if i knew every impropriety that even mr putzel has committed in his life i would not mention one of them my judgment has been maturing for seventy years and i have got to that point where i know better than that  mr putzel stands related to me in a very tender way through the tax office and it does not behoove me to say anything which could by any possibility militate against that condition of things  now that wordtaxes taxes taxes i have heard it tonight i have heard it all night i wish somebody would change that subject that is a very sore subject to me  i was so relieved when judge leventritt did find something that was not taxablewhen he said that the commissioner could not tax your patience and that comforted me weve got so much taxation i dont know of a single foreign product that enters this country untaxed except the answer to prayer  on an occasion like this the proprieties require that you merely pay compliments to the guest of the occasion and i am merely here to pay compliments to the guest of the occasion not to criticise him in any way and i can say only complimentary things to him  when i went down to the tax office some time ago for the first time in new york i saw mr putzel sitting in the seat of perjury i recognized him right away i warmed to him on the spot i didnt know that i had ever seen him before but just as soon as i saw him i recognized him i had met him twentyfive years before and at that time had achieved a knowledge of his abilities and something more than that  i thought now this is the man whom i saw twentyfive years ago on that occasion i not only went free at his hands but carried off something more than that i hoped it would happen again  it was twentyfive years ago when i saw a young clerk in putnams bookstore i went in there and asked for george haven putnam and handed him my card and then the young man said mr putnam was busy and i couldnt see him well i had merely called in a social way and so it didnt matter  i was going out when i saw a great big fat interestinglooking book lying there and i took it up it was an account of the invasion of england in the fourteenth century by the preaching friar and it interested me  i asked him the price of it and he said four dollars  well i said what discount do you allow to publishers  he said forty percent off  i said all right i am a publisher  he put down the figure forty per cent off on a card  then i said what discount do you allow to authors  he said forty per cent off  well i said set me down as an author  now said i what discount do you allow to the clergy  he said forty per cent off  i said to him that i was only on the road and that i was studying for the ministry i asked him wouldnt he knock off twenty per cent for that he set down the figure and he never smiled once  i was working off these humorous brilliancies on him and getting no returnnot a scintillation in his eye not a spark of recognition of what i was doing there i was almost in despair  i thought i might try him once more so i said now i am also a member of the human race will you let me have the ten per cent off for that he set it down and never smiled  well i gave it up i said there is my card with my address on it but i have not any money with me will you please send the bill to hartford i took up the book and was going away  he said wait a minute there is forty cents coming to you  when i met him in the tax office i thought maybe i could make something again but i could not but i had not any idea i could when i came and as it turned out i did get off entirely free  i put up my hand and made a statement it gave me a good deal of pain to do that i was not used to it i was born and reared in the higher circles of missouri and there we dont do such thingsdidnt in my time but we have got that little matter settledgot a sort of tax levied on me  then he touched me yes he touched me this time because he criedcried he was moved to tears to see that i a virtuous person only a year before after immersion for one yearduring one year in the new york moralshad no more conscience than a millionaire       the day we celebrate            address at the fourthofjuly dinner of the american society           london 1899  i noticed in ambassador choates speech that he said you may be americans or englishmen but you cannot be both at the same time you responded by applause  consider the effect of a short residence here i find the ambassador rises first to speak to a toast followed by a senator and i come third what a subtle tribute that to monarchial influence of the country when you place rank above respectability  i was born modest and if i had not been things like this would force it upon me i understand it quite well i am here to see that between them they do justice to the day we celebrate and in case they do not i must do it myself but i notice they have considered this day merely from one sideits sentimental patriotic poetic side but it has another side it has a commercial a business side that needs reforming it has a historical side  i do not say an historical side because i am speaking the american language i do not see why our cousins should continue to say an hospital an historical fact an horse it seems to me the congress of women now in session should look to it i think an is having a little too much to do with it it comes of habit which accounts for many things  yesterday for example i was at a luncheon party at the end of the party a great dignitary of the english established church went away half an hour before anybody else and carried off my hat now that was an innocent act on his part he went out first and of course had the choice of hats as a rule i try to get out first myself but i hold that it was an innocent unconscious act due perhaps to heredity he was thinking about ecclesiastical matters and when a man is in that condition of mind he will take anybodys hat the result was that the whole afternoon i was under the influence of his clerical hat and could not tell a lie of course he was hard at it  it is a compliment to both of us his hat fitted me exactly my hat fitted him exactly so i judge i was born to rise to high dignity in the church some how or other but i do not know what he was born for that is an illustration of the influence of habit and it is perceptible here when they say an hospital an european an historical  the business aspects of the fourth of july is not perfect as it stands see what it costs us every year with loss of life the crippling of thousands with its fireworks and the burning down of property it is not only sacred to patriotism sand universal freedom but to the surgeon the undertaker the insurance officesand they are working it for all it is worth  i am pleased to see that we have a cessation of war for the time this coming from me a soldier you will appreciate i was a soldier in the southern war for two weeks and when gentlemen get up to speak of the great deeds our army and navy have recently done why it goes all through me and fires up the old war spirit i had in my first engagement three horses shot under me the next ones went over my head the next hit me in the back then i retired to meet an engagement  i thank you gentlemen for making even a slight reference to the war profession in which i distinguished myself short as my career was       independence day            the american society in london gave a banquet july 4 1907 at           the hotel cecil  ambassador choate called on mr clemens to           respond to the toast the day we celebrate  mr chairman my lord and gentlemenonce more it happens as it has happened so often since i arrived in england a week or two ago that instead of celebrating the fourth of july properly as has been indicated i have to first take care of my personal character sir mortimer durand still remains unconvinced well i tried to convince these people from the beginning that i did not take the ascot cup and as i have failed to convince anybody that i did not take the cup i might as well confess i did take it and be done with it i dont see why this uncharitable feeling should follow me everywhere and why i should have that crime thrown up to me on all occasions the tears that i have wept over it ought to have created a different feeling than thisand besides i dont think it is very right or fair that considering england has been trying to take a cup of ours for forty yearsi dont see why they should take so much trouble when i tried to go into the business myself  sir mortimer durand too has had trouble from going to a dinner here and he has told you what he suffered in consequence but what did he suffer he only missed his train and one night of discomfort and he remembers it to this day oh if you could only think what i have suffered from a similar circumstance two or three years ago in new york with that society there which is made up of people from all british colonies and from great britain generally who were educated in british colleges and british schools i was there to respond to a toast of some kind or other and i did then what i have been in the habit of doing from a selfish motive for a long time and that is i got myself placed no 3 in the list of speakersthen you get home early  i had to go five miles upriver and had to catch a particular train or not get there but see the magnanimity which is born in me which i have cultivated all my life a very famous and very great british clergyman came to me presently and he said i am away down in the list i have got to catch a certain train this saturday night if i dont catch that train i shall be carried beyond midnight and break the sabbath wont you change places with me i said certainly i will i did it at once now see what happened  talk about sir mortimer durands sufferings for a single night i have suffered ever since because i saved that gentleman from breaking the sabbathyes saved him i took his place but i lost my train and it was i who broke the sabbath up to that time i never had broken the sabbath in my life and from that day to this i never have kept it  oh i am learning much here tonight i find i didnt know anything about the american societythat is i didnt know its chief virtue i didnt know its chief virtue until his excellency our ambassador revealed iti may say exposed it i was intending to go home on the 13th of this month but i look upon that in a different light now i am going to stay here until the american society pays my passage  our ambassador has spoken of our fourth of july and the noise it makes we have got a double fourth of julya daylight fourth and a midnight fourth during the day in america as our ambassador has indicated we keep the fourth of july properly in a reverent spirit we devote it to teaching our children patriotic thingsreverence for the declaration of independence we honor the day all through the daylight hours and when night comes we dishonor it presentlybefore longthey are getting nearly ready to begin nowon the atlantic coast when night shuts down that pandemonium will begin and there will be noise and noise and noiseall night longand there will be more than noise there will be people crippled there will be people killed there will be people who will lose their eyes and all through that permission which we give to irresponsible boys to play with firearms and firecrackers and all sorts of dangerous things we turn that fourth of july alas over to rowdies to drink and get drunk and make the night hideous and we cripple and kill more people than you would imagine  we probably began to celebrate our fourthofjuly night in that way one hundred and twentyfive years ago and on every fourthofjuly night since these horrors have grown and grown until now in our five thousand towns of america somebody gets killed or crippled on every fourthofjuly night besides those cases of sick persons whom we never hear of who die as the result of the noise or the shock they cripple and kill more people on the fourth of july in america than they kill and cripple in our wars nowadays and there are no pensions for these folk and too we burn houses really we destroy more property on every fourthofjuly night than the whole of the united states was worth one hundred and twentyfive years ago really our fourth of july is our day of mourning our day of sorrow fifty thousand people who have lost friends or who have had friends crippled receive that fourth of july when it comes as a day of mourning for the losses they have sustained in their families  i have suffered in that way myself i have had relatives killed in that way one was in chicago years agoan uncle of mine just as good an uncle as i have ever had and i had lots of themyes uncles to burn uncles to spare this poor uncle full of patriotism opened his mouth to hurrah and a rocket went down his throat before that man could ask for a drink of water to quench that thing it blew up and scattered him all over the fortyfive states andreally now this is truei know about it myselftwentyfour hours after that it was raining buttons recognizable as his on the atlantic seaboard a person cannot have a disaster like that and be entirely cheerful the rest of his life i had another uncle on an entirely different fourth of july who was blown up that way and really it trimmed him as it would a tree he had hardly a limb left on him anywhere all we have left now is an expurgated edition of that uncle but never mind about these things they are merely passing matters dont let me make you sad  sir mortimer durand said that you the english people gave up your colonies over theregot tired of themand did it with reluctance now i wish you just to consider that he was right about that and that he had his reasons for saying that england did not look upon our revolution as a foreign war but as a civil war fought by englishmen  our fourth of july which we honor so much and which we love so much and which we take so much pride in is an english institution not an american one and it comes of a great ancestry the first fourth of july in that noble genealogy dates back seven centuries lacking eight years that is the day of the great charterthe magna chartawhich was born at runnymede in the next to the last year of king john and portions of the liberties secured thus by those hardy barons from that reluctant king john are a part of our declaration of independence of our fourth of july of our american liberties and the second of those fourths of july was not born until four centuries later in charles the firsts time in the bill of rights and that is ours that is part of our liberties the next one was still english in new england where they established that principle which remains with us to this day and will continue to remain with usno taxation without representation that is always going to stand and that the english colonies in new england gave us  the fourth of july and the one which you are celebrating now born in philadelphia on the 4th of july 1776that is english too it is not american those were english colonists subjects of king george iii englishmen at heart who protested against the oppressions of the home government though they proposed to cure those oppressions and remove them still remaining under the crown they were not intending a revolution the revolution was brought about by circumstances which they could not control the declaration of independence was written by a british subject every name signed to it was the name of a british subject there was not the name of a single american attached to the declaration of independencein fact there was not an american in the country in that day except the indians out on the plains they were englishmen all englishmenamericans did not begin until seven years later when that fourth of july had become seven years old and then the american republic was established since then there have been americans so you see what we owe to england in the matter of liberties  we have however one fourth of july which is absolutely our own and that is that great proclamation issued forty years ago by that great american to whom sir mortimer durand paid that just and beautiful tributeabraham lincoln lincolns proclamation which not only set the black slaves free but set the white man free also the owner was set free from the burden and offence that sad condition of things where he was in so many instances a master and owner of slaves when he did not want to be that proclamation set them all free but even in this matter england suggested it for england had set her slaves free thirty years before and we followed her example we always followed her example whether it was good or bad  and it was an english judge that issued that other great proclamation and established that great principle that when a slave let him belong to whom he may and let him come whence he may sets his foot upon english soil his fetters by that act fall away and he is a free man before the world we followed the example of 1833 and we freed our slaves as i have said  it is true then that all our fourths of july and we have five of them england gave to us except that one that i have mentionedthe emancipation proclamation and lest we forget let us all remember that we owe these things to england let us be able to say to old england this greathearted venerable old mother of the race you gave us our fourths of july that we love and that we honor and revere you gave us the declaration of independence which is the charter of our rights you the venerable mother of liberties the protector of anglosaxon freedomyou gave us these things and we do most honestly thank you for them       americans and the english       address at a gathering of americans in london july 4 1872  mr chairman and ladies and gentlemeni thank you for the compliment which has just been tendered me and to show my appreciation of it i will not afflict you with many words it is pleasant to celebrate in this peaceful way upon this old mother soil the anniversary of an experiment which was born of war with this same land so long ago and wrought out to a successful issue by the devotion of our ancestors it has taken nearly a hundred years to bring the english and americans into kindly and mutually appreciative relations but i believe it has been accomplished at last it was a great step when the two last misunderstandings were settled by arbitration instead of cannon it is another great step when england adopts our sewingmachines without claiming the inventionas usual it was another when they imported one of our sleepingcars the other day and it warmed my heart more than i can tell yesterday when i witnessed the spectacle of an englishman ordering an american sherry cobbler of his own free will and accordand not only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the barkeeper not to forget the strawberries with a common origin a common language a common literature a common religion andcommon drinks what is longer needful to the cementing of the two nations together in a permanent bond of brotherhood  this is an age of progress and ours is a progressive land a great and glorious land tooa land which has developed a washington a franklin a wm m tweed a longfellow a motley a jay gould a samuel c pomeroy a recent congress which has never had its equal in some respects and a united states army which conquered sixty indians in eight months by tiring them out which is much better than uncivilized slaughter god knows we have a criminal jury system which is superior to any in the world and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty of finding twelve men every day who dont know anything and cant read and i may observe that we have an insanity plea that would have saved cain i think i can say and say with pride that we have some legislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world  i refer with effusion to our railway system which consents to let us live though it might do the opposite being our owners it only destroyed three thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions and twentyseven thousand two hundred and sixty by running over heedless and unnecessary people at crossings the companies seriously regretted the killing of these thirty thousand people and went so far as to pay for some of themvoluntarily of course for the meanest of us would not claim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law against a railway company but thank heaven the railway companies are generally disposed to do the right and kindly thing withoutcompulsion i know of an instance which greatly touched me at the time after an accident the company sent home the remains of a dear distant old relative of mine in a basket with the remark please state what figure you hold him atand return the basket now there couldnt be anything friendlier than that  but i must not stand here and brag all night however you wont mind a body bragging a little about his country on the fourth of july it is a fair and legitimate time to fly the eagle i will say only one more word of bragand a hopeful one it is this we have a form of government which gives each man a fair chance and no favor with us no individual is born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in contempt let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that and we may find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is the condition of our political morality today england has risen up out of a far fouler since the days when charles i ennobled courtesans and all political place was a matter of bargain and sale there is hope for us yet            at least the above is the speech which i was going to make           but our minister general schenck presided and after the           blessing got up and made a great long inconceivably dull           harangue and wound up by saying that inasmuch as speechmaking           did not seem to exhilarate the guests much all further oratory           would be dispensed with during the evening and we could just           sit and talk privately to our elbowneighbors and have a good           sociable time  it is known that in consequence of that remark           fortyfour perfected speeches died in the womb  the           depression the gloom the solemnity that reigned over the           banquet from that time forth will be a lasting memory with many           that were there  by that one thoughtless remark general           schenck lost fortyfour of the best friends he had in england           more than one said that night and this is the sort of person           that is sent to represent us in a great sister empire       about london            address at a dinner given by the savage club           london september 28 1872            reported by moncure d conway in the cincinnati commercial  it affords me sincere pleasure to meet this distinguished club a club which has extended its hospitalities and its cordial welcome to so many of my countrymen i hope and here the speakers voice became low and fluttering you will excuse these clothes i am going to the theatre that will explain these clothes i have other clothes than these judging human nature by what i have seen of it i suppose that the customary thing for a stranger to do when he stands here is to make a pun on the name of this club under the impression of course that he is the first man that that idea has occurred to it is a credit to our human nature not a blemish upon it for it shows that underlying all our depravity and god knows and you know we are depraved enough and all our sophistication and untarnished by them there is a sweet germ of innocence and simplicity still when a stranger says to me with a glow of inspiration in his eye some gentle innocuous little thing about twain and one flesh and all that sort of thing i dont try to crush that man into the earthno i feel like saying let me take you by the hand sir let me embrace you i have not heard that pun for weeks we will deal in palpable puns we will call parties named king your majesty and we will say to the smiths that we think we have heard that name before somewhere such is human nature we cannot alter this it is god that made us so for some good and wise purpose let us not repine but though i may seem strange may seem eccentric i mean to refrain from punning upon the name of this club though i could make a very good one if i had time to think about ita week  i cannot express to you what entire enjoyment i find in this first visit to this prodigious metropolis of yours its wonders seem to me to be limitless i go about as in a dreamas in a realm of enchantmentwhere many things are rare and beautiful and all things are strange and marvellous hour after hour i standi stand spellbound as it wereand gaze upon the statuary in leicester square leicester square being a horrible chaos with the relic of an equestrian statue in the centre the king being headless and limbless and the horse in little better condition i visit the mortuary effigies of noble old henry viii and judge jeffreys and the preserved gorilla and try to make up my mind which of my ancestors i admire the most i go to that matchless hyde park and drive all around it and then i start to enter it at the marble archandam induced to change my mind cabs are not permitted in hyde parknothing less aristocratic than a private carriage it is a great benefactionis hyde park there in his hansom cab the invalid can gothe poor sad child of misfortuneand insert his nose between the railings and breathe the pure healthgiving air of the country and of heaven and if he is a swell invalid who isnt obliged to depend upon parks for his country air he can drive insideif he owns his vehicle i drive round and round hyde park and the more i see of the edges of it the more grateful i am that the margin is extensive  and i have been to the zoological gardens what a wonderful place that is i never have seen such a curious and interesting variety of wild animals in any garden beforeexcept mabilie i never believed before there were so many different kinds of animals in the world as you can find thereand i dont believe it yet i have been to the british museum i would advise you to drop in there some time when you have nothing to do forfive minutesif you have never been there it seems to me the noblest monument that this nation has yet erected to her greatness i say to her our greatnessas a nation true she has built other monuments and stately ones as well but these she has uplifted in honor of two or three colossal demigods who have stalked across the worlds stage destroying tyrants and delivering nations and whose prodigies will still live in the memories of men ages after their monuments shall have crumbled to dusti refer to the wellington and nelson monuments andthe albert memorial sarcasm the albert memorial is the finest monument in the world and celebrates the existence of as commonplace a person as good luck ever lifted out of obscurity  the library at the british museum i find particularly astounding i have read there hours together and hardly made an impression on it i revere that library it is the authors friend i dont care how mean a book is it always takes one copy a copy of every book printed in great britain must by law be sent to the british museum a law much complained of by publishers and then every day that author goes there to gaze at that book and is encouraged to go on in the good work and what a touching sight it is of a saturday afternoon to see the poor careworn clergymen gathered together in that vast readingroom cabbaging sermons for sunday you will pardon my referring to these things  everything in this monster city interests me and i cannot keep from talking even at the risk of being instructive people here seem always to express distances by parables to a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolicso to speak i collar a citizen and i think i am going to get some valuable information out of him i ask him how far it is to birmingham and he says it is twentyone shillings and sixpence now we know that doesnt help a man who is trying to learn i find myself downtown somewhere and i want to get some sort of idea where i ambeing usually lost when aloneand i stop a citizen and say how far is it to charing cross shilling fare in a cab and off he goes i suppose if i were to ask a londoner how far it is from the sublime to the ridiculous he would try to express it in coin but i am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections i will not longer keep you from your orgies tis a real pleasure for me to be here and i thank you for it the name of the savage club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger and you opened your english hearts to him and gave him welcome and a homeartemus ward asking that you will join me i give you his memory       princeton            mr clemens spent several days in may 1901 in princeton new           jersey as the guest of lawrence hutton  he gave a reading one           evening before a large audience composed of university students           and professors  before the reading mr clemens said  i feel exceedingly surreptitious in coming down here without an announcement of any kind i do not want to see any advertisements around for the reason that im not a lecturer any longer i reformed long ago and i break over and commit this sin only just one time this year and that is moderate i think for a person of my disposition it is not my purpose to lecture any more as long as i live i never intend to stand up on a platform any moreunless by the request of a sheriff or something like that       the st louis harborboat mark twain            the countess de rochambeau christened the st louis harborboat           mark twain in honor of mr clemens june 6 1902  just           before the luncheon he acted as pilot            lower away lead boomed out the voice of the pilot            mark twain quarter five and onehalfsix feet replied the           leadsman below            you are all dead safe as long as i have the wheelbut this is           my last time at the wheel            at the luncheon mr clemens made a short address  first of all nosecond of alli wish to offer my thanks for the honor done me by naming this last rose of summer of the mississippi valley for me this boat which represents a perished interest which i fortified long ago but did not save its life and in the first place i wish to thank the countess de rochambeau for the honor she has done me in presiding at this christening  i believe that it is peculiarly appropriate that i should be allowed the privilege of joining my voice with the general voice of st louis and missouri in welcoming to the mississippi valley and this part of the continent these illustrious visitors from france  when la salle came down this river a century and a quarter ago there was nothing on its banks but savages he opened up this great river and by his simple act was gathered in this great louisiana territory i would have done it myself for half the money       seventieth birthday            address at a dinner given by colonel george harvey at           delmonicos december 5 1905 to celebrate the seventieth           anniversary of mr clemens birth            mr howells introduced mr clemens            now ladies and gentlemen and colonel harvey i will try not           to be greedy on your behalf in wishing the health of our           honored and in view of his great age our revered guest  i           will not say oh king live forever but oh king live as           long as you like amid great applause and waving of napkins           all rise and drink to mark twain  well if i made that joke it is the best one i ever made and it is in the prettiest language tooi never can get quite to that height but i appreciate that joke and i shall remember itand i shall use it when occasion requires  i have had a great many birthdays in my time i remember the first one very well and i always think of it with indignation everything was so crude unaesthetic primeval nothing like this at all no proper appreciative preparation made nothing really ready now for a person born with high and delicate instinctswhy even the cradle wasnt whitewashednothing ready at all i hadnt any hair i hadnt any teeth i hadnt any clothes i had to go to my first banquet just like that well everybody came swarming in it was the merest little bit of a villagehardly that just a little hamlet in the backwoods of missouri where nothing ever happened and the people were all interested and they all came they looked me over to see if there was anything fresh in my line why nothing ever happened in that villageiwhy i was the only thing that had really happened there for months and months and months and although i say it myself that shouldnt i came the nearest to being a real event that had happened in that village in more than two years well those people came they came with that curiosity which is so provincial with that frankness which also is so provincial and they examined me all around and gave their opinion nobody asked them and i shouldnt have minded if anybody had paid me a compliment but nobody did their opinions were all just green with prejudice and i feel those opinions to this day well i stood that as long aswell you know i was born courteous and i stood it to the limit i stood it an hour and then the worm turned i was the warm it was my turn to turn and i turned i knew very well the strength of my position i knew that i was the only spotlessly pure and innocent person in that whole town and i came out and said so and they could not say a word it was so true they blushed they were embarrassed well that was the first afterdinner speech i ever made i think it was after dinner  its a long stretch between that first birthday speech and this one that was my cradlesong and this is my swansong i suppose i am used to swansongs i have sung them several times  this is my seventieth birthday and i wonder if you all rise to the size of that proposition realizing all the significance of that phrase seventieth birthday  the seventieth birthday it is the time of life when you arrive at a new and awful dignity when you may throw aside the decent reserves which have oppressed you for a generation and stand unafraid and unabashed upon your seventerraced summit and look down and teachunrebuked you can tell the world how you got there it is what they all do you shall never get tired of telling by what delicate arts and deep moralities you climbed up to that great place you will explain the process and dwell on the particulars with senile rapture i have been anxious to explain my own system this long time and now at last i have the right  i have achieved my seventy years in the usual way by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else it sounds like an exaggeration but that is really the common rule for attaining to old age when we examine the programme of any of these garrulous old people we always find that the habits which have preserved them would have decayed us that the way of life which enabled them to live upon the property of their heirs so long as mr choate says would have put us out of commission ahead of time i will offer here as a sound maxim this that we cant reach old age by another mans road  i will now teach offering my way of life to whomsoever desires to commit suicide by the scheme which has enabled me to beat the doctor and the hangman for seventy years some of the details may sound untrue but they are not i am not here to deceive i am here to teach  we have no permanent habits until we are forty then they begin to harden presently they petrify then business begins since forty i have been regular about going to bed and getting upand that is one of the main things i have made it a rule to go to bed when there wasnt anybody left to sit up with and i have made it a rule to get up when i had to this has resulted in an unswerving regularity of irregularity it has saved me sound but it would injure another person  in the matter of dietwhich is another main thingi have been persistently strict in sticking to the things which didnt agree with me until one or the other of us got the best of it until lately i got the best of it myself but last spring i stopped frolicking with mincepie after midnight up to then i had always believed it wasnt loaded for thirty years i have taken coffee and bread at eight in the morning and no bite nor sup until seventhirty in the evening eleven hours that is all right for me and is wholesome because i have never had a headache in my life but headachy people would not reach seventy comfortably by that road and they would be foolish to try it and i wish to urge upon you thiswhich i think is wisdomthat if you find you cant make seventy by any but an uncomfortable road dont you go when they take off the pullman and retire you to the rancid smoker put on your things count your checks and get out at the first way station where theres a cemetery  i have made it a rule never to smoke more than one cigar at a time i have no other restriction as regards smoking i do not know just when i began to smoke i only know that it was in my fathers lifetime and that i was discreet he passed from this life early in 1847 when i was a shade past eleven ever since then i have smoked publicly as an example to others andnot that i care for moderation myself it has always been my rule never to smoke when asleep and never to refrain when awake it is a good rule i mean for me but some of you know quite well that it wouldnt answer for everybody thats trying to get to be seventy  i smoke in bed until i have to go to sleep i wake up in the night sometimes once sometimes twice sometimes three times and i never waste any of these opportunities to smoke this habit is so old and dear and precious to me that i would feel as you sir would feel if you should lose the only moral youve gotmeaning the chairmanif youve got one i am making no charges i will grant here that i have stopped smoking now and then for a few months at a time but it was not on principle it was only to show off it was to pulverize those critics who said i was a slave to my habits and couldnt break my bonds  today it is all of sixty years since i began to smoke the limit i have never bought cigars with lifebelts around them i early found that those were too expensive for me i have always bought cheap cigarsreasonably cheap at any rate sixty years ago they cost me four dollars a barrel but my taste has improved latterly and i pay seven now six or seven seven i think yes its seven but that includes the barrel i often have smokingparties at my house but the people that come have always just taken the pledge i wonder why that is  as for drinking i have no rule about that when the others drink i like to help otherwise i remain dry by habit and preference this dryness does not hurt me but it could easily hurt you because you are different you let it alone  since i was seven years old i have seldom take a dose of medicine and have still seldomer needed one but up to seven i lived exclusively on allopathic medicines not that i needed them for i dont think i did it was for economy my father took a drugstore for a debt and it made codliver oil cheaper than the other breakfast foods we had nine barrels of it and it lasted me seven years then i was weaned the rest of the family had to get along with rhubarb and ipecac and such things because i was the pet i was the first standard oil trust i had it all by the time the drugstore was exhausted my health was established and there has never been much the matter with me since but you know very well it would be foolish for the average child to start for seventy on that basis it happened to be just the thing for me but that was merely an accident it couldnt happen again in a century  i have never taken any exercise except sleeping and resting and i never intend to take any exercise is loathsome and it cannot be any benefit when you are tired and i was always tired but let another person try my way and see where he will come out i desire now to repeat and emphasise that maxim we cant reach old age by another mans road my habits protect my life but they would assassinate you  i have lived a severely moral life but it would be a mistake for other people to try that or for me to recommend it very few would succeed you have to have a perfectly colossal stock of morals and you cant get them on a margin you have to have the whole thing and put them in your box morals are an acquirementlike music like a foreign language like piety poker paralysisno man is born with them i wasnt myself i started poor i hadnt a single moral there is hardly a man in this house that is poorer than i was then yes i started like thatthe world before me not a moral in the slot not even an insurance moral i can remember the first one i ever got i can remember the landscape the weather thei can remember how everything looked it was an old moral an old secondhand moral all out of repair and didnt fit anyway but if you are careful with a thing like that and keep it in a dry place and save it for processions and chautauquas and worlds fairs and so on and disinfect it now and then and give it a fresh coat of whitewash once in a while you will be surprised to see how well she will last and how long she will keep sweet or at least inoffensive when i got that mouldy old moral she had stopped growing because she hadnt any exercise but i worked her hard i worked her sundays and all under this cultivation she waxed in might and stature beyond belief and served me well and was my pride and joy for sixtythree years then she got to associating with insurance presidents and lost flesh and character and was a sorrow to look at and no longer competent for business she was a great loss to me yet not all loss i sold herah pathetic skeleton as she wasi sold her to leopold the pirate king of belgium he sold her to our metropolitan museum and it was very glad to get her for without a rag on she stands 57 feet long and 16 feet high and they think shes a brontosaur well she looks it they believe it will take nineteen geological periods to breed her match  morals are of inestimable value for every man is born crammed with sin microbes and the only thing that can extirpate these sin microbes is morals now you take a sterilized christiani mean you take the sterilized christian for theres only one dear sir i wish you wouldnt look at me like that  threescore years and ten  it is the scriptural statute of limitations after that you owe no active duties for you the strenuous life is over you are a timeexpired man to use kiplings military phrase you have served your term well or less well and you are mustered out you are become an honorary
