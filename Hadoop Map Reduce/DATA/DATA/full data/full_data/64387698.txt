scented with the smell of the firs and the tiny ripples it chased across the water splashed musically against the bows of the canoe there was a thud as the blade struck the water and the long light hull forged onwards with slightly lifted birdshead prow while the two men swung forward for the next stroke with a rhythmic grace of motion they knelt facing forward in the bottom of the craft and dissimilar as they were in features and to some extent in character the likeness between them was stronger than the difference both bore the unmistakable stamp of a wholesome life spent in vigorous labour in the open their eyes were clear and like those of most bushmen singularly steady their skin was weatherdarkened and they were leanly muscular  on either side of the lane of green water giant firs cedars and balsams crept down the rocky hills to the whitened driftwood fringe they formed part of the great coniferous forest which rolls westwards from the wet coast range of canadas pacific province and overleaping the strait spreads across the rugged and beautiful wilderness of vancouver island ahead clusters of little frame houses showed up here and there in openings among the trees and a small sloop towards which the canoe was heading lay anchored near the wharf  the men had plied the paddle during most of that day from inclination rather than necessity because they could have hired siwash indians to undertake the labour for them had they been so minded they were though their appearance did not suggest it moderately prosperous but their prosperity was of recent date and they had been accustomed to doing everything for themselves as are most of the men who dwell among the woods and ranges of british columbia  vane who knelt nearest the bows was twentyseven years of age and he had spent nine of them chopping trees driving cattle poling canoes and assisting in the search for useful minerals among the snowclad ranges he wore a wide grey felt hat which had lost its shape from frequent wettings an old shirt of the same colour and blue duck trousers rent in places but the light attire revealed a fine muscular symmetry he had brown hair and brown eyes and a certain warmth of colouring which showed through the deep bronze of his skin hinted at a sanguine and somewhat impatient temperament  his companion carroll had lighter hair and grey eyes and his appearance was a little less vigorous and a little more refined though he too had toiled hard and borne many privations in the wilderness his dress resembled vanes the two had located a valuable mineral property some months earlier and though this does not invariably follow had held their own against city financiers during the negotiations that preceded the floating of a company to work the mine that they had succeeded in securing a good deal of the stock was largely due to vanes pertinacity and said something for his acumen but both had been trained in a very hard school  as the wooden houses ahead rose higher and the sloops grey hull grew into sharper shape upon the clear green shining of the brine vane broke into a snatch of song    had i the wings of a dove i would fly   just for tonight to the old country  he stopped and laughed its nine years since ive seen it but i cant get those lines out of my head perhaps its because of the girl who sang them somehow i felt sorry for her she had remarkably fine eyes  seablue said his companion i dont grasp the connection between the last two remarks  neither do i vane admitted i suppose there isnt one but they werent seablue unless you mean the depth of indigo when youre out of sounding theyre irish eyes  youre not irish theres not a trace of the celt in you unless its your habit of getting indignant with the folks who dont share your views  no sir answered vane by birth im north countryengland i mean over there were respectable before everything and smart at getting hold of whatevers worth having as a matter of fact you ontario scotsmen are mighty like us  you certainly came out well ahead of those city men who put up the dollars said carroll i guess its in the blood though i fancied they would take the mine from you  vane brought his paddle down with a thud just for tonight to the old country he hummed and added it sticks to one  why did you leave the old country  thats a blamed injudicious question to ask but you shall have an answer there was a row at homei was a sentimentalist then and just eighteenand as the result of it i came out to canada his voice changed and grew softer i hadnt many relatives and except one sister theyre all gone now that reminds meshes not going to lecture for the county education authorities any longer  the sloop was close ahead and slackening the paddling they ran alongside vane glanced at his watch when they had climbed on board  supper will be finished at the hotel he remarked you had better get the stove lighted its your turn and that rascally siwash seems to have gone off again if hes not back when were ready well sail without him  carroll accordingly prepared the meal and when they had finished it they lay on deck smoking with a content which was not altogether accounted for by a satisfied appetite they had spent several anxious months during which they had come very near the end of their slender resources arranging for the exploitation of the mine and now at last the work was over vane had that day made his final plans for the construction of a road and wharf by which the ore could be economically shipped for reduction or as the alternative to this for the erection of a small smelting plant they had bought the sloop as a convenient means of conveyance and shelter since they could live in some comfort on board now they could take their ease for a while which was a very unusual thing to both of them  i suppose youre bent on sailing this craft back carroll said at length we could hire a couple of siwash to take her home while we rode across the island and got the cars to victoria besides theres that steamboat coming down the coast tonight  either way would cost a good deal extra vane pointed out  thats true carroll agreed with an amused look you could charge it to the company  vane laughed you and i have a big stake in the concern and i havent got used to spending money unnecessarily yet ive been mighty glad to earn 250 by working from sunup until dark though i didnt always get it afterwards so have you  how are you going to dispose of your dollars then you have a balance in cash as well as the shares  it has occurred to me that i might spend a few months in the old country have you ever been over  i was across some time ago but if you would sooner i went with you ill come along we could start as soon as weve arranged the few matters left open in vancouver  vane was glad to hear it he knew little about carrolls antecedents but the latter was obviously a man of education and they had been comrades for the last three years during that time they had learnt to trust each other and to bear with each others idiosyncrasies filling his pipe again as he lay in the fading sunlight vane looked back on the nine years he had passed in canada and allowing for the periods of exposure to cold and wet and the almost ceaseless toil he admitted that he might have spent them more unpleasantly  having quarrelled with his relatives he had come out with only a few pounds and had promptly set about earning a living with his hands when he had been in the country several years however a friend of the family had sent him a small sum and the young man had made a judicious use of the money the lot he bought outside a wooden town doubled in value and the share he took in a new orchard paid him well but he had held aloof from the cities and his only recklessness had been prospecting journeys into the wilderness prospecting for minerals is at once an art and a gamble but even in this direction in which he had had keen wits against him vane had held his own but there was one side of life with which he was practically unacquainted  there are no social amenities on the rangeside or in the bush and women are scarce vane had lived in spartan simplicity his passions had remained unstirred and now he was sevenandtwenty sound and vigorous of body and as a rule level of head at length however there was to be a change he had earned an interlude of leisure and he meant to enjoy it without as he prudently determined making a fool of himself  presently carroll took his pipe from his mouth  are you going ashore to the show tonight he asked  yes said vane lazily its a long while since ive struck another entertainment of any kind and that yellowhaired mites dancing is one of the prettiest things ive seen  youve been twice already carroll pointed out the girl with the blue eyes sings her first song rather well  i think so vane agreed with a significant absence of embarrassment in this case a good deal depends upon the singingthe interpretation dont they call it the things on the border and ive struck places where theyd have made it gross but the girl only brought out the mischief strikes me she didnt see there was anything else in it  thats curious considering the crowd she goes about with carroll suggested arent you cultivating a critical faculty  vane disregarded the ironical question shes irish that accounts for a good deal he paused and looked thoughtful if i knew how to do it id like to give the child who dances five dollars it must be a tough life and her motherthe woman at the pianolooks ill i wonder why they came to a place like this  struck a cold streak at nanaimo the storekeeper told me carroll replied anyway since were to start at sunup im staying here then he smiled has it struck you that your attendance in the front seats is liable to misconception  his companion rose without answering and dropped into the canoe thrusting her off he drove the craft towards the wharf with vigorous strokes and carroll shook his head whimsically as he watched him  anybody except myself would conclude that he was waking up at last he said  a minute or two later vane swung himself up on to the wharf and strode into the wooden settlement there were one or two hydraulic mines and a pulp mill in the vicinity and though the place was by no means populous a company of thirdrate entertainers had arrived some days earlier on reaching the rude wooden building in which they had given their performance and finding it closed he accosted a lounger  whats become of the show he asked  busted replied the man didnt take the boys fancy and the crowd went out with the stage this afternoon though i heard that two of the women stayed behind  vane turned away with a slight sense of compassion he however dismissed the matter from his mind and having been kneeling in a cramped position in the canoe most of the day decided to stroll along the waterside before going back to the sloop  great firs stretched out their sombre branches over the smooth shingle and now the sun had gone their clean resinous smell was heavy on the dewcooled air here and there brushwood grew among outcropping rock and catching sight of what looked like a stripe of woven fabric beneath a brake he strode towards it then he stopped with a start for a young woman lay with her face hidden from him in an attitude of dejected abandonment he was about to turn away softly when she started and looked up at him her eyes were wet but they were of the deep blue he had described to carroll and he stood still  you shouldnt give way like that he said  it was all he could think of but he spoke without obtrusive assurance or pronounced embarrassment and the girl who shook out her crumpled skirt over one little foot with a swift movement choked back a sob and favoured him with a glance of keen scrutiny as she rose to a sitting posture she was quick at reading characterthe life she led had made that necessaryand his manner and appearance were reassuring she however said nothing and sitting down on a neighbouring boulder he took out his pipe from force of habit  well he added in much the same tone as he would have used to a distressed child whats the trouble  she told him speaking on impulse theyve gone off and left me the takings didnt meet expenses  thats bad said vane gravely do you mean theyve left you alone  no replied the girl in a way its worse than that i suppose i could gosomewherebut theres mrs marvin and elsie  the child who danced  the girl assented and vane looked thoughtful  the three of you stick together he suggested  of course mrs marvins the only friend i have  then i suppose youve no idea what to do  his companion confessed it and explained that it was the cause of her distress and that they had had bad luck of late vane could understand that as he looked at her her dress was shabby and he fancied she had not been bountifully fed  if you stayed here a few days you could go out with the next stage and get on to victoria with the cars he said he paused and continued diffidently it could be arranged with the hotelkeeper  she laughed in a halfhysterical manner and he remembered that fares were high in the country  i suppose you have no money he added with blunt directness i want you to tell mrs marvin that ill lend her enough to take you all to victoria  her face crimsoned which was not quite what he had expected and he suddenly felt embarrassed  no she replied i cant do that for one thing it would be too late when we got to victoria i think we could get an engagement if we reached vancouver in time to get to kamloops by  vane knitted his brows when he heard the date and it was a moment or two before he spoke  then he said theres only one way you can do so theres a little steamboat coming down the coast tonight and i had half thought of intercepting her and handing the skipper some letters to post in victoria he knows me thats my sloop yonder and if i put you on board the steamer youd reach vancouver in good time we would have sailed at sunup anyway  the girl hesitated which struck vane as natural and turned partly from him he surmised that she did not know what to make of his offer though her need was urgent in the meanwhile he stood up  come along and talk it over with mrs marvin he went on id better tell you im wallace vane of the clermont mine of course i know your name from the programme  she rose and they walked back to the hotel once more it struck him that the girl was pretty and graceful on reaching the hotel he sat down on the verandah while she went in and a few minutes later the elder woman came out and looked at him much as the girl had done he grew hot under her gaze and repeated his offer in the curtest terms  if this breeze holds well put you on board the steamer soon after daybreak he explained  the womans face softened and he recognised now that there had been suspicion in it thank you she added well come then she added with an eloquent gesture you dont know what it means to us  vane merely took off his hat and turned away but a minute or two afterwards he met the hotelkeeper  do these people owe you anything he asked  five dollars answered the man  vane handed him a bill take it out of this and make any excuse you like im going to put them on board the steamboat  the man made no comment and vane striding down to the beach sent a hail ringing across the water carroll appeared on the sloops deck and answered him  hallo he cried whats the trouble  get ready the best supper you can manage for three people as quick as you can  then he turned away in a hurry wondering rather uneasily what carroll would say when he grasped the situation     chapter ii  a breeze of wind   there were signs of a change in the weather when vane walked down to the wharf with his passengers for a cold wind which had sprung up struck an eerie sighing from the sombre firs and sent the white mists streaming along the hillside there was a watery moon in the sky and on reaching the end of the wharf vane fancied that the singer hesitated but the elder woman laid her hand upon the girls arm reassuringly and she got into the canoe in a few minutes vane ran the craft alongside the sloop and saw the amazement in carrolls face by the glow from the cabin skylight he however fancied that his comrade would rise to the occasion and he handed his guests up  my partner carroll mrs marvin and her daughter miss kitty blake you have seen them already he said theyre coming down with us to catch the steamer  carroll bowed and vane who thrust back the cabin slide motioned the others below the place was brightly lighted by a nickelled lamp though it was scarcely four feet high and the centreboard trunk occupied the middle of it a wide cushioned locker ran along each side a foot above the floor and a swing table fixed above the trunk filled up most of the space between there was no cloth upon the table but it was invitingly laid out with canned fruit coffee hot flapjacks and a big lake trout  you must help yourselves while we get sail upon the boat said vane the saloons at your disposal my partner and i have the focsle you will notice there are blankets yonder and as well have smooth water most of the way you should get some sleep  he withdrew closing the slide and went forward with carroll to shorten in the cable but when they stopped beside the bitts his companion broke into a soft laugh  is there anything to amuse you vane asked curtly  well said carroll with an air of reflection it strikes me youre making a rather unconventional use of your new prosperity and it might be prudent to consider how your friends in vancouver may regard the adventure  vane sat down upon the bitts and took out his pipe one trouble in talking to you is that i never know whether youre in earnest or not you trot out your coldblooded worldly wisdom and then you grin at it  i think thats the only philosophic attitude replied carroll its possible to grow furiously indignant with the restraints stereotyped people lay on one but on the whole its wiser to bow to them and chuckle after all theyve some foundation  vane looked up at him sharply  youve been right in the advice you have given me more than once you seem to know how prosperous and what you call stereotyped folks look at things but youve never explained where you got the knowledge  that said carroll is quite another matter  anyway continued vane theres one remark of yours id like to answer you would no doubt consider i made a legitimate use of my money when i entertained that crowd of city peoplesome of whom would have plundered me if they could have managed itin vancouver i didnt grudge it but i was a little astonished when i saw the wine and cigar bill it struck me that the best of them scarcely noticed what they goti think theyd been up against it at one time as we have and it would have done the rest of the guzzlers good if theyd had to work all day with the shovel on pork and flapjacks but well let that go what have you and i done that we should swill in champagne while a girl with a face like that one below and a child who dances like a fairy havent enough to eat you know what i paid for the last cigars what confounded hogs we are  carroll laughed outright there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon his comrade who was hardened and toughened by determined labour and the term hog appeared singularly inappropriate  well said carroll youll no doubt get used to the new conditions by and by and in regard to your latest exploit theres a motto on your insignia of the garter which might meet the case but hadnt we better heave her over her anchor  they seized the chain and as it ran below a sharp musical rattle rang out for the hollow hull flung back the metallic clinking like a sounding board when the cable was shortup they grasped the halyards and the big gaff mainsail rose flapping up the mast they set it and turned to the headsails for though strictly speaking a sloop only carries one the term is loosely applied in places and as vane had changed her rig there were two of them  its a fair wind and i expect well find more weight in it lower down said carroll well let the staysail lie and run her with the jib  they set the jib and broke out the anchor vane took the helm and the sloop slanting over until her deck on one side dipped close to the frothing brine drove away into the darkness the lights of the settlement faded among the trees and when carroll coming aft flung a strip of canvas over the skylight his comrade could see the black hills and climbing firs on both sides slip by sliding vapours streaked them a crisp splashing sound made by the curling ripples followed the vessel the canoe surged along noisily astern and the frothing and gurgling grew louder at the bows they were running down one of the deep forestshrouded inlets which resembling the norwegian fiords pierce the pacific littoral of canada  i wonder how the wind is outside vane said  carroll looked round and saw the white mists stream athwart the pines on a promontory they were skirting thats more than i can tell in these troughs among the hills it either blows straight up or directly down and i dare say well find it different when we reach the sound one things certaintheres some weight in it now  vane nodded agreement though an idea that troubled him crept into his mind i understand the steamboat skipper will run in to land some siwash hes bringing down it will be awkward in the dark if the winds onshore  carroll made no comment and they drove on until as they swept round the point the sloop slanting sharply dipped her lee rail in the froth  well have to tie down a reef he said  vane told him to take the tiller and scrambling forward rapped upon the cabin side which he flung back mrs marvin lay upon the leeward locker with a blanket across her and the little girl at her feet miss blake sat on the weather one with a book in her hand  were going to take some sail off the boat he said you neednt be disturbed by the noise  when do you expect to meet the steamer miss blake inquired  not for two or three hours anyway vane answered with a hint of uncertainty in his voice then as he fancied the girl had noticed it he closed the slide  down helm he said to carroll and there was a banging and thrashing of canvas as the sloop came up into the wind they held her there with the jib aback while they hauled the canoe on board which was not an easy task and then with difficulty hove down a reef in the mainsail it was heavy work because there was nobody at the helm and the craft falling off once or twice as they leaned out upon the boom with toes on her depressed lee rail threatened to hurl them into the frothing water neither of them were trained sailors but on that coast with its inlets and sounds and rivers the wanderer learns to handle sail and paddle and canoepole  they finished their task and when vane seized the helm carroll sat down under the shelter of the coaming out of the flying spray  well probably have some trouble putting your friends on board the steamer even if she runs in he remarked what are you going to do if theres no sign of her  its a question ive been shirking for the last halfhour vane confessed  id like to point out that it would be very slow work beating back up this inlet and if we did so there isnt a stage across the island for several days no doubt you remember you have to see that contractor on thursday and theres the directors meeting  its uncommonly awkward vane answered dubiously  carroll laughed it strikes me your guests will have to stay where they are whether they like it or not but theres one consolationif this wind is from the northwest which is most likely it will be a fast run to victoria and now ill try to get some sleep  he disappeared down a scuttle forward leaving vane somewhat disturbed in mind he had merely contemplated taking his guests for a few hours run but to have them on board for perhaps several days was a very different thing besides he was far from sure that they would understand the necessity for the latter in which case the situation might become difficult in the meanwhile the sloop drove on until at last towards morning the beach fell back on each hand and she met the long swell tumbling in from the pacific the wind was from the northwest and blowing moderately hard there was no light yet in the sky above the black heights to the east of him and the swell grew higher and steeper breaking white here and there the sloop plunged over it wildly hurling the spray aloft and it cost him a determined effort to haul his sheets in as the wind drew ahead shortly afterwards the beach faded altogether on one hand and he saw that the sea was piled up into foaming ridges it seemed most improbable that the steamer would run in to land her indian passengers and he drove the sloop on with showers of stinging brine beating into her wet canvas and whirling about him  by and by he noticed that a stream of smoke was pouring from the short funnel of the stove and soon afterwards the cabin slide opened miss blake crept out and stood up in the well gazing forward while she clutched the coaming  day was now breaking and vane could see that her thin dress was blown flat against her there was something graceful in her pose and it struck him that she had a very pretty slender figure  wheres the steamer she asked  it was a question vane had dreaded but he answered it honestly i cant tell you its very likely that she has gone straight on to victoria  he read suspicion in her suddenly hardening face  you expected this when you asked us to come on board she cried  no said vane whose face grew hot on my honour i did nothing of the kind there was only a moderate breeze when we left and when it freshened enough to make it unlikely that the steamer would run in i was as vexed as you seem to be as it happened i couldnt go back i must get on to victoria as soon as possible  she looked at him searchingly  then what are we to do she asked  there was distress in the cry but vane answered it in his most matteroffact tone so far as i can see you can only reconcile yourself to staying on board well have a fresh fair wind for victoria once were round the next head and with luck we ought to get there late tonight  youre sure youll be there then  im sorry i cant even promise that it depends upon the weather he replied but you mustnt stand up in the spray youre getting wet through  she still clung to the coaming but he fancied that her misgivings were vanishing and he spoke again how are mrs marvin and the little girl i see you have lighted the stove  the girl sat down shivering in the partial shelter of the coaming and at last a gleam of amusement which he thought was partly compassionate shone in her eyes  im afraid theyrefar from well that was why i lighted the fire i wanted to make them some tea i thought you wouldnt mind  vane smiled everythings at your service go and get your breakfast and put on a coat youll find below if you come out again  she disappeared and vane felt relieved though the explanation had proved less difficult than he had anticipated he was glad that it was over half an hour later she appeared again carrying a loaded tray and he wondered at the ease of her movements for the sloop was plunging viciously  ive brought you some breakfast you have been up all night she said  vane laughed as i can only take one hand from the helm you will have to cut up the bread and canned stuff for me draw that box out and sit down beneath the coaming if you mean to stay  she did as he told her the well was some four feet long and the bottom of it about half that distance below the level of the deck as the result of this she sat close to his feet while he balanced himself on the coaming gripping the tiller he noticed that she had brought an oilskin jacket with her  hadnt you better put this on first theres a good deal of spray she said  vane struggled into the jacket with some difficulty and she smiled as she handed him up a slice of bread and canned meat i suppose she said you can only manage one piece at once  thank you thats about as much as you could expect one to be capable of even allowing for the bushmans appetite im surprised to see you looking so fresh  oh said the girl i used to go out with the mackerel boats at home we lived at the ferry it was a mile across the lough and with the wind westerly the sea worked in  the lough said vane i told carroll you were from the green isle  it struck him that this was perhaps imprudent since it implied that they had been discussing her but on the other hand he thought the candour of the statement was in his favour then he added have you been long out here  her face grew wistful four years she answered i came out with larryhes my brother he was a forester at home and he took small contracts for clearing land then he marriedand i left him  vane made a sign of comprehension i see wheres larry now  he went to oregon there was no answer to my last letter ive lost sight of him  and you go about with mrs marvin is her husband alive  sudden anger flared up in the girls blue eyes though he knew it was not directed against him  yes she said its a pity he is men of his kind always seem to live  it occurred to vane that miss blake who had evidently a spice of temper could be a staunch partisan and he also noticed that now he had inspired her with some degree of trust in himself her conversation was marked by an ingenious candour for all that she changed the subject  another piece or some tea she asked  tea first said vane and they both laughed when she afterwards handed him a double slice of bread  these sandwiches strike me as unusually nice he informed her its exceptionally good tea too  the blue eyes gleamed with amusement you have been in the cold all nightbut i was once in a restaurant she watched the effect of this statement on him you know i really cant singi was never taught anyway though there were some of the settlements where we did rather well  vane hummed a few bars of a song i dont suppose you realise what one ballad of yours has done id almost forgotten the old country but the night i heard you i felt i must go back and see it again whats more carroll and i are going shortly its your doing  this was a matter of fact but kitty blake had produced a deeper effect on him although he was not aware of it yet  its a shame to keep you handing me things to eat he added disconnectedly still id like another piece  she smiled delighted as she passed the food to him you cant help yourself and steer the boat besidesafter the restauranti dont mind waiting on you  vane made no comment but he watched her with satisfaction while he ate and as one result of it the sloop plunged heavily into the frothing sea there was no sign of the others and they were alone on the waste of tumbling water in the early dawn the girl was pretty and there was a pleasing daintiness about her  she belonged to the peoplethere was no doubt of that but then vane had a strong faith in the people nativeborn and adopted of the pacific slope it was from them he had received the greatest kindnesses he could remember they were cheerful optimists indomitable grapplers with forest and flood who did almost incredible things with axe and saw and giantpowder they lived in lonely ranch houses tents and rudely flung up shacks driving the new roads along the rangeside risking life and limb in wildcat adits they were quick to laughter and reckless in hospitality  then with an effort he brushed the hazy thoughts away kitty blake was merely a guest of his in another day he would land her in victoria and that would be the end of it he was assuring himself of this when carroll crawled up through the scuttle forward and came aft to join them in spite of his prudent reflections vane was by no means certain that he was pleased to see him     chapter iii  an afternoon ashore   half the day had slipped by when the breeze freshened further and the sun broke through the sloop was then rolling wildly as she drove along with the peak of her mainsail lowered before a big following sea vane looked thoughtful as he gripped the helm because a head ran out from the beach he was following three or four miles way and he would have to haul the boat up to windward to get round it this would bring the combers upon her quarter or worse still abeam kitty blake was below mrs marvin had made no appearance yet and he spoke to carroll who was standing in the well  the seas breaking more sharply and wed get uncommonly wet before we hammered round yonder head he said theres an inlet on this side of it where we ought to find good shelter  the trouble is that if you stay there long youll be too late for the directors meeting carroll answered  they cant have the meeting without me and if its necessary they can wait vane pointed out ive had to many an hour ive spent cooling my heels in offices before the head of the concern could find time to attend to me no doubt it was part of the game and done to impress me with a due sense of my unimportance  its possible carroll agreed smiling  kitty blake made her appearance in the cabin entrance just then and vane smiled at her  were going to give you a rest he announced theres an inlet close ahead where we should find smooth water and well put you all ashore until the wind drops  there was no suspicion in the girls face now and she gave him a grateful glance before she disappeared below with the consoling news  soon afterwards vane luffed into a tiny bay where the sloop rode upright in the sunshine with loose canvas flapping softly in a faint breeze while the cable rattled down  they got the canoe over and when he had landed mrs marvin and her little girl both of whom looked very woebegone and the worse for the voyage into her vane glanced round  isnt miss blake coming he asked  mrs marvin who was suggestively pallid smiled shes changing her dress she glanced at her own crumpled attire and added im past thinking of such things as that  they waited some minutes and then vane called to kitty who appeared in the entrance to the cabin wont you look in the locker and bring anything you think would be nice well make a fire and have supper on the beach if it isnt firstrate youll be responsible  a few minutes later they paddled ashore and vane landed them on a strip of shingle with a wall of rock behind it to which dark firs clung in the rifts and crannies the sunshine streamed into the hollow the wind was cut off and not far away a crystal stream came splashing down a ravine  vane who had brought an axe made a fire of resinous wood and carroll and kitty prepared a bountiful supper after it was finished carroll carried the plates away to the stream towards which mrs marvin and the little girl followed him and vane and kitty were left beside the fire she sat on a log of driftwood and he lay on the warm shingle with his pipe in his hand the clear green water splashed and tinkled upon the pebbles close at his feet and a faint elfin sighing fell from the firs above them it was very old music the song of the primeval wilderness and though he had heard it often it had a strange unsettling effect upon him as he languidly watched his companion there was no doubt that she was pleasant to look upon but although he failed to recognise this clearly it was to a large extent an impersonal interest he took in her she was not so much an attractive young woman with qualities that pleased him as a type of something that had so far not come into his life something which he vaguely felt that he had missed one could have fancied that by some deepsunk intuition she surmised this fact and felt the security of it  so you believe you can get an engagement if you reach vancouver in time he said at length kitty assented and he asked how long will it last  i cant tell perhaps a few weeks it depends upon how the boys are pleased with the show  it must be a hard life vane broke out you must make very littlescarcely enough i suppose to carry you on from one engagement to another after all werent you as well off at the restaurant didnt they treat you properly  she coloured a little at the question oh yes at least i have no fault to find with the man who kept it or his wife  vane made a hasty sign of comprehension he supposed that the difficulty had arisen from the conduct of one or more of the regular customers he felt he would very much like to meet the man whose undesired attentions had driven his companion from her occupation  did you never try to learn keeping accounts or typewriting he asked  i tried it once but the mill shut down  ive an idea that i could find you a post vane made the suggestion casually though he was troubled by an inward diffidence  he saw a tinge of warmer colour creep into the girls cheeks  no she said decidedly it wouldnt do  the man knitted his brows though he fancied that she was right well he replied i dont want to be officiousbut how can i help  you cant help at all  vane who saw that she meant it lay smoking in silence for a minute or two then carroll came up with mrs marvin and the child and he felt strongly stirred when the little girl walked up to him shyly with a basket filled with shells he drew her down beside him with an arm about her waist while he examined her treasures and then glancing up met kittys eyes and felt his face grow hot with an emotion he failed to analyse the child was delicate life had scanty pleasure to offer her but now she was happy  theyre so pretty and there are lots of them she said cant we stay here longer and gather some more  yes said vane conscious that carroll who had heard the question was watching him you shall stay and get as many as you want im afraid you dont like the sloop  no replied the child gravely i dont like it when it jumps after i woke up it jumped all the time  never mind said vane the boat will keep still tonight and i dont think therell be any waves to roll her about tomorrow well bring you ashore first thing in the morning  he talked to her for a few minutes and then strolled along the beach with carroll  why did you promise that child to stay here carroll asked  because i felt like doing so  i neednt remind you that youve an appointment with horsfield about the smelter and theres a meeting of the board next day if we started now and caught the first steamer across you wouldnt have much time to spare  thats correct i shall have to wire from victoria that ive been detained  carroll laughed expressively do you mean to keep your directors waiting to please a child  i suppose thats one reason anyway i dont propose to hustle the little girl and her mother on board the steamer helpless with sea sickness he paused and a gleam of humour crept into his eyes as i told you ive no objection to letting the directors wait my pleasure  but they set the concern on its feet  just so said vane coolly on the other hand they got excellent value for their servicesand i found the mine whats more during the preliminary negotiations most of them treated me very casually  well said carroll  theres going to be a difference now ive a board of directors one way or another ive had to pay for the privilege pretty dearly but i dont intend that they should run the clermont mine  carroll glanced at him with open amusement there had been a marked change in vane since he had floated the company but it was one that did not astonish his comrade carroll had long suspected him of latent capabilities which had suddenly sprung to life  you ought to see horsfield before you meet the board he pointed out  im not sure vane answered in fact im uncertain whether ill give horsfield the contract even if we decide about the smelter i dont want a man with too firm a hold up against me  but if he put his money in with the idea of getting certain pickings  he didnt explain his intentions and i made no promises vane answered dryly hell get his dividends thatll satisfy him  they rejoined the others and when the white mists crept lower down from the heights above and the chill of the dew was in the air vane launched the canoe  its getting late and theres a long run in front of us tomorrow he informed his passengers the sloop will lie as still as if moored in a pond and youll have her all to yourselves carroll and i are going to camp ashore  he paddled them off to the boat and coming back with some blankets cut a few armfuls of spruce twigs in a ravine and spread them out beside the fire then sitting down just clear of the scented smoke he lighted his pipe and asked an abrupt question what do you think of kitty blake  well said carroll cautiously i must confess that ive taken some interest in the girl partly because you were obviously doing so in a general way what i noticed rather surprised me it wasnt what i expected  you smart folks are as often wrong as the rest of us i suppose you looked for coldblooded assurance tempered by what one might call experienced coquetry  something of the kind carroll agreed as you say i was wrong there are only two ways of explaining miss blake and the firsts the one that would strike most people that is shes acting a part possibly with an object holding her natural self in check and doing it cleverly  vane laughed scornfully i wouldnt have entertained that idea for five minutes  then said carroll theres the other explanation its simply that the girls life hasnt affected her somehow she has kept fresh and wholesome  theres no doubt of it said vane shortly  you offered to help her in some way  i did i dont know how you guessed it i said id find her a situation she wouldnt hear of it  she was wise said carroll vancouver isnt a very big place yet and the girl has more sense than you have what did you say  nothing you interrupted us but im going to sleep  he rolled himself up in his blanket and lay down among the soft spruce twigs but carroll sat still in the darkness and smoked his pipe out then he glanced at his comrade who lay still breathing evenly  no doubt youll be considered fortunate he said apostrophizing him half aloud youve had power and responsibility thrust upon you what will you make of them  then he too lay down and only the soft splash of the tiny ripples broke the silence while the fire sank lower  they sailed next morning and eventually arrived in victoria after the boat which crossed the strait had gone but the breeze was fair from the westwards and after dispatching a telegram vane put to sea again the sloop made a quick passage and for most of the time her passengers lounged in the sunshine on her gentlyslanted deck it was evening when they ran through the narrows into vancouvers landlocked harbour  half an hour later vane landed his passengers and it was not until he had left them they discovered that he had thrust a roll of paper currency into the little girls hand then he and carroll set off for the cpr hotel     chapter iv  a change of environment   on the evening after his arrival in vancouver vane who took carroll with him paid a visit to one of his directors and in accordance with the invitation reached the latters dwelling some little time before the arrival of other guests whose acquaintance it was considered advisable that he should make  vane and his companion were ushered into a small room with an uncovered floor and simple hardwood furniture it was obviously a working room for as a rule the work of the western business man goes on continuously except when he is asleep but a somewhat portly lady with a goodhumoured face reclined in a rockingchair a gaunt elderly man of rugged appearance rose from his seat at a writingtable as his guests entered  so ye have come at last he said i had you shown in here because this room is mine and i can smoke when i like the rest of the house is mrs nairns and it seems that her friends do not appreciate the smell of my cigars im not sure that i can blame them  mrs nairn smiled placidly alec she explained leaves them lying everywhere and i do not like the stubs on the stairs but sit ye down and he will give ye one  vane felt at home with both of them he had met people of their kind before and allowing for certain idiosyncrasies considered them the salt of the dominion nairn had done good service to his adopted country developing her new industries with some profit to himself for he was of scottish extraction but while close at a bargain he could be generous afterwards when his guests were seated he laid two cigar boxes on the table  those he said pointing to one of them are mine i think ye had better try the others theyre for visitors  vane who had already noticed the aroma of the cigar that was smouldering on a tray decided that he was right and dipped his hand into the second box which he passed to carroll  now said nairn we can talk comfortably and clara will listen afterwards its possible she will favour me with her opinion  mrs nairn smiled at them encouragingly and her husband proceeded one or two of my colleagues were no pleased at ye for putting off the meeting  the sloop was small and it was blowing rather hard vane explained  maybe said nairn for all that the tone of your message was not altogether conciliatory it informed us that ye would arrange for the postponed meeting at your earliest convenience ye didna mention ours  i pointed that out to him and he said it didnt matter carroll broke in laughing  nairn spread out his hands in expostulation but there was dry appreciation in his eyes young blood must have its way then he paused ye will not have said anything to horsfield yet about the smelter  no so far im not sure it would pay us to put up the plant and the other mans terms were lower  maybe nairn answered and he made the word very expressive ye have had the handling of the thing but henceforward it will be necessary to get the sanction of the board however ye will meet horsfield tonight we expect him and his sister  vane thought he had been favoured with a hint but he also fancied that his host was not inimical and was merely reserving his judgment the latter changed the subject  so yere going to england for a holiday he remarked yell have friends wholl be glad to see ye  ive one sister and no other near relatives but i expect to spend some time with folks you know the chisholms are old family friends and as you will remember it was through them i first approached you then obeying one of the impulses which occasionally swayed him he turned to mrs nairn im grateful to them for sending me the letter of introduction to your husband he didnt treat me as the others did when i first went round this city with a few mineral specimens  he had expected nothing when he spoke but there was a responsive look in the ladys face which hinted that he had made a friend and as a matter of fact he owed a good deal to his host  so ye are meaning to stay with chisholm nairn exclaimed we had evelyn here two years ago and clara said something about her coming out again  i never heard of that but its nine years since i saw evelyn  then theres a surprise in store for ye said nairn i believe theyve a bonny place and theres no doubt chisholm will make ye welcome  the slight pause was expressive it implied that nairn who had a somewhat biting humour could furnish a reason for chisholms hospitality if he desired and vane was confirmed in this supposition when he saw the warning look which his hostess cast at her husband  its likely that well have evelyn again in the fall she broke in its a very small world mr vane  its a far cry from vancouver to england said vane how did you come to know chisholm  nairn answered him our acquaintance began with business and hes a kind of connection of colquhouns  colquhoun was a man of some importance who held a crown appointment and vane felt inclined to wonder why chisholm had not sent him a letter to him afterwards he guessed at the reason which was not flattering to himself or his host the latter and he chatted awhile on business topics until there was a sound of voices below and going down in company with mrs nairn they found two or three new arrivals in the entrance hall more came in and when they sat down to supper vane was given a place beside a lady whom he had already met  jessie horsfield was about his own age tall and slight of figure with regular features a rather colourless face and eyes of a cold light blue there was however something which vane considered striking in her appearance and he was gratified by her graciousness to him her brother sat almost opposite to them a tall spare man with an expressionless countenance except for the aggressive hardness in his eyes vane had noticed this look in them and it had roused his dislike but he had not observed it in those of miss horsfield though it was present now and then nor did he realise that while she chatted she was unobtrusively studying him she had not favoured him with much notice when she was in his company on a previous occasion he had been a man of no importance then  i suppose you are glad you have finished your work in the bush she remarked presently it must be nice to get back to civilisation  yes vane assented its remarkably nice after living for nine years in the wilderness  a fresh dish was laid before him and his companion smiled you didnt get things of this kind among the pines  no said vane in fact cookery is one of the choppers trials you come back dead tired and often very wet to your lonely tent and then theres a fire to make and supper to get before you can rest it happens now and then that youre too played out to trouble and go to sleep instead  dreadful said the girl sympathetically but you have been in vancouver before  except on the last occasion i stayed down near the waterfront we were not provided with luxurious quarters or suppers of this kind then  jessie nodded its romantic and though you must be glad its over there must be some satisfaction in feeling that you owe the change to your own efforts doesnt it give you a feeling that in some degree youre master of your fate i fancy i should like that  it was subtle flattery and there were reasons why it appealed to the man he had wandered about the province in search of employment besides being beaten down at many a small bargain by more fortunately situated men now however he had resolved that there should be a difference instead of begging favours he would dictate terms  i should have imagined it he said in answer to her last remark and he was right for jessie horsfield was a clever woman who loved power and influence then she abruptly changed the subject  it was you who located the clermont mine wasnt it she asked i read something about it in the papers i think they said it was copper  this vagueness was misleading because her brother had given her a good deal of information about the mine  yes said vane who was willing to take up any subject she suggested its copper but theres some silver combined with it of course the value of any ore depends upon two thingsthe percentage of the metal and the cost of extracting it  she waited with flattering interest and he added in both respects clermont produce is promising  after that he did not remember what they talked about but the time passed rapidly and he was surprised when mrs nairn rose and the company drifted away by twos and threes towards the verandah left by himself a moment he came upon carroll sauntering down a corridor and the latter stopped him  ive had a chat with horsfield he remarked  well said vane  he may have merely meant to make himself agreeable and he may have wished to extract information about you if the latter was his object he was not successful  ah said vane thoughtfully nairns straight anyway and to be relied upon i like him and his wife  so do i carroll agreed  he moved away and a few moments later horsfield joined vane who had strolled out on to the verandah  i dont know if its a very suitable time to mention it but are you any nearer a decision about that smelter yet he said candidly id like the contract  no said vane i cant make up my mind and i may postpone the matter indefinitely it might prove more profitable to ship the ore out for reduction  horsfield examined his cigar of course i cant press you but i may perhaps suggest that as well have to work together in other matters i might be able to give you a quid pro quo  that occurred to me said vane on the other hand i dont know how much importance i ought to attach to the consideration  his companion laughed with apparent goodhumour oh well he answered i must wait until youre ready  he strolled away and presently joined his sister  how does vane strike you he asked you seem to get on with him  ive an idea that you wont find him easy to influence and the girl looked at her brother pointedly  im inclined to agree with you said horsfield in spite of that hes a man worth cultivating  he passed on to speak to nairn and by and by vane sat down beside jessie in a corner of a big room it was simply furnished but spacious and lofty and looked out across the verandah it was pleasant to lounge there and feel that miss horsfield had goodnaturedly taken him under her wing which seemed to describe her attitude  as mrs nairn tells me you are going to england i suppose we shall not see you in vancouver for some months she said presently this city really isnt a bad place to live in  vane felt gratified she implied that he would be an acquisition and included him among the number of her acquaintances i fancy i shall find it a particularly pleasant one he responded indeed im inclined to be sorry ive made arrangements to leave it very shortly  that is pure goodnature his companion laughed  she changed the subject and vane found her conversation entertaining she said nothing of any consequence but she knew how to make a glance or a changed inflection expressive he was sorry when she left him but she smiled at him before she moved away  if you and mr carroll care to call i am generally at home in the afternoon she said  she crossed the room and vane who joined nairn remained near him until he took his departure  it was late the next afternoon and an empress liner from china and japan had arrived an hour or two earlier when he and carroll reached the cpr station the atlantic train was waiting and an unusual number of passengers were hurrying about the cars they were for the most part prosperous people business men and tourists from england going home that way and when vane found mrs marvin and kitty he was once more conscious of a stirring of compassion kitty smiled at him diffidently  you have been so kind she began and pausing added with a tremor in her voice but the tickets  pshaw said vane if it will ease your mind you can send me what they cost after the first full house you draw  how shall we address you  clermont mineral exploitation i dont want to think im going to lose sight of you  kitty turned away from him a moment and then looked back  im afraid you must make up your mind to that she said  vane could not remember his answer though he afterwards tried but just then an official strode along beside the cars calling to the passengers and when a bell began tolling vane hurried the girl and her companions on to a platform mrs marvin entered the car elsie held up her face to kiss him before she disappeared and he and kitty were left alone she held out her hand and a liquid gleam crept into her eyes  we cant thank you properly she said goodbye  no vane protested you mustnt say that  yes said kitty firmly its goodbye youll be carried on in a moment  vane gazed down at her and afterwards wondered at what he did but she looked so forlorn and desolate and the pretty face was so close to him stooping swiftly he kissed her and had a thrilling fancy that she did not recoil then the cars lurched forward and he swung himself down     chapter v  the old country   a month had passed since vane said goodbye to kitty when he and carroll alighted one evening at a little station in the north of england  the train went on and vane stood still looking about him with a poignant recollection of how he had last waited on that platform sick at heart but gathering his youthful courage for the effort that he must make it all came back to him the dejection the sense of loneliness for he was then going out to the western dominion in which he had not a friend now he was returning prosperous and successful but once again the feeling of loneliness was with himmost of those whom he had left behind had made a longer journey than his  then he noticed an elderly man in livery approaching and held out his hand with a smile of pleasure  you havent changed a bit jim he said  a bit stiffer in the joints and maybe a bit sourer was the answer then the mans wrinkled face relaxed im main glad to see thee mr wallace master wad have come only hed t gan t manchester suddenly  vane helped him to place their baggage in the trap and then gathering up the reins bade him sit behind after half an hours ride through a country rolled in ridge and valley vane pulled up where a stile path led across a strip of meadow  you can drive round well be there before you he said to the groom as he got down  carroll and he crossed the meadow and passing round a clump of larches came suddenly into sight of an old grey house with a fir wood rolling down the hillside close behind it the building was long and low weatherworn and stained with lichens where the creepers and climbing roses left the stone exposed the bottom row of mullioned windows opened upon a terrace and in front of the latter ran a low wall with a mossy coping on which was placed urns bright with geraniums it was pierced by an opening approached by shallow stairs on which a peacock stood and between them and the two men stretched a sweep of lawn a couple of minutes later a lady met them in the hall and held out her hand to vane effusively she was middleaged and had once been handsome carroll thought but there were wrinkles about her eyes which had a hint of hardness in them  welcome home wallace she said it should not be difficult to look upon the dene as thatyou were here so often once upon a time  thank you said vane i felt tempted to ask jim to drive me round by the low wood i wanted to see the place again  im glad you didnt and the lady smiled sympathetically the house is shut up and going to pieces it would have been depressing tonight  vane presented carroll mrs chisholms manner was gracious but for no particular reason carroll wondered if she would have extended the same welcome to either had his comrade not come back the discoverer of a mine  tom was sorry he couldnt wait to meet you but he had to leave for manchester on some urgent business she informed vane and looked round as a girl with disordered hair came up to them  this is mabel she said i hardly think you will remember her  ive carried her across the meadow smilingly remarked vane  the girl greeted the strangers demurely and favoured vane with a critical gaze so youre wallace vanewho found the clermont mine though i dont remember you ive heard a good deal about you lately very pleased to make your acquaintance  vanes eyes twinkled as he shook hands with her her manner was quaintly formal but he fancied there was a spice of mischief hidden behind it and in the meanwhile carroll watching his hostess surmised that her daughters remarks had not altogether pleased her she however chatted with them until the man who had driven them appeared with their baggage when they were shown their respective rooms  vane was the first to go down and reaching the hall found nobody there though a clatter of dishes and clink of silver suggested that a meal was being laid out in an adjoining room sitting down near the hearth he looked about him  his eyes rested on many objects that he recognised but as his glance travelled to and fro it occurred to him that much of what he saw conveyed a hint that economy was needful  by and by he heard a patter of feet and looking up saw a girl descending the stairs in the fading stream of light she was clad in trailing white which gleamed against the dark oak and rustled softly as it flowed about a tall finelyoutlined and finelypoised figure she had hair of dark brown with paler lights in its curling tendrils gathered back from a neck that showed a faintly warmer whiteness than the snowy fabric beneath it it was however her face which seized vanes attention the level brows the quiet deep brown eyes the straight cleanlycut nose and the subtle suggestion of steadfastness and pride which they all conveyed he rose with a cry that had pleasure and eagerness in it evelyn  she came down moving lightly but as he noticed with a rhythmic grace and laid a firm cool hand in his  im glad to see you back wallace she said but you have changed  im not sure thats kind in some ways you havent changed at all i would have known you anywhere  nine years is a long time to remember any one  vane had seen few women during that period but he was not a fool and he recognised that this was no occasion for an attempt at gallantry there was nothing coquettish in evelyns words nor were they ironical she had answered in the tranquil matteroffact manner which as he remembered usually characterised her  its a little while since you landed isnt it she added  a week said vane id some business in london and then i went on to look up lucy she had just gone up to town and i missed her i shall go up again to see her as soon as she answers my note  it wont be necessary shes coming here for a fortnight very soon  thats kind said vane whom have i to thank for suggesting it  does it matter it was a natural thing to ask your only sisterwho is a friend of mine we have plenty of room and the place is quiet  it used not to be if i remember your mother generally had it full part of the year  things have changed said evelyn quietly  vane was baffled by something in her manner evelyn had never been effusivethat was not her waybut now while she was cordial she did not seem disposed to resume their acquaintance where it had been broken off after all he could hardly have expected this  mabel is like you as you used to be he said it struck me as soon as i saw her but when she began to talk there was a difference  yes she said i think youre right in both respects mopsy has the courage of her convictions shes an open rebel  there was no bitterness in her tone evelyns manner was never pointed but vane fancied that she had said a meaning thing one that might explain what he found puzzling in her attitude when he held the key to it then she went on mopsy was dubious about you before you arrived but im pleased to say she now seems reassured  then carroll came down and a few moments later mrs chisholm appeared and they went in to dinner in a lowceilinged room nobody said anything of importance but by and by mabel turned to vane  i suppose you have brought your pistols with you she said  i never owned one vane informed her  the girl looked at him with an excellent assumption of incredulity then you have never shot anybody in british columbia  carroll laughed as if this greatly pleased him but vanes face was rather grave as he answered her  no he said im thankful i havent  then the west must be getting what the archdeaconhes floras husband you knowcalls decadent the girl retorted  shes incorrigible mrs chisholm interposed with a smile  carroll who was sitting next to mabel leaned towards her confidentially in case you feel badly disappointed ill let you into a secret he said when we feel real savage we take the axe instead  evelyn fancied that vane winced at this but mabel looked openly regretful  can either of you pick up a handkerchief going at full gallop on horseback she inquired  im sorry i cant and ive never seen wallace do so carroll answered laughing and mrs chisholm shook her head at her daughter  miss clifford complained of your inattention to the study of english last quarter she said severely  mabel made no answer though vane thought it would have relieved her to grimace and by and by the meal came to an end some time afterwards mrs chisholm rose from her seat in the drawingroom  we keep early hours at the dene but you will retire when you like she said as tom is away i had better tell you that you will find syphons and whisky in the smokingroom i have had the lamp lighted  thank you vane replied with a smile im afraid you have taken more trouble on our account than you need have done except on special occasions we have generally confined ourselves to strong green tea  mabel looked at him in amazement oh she said the west is certainly decadent you should be here when the otter hounds are out why it was only  she broke off abruptly beneath her mothers withering glance and when they were left alone vane and carroll strolled out upon the terrace pipe in hand  i suppose you could put in a few weeks here vane remarked  i could carroll replied theres anatmosphereabout these old houses that appeals to me perhaps because we have nothing like it in canada besides i think your friends mean to make things pleasant  im glad you like them  carroll understood that his comrade would not resent a candid expression of opinion i do the girls in particular they interest me the younger ones of a type thats common in our country though its generally given room for free development into something useful there mabels chaffing at the curb it remains to be seen if shell kick and hurt herself in doing so presently  vane who remembered that evelyn had said something to the same effect had already discovered that carroll possessed a keen insight in certain matters  and her sister he suggested  you wont mind my saying that im inclined to be sorry for her she has learned repressionbeen driven into line that girl has character but its being cramped and stunted you live in walledin compartments in this country  vane strolled along the terrace thoughtfully he was not offended and he understood his companions attitude like other men of education and good upbringing driven by unrest or disaster to the untrammelled life of the bush carroll had gained sympathy as well as knowledge facing facts candidly he seldom indulged in decided protest against any of them on the other hand vane was on occasion liable to outbreaks of indignation  well said the latter at length i guess its time to go to bed     chapter vi  upon the heights   vane rose early next morning as he had been accustomed to do and taking a towel with him made his way across dewy meadows and between tall hedgerows to the tarn stripping where the rabbitcropped sward met the mossy boulders he swam out joyously breasting the little ripples which splashed and sparkled beneath the breeze that had got up with the sun coming back where the water lay in shadow beneath a larch wood which as yet had not wholly lost its vivid green he disturbed the paddling moorhens and put up a mallard from a clump of swaying reeds then he dressed and turned homewards  scrambling over a limestone wall tufted thick with parsley fern he noticed mabel stooping down over an object which lay among the heather where a rough cartroad approached a wooden bridge on joining her he saw that it was a finelybuilt canoe with a hole in one bilge she was examining she looked up at him ruefully as she said very sad isnt it that stupid little did it with his clumsy cart  i think it could be mended vane replied  old beavanhes the wheelwrightsaid it couldnt and dad said i could hardly expect him to send the canoe back to kingston he bought it for me at an exhibition then a thought seemed to strike her perhaps you had something to do with canoes in canada  i used to pole one loaded with provisions up a river and carry the lot round several falls youre fond of paddling  i love it i used to row the fishingpunt but its too old to be safe and now the canoes smashed i cant go out  well said vane well walk across and see what we can find in beavans shop  they crossed the heath to a tiny hamlet nestling in a hollow of a limestone crag there vane made friends with the wheelwright who regarded him dubiously at first and obtained a piece of larch board from him the grizzled north countryman watched him closely as he set a plane which is a delicate operation and then raised no objection when vane made use of his work bench after that vane who had sawn up the board borrowed a few tools and copper nails and he and mabel went back to the canoe on the way she glanced at him curiously  i wasnt sure old beavan would let you have the things she remarked it isnt often hell lend even a hammer but he seemed to take to you i think it was the way you handled his plane  its strange what little things win some peoples good opinion isnt it  oh dont she exclaimed thats how the archdeacon talks i thought you were different  the man acquiesced in the rebuke and after an hours labour at the canoe scraped the red lead he had used off his hands and sat down beside the craft by and by he became conscious that his companion was regarding him with what seemed to be approval  i really think youll do and well get on she informed him if you had been the wrong kind you would have worried about your red hands still you could have rubbed them on the heather instead of on your socks  i might have thought of that vane agreed but you see ive been accustomed to wearing old clothes anyway youll be able to launch the canoe as soon as the joints dry  theres one thing i should have told you the girl replied dad would have sent the canoe away to be mended if it hadnt been so far hes very good when things dont ruffle him but he hasnt been fortunate lately the lead mine takes a good deal of money  vane admired her loyalty and refrained from taking advantage of her candour though there were one or two questions he would have liked to ask when he was last in england chisholm had been generally regarded as a man of means though it was rumoured that he was addicted to hazardous speculations mabel who did not seem to mind his silence went on  i heard stevenshes the gamekeepertell beavan that dad should have been a rabbit because hes so fond of burrowing no doubt that meant he couldnt keep out of mines  vane made no comment and to change the subject reminded her dont you think its getting on for breakfast time  it wont be for a good while yet we dont get up early and though evelyn used to its different now we went out on the tarn every morning even in the rain but i suppose thats not good for ones complexion though bothering about such things doesnt seem to be worth while aunt julia couldnt do anything for evelyn though she had her in london for some time flora is our shining light  what did she do vane inquired  she married the archdeacon and he isnt so very dried up ive seen him smile when i talked to him  im not astonished at that mabel  his companion looked up at him demurely my names not mabelto you im mopsy to the family but my special friends call me mops youre one of the few people one can be natural with and im getting sickyou wont be shocked at thatof having to be the opposite  half an hour later vane who had seldom had to wait so long for it sat down to breakfast all he saw spoke of ease and taste and leisure evelyn who sat opposite him looked wonderfully fresh in her white dress mopsy was as amusing as she dared to be but he felt drawn back to the restless world again as he glanced at his hostess and saw the wrinkles round her eyes and a hint of cleverlyhidden strain in her expression he fancied a good deal could be inferred from the fragments of information her youngest daughter had let drop  it was the latter who suggested that they should picnic upon the summit of a lofty hill from which there was a striking view and as this met with the approval of mrs chisholm who excused herself from accompanying them they set out an hour later the day was bright with glaring sunshine and a moderate breeze drove up wisps of ragged cloud that dappled the hills with flitting shadow  vane carried the provisions in a fishingcreel and on leaving the head of the valley they climbed leisurely up easy slopes slipping on the crisp hill grass now and then by and by they plunged into tangled heather on a bolder ridge which was rent by black gullies down which at times wild torrents poured this did not trouble either of the men but vane was surprised at the ease with which evelyn threaded her way across the heath she wore a short skirt and he noticed the supple grace of her movements and the delicate colour the wind had brought into her face she had changed since they left the valley she seemed to have flung off something and her laugh had a gayer ring but while she chatted with him he was still conscious of a subtle reserve in her manner  climbing still they reached the haunts of the cloudberries and brushed through broad patches of the snowy blossoms that open their gleaming cups among the moss and heather  then turning the flank of a steep ascent they reached the foot of a shingly scree and sat down to lunch in the warm sunshine where the wind was cut off by the peak above beneath them a great rift opened up among the rocks and far beyond the blue lake in the depths of it they caught the silver gleam of the distant sea  the creel was promptly emptied and when mabel afterwards took carroll away to see if he could get up a chimney in some neighbouring crags vane lay resting on one elbow not far from evelyn she was looking down the long hollow with the sunshine upon her face  you didnt seem to mind the climb he said  i enjoyed it i am fond of the mountains and i have to thank you for a day among them  on the surface the words offered an opening for a complimentary rejoinder but vane was too shrewd to seize it he had made one venture and he surmised that a second one would not please her  theyre almost at your door he said one would imagine you could indulge in a scramble among them whenever if pleased you  there are a good many things that look so close and still are out of reach evelyn answered with a smile that somehow troubled him then her manner changed you are content with this  vane gazed about him at purple crags in shadow glistening threads of water that fell among the rocks and long slopes that lay steeped in softest colour under the summer sky  content is scarcely the right word for it he assured her if it wasnt so still and serene up here id be riotously happy there are reasons for this quite apart from the scenery for one its pleasant to feel that i need do nothing but what i like for the next few months  the sensation must be unusual i wonder if even in your case it will last so long  vane laughed and stretched out one of his hands it was lean and brown and she could see the marks of old scars on the knuckles  in my case he answered it has only come once in a lifetime and if it isnt too presumptuous i think ive earned it he indicated his battered fingers thats the result of holding a wet and slippery drill but those arent the only marks i carry about with methough ive been more fortunate than many fine comrades  i suppose one must get hurt now and then said evelyn who had noticed something that pleased her in his voice as he concluded after all a bruise thats only skindeep doesnt trouble one long and no doubt some scars are honourable its slow corrosion thats the deadliest she broke off with a laugh and added moralisings out of place on a day like this and theyre not frequent in the north in a way thats their greatest charm  vane nodded  yes he said on the face of it the north is fickle though to those who know it thats a misleading term to some of us its always the same and its dark grimness makes you feel the radiance of its smile for all that i think were going to see a sudden change in the weather  half of the wide circle their view would have commanded was cut off by the scree but long wisps of leaden cloud began to stream across the crags above intensifying until it seemed unnatural the glow of light and colour on the rest  i wonder if mopsy is leading mr carroll into any mischief they have been gone some time said evelyn she has a trick of getting herself and other people into difficulties i suppose he is an old friend of yours unless perhaps hes acting as your secretary  vanes eyes twinkled if he came in any particular capacity its as bearleader you see there are a good many things ive forgotten in the bush and as i left this country young there are no doubt some i never learned  and so you make mr carroll your confidential adviser how did he gain the necessary experience  that replied vane is more than i can tell you but im inclined to believe he has been at one of the universities toronto most likely anyhow on the whole he acts as a judicious restraint  but dont you really know anything about him  only what some years of close companionship have taught me  evelyn looked surprised and he spread out his hands in a humorous manner a good many people have had to take me in that way and they seemed willing to do so the things not uncommon in the west why should i be more particular than they were  just then mabel and carroll appeared the latters garments were stained in places as if he had been scrambling over mossy rocks and his pockets bulged  weve found some sundew and two ferns i dont know as well as all sorts of other things she announced  thats correct said carroll ive got them i guess theyre going to fill up most of the creel  mabel superintended their transfer and then addressed the others generally i think we ought to go up the pike now when we have the chance it isnt much of a climb from here besides the quickest way back to the road is across the top and down the other side  evelyn agreed and they set out following a sheeppath which skirted the screes until they left the bank of sharp stones behind and faced a steep ascent parts of it necessitated a breathless scramble and the sunlight faded from the hills as they climbed while thicker wisps of cloud drove across the ragged summit they reached the latter at length and stopped bracing themselves against a rush of chilly breeze while they looked down upon a wilderness of leadencoloured rock long trails of mist were creeping in and out among the crags and here and there masses of it gathered round the higher slopes  i think the pikes grandest in this weather mabel declared look below mr carroll and youll see the mountain is like a starfish it has prongs running out from it  carroll did as she directed him and noticed three diverging ridges springing off from the shoulder of the peak their crests which were narrow led down towards the valley but their sides fell in rent and fissured crags to great black hollows  you can get down two of them mabel went on the first is the nearest to the road but the thirds the easiest it takes you to the hause thats the gap between it and the next hill  a few big drops began to fall and evelyn cut her sisters explanations short  we had better make a start at once she said  they set out mabel and carroll leading and drawing farther away from the two behind and the rain began in earnest as they descended rock slope and scattered stones were slippery and vane found it difficult to keep his footing on some of their lichened surfaces he however was relieved to see that his companion seldom hesitated and they made their way downwards cautiously until near the spot where the three ridges diverged they walked into a belt of drifting mist the peak above them was suddenly blotted out and evelyn bade vane hail carroll and mabel who had disappeared he sent a shout ringing through the vapour and caught a faint and unintelligible reply after which a flock of sheep fled past and dislodged a rush of sliding stones vane heard the latter rattle far down the hillside and when he called again a blast of chilly wind whirled his voice away there was a faint echo above him and then silence again  it looks as if they were out of hearing and the slope ahead of us seems uncommonly steep by the way those stones went down he remarked do you think mabel has taken carroll down the stanghyll ridge  i cant tell said evelyn its comforting to remember that she knows it better than i do i think we ought to make for the hause theres only one place thats really steep keep up to the left a little the scale crags must be close beneath us  they moved on cautiously skirting what seemed to be a pit of profound depth in which dim vapours whirled while the rain which grew thicker beat into their faces     chapter vii  stormstayed   the weather was not the only thing that troubled vane as he stumbled on through the mist any unathletic tourist from the cities could have gone up without much difficulty by the way they had ascended but it was different coming down on the opposite side of the mountain there their route laid across banks of sharppointed stones that rested lightly on the steep slope interspersed with outcropping rocks which were growing dangerously slippery and a wilderness of crags pierced by three great radiating chasms lay beneath  after half an hours arduous scramble he decided that they must be close upon the top of the last rift and stood still for a minute looking about him the mist was now so thick that he could scarcely see thirty yards ahead but the way it drove past him indicated that it was blowing up a hollow on one hand a rampart of hillside loomed dimly out of it in front there was a dark patch that looked like the face of a dripping rock and between the latter and the hill a boggy stretch of grass ran back into the vapour then he turned and glanced at evelyn with some concern her skirt was heavy with moisture and the rain dripped from the brim of her hat but she smiled at him reassuringly  its not the first time ive got wet she said  vane felt relieved on one account he had imagined that a woman hated to feel draggled and untidy and he was willing to own that in his case fatigue usually tended towards shortness of temper though the scramble had scarcely taxed his powers he fancied that evelyn had already done as much as one could expect of her  i must prospect about a bit he said scardales somewhere below us but if i remember its an awkward descent to the head of it and im not sure of the right entrance to the hause  ive only once been down this way and that was a long while ago evelyn replied  vane left her and plodded away across the grass when he had grown scarcely distinguishable in the haze he turned and waved his hand  i know where we are the head of the becks close by he cried  evelyn joined him at the edge of a trickle of water splashing in a peaty hollow and they followed it down seeing only odd strips of hillside amidst the vapour until at length the ground grew softer and vane going first sank among the long green moss almost to his knees  that wont do stand still please he said ill try a little to the right  he tried in one or two directions but wherever he went he sank over his boots and coming back he informed his companion that they had better go straight ahead  i know theres no bog worth speaking of the hause is a regular tourist track he added and suddenly stripped off his jacket first of all youll put this on im sorry i didnt think of it before  evelyn demurred and he rolled up the jacket you have to choose between doing what i ask and watching me pitch it into the beck he declared im a rather determined person and it would be a pity to throw the thing away particularly as the rain hasnt got through it yet  she yielded and after he had held up the garment while she put it on he spoke again  theres another thing im going to carry you for the next hundred yards or possibly farther  no said evelyn firmly on that point my determination is as strong as yours  vane made a sign of acquiescence you can have your way for a minute i expect it will be long enough  he was correct evelyn moved forward a pace or two and then stopped with the skirt she had gathered up brushing the quivering emerald moss and her boots which were high ones hidden in the latter she had some difficulty in pulling them out then vane coolly picked her up  all you have to do is to keep still for the next few minutes he informed her in a most matteroffact voice  evelyn did not move though had he shown any sign of selfconscious hesitation she would at once have shaken herself loose he was conscious of a thrill and a certain stirring of his blood but this he decided must be sternly ignored and his task occupied most of his attention it was not an easy one and he stumbled once or twice but he accomplished it and set the girl down safely on firmer ground  now he said theres only the drop to the dale but we must endeavour to keep out of the beck  his voice and air were unembarrassed though he was breathless and evelyn fancied that in this and the incident of the jacket he had revealed the forceful natural manners of the west it was the first glimpse she had had of them though she had watched for one and she was not displeased the man had merely done what was most advisable with practical sense  a little farther on a shoot of falling water swept out of the mist above and came splashing down a crag spread out in frothing threads it flowed across their path reunited in a deep gully which they sprang across and then fell tumultuously into the beck which was now ten or twelve feet below on one side of them they clung to the rock as they traced it downwards stepping cautiously from ledge to ledge at times a stone plunged into the mist beneath them and vane grasped the girls arm or held out a steadying hand but he was never fussy or needlessly concerned when she wanted help it was offered at the right moment but that was all and she thought that had she been alarmed which was not the case her companions manner would have been more comforting than persistent solicitude he was she decided one who could be relied upon in an emergency  though caution was still necessary the next stage of the journey was easier and by and by they reached a winding dale they followed it downwards splashing through water part of the time and at length came into sight of a cluster of little houses standing between a river and a big fir wood  it must be getting on towards evening said evelyn mopsy and carroll probably went down the ridge and as it runs out lower down the valley theyll be almost at home  its six oclock said vane glancing at his watch you cant walk home in the rain and its a long while since lunch if adam bell and his wife are still at the golden fleece well get something to eat there and borrow you dry clothes hell drive us home afterwards  evelyn made no objections she was very wet and beginning to feel weary and they were some distance from home she restored him his jacket and a few minutes later they entered an old hostelry which like many others among these hills was a farm as well as an inn the landlady who recognised vane with pleased surprise took evelyn away with her and afterwards provided vane with some of her husbands clothes then she lighted a fire and when she had laid out a meal in the guestroom evelyn came in attired in a dress of lilac print  its maggie bells she explained demurely her mothers things were rather large adam is away at a sheep auction and they have only the trap he went in but they expect him back in an hour or so  then we must wait said vane worse misfortunes have befallen me  they made an excellent meal and then vane drew up a wicker chair to the fire for evelyn and sat down opposite to her outside the rain dripped from the mossy flagstone eaves and the song of the river stole in monotonous cadence into the room  evelyn was silent and vane said nothing for a while he had been in the air all day and though this was nothing new to him he was content to sit lazily still and leave the opening of conversation to his companion in the meanwhile it was pleasant to glance towards her now and then the paletinted dress became her and he felt that the room would have looked less cheerful had she been away  the effect she had on him was difficult to analyse though he lazily tried she appealed to him by the grace of her carriage the poise of her head her delicate colouring and the changing lights in her eyes but behind these points something stronger and deeper was expressed through them he fancied she possessed qualities he had not hitherto encountered which would become more precious when they were fully understood he thought of her as wholesome in mind one who sought for the best but she was also endowed with an ethereal something that could not be defined  then a simile struck him she was like the snow that towers high into the empyrean in british columbia in which he was wrong for there was warm human passion in the girl though it was sleeping yet by and by he told himself he was getting absurdly sentimental and he instinctively fumbled for his pipe and stopped evelyn noticed this and smiled  you neednt hesitate she said the dene is redolent of cigars and gerald smokes everywhere when he is at home  is he likely to turn up vane asked its ever so long since ive seen him  im afraid not in fact geralds rather under a cloud just now i may as well tell you this because you are sure to hear of it sooner or later he has been extravagant and as he assures us extraordinarily unlucky  stocks and shares suggested vane who was acquainted with some of the family tendencies  evelyn hesitated a moment that would have been more readily forgiven him i believe he has speculated on the turf as well  vane was surprised since he understood that gerald chisholm was a barrister and betting on the turf was not an amusement he would have associated with that profession  then he said thoughtfully i must run up and see him later on  evelyn felt sorry she had spoken gerald needed help which his father was not in a position to offer she was not censorious of other peoples faults but it was impossible to be blind to some aspects of her brothers character and she would have preferred that vane should not meet gerald while the latter was embarrassed by financial difficulties she changed the subject  several of the things you told me about your life in canada interested me she said it must have been bracing to feel that you depended upon your own efforts and stood on your own feet free from all the hampering customs that are common here  the position has its disadvantages you have no family influence behind you nothing to fall back upon if you cant make good your footing you must go down its curious that just before i came over here a lady i met in vancouver expressed an opinion very like yours she said it must be pleasant to feel that one was to some extent at least master of ones fate  then she merely explained my meaning more clearly than i have done  one could have imagined that she has everything she could reasonably wish for if im not transgressing so have you its strange you should both harbour the same idea  i dont think its uncommon among young women nowadays theres a grandeur in the thought that ones fate lies in the hands of the high unseen powers but to allow ones life to be moulded byones neighbours prejudices and preconceptions is a different matter besides if unrest and human striving were sent was it only that they should be repressed  vane sat silent a moment or two he had noticed the brief pause and fancied that she had changed one of the words that followed it he did not think it was her neighbours opinions she most chafed against  its not a point ive been concerned about he replied at length in a general way i did what i wanted  which is a privilege that is denied to us evelyn spoke without bitterness and added a moment later what do women who are left to their own resources do in western canada  some of them marry i suppose thats the most natural thing said vane with an air of reflection that amused her anyway they have plenty of opportunities theres a preponderating number of unattached young men in the newlyopened parts of the dominion  things are different here or perhaps we want more than they do across the atlantic said evelyn what becomes of the others  they wait in the hotels learn stenography and typewriting and go into offices and stores  and earn just enough to live upon meagrely if their wages are high they must pay out more that follows doesnt it  to some extent  is there nothing better open to them  no said vane thoughtfully not unless theyre trained for it and become specialised that implies peculiar abilities and a systematic education with one end in view you cant enter the arena to fight for the higher prizes unless youre properly armed the easiest way for a woman to acquire power and influence is by a judicious marriage no doubt its the same here  it is replied evelyn smiling a man is more fortunately situated  i suppose he is if hes poor hes rather walled in too but he breaks through now and then in the newer countries he gets an opportunity  vane abstractedly examined his pipe which he had not lighted yet it was clear that the girl was dissatisfied with her surroundings and had for some reason temporarily relaxed the restraint she generally laid upon herself but he felt that if she were wise she would force herself to be content she was of too fine a fibre to plunge into the struggle that many women had to wage and though he did not doubt her courage she had not been trained for it he had noticed that among men it was the cruder and less developed organisations that proved hardiest in adverse situations one needed a strain of primitive vigour there was it seemed only one means of release for her and that was a happy marriage but a marriage could not be happy unless the suitor was all that she desired and evelyn would be fastidious though her family would no doubt only look for wealth and station he imagined that this was where the trouble lay he would wait and keep his eyes open shortly after he arrived at this decision there was a rattle of wheels outside and the landlord who came in greeted him with rude cordiality in another minute or two vane handed evelyn into the gig and bill drove them home through the rain     chapter viii  lucy vane   bright sunshine streamed down out of a cloudless sky when vane stood talking with his sister upon the terrace in front of the dene one afternoon shortly after his ascent of the pike in evelyns company he leaned against the low wall frowning for lucy had hitherto avoided a discussion of the subject which occupied their attention and now as he would have said he could not make her listen to reason  she stood in front of him with the point of her parasol pressed firmly into the gravel and her lips set though there was a smile which suggested forbearance in her eyes lucy was tall and spare of figure a year younger than her brother and of somewhat determined character she earned her living in a northern manufacturing town by lecturing on domestic economy for the public authorities vane understood that she also took part in suffrage propaganda she had a thin forceful face which was seldom characterised by repose  after all vane broke out what ive been urging is a very natural thing i dont like to think of your being forced to work as you are doing and ive tried to show that it wouldnt cost me any selfdenial to make you an allowance theres no reason why you should be at the beck and call of those committees any longer  lucys smile grew plainer i dont think that describes my position very accurately  its possible vane agreed with a trace of dryness no doubt you insist on the chairman or lady president giving way to you but that doesnt affect the question you have to work anyway  but i like it and it keeps me in some degree of comfort  the man turned half impatiently and glanced about him the front of the old grey house was flooded with light and the lawn below the terrace glowed luminously green the shadows of the hollies and cypresses were thin and unsubstantial but where a beach overarched the grass evelyn and mrs chisholm attired in light draperies reclined in basket chairs carroll who wore thin grey tweed stood close by talking to mabel and chisholm sat a little apart upon a bench with a newspaper in his hand he looked half asleep and a languorous stillness pervaded the whole scene  wouldnt you like this kind of thing as well he asked of course i mean what it impliesthe power to take life easily and get as much enjoyment as possible out of it it wouldnt be difficult if you would only take what id be glad to give you he indicated the languid figures in the foreground you could for instance spend your time among folks like these and after all its what you were meant to do  well said lucy i believe im more at home with the other kind of folksthose in poverty squalor and ignorance ive an idea theyve a stronger claim on me but thats not a point i can urge the fact is ive chosen my career and there are practical reasons why i shouldnt abandon it i had a good deal of trouble in getting a footing and if i fell out now it would be harder still to take my place in the ranks again  but you wouldnt require to do so  i cant be sure i dont want to hurt you but after all your success was sudden and one understands that it isnt wise to depend upon an income derived from mining properties  none of you ever did believe in me  i suppose theres some truth in that you really did give us some trouble somehow you were differentyou wouldnt fit inthough i believe the same thing applied to me for that matter  and now you dont expect my prosperity to last  the girl hesitated but she was candid by nature perhaps i had better answer you have it in you to work determinedly and when its necessary to do things that men with less courage would shrink from but i doubt if yours is the temperament that leads to success you havent the hucksters instincts youre not coldblooded enough you wouldnt cajole your friends or truckle to your enemies  if i adopted the latter course it would be very much against the grain vane confessed  lucy laughed well she said i mean to go on earning my living but you can take me up to london for a few days and buy me some hats and things then i dont mind you giving something to the emancipation society  i dont know if i believe in emancipation or not but you can have ten guineas  thank you said lucy glancing round towards carroll who was approaching them with mabel ill give you a piece of advicestick to that man hes cooler and less headstrong than you are hell prove a useful friend  carroll came up just then what are you two talking about he asked you look animated  wallace has just promised me ten guineas to assist the movement for the emancipation of women lucy answered pointedly i may mention that our societys efforts are sadly restricted by the lack of funds  hes now and then a little inconsequential in his generosity carroll rejoined i didnt know he was interested in that kind of thing but as i dont like to be outdone by my partner ill subscribe the same  thanks said lucy who made an entry in a pocketbook in a businesslike manner  they strolled along the terrace together and as they went down the steps to the lawn carroll inquired with a smile have you tackled chisholm yet  i would have done so had it appeared likely to have been of any use but i never waste powder and shot lucy replied a man of his restricted views would sooner subscribe handsomely to put us down  carroll turned to his comrade are you regretting the ten guineas you dont look pleased  no said vane the fact is i wanted to do something which wasnt allowed ive met with the same disillusionment here as i did in british columbia  lucy looked up at her brother did you attempt to give somebody money there  i did said vane shortly its not worth discussing and anyway she wouldnt listen to me  they strolled on vane frowning while carroll who had seen signs of suppressed interest in lucys face smiled unobserved neither he nor the others had noticed mabel who was following them  they joined the rest and some time afterwards mrs chisholm addressed carroll who was lying back in a deep chair with his eyes which were half closed turned in lucys direction  are you asleep or thinking hard she asked  not more than half asleep carroll protested i was trying to remember a dream of fair women it struck me as a suitable occupation for a drowsy summer afternoon in a place like this but i must confess that it was miss vane who put it into my head she reminded me of one or two of the heroines not long ago when she was championing the cause of the suffragist  you mustnt imagine that english women in general sympathise with her or that such ideas are popular at the dene mrs chisholm rejoined  carroll smiled reassuringly i wouldnt have imagined the latter for a moment but as i said on an afternoon of this kind one can be excused for indulging in romantic fancies and dont you see what brought those oldtime heroines into my mindi mean the elusive resemblance to their latterday prototype  mrs chisholm looked puzzled no she declared one of them was greek another early english and the finest of all was the hebrew maid as they couldnt even have been like one another how could they have collectively borne a resemblance to anybody else  thats logical on the surface to digress why do you most admire jephthahs daughter the gentle gileadite  his hostess affected surprise isnt it evident when one remembers her patient sacrifice her fine sense of family honour  carroll felt that this was much the kind of sentiment one could have expected from her and he did her justice in believing that it was genuine and that she was capable of acting up to her convictions his glance rested on vane for a moment and the latter was startled as he guessed his comrades thought  evelyn sat near him reclining languidly in a wicker chair she had been silent and now her face was in repose the signs of reserve and repression were plainer than ever there was however pride in it and he felt that she was endowed with a keener and finer sense of family honour than her mother her brothers career was threatened by the results of his own imprudence and though her father could hardly be compared with the gileadite warrior there was vane imagined a disturbing similarity between the two cases it was unpleasant to contemplate the possibility of this girls being called upon to bear the cost of her relations misfortunes or follies carroll however looked across at lucy with a smile  you dont agree with mrs chisholm he suggested  no said lucy firmly leaving the instance in question out there are too many people who transgress and then expect somebody elsea woman as a ruleto serve as a sacrifice  i dont agree either mabel broke in id sooner have been cleopatra or joan or arconly she was burned poor thing  that was only what she might have expected an unpleasant fate generally overtakes people who go about disturbing things mrs chisholm said severely  the speech was characteristic and the others smiled it would have astonished them had mrs chisholm sympathised with the rebel idealist whose beckoning visions led to the clash of arms then vane turned to his comrade  arent you getting off the track he asked i dont see the drift of your previous remarks  well said carroll with an air of reflection there must be i think a certain distinctive stamp upon those who belong to the leader type i mean the folks who are capable of doing striking and heroic things apart from this ive been studying you englishand it has struck me that theres occasionally something imperious or rather imperial in the faces of your women in the most northern counties i cant define the thing but its therein the line of nose the mouth and i think most marked in the brows its not saxon or norse or danish id sooner call it roman  vane was slightly astonished he had seen that look in evelyns face and now for the first time he recognised it in his sisters  i wonder if you have hit it he said with a laugh you can reach the wall from here in a days ride  the wall  the roman wall hadrians wall i believe one authority states they had a garrison of 100000 men to keep it  chisholm joined the group he was a tall rather floridfaced man with a formal manner dressed immaculately in creaseless clothes  the point carroll raises is interesting he remarked while i dont know how long it takes for a strain to die out there must have been a large civil population living near the wall and we know that the characteristics of the teutonic peoples who followed the romans still remain  nobody else had any comment to make and when by and by the group broke up evelyn was left alone for a few minutes with mabel  gerald should have been sent to canada instead of oxford she said then he might have got as rich as wallace vane and mr carroll  what makes you think theyre rich evelyn asked with reproof in her tone  oh said mabel we all knew they were rich before they came and they were giving lucy guineas for the suffragists an hour ago they must have a good deal of money to waste it like that besides i think wallace wanted her to take some more and he seemed quite vexed when he said hed tried to give money to somebody else in canada who wouldnt have it as he saidsheit must have been a womanbut i dont think he meant to mention that it slipped out  you had no right to listen evelyn retorted severely but the information sank into her mind and she afterwards remembered it     chapter ix  chisholm proves amenable   vane spent a month at the dene with quiet satisfaction and when at last he left for london and paris he gladly promised to come back for another few weeks before he sailed for canada he stayed some time in paris because carroll insisted on it but it was with eagerness he went north again for one reasonand he laid some stress upon thishe longed for the moorland air and the rugged fells though he also admitted that evelyns society enhanced their charm for him  at last shortly before setting out on the journey he took himself to task and endeavoured to determine what his feelings towards her were but he signally failed to elucidate the point it was only clear that he was more contented in her presence and that apart from her physical comeliness she had a stimulating effect upon his mental faculties although so far as he could remember she seldom said anything remarkable then he wondered how she regarded him and to this question he could find no answer for the most part there was a reserve he found more piquant than deterrent about her and he was conscious that while willing to talk with him freely she was still holding him off at arms length  on the whole he could not be absolutely sure that he desired to get much nearer though he failed to admit this clearly his attitude was largely one of respectful admiration with a vein of compassion in it evelyn was unhappy and out of harmony with her relatives which he could understand more readily because their ideas often jarred on him  he had been back at the dene a fortnight when one morning he walked out of the hamlet where the wheelwrights shop was with a telegram in his hand sitting down on the wall of a bridge close by he turned to carroll who had accompanied him  i think you have nairns code in your wallet he said well decipher the thing  carroll laid the message upon a smooth stone and set to work with a pencil  situation highly satisfactory he read aloud and commented it must be if nairn paid for another word highlys not in the code then he went on with the deciphering result of reduction exceeds anticipations stock 30 premium your presence not immediately required  thats distinctly encouraging said vane now theyre getting farther in the ore must be carrying more silver  its fortunate i ran through the bank account last night and you have spent a lot of money it confirms my opinion that you have expensive friends  vane frowned at this but carroll continued undeterred you want pulling up after the way you have been indulging in a reckless extravagance which i feel compelled to point out is new to you the cheque drawn in favour of gerald chisholm rather astonished me have you said anything about it to his relatives  i havent vane answered shortly  then judging by the little i saw of him i should consider it most unlikely that he has made any allusion to the matter the next cheque was more surprising i mean the one you gave his father  they were both loans  have you any expectation of getting the money back  what has that to do with you  carroll spread out his hands only thisi think you need looking after we cant stay here indefinitely hadnt you better get back to vancouver before your english friends ruin you  ill go in three or four weeks not before  carroll sat silent a minute or two and then he looked his companion squarely in the face  is it your intention to marry evelyn chisholm  i dont know what has put that into your mind  i should be astonished if it hadnt suggested itself to her family carroll retorted  im far from sure its an idea theyd entertain with any great favour for one thing i cant live here  try them and see show them nairns telegram when you mention the matter  vane swung himself down from the wall  its very possible that i may do so he informed his comrade but well get along  his heart beat more rapidly than usual as they turned back towards the house but he was perfectly composed when some little time later he sat down beside chisholm who was lounging away the morning on the lawn  ive been across to the village for a telegram i expected he announced the news is encouraging  he read it to chisholm who had determined on the line he meant to follow  youre a fortunate man he said theres probably no reasonable wish that you cant gratify  there are things one cant buy with dollars vane replied  that is very true theyre often the most valuable on the other hand some of them may now and then be had for the asking besides when one has a sanguine temperament its difficult to believe that anything one sets ones heart upon is quite unattainable  vane wondered if he had been given a hint chisholms manner was suggestive and carrolls remarks had had an effect on him he sat silent and chisholm spoke again if i were in your place i should feel i had all i could desire within my reach  vane was becoming sure that his comrade had been right chisholm would not have harped upon the same idea unless he had intended to convey some particular meaning but the mans methods roused vanes dislike he could face opposition and he would sooner have been discouraged than judiciously prompted  then if i offered myself as a suitor for evelyn you would not think me presumptuous he said  chisholm was somewhat surprised at his abruptness but he smiled reassuringly  no he said i cant see why i should do so you are in a position to maintain a wife in comfort and i dont think anybody could take exception to your character he paused a moment i suppose you have some idea of how evelyn regards you  i havent the faintest notion vane confessed thats the trouble  would you like me to mention the matter  no said vane decidedly in fact i must ask you not to do anything of the kind i only wished to make sure of your good will and now im satisfied on that point id sooner wait and speakwhen it seems judicious  chisholm nodded yes he said indulgently i dare say that would be wisest  vane who thanked him waited he fancied that the transaction which seemed the best name for it was not complete yet but he meant to leave what should follow to his companion he would not help the man  theres a matter which had better be mentioned now distasteful as it is chisholm said at length i can settle nothing upon evelyn as you must have guessed my affairs are in a far from promising state indeed im afraid i may have to ask your indulgence when the loan falls due and i dont mind confessing that the prospect of evelyns making what i think is a suitable marriage is a relief to me  vanes feelings were somewhat mixed but contempt figured prominently among them he could find no fault with chisholms desire to safeguard his daughters future but he was convinced that the man looked for more than this he felt he had been favoured with a delicate hint to which his companion expected an answer  well he said curtly you need not be concerned about the loan to go a little farther i should naturally take an interest in the welfare of my wifes relatives i dont think i can say anything more in the meanwhile  he knew that he might have spoken more plainly without offence when he saw chisholms smile but the latter looked satisfied  those are the views i expected you to hold he declared i believe mrs chisholm will share my gratification if you find evelyn disposed to listen to you  vane left him shortly afterwards with a sense of shame he felt he had bought the girl and that if she ever heard of it she would find it hard to forgive him for the course he had taken by and by he met carroll who looked at him inquiringly  ive had a talk with chisholm said vane it has upset my temperi feel mean theres no doubt that you were right  carroll smiled and showed that he could guess what was in his comrades mind i wouldnt worry too much about the thing he replied the girl probably understands the situation its not pleasant but i expect shes more or less resigned to it she cant help herself  vane gazed at him with anger does that make it any better is it any comfort to me  take her out of it if she has any liking for you shell thank you for doing so afterwards  vane who made no answer strode away and nobody saw any more of him for an hour or two  he had her fathers consent but he felt he could not plead his cause with evelyn just then with her parents on his side she was at a disadvantage and he shrank from the thought that she might be forced upon him against her will this was not what he desired and she might hate him for it afterwards she was very alluring there had been signs of an unusual gentleness in her manner but he wanted time to win her favour aided only by such gifts as he had been endowed with it cost him a determined effort but he made up his mind to wait     chapter x  with the otter hounds   a week or two had slipped away since vanes eventful interview when he lounged upon the terrace after breakfast chatting with carroll  suddenly a long faint howl came up the valley and was answered by another in a deeper note then a confused swelling clamour which slightly resembled the sound of chiming bells broke out softened by the distance carroll stopped and listened  what in the name of wonder is that he asked the first of it reminded me of a coyote howling but the rests more like the noise the timber wolves make in the bush at night  you havent made a bad shot vane laughed its a pack of otter hounds hot upon the scent  the sound ceased as suddenly as it had begun but a few moments later mabel came running towards the men  i knew the hounds met at patten brig but jim was sure theyd go downstream she cried breathlessly theyre coming up and i think theyre at the pool below the village get two polesyoull find some in the toolshedand come along at once  she clambered into the house through a window calling for evelyn and carroll smiled  we have our orders he remarked i suppose wed better go  its one of the popular sports up here said vane you may as well see it  they set out a few minutes later accompanied by evelyn while mabel hurried on in front and reproached them for their tardiness  at length after crossing several wet fields they came into a rushy meadow on the edge of the river which spread out into a wide pool fringed with alders which had not yet lost their leaves and the barer withes of osiers there was a swift stream at the head of it and a long rippling shallow at the tail and a very mixed company was scattered along the bank and in the water  a redcoated man with whip and horn stood in the tail outflow and three or four more with poles in their hands were spread out across the stream behind him these and one or two in the head stream appeared by their dress to belong to the hunt but the rest among whom were a few women were attired in everyday garments and of different walks in life artisans labourers people of leisure and a belated tourist or two  three or four big hounds were swimming aimlessly up and down the pool a dozen more or thereabouts trotted to and fro along the waters edge stopping to sniff and give tongue in an uncertain manner now and then but there was no sign of an otter  carroll looked round with a smile when his companions stopped therell be very little work done in this neighbourhood today he said id no idea there were so many folks in the valley with time to spare the only thing thats missing is the beast theyre after  an otter is an almost invisible creature evelyn explained you very seldom see one unless its hard pressed by the dogs there are a good many in the river but even the trout fishers who are about at sunrise in the hot weather and wade in the dusk rarely come across them are you going to take a share in the hunt  no replied carroll glancing humorously at his pole i dont know what i brought this thing for unless it was because mopsy sent me for it id sooner stay and watch with you splashing through a river after a little beast which i dont suppose theyd let an outsider kill doesnt interest me and i dont see why i should want to kill it anyway some of you english people have sporting ideas i cant understand i struck a young man the other daya welleducated man by the look of himwho was spending the afternoon happily with a ferret by a corn stack killing rats with a club he seemed uncommonly pleased with himself because hed got four of them  oh exclaimed mabel youre as bad as the silly people who call killing things cruelty i wouldnt have thought it of you  ive seen him said vane drop a deer going almost as fast as a locomotive through thick brush with a singleshot rifle and i believe he once assisted in killing a panther in a thicket you couldnt see two yards ahead in the point is that he meant to eat the deer and the panther had been taking a ranchers hogs  then im sorry i brought him said mabel decidedly hes not a sportsman  i really think theres some excuse for the more vigorous sports evelyn declared of course you cant eliminate a certain amount of cruelty but admitting that isnt it just as well that men who live in a luxurious civilisation should be willing to plod through miles of heather after grouse risk their limbs on horseback or spend hours in cold water these are bracing things they imply moral discipline it cant be nice to ride at a dangerous fence or flounder down a rapid after an otter when youre stiff with cold the effort to do so must be wholesome  a sure thing carroll agreed the only drawback is that when youve got your fox or otter it isnt worth anything a good many of the folks in the newer lands have to make something of the kind of effort you described every day in their case the results are waggontrails valleys cleared for orchards new branch railroads i suppose its a matter of opinion but if id put in a seasons risky work id sooner have a piece of land to grow fruit on or a share in a mineral claimyou get plenty of excitement in prospectingthan a foxs tail but there are people in canada who wouldnt agree with me  he strolled along the waters edge with evelyn and presently looked round  mopsys gone and i dont see vane he said  after all hes one of us if youre born in the north country its hard to keep out of the river when you hear the otter hounds  they took up their station behind a growth of alders and for a while the dogs went trotting by in twos and threes or swam about the pool but nothing else broke the surface of the leadencoloured water then there was a cry an outbreak of shouting a confused baying and half a dozen hounds dashed past evelyn stretched out her hand  look she said  carroll saw a small grey spotthe top of the otters headmoving across the slacker part of the pool with a very slight wedgeshaped ripple trailing away from it it sank next moment a bubble or two rose and then there was nothing but the smooth flow of water  a horn called shrilly a few whipcracks rang out like pistol shots and the dogs took to the water swimming slowly here and there men scrambled along the bank and while some entering the river reinforced the line spread out across the head rapid others joined the second row wading steadily upstream and splashed about as they advanced with irontipped poles nothing rewarded their efforts the dogs turned and went downstream and then suddenly everybody ran or waded towards the tall outflow a clamour of shouting and baying broke out and floundering men and swimming dogs went down the stream together in a confused mass then there was silence and the hounds came out and trotted to and fro along the bank up which dripping men clambered after them evelyn laughed as she pointed to vane who looked wetter than most among the leading group  i dont suppose he meant to go in its in the blood she said  theres no reason why he shouldnt if it amuses him carroll replied  a little later the dogs were driven in again and this time the whole of the otters head was visible as it swam upstream the animal was flagging and on reaching shoaler water it sprang out altogether now and then rising and falling in the stronger stream with a curious serpentine motion in fact as head and body bent in the same sinuous curves it looked less like an animal than a plunging fish the men guarding the rapid stood ready with their poles and more were wading and splashing up both sides of the pool the otters pace was getting slower sometimes it seemed to stop and now and then it vanished among the ripples carroll saw that evelyns face was intent though there were signs of shrinking in it  now he said ill tell you what you are thinkingyou want that poor little beast to get away  i believe i do evelyn confessed  they watched with strained attention the girl could not help it though she dreaded the climax her sympathies were now with the hard pressed exhausted creature that was making a desperate fight for life the pursuers were close behind it the swimming dogs leading them and ahead lay a foaming rush of water which did not seem more than a foot deep with men spread out across it the shouting from the bank had ceased and everybody waited in tense expectancy when the otter disappeared  the dogs reached the rapid where they were washed back a few yards before they could make head upstream men who came splashing close upon their tails left the river to scramble along its edge and then stopped abruptly while the dogs swam in an uncertain manner about the still reach beyond they came out in a few minutes and scampered up and down among the stones evidently at fault for there was no sign of the otter anywhere the hunted creature had crept up the rush of water among the feet of those who watched for it and vanished unseen into the sheltering depths beyond  evelyn sighed with relief i think it will escape she said the rivers rather full after the rain which is against the dogs and there isnt another shallow for some distance shall we go on  they strolled forward behind the dogs which were again moving upstream but they turned aside to avoid a wood and it was some time later when they came out upon a rocky promontory dropping steeply to the river the hunt was now widely scattered about the reach men crept along slippery ledges above the water and moved over steeplyslanting slopes half hidden among the trees  a few were in the river and three or four of the dogs were swimming the rest spread out in twos and threes trotted to and fro among the undergrowth carroll did not think they were following any scent but a figure creeping along the foot of the rock not far away presently seized his attention  its mopsy he said the foothold doesnt look very safe among those stones and there seems to be deep water below  he called out in warning but the girl did not heed the willows were thinner at the spot she had reached and squeezing herself through them she leaned down clinging to an alder branch  hes gone to holt among the roots she cried  three or four men came running along the opposite bank and apparently decided that she was right for the horn was sounded and here and there a dog broke through the underbrush then just as the firstcomers reached the rapid there was a splash it was a moment or two before evelyn or carroll who had been watching the dogs realised what had happened and then the blood ebbed from the girls face mabel had disappeared  running a few paces forward carroll saw what looked like a bundle of spreadout garments swing round in an eddy it washed in among the willows and he heard a faint cry  somebody help me quick ive caught a branch  he could not see the girl now but an alder bough was bending sharply and he flung a rapid glance around him the summit of the rock he stood upon rose above the trees and though he would have faced the risky fall had there been a better landing it seemed impossible to alight among the stones without a broken leg further downstream he might reach the water by a reckless jump because the promontory sloped towards it there but he would not be able to swim back against the current his position was a painful one it looked as if there was nothing that he could do  next moment men and dogs went scrambling and swimming down the rapid but they were in hot pursuit of the otter which had left its hidingplace and it was evident that the girl had escaped their attention carroll shouted savagely as his comrade appeared among the tail of the hunt below the others were too occupied to heed or perhaps concluded that he was urging them on but vane who was in the water seemed to understand in another few minutes he was swimming down the pool along the edge of the alders then carroll saw that evelyn expected him to take some part in the rescue  get down before its too late she cried  carroll spread out his hands as if to beg her forbearance and while every impulse urged him to the leap he endeavoured to keep his head  i cant do any good just now he answered knowing he was right and yet feeling horribly ashamed shes holding on and wallace will reach her in a moment or two  evelyn broke out on him in an agony of fear and anger you coward she cried will you let her drown  she turned and ran forward but carroll dreading that she meant to attempt the descent seized her shoulder and held her fast while he grappled with her vanes voice rose from below and he let his hands drop  wallace has her theres no more danger he said  evelyn suddenly recovered some degree of calm  standing breathless a pace or two apart they saw vane and the girl appear from beneath the willows and wash away downstream the man was swimming but he was hampered by his burden and once he and mabel sank almost from sight in a whirling eddy carroll said nothing but he turned and ran along the sloping ridge until where the fall was less and the trees were thinner he leaped out into the air he broke through the alders amidst a rustle of bending boughs and disappeared but a moment later his head rose out of the water close beside vane and the two men went downstream with mabel between them  evelyn scrambled wildly along the ridge and when she reached the foot of it vane was helping mabel up the sloping bank of gravel the girls drenched garments clung about her her wet hair was streaked across her face but she seemed able to stand and she was speaking in jerky gasps the hunt had swept on through shoaler water but there was a cheer from the stragglers across the river evelyn clutched her sister half laughing half sobbing and incoherently upbraided her mabel shook herself free and her first remark was characteristic  oh she said dont make a silly fuss then she tried to shake out her dripping skirt im only wet through wallace take me home  vane picked her up which was what she seemed to expect and the others followed when he pushed through the underbush towards a neighbouring meadow evelyn however was still a little unnerved and when they reached a gap in a wall she stopped and leaning against the stones turned to carroll  i think im more disturbed than mopsy is she said what i felt must be some excuse for me im sorry for what i said it was unjustifiable  anyway it was perfectly natural but i must confess that i felt some temptation to make a fool of myself i might have jumped into those alders but its most unlikely that i could have got out of them  evelyn looked at him with a faint respect she had not troubled to point out that he had not flinched from the leap when it seemed likely to be of service  how had you the sense to think of that she asked  i suppose its a matter of practice carroll answered with amusement one cant work among the ranges and rivers without learning to make the right decision rapidly when you dont you get badly hurt the thing has to be cultivated its not instinctive  evelyn was struck by the explanation this acquired coolness was a finer thing and undoubtedly more useful than hotheaded gallantry though she admired the latter  wallace was splendid in the water she broke out uttering part of her thoughts aloud  i thought rather more of him in the city carroll replied that kind of thing was new to him and im inclined to believe id have let the folks he had to negotiate with have the mine for a good deal less than what he eventually got for it but ive said something about that before and after all im not here to play boswell  the girl was surprised at the apt allusion it was not what she would have expected from the man since she had not recovered her composure she forgot what vane had told her about him and her comment was an incautious one how did you hear of him  carroll parried this with a smile  oh he said you dont suppose you can keep those old fellows to yourselvestheyre international but hadnt we better be getting on let me help you through the gap  they reached the dene some time later and mabel very much against her wishes was sent to bed while shortly afterwards carroll came across vane who had changed his clothes strolling up and down among the shrubberies  what are you doing here he asked  vane looked embarrassed for one thing im keeping out of mrs chisholms way shes inclined to be effusive for another im trying to decide what i ought to do well have to pull out very shortly and i had meant to have had an interview with evelyn today thats why i feel uncommonly annoyed with mopsy for falling in  carroll made a grimace if thats how it strikes you any advice i could offer would be wasted a sensible man would consider it a promising opportunity  and trade upon it  do you really want the girl  that impressions firmly in my mind said vane curtly  then you had better pitch your quixotic notions overboard and tell her so  vane made no answer and carroll seeing that his comrade was not inclined to be communicative left him     chapter xi  vane withdraws   dusk was drawing on when vane strolled along the terrace in front of the dene  he was preoccupied and eager but fully aware of the need for coolness because it was very possible that he might fail in the task he had in hand by and by he saw evelyn whom he had been waiting for cross the opposite end of the terrace and moving forward he joined her at the entrance to a shrubbery walk a big clipped yew with a recess in which a seat had been placed stood close by  ive been sitting with mopsy said evelyn she seems very little the worse for her adventurethanks to you she hesitated and her voice grew softer i owe you a heavy debti am very fond of mopsy  its a great pity she fell in vane declared  evelyn looked at him with surprise she scarcely thought he could regret the efforts he had made on her sisters behalf but that was what his words implied  the trouble is that the thing might seem to give me some claim on you and i dont want that he explained it cost me no more than a wetting i hadnt the least difficulty in getting her out  his companion was still puzzled she could find no fault with him for being modest about his exploit but that he should make it clear that he did not require her gratitude seemed to her unnecessary  for all that you did bring her out she persisted  i dont seem to be beginning very fortunately vane replied what i mean is that i dont want to urge my claim if i have one id sooner be taken on my merits he paused a moment with a smile thats not much better is it but it partly expresses what i feel leaving mopsy out altogether let me try to explaini dont wish you to be influenced by anything except your own idea of me im saying this because one or two points that seem in my favour may have a contrary effect  evelyn made no answer and he indicated the seat wont you sit down i have something more to say  the girl did as he suggested and his smile faded now he went on you wont be astonished if i ask if you will marry me  he stood looking down on her with an impressive steadiness of gaze she could imagine him facing the city men from whom he had extorted the full value of his mine in the same fashion and in a later instance so surveying the eddies beneath the osiers when he had gone to mabels rescue she felt that they had better understand one another  no she said if i must be candid i am not astonished then the colour crept into her cheeks is she met his gaze i suppose it is an honour and it is undoubtedly atemptation  a temptation  yes said evelyn mustering her courage to face a crisis she had dreaded it is only due to you that you should hear the truththough i think you suspect it i have some liking for you  that is what i wanted you to own vane broke in  she checked him with a gesture her manner was cold and yet there was something in it that stirred him more than her beauty  after all she answered it does not go very far and you must try to understand i want to be quite honest and what i have to say isdifficult in the first place things are far from pleasant for me here i was expected to make a good marriage and i had my chance in london i refused to profit by it and now im a failure i wonder if you can realise what a temptation it is to get away  yes he said it makes me savage to think of it i can at least take you out of all this if you hadnt had a very fine courage you wouldnt have told me  evelyn smiled a curious wry smile  it has only prompted me to behave as most people would consider shamelessly but there are times when one must get above that point of view besides theres a reason for my candour had you been a man of different stamp its possible that i might have been driven into taking the risk we should both have suffered for a time but through open variance we might have reached an understandingnot to intrude on one another as it is i could not do you that injustice and i should shrink from marrying you with only a little cold liking  the man held himself firmly in hand her calmness had infected him and he felt that this was not an occasion for romantic protestations even had he felt capable of making them which was not the case as a matter of fact such things were singularly foreign to his nature  even that would go a long way with me if i could get nothing better he declared besides you might change i could surround you with some comfort i think i could promise not to force my company upon you i believe i could be kind  yes assented evelyn i shouldnt be afraid of harshness from you but it seems impossible that i should change you must see that you started handicapped from the beginning had i been free to choose it might have been different but i have lived for some time in shame and fear hating the thought that some one would be forced on me  he said nothing and she went on must i tell you you are the man  his face grew hard and for a moment he set his lips tight it would have been a relief to express his feelings concerning his host just then  if you dont hate me for it now im willing to take the risk he said at length it will be my fault if you hate me in the future ill try not to deserve it  he imagined she was yielding but she roused herself with an effort  no she said love on one side may go a long way if it is strong enoughbut it must be strong to overcome the many clashes of thought and will yoursshe looked at him steadilywould not stand the strain  vane started you are the only woman i ever wished to marry he paused with a forcible gesture what can i say to convince you  she smiled softly im afraid its impossible if you had wanted me greatly you would have pressed the claim you had in saving mopsy and i would have forgiven you that you would have urged any and every claim as it is i suppose i am prettyher lips curled scornfullyand you find some of your ideas and mine agree it isnt half enough shall i tell you that you are scarcely moved as yet  it flashed upon vane that he was confronted with the reality her beauty had appealed to him but without rousing passion for there was little of the sensual in this man her other qualities her reserved graciousness which had a tinge of dignity in it her insight and comprehension had also had their effect but they had only awakened admiration and respect he desired her as one desires an object for its rarity and preciousness but this as she had told him was not enough behind her physical and mental attributes and half revealed by them there was something deeper the real personality of the girl it was elusive mystic with a spark of immaterial radiance which might brighten human love with its transcendent glow but as he dimly realised if he won her by force it might recede and vanish altogether he could not with strong ardour compel its clearer manifestation  i think i am as moved as it is possible for me to be he said  evelyn shook her head no you will discover the difference some day and then you will thank me for leaving you your liberty now i beg you to leave me mine and let me go  vane stood silent a minute or two for the last appeal had stirred him to chivalrous pity he was shrewd enough to realise that if he persisted he could force her to come to him her father and mother were with him she had nothingno commonplace usefulness or trained abilitiesto fall back upon if she defied them but it was unthinkable that he should brutally compel her  well he said at length i must try to face the situation i want to assure you that it is not a pleasant one to me but theres another point im afraid ive made things worse for you your people will probably blame you for sending me away  evelyn did not answer this and he broke into a little grim smile now he added i think i can save you any trouble on that scorethough the course im going to take isnt flattering if you look at it in one way i want you to leave me to deal with your father  he took her consent for granted and leaning down laid a hand lightly on her shoulder you will try to forgive me for the anxiety i have caused you the time ive spent here has been very pleasant but im going back to canada in a few days perhaps youll think of me without bitterness now and then  he turned away and evelyn sat still glad that the strain was over and thinking earnestly the man was gentle and considerate as well as forceful and she liked him indeed she admitted that she had not met any man she liked as much but that was not going very far then she began to wonder at her candour and to consider if it had been necessary it was curious that this was the only man she had ever taken into her confidence and her next suitor would probably be a much less promising specimen on the other hand it was consoling to remember that eligible suitors for the daughter of an impoverished gentleman were likely to be scarce  it had grown dark when she rose and entering the house went up to mabels room the girl looked at her sharply as she came in  so you have got rid of him she said i think youre very silly  how did you know evelyn asked with a start  i heard him walking up and down the terrace and i heard you go out you cant walk over raked gravel without making a noise he went along to join you and it was a good while before you came back at different times ive been waiting for this the last day or two  evelyn sat down with a strained smile well she said i have sent him away  mabel regarded her indignantly then youll never get another chance like this one if you had only taken him i could have worn decent frocks nobody could call the last one that  this was a favourite grievance and evelyn ignored it but mabel had more to say i suppose she went on you dont know that wallace has been getting gerald out of trouble  are you sure of that evelyn asked sharply  yes said mabel ill tell you what i know wallace saw gerald in londonhe told us thatand we all know that gerald couldnt pay his debts a little while since you remember he came down to kendal and went on and stayed the next night with the claytons it isnt astonishing that he didnt come here after the row there was on the last occasion  go on said evelyn what has his visit to the claytons to do with it  well said mabel you dont know that i saw gerald in the afternoon after all hes the only brother ive got and as jim was going to the station with the trap i made him take me the claytons were in the garden we were scattered about and i heard frank and gerald who had strolled off from the others talking gerald was telling him about some things hed bought they must have been expensive because frank asked him where he got the money gerald laughed and said hed had an unexpected stroke of luck that had set him straight again now of course gerald got no money from home and if hed won it he would have told frank how he did so gerald always would tell a thing like that  evelyn was filled with confusion and hot indignation she had little doubt that mabels surmise was correct  i wonder if he has told anybody though its scarcely likely she said  of course he hasnt we all know what gerald is wallace ought to get his money back now you have sent him away mabel who had waited a moment or two went on but of course thats most unlikely it wouldnt take gerald long to waste it  evelyn rose and making some excuse left the room a suspicion which had troubled her more than geralds conduct had lately crept into her mind and it now thrust itself upon her attentionseveral things pointed to the fact that her father had taken a similar course to that which her brother had taken she felt that had she heard mabels information before the interview with vane she might have yielded to him in an agony of humiliation mabel had summed up the situation with stinging candour and crudityvane who had been defrauded was entitled to recover the money he had parted with for a few moments evelyn was furiously angry with him and then growing calmer she recognised that this was unreasonable she could not imagine any idea of a compact originating with the man and he had quietly acquiesced in her decision  soon after she left her sister vane walked into the room which chisholm reserved for his own use chisholm was sitting at the table with some papers in front of him and a cigar in his hand and vane drew out a chair and lighted his pipe before he addressed him  ive made up my mind to sail on saturday instead of next week he said  you have decided rather suddenly havent you  vane knew that what his host wished to inquire about was the cause of his decision and he meant to come to the point he was troubled by no consideration for the man  the last news i had indicated that i was wanted he replied after all there was only one reason why i have abused mrs chisholms hospitality so long  well said chisholm with an abruptness which hinted at anxiety  you will remember what i asked you some time ago i had better say that i abandon the idea  chisholm started and his florid face grew redder while vane in place of embarrassment was conscious of a somewhat grim amusement it seemed strange that a man of chisholms stamp should have any pride but he evidently possessed it  what am i to understand by that he asked with some asperity  i think what i said explained it bearing in mind your and mrs chisholms influence ive an idea that evelyn might have yielded if id strongly urged my suit but that was not by any means what i wanted id naturally prefer a wife who married me because she wished to do so thats why after thinking the thing over ive decided towithdraw  chisholm straightened himself in his chair in fiery indignation which he made no attempt to conceal  you mean that after asking my consent and seeing more of evelyn you have changed your mind cant you understand that its an unpardonable confession one which i never fancied a man born and brought up in your station could have brought himself to make  vane looked at him with an impassive face it strikes me as largely a question of termsi maynt have used the right one now you know how the matter stands you can describe it in any way that sounds nicest in regard to your other remark ive been in a good many stations and i must admit that until lately none of them were likely to promote much delicacy of sentiment  so it seems chisholm was almost too hot to sneer but cant you realise how your action reflects upon my daughter  vane held himself in hand he had only one object to divert chisholms wrath from evelyn to himself and he thought he was succeeding in this for the rest he cherished a strong resentment against the man  it cant reflect upon her unless you talk about it and both you and mrs chisholm have sense enough to refrain from doing so he answered dryly i cant flatter myself that evelyn will grieve over me then his manner changed now well get down to business i dont purpose to call that loan in which will no doubt be a relief to you  he rose leisurely and strolling out of the room met carroll shortly afterwards in the hall the latter glanced at him sharply  what have you been doing he inquired theres a look i seem to remember in your eye  i suppose ive been outraging the rules of decency but i dont feel ashamed ive been acting the uncivilised westerner though its possible that i rather strained the part to come to the point however we pull out for the dominion first thing tomorrow  carroll asked no further questions he did not think it would serve any purpose and he contented himself with making arrangements for their departure which they took early on the morrow vane had a brief interview with mabel who shed some tears over him and then by her contrivance secured a word or two with evelyn alone  now he said its possible that you may hear some hard things of me and i count upon your not contradicting them after all i think you owe me that favour theres just another matteras i wont be here to trouble you try to think of me leniently  he held her hand for a moment and then turned away and a few minutes later he and carroll left the dene     chapter xii  vane grows restless   vane had been back in vancouver a fortnight when he sat one evening on the verandah of nairns house in company with his host and carroll lazily looking down upon the inlet  nairn referred to one of the papers in his hand  horsfield has been bringing up that smelter project again and theres something to be said in favour of his views he remarked were paying a good deal for reduction  we couldnt keep a smelter going at present vane objected  there are two or three lowgrade mineral properties in the neighbourhood of the clermont that have only had a little development work done on them nairn pointed out they cant pay freight on their raw product but im thinking wed encourage their owners to open up the mines and get their business if we had a smelter handy  it wouldnt amount to much vane replied besides theres another objectionwe havent the dollars to put up a thoroughly efficient plant  horsfields ready to find part of them and do the work  i know he is said vane hes suspiciously eager the arrangement would give him a pretty strong hold upon the company there are ways in which he could squeeze us  its possible but looking at it as a personal matter there are inducements he could offer ye horsfields a man who has the handling of other folks dollars as weel as a good many of his own it might be wise to stand in with him  so he hinted vane answered shortly  your argument was about the worst you could have used mr nairn carroll broke in laughing  weel said nairn goodhumouredly im no urging it i would not see your partner make enemies for the want of a warning  hed probably do so in any case its a gift of his said carroll on the other hand its fortunate he has a way of making friends the two things sometimes go together  vane turned to nairn with signs of impatience it might save trouble if i state that while im a director of the clermont i expect to be content with a fair profit on my stock in the company  hes modest carroll commented what he means is that he doesnt propose to augment that profit by taking advantage of his position  its a creditable idea though im no sure its as common as might be desired while i have to thank ye for it i would not consider the explanation altogether necessary said nairn whose eyes twinkled then he addressed vane now we come to another pointthe companys a small one the mine is doing satisfactorily and the moments favourable for the floating of mineral properties if we got an option on the halfdeveloped claims near the clermont and went into the market its likely that an issue of new stock would meet with investors favour  i suppose so said vane ill support such a scheme when i can see how an increased capital could be used to advantage and i am convinced about the need for a smelter at present thats not the case  i mentioned it as a dutyyell hear more of it for the rest im inclined to agree with ye nairn replied  a few minutes later he went into the house with carroll and as they entered it he glanced at his companion in the present instance mr vanes views are sound he said but i see difficulties before him  so do i when he grapples with him it will be by a frontal attack  a bit of compromise is judicious now and then  in a general way its not likely to appeal to my partner when he cant get through by direct means therell be something wrecked you had better understand what kind of man he is  its no the first time ive been enlightened upon the point  shortly after they had disappeared miss horsfield came out of another door and vane rose when she approached him  mrs nairn told me i would find you and the others in the verandah she informed him she said she would join you presently and it was too fine to stay in  i think she was right vane replied as you see im alone nairn and carroll have just deserted me but i cant complain what pleases me most about this house is that you can do what you like in it andwithin limitsthe same thing applies to this city  jessie laughed and sank gracefully into the chair he drew forward  yes she said i think that would please you but how long have you been back  a fortnight since yesterday  there was a hint of reproach in the glance jessie favoured him with then i think mrs nairn might have brought you over to see us  vane wondered if she meant she was surprised he had not come of his own accord and he was mildly flattered  i was away at the mine a good deal of the time he replied deprecatingly  i wonder if you are sorry to get back  turning a little vane indicated the climbing city rising tier on tier above its water front and then the broad expanse of blue inlet and the faint white line of towering snow  wouldnt anything i could say in praise of vancouver be trifle superfluous he asked  jessie recognised that he had parried her question neatly but this did not deter her she was anxious to learn if he had felt any regret in leaving england or to be more concise if there was anybody in that country whom he had reluctantly parted from she admitted that the man attracted her there was a breezy freshness about him and though she was acquainted with a number of young men whose conversation was characterised by snap and sparkle they needed toning down this miner was set apart from them by something which he had doubtless acquired in youth in the older land  that wasnt quite what i meant she said we dont always want to be flattered and im in search of information you told me you had been nine years in this country and life must be rather different yonder how did it strike you after the absence  its difficult to explain vane replied with an air of amused reflection which hinted that he meant to get away from the point on the whole i think im more interested in the question how i struck them its curious that whereas some folks insist upon considering me english here ive a suspicion that they looked upon me as a typical colonial there  one wouldnt like to think you resented it  how could i this land sheltered me when i was an outcast and set me on my feet  ah said jessie you are the kind we dont mind taking in the rest go back and abuse us but you havent given me very much information yet  then said vane the best comparison is supplied by my first remarkthat in this city you can do what you like youre rather fenced in yonder which if youre of a placid disposition is no doubt comforting because it shuts out unpleasant things on the other hand if you happen to be restless and active the fences are inconvenient because you cant always climb over and it is not considered proper to break them down still having admitted that im proud of the old land its only the fences that irritate me  fences would naturally be obnoxious to you but we have some here  theyre generally built loose of splitrails and not nailed an energetic man can pull off a bar or two and stride over if its necessary he can afterwards put them up again and theres no harm done  would you do the latter  vanes expression changed no he said i think if there were anything good on the other side id widen the gap so that the less agile and the needy could crawl through he smiled at her you see i owe some of them a good deal they were the only friends i had when i first tramped jaded and footsore about the province  jessie was pleased with his answer she had heard of the bush choppers free hospitality and she thought it was a graceful thing that he should acknowledge his debt to them  now at last youll be content to rest a while she suggested i dare say you deserve it  its strange you should say that because just before you came out of the house i was thinking that id sat still long enough vane answered with a laugh its a thing that gets monotonous one must keep going on  then said jessie take care you dont walk over a precipice some day when you have left all the fences behind but ive kept you from your meditations and i had better see if mrs nairn is coming  she left him and he was lighting a cigar when he noticed a girl whose appearance seemed familiar in the road below moving along the verandah he recognised her as kitty and hastily crossed the lawn towards her she was accompanied by a young man whom vane had once seen in the city but she greeted him with evident pleasure  tom she said when they had exchanged a few words this is mr vane then turning to vane she added mr drayton  vane who liked the mans face and manner shook hands with him and then looked back at kitty  what are you doing now and how are little elsie and her mother he inquired  kittys face clouded mrs marvins dead elsies with some friends at spokane and i think shes well looked after ive given up the stage tomshe explained shylydidnt like it now im with some people at a ranch near the fraser on the westminster road there are two or three children and im fond of them  drayton smiled she wont be there long ive wanted to meet you for some time mr vane they told me at the office that you were away  ah said vane i suppose my congratulations wont be out of place wont you ask me to the wedding  kitty blushed will you come  try said vane and drayton broke in  theres nobody we would sooner see im heavily in your debt mr vane  oh pshaw rejoined vane come and see me any time tomorrow if you can manage it  drayton said he would do so and shortly afterwards he and kitty moved away but vane who turned back across the lawn was not aware that jessie had watched the meeting from the verandah and had recognised kitty whom she had once seen at the station she had already ascertained that the girl had arrived at vancouver in his company which in view of the opinion she had formed about him somewhat puzzled her but she said one must endeavour to be charitable besides having closely watched the little group she was inclined to believe from the way vane shook hands with the man that there was no danger to be apprehended from kitty     chapter xiii  a new project   vane was sitting alone in the room set apart for the clermont company in nairns office when drayton was shown in he took the chair vane pointed to and lighted a cigar the latter gave him  now he began with some diffidence you cut me off short when i met you the other day and one of my reasons for coming over was to get through with what i was saying then its just thisi owe you a good deal for taking care of kitty shes very grateful and thinks no end of you i want to say ill always feel you have a claim on me  vane smiled at him it was evident that kitty had taken her lover into her confidence with regard to her trip on board the sloop and that she had done so said a good deal for her  it didnt cost me any trouble vane replied we were coming down to vancouver anyway  draytons embarrassment became more obvious it cost you some dollars there were the tickets now i feel i have to  vane stopped him when you are married to miss blake you can pay me back if it will be a relief to you whens the wedding to be  in a couple of months said drayton who saw it would be useless to protest im a clerk in the winstanley mills and as one of the staff is going ill get a move up then we are to be married as soon as i do  he said a little more on the same subject and then after a few moments silence added i wonder if the clermont business keeps your hands full mr vane  it doesnt its a fact im beginning to regret  drayton appeared to consider well he said folks seem to regard you as a rising man with snap in him and theres a matter i might perhaps bring before you let me explain ive taken an interest outside my routine work in the lumber trade of this province and its subsidiary branches i figured any knowledge i could pick up might stand me in some dollars some day so farhe smiled ruefullyit hasnt done so  go on said vane whose curiosity was aroused  well i think that pulping sprucepaper spruceis likely to be scarce soon the supplys not unlimited and the worlds consumption is going up by jumps  theres a good deal of timber you could make pulp of in british columbia alone vane interposed  sure but theres not a very great deal of spruce that could be milled into highgrade paper pulp and its rapidly getting worked out in most other countries then as a rule its mixed up with the firs cedars and cypresses and that means the cutting of logging roads to each cluster of milling trees theres another pointa good deal of the spruce lies back from water or a railroad and it would be costly to bring in milling plant or pack the pulp out  thats obvious said vane for you might have to haul every pound of freight over a breakneck divide  drayton leaned forward confidentially then if one struck highgrade paper sprucea valley full of itwith water power and easy access to the sea there ought to be dollars in the thing  yes said vane with growing interest that is very probable  i could put you on the track of such a valley drayton replied  we had better understand each other do you want to sell me the information and have you offered it to anyone else  his companion answered with the candour he had expected the one or two folks ive spoken to dont seem anxious to consider it its mighty hard for a small man to launch a project  as a rule it is  then drayton continued the ideas not my own it was a mineral prospectora relative of minewho struck the valley on his last trip hes an old man and he came down played out and sick now i guess hes slowly dying he paused a moment would you like to see him  ill go with you now if its convenient vane replied  they crossed the city to where a row of squalid frame shacks stood on its outskirts in one which they entered a gaunt man with grizzled hair lay upon a rickety bed a glance showed vane that the man was very frail drayton who explained the cause of his visit motioned vane to sit down and the prospector fixed his eyes upon the latter  ive heard of you youre the man who located the clermontand put the project through he said you had the luck ive been among the ranges half my life and you can see how much ive made of it when i struck a claim worth anything somebody else got the money  vane had reasons for believing that this was not an uncommon experience but the man went on again well you look straight and ive got to take some chances its my last stake well get down to business ill tell you about that spruce  he spoke for a few minutes and then asked abruptly what are you going to offer  vane had not been certain that he would make any offer at all but as had befallen him before the swift decision flashed instinctively into his mind  if i find that the timber and its location come up to your account of it ill pay you so many dollars downwhatever we can agree uponwhen i get my lease from the land office he said then ill make another equal payment the day we start the mill but i dont bind myself to record the timber or put up a mill unless im convinced its worth while  id sooner take less dollars and a small share in the concern and drayton must stand in  its a question of terms vane replied ill consider your views  they discussed it for a while and when they had at length arrived at a provisional understanding the prospector made a sign of acquiescence well let it go at that but the thing will take time and ill never get the money if you exercise your option youll sure pay it down to seely  celias his daughter drayton explained he has no one else shes a waitress at the  house in the city he named an hotel of no great standing comes home at nights and looks after him  vane glanced round the room it was evident that celias earnings were small but he noticed several things which suggested that she had lavished loving care upon the sick man probably at the cost of severe selfdenial  yes he answered ill promise that but as i pointed out while we have agreed upon the two payments i reserve the right of deciding what share your daughter and drayton are to take afterwards within the limits sketched out i cant fix it definitely until ive seen the timberyoull have to trust me  the prospector once more looked at him steadily and then implied by a gesture that he was satisfied  the man fumbled under his pillow and produced a piece cut out from a map of the province with rough pencil notes on the back of it  it was on my last prospecting trip i found the spruce he said id been looking round for the company i was with and i figured id strike the coast over the range the creeks were full of snowwater and as i was held up here and there before i could get across provisions began to run short by and by i fell sick but i had to get out of the mountains and i was pushing on for the strait when i struck the place where the spruce is after that i got kind of muddled in the head but i went down a long valley on an easy grade and struck some siwash curing the last of the salmon the trouble is i was too sick to figure exactly where the small inlet they were camped by lies they took me back with them to their rancherieyou could find thatand sailed me across to comox by and by i came down on a steamboat and the doctor told me id made my last journey  vane expressed his sympathy the narrative has been crudely matteroffact but he had been out on the prospecting trail often enough to fill in the details the sick man omitted  how far was the valley from the inlet he asked  i cant tell you i think i was four days on the trail but it might have been more i was too sick to remember anyway there was a creek you could run the logs down  vane nodded well he said how far was the inlet from the rancherie  i was in the canoe part of one night and some of the next day guess thirty miles wouldnt be far out  thats something to go upon  vane rose if drayton will come along with me ill send him back with a hundred dollars its part of the first paymentbut your getting it now should make things a little easier for celia  but you havent located the spruce yet  im going to locate it if the things anyway possible vane shook hands with the man i expect to get off up the strait very shortly  the prospector looked at him with relief and gratitude in his eyes youre whiteand i guess youd be mighty hard to beat  vane touched draytons arm and when they reached the street his companion glanced at him with open admiration  im glad i brought you across he broke out you have a way of getting hold of folks making them believe in you hartley hasnt a word in writing but he knows you mean to act square with him kitty felt the same thingit was why she came down in the sloop with you  vane smiled though there was a trace of embarrassment in his manner now you mention it you were equally confiding we have only arrived at a rather indefinite understanding about your share yet  well leave it at that said the other i havent struck anybody else in this city who would hear about the thing anyway id prefer a few shares in the concern as mentioned instead of money if you get the thing on foot i guess it will go  during the rest of the day vane was busy on board the sloop but in the evening he walked over to horsfields house with mrs nairn and found jessie and her brother at home horsfield presently took him to his smokingroom  about that smelter he said havent you make your mind up yet  isnt it a matter for the board vane asked suggestively there are several directors  horsfield laughed well face the fact theyll do what you decide upon  vane did not reply to this well he said at present we couldnt keep a smelter big enough to be economical going and im doubtful if we would get much ore from the other properties you were talking to nairn about  did he say it was my idea  he didnt id reasons for assuming it those properties however are of no account  horsfield waited expectantly and vane went on if it seems possible that we can profitably increase our output later by means of further capital well put up a smelter but in that case it might be economical to do the work ourselves  who would superintend it  i would if necessary  horsfield smiled in a significant manner arent you inclined to take hold of too much when you have plenty in your hands its good policy to leave a little for somebody else sometimes the person who benefits is willing to reciprocate  the hint was plain and nairn had said sufficient on another occasion to make it clearer but vane did not respond  if we gave the work out it would be an open tender he said there would be no reason why you shouldnt make a bid  horsfield found it difficult to conceal his disgust he had no desire to bid on an open tender which would prevent his obtaining anything beyond the market price  the question must stand over until i come back vane resumed im going up the west coast shortly and may be away some little time  they left the smokingroom soon afterwards and when they strolled back to the other vane sat down near jessie  i hear you are going away she began  yes said vane im going to look for pulping timber  but why do you want pulping timber  it can sometimes be converted into dollars  isnt there every prospect of your obtaining a good many already are you never satisfied  i suppose im open to take as many as i can get vane answered with an air of humorous consideration the reason probably is that ive had very few until lately still i dont think its altogether the dollars that are driving me  if its the restlessness you once spoke of you ought to put a check on it and try to be content theres danger in the longing to be always going on  its a common idea that a small hazard gives a thing an interest  jessie shot a swift glance at him and she had as he noticed expressive eyes  be careful she said after all its wiser to keep within safe limits and not climb over too many fences she hesitated and her voice grew softer you have friends who would be sorry if you got hurt  the man was a little stirred she was alluring physically while something in her voice had its effect on him evelyn however still occupied his thoughts and he smiled at his companion  thank you he said i like to believe it     chapter xiv  vane sails north   it was growing dusk on the evening of vanes departure when he walked out of nairns room his host was with him and when they entered an adjacent room where a lamp was burning the older mans face relaxed into a smile as he saw jessie horsfield talking to his wife vane stopped a few minutes to speak to them and it was jessie who gave the signal for the group to break up  i must go she said to mrs nairn ive already stayed longer than i intended ill let you have those patterns back in a day or two  mair patterns nairn exclaimed with dry amusement its the second lot this week yere surely industrious jessie womenhe addressed vanehave curious notions of economy they will spend a month knitting a thing to give to somebody who does not want it when they could buy it for half a dollar done better by machinery im no saying however that it does not keep them out of mischief  jessie laughed i dont think many of us are industrious in that way now after all isnt it a pity that so many of the beautiful old handicrafts are dying out no loom for instance could turn out some of the things your wife makes theyre matchless  she has an aumrieye can translate it trunkfull of them said nairn its no longer customary to scatter them ower the house  mrs nairns smile was half a sigh there were no books and no mony amusements when i was young she said to jessie we sat through the long winter forenights counting stitches at burnfoot under the scottish moors that my dear was thirty years ago  she shook hands with vane who left the house with jessie and watched them cross the lawn  im thinking yell no see so much of jessie for the next few weeks nairn who had accompanied her to the door remarked has she shown ye any of yon knickknacks when she finished them  his wife shook her head at him reproachfully alec she said yere now and then hasty in jumping at conclusions  maybe replied nairn im no infallible but the fault ye mention is no common in the land where we were born im no denying that jessie has enterprise but how far it will carry her in this case is mair than i can tell  he smiled as he recalled a scene at the station some time ago and mrs nairn looked up at him  what is amusing ye alec she asked  it was just a bit idea no worth the mentioning said nairn i think it wouldna count he paused and resumed with an air of reflection a young mans heart is whiles inconstant and susceptible  mrs nairn who ignored the last remark went into the house and in the meanwhile jessie and vane walked down the road until they stopped at a gate jessie held out her hand  im glad i met you tonight she said you will allow me to wish you every success  thank you he replied its nice to feel one has the sympathy of ones friends  he turned away and jessie stood watching him as he strode down the road there was she thought something that set him apart from other men in his fine poise and swing she was however forced to confess that although he had answered her courteously there had been no warmth in his words  as it happened vane was just then conscious of a slight relief he admired jessie and he liked nairn and his wife but they belonged to the city which he was on the whole glad to leave behind he was going back to the shadowy woods where men lived naturally and the lust of fresh adventure was strong in him  on reaching the wharf he found kitty and celia hartley whom he had not met hitherto awaiting him with carroll and drayton a boat lay at the steps and he and carroll rowed the others off to the sloop the moon was just rising from behind the black firs at the inlets inner end and a little cold wind faintly scented with resinous fragrance that blew down across them stirred the water into tiny ripples that flashed into silvery radiance here and there  a soft glow shone out from the skylights to welcome them as they approached the sloop and when laughing gaily they clambered on board carroll led the way to the tiny saloon which just held them all it was brightly lighted by two nickelled lamps flowers were fastened against the panelling and clusters of them stood upon the table which was covered with a spotless cloth vane took the head of it and carroll modestly explained that only part of the supper had been prepared by him the rest he had obtained in the city out of regard for the guests who he added had not lived in the bush  carroll started the general chatter which went on after the meal was over and nobody appeared to notice that kitty sat with her hand in draytons amidst the happy laughter even celia who had her grief to grapple with smiled bravely vane had given them champagne the best in the city though they drank sparingly and at last when celia made a move to rise drayton stood up with his glass in his hand  we must go but theres something to be done he said its to thank our host and wish him success its a little boat hes sailing in but shes carrying a big freight if our good wishes count for anything  they emptied the glasses and vane replied my success is yours you have all a stake in the venture and that piles up my responsibility if the spruce is still in existence ive got to find it  and youre going to find it said drayton confidently  then vane divided the flowers between celia and her companion but when they went up on deck kitty raised one bunch and kissed it  tom wont mind she said take that one back from celia and me  they got down into the boat then while the girls called back to vane drayton rowed away and the boat was fading out of sight when kittys voice reached the men on board she was singing a wellknown jacobite ballad  considering what his highland followers suffered on his account and what the women thought of him said carroll some of the virtues they credited the young chevalier with must have been real he raised his hand you may as well listen  vane stood still a moment with the blood hot in his face and the refrain rang more clearly across the sparkling water    better loed ye cannot be   will ye no come back again  i dont know if you feel flattered but ive an idea that kitty and celia would go into the fire for you and drayton seems to share their confidence carroll resumed in his most matteroffact tone  vane began to shake the mainsail loose i believe we both talked rather freely tonight but we have to find the spruce  so you have said already carroll pointed out hadnt you better heave the boom up with the topping lift  they got the mainsail on to her broke out the anchor and set the jib and as the boat slipped away before a freshening breeze vane sat at the helm while carroll stood on the foredeck coiling up the gear the moon was higher now the broad sail gleamed a silvery grey the ripples which were getting bigger flashed and sparkled as they streamed back from the bows and the lights of the city dropped fast astern vane was conscious of a keen exhilaration he had started on a new adventure he was going back to the bush and he knew that no matter how his life might change the wilderness would always call to him in spite of this however he was as he had said conscious of an unusual responsibility hitherto he had fought for what he could get for himself but now kittys future partly depended upon his efforts and his success would be of vast importance to celia  he had a very friendly feeling towards both the girls indeed all the women he had met of late had attracted him in different ways but evelyn stood apart from all  she appealed less to his senses and intellect than she did to a sublimated something in the depths of his nature and it somehow seemed fitting that her image should materialise before his mental vision as the sloop drove along under the cloudless night sky while the moonlight poured down glamour on the shining water evelyn harmonised with such things as these  it was true that she had repulsed him but that he remembered once more with a sense of compunction was what he deserved for entering into an alliance against her with her venial father he was glad now that he had acquiesced in her dismissal of him since to have stood firm and broken her to his will would have brought disaster upon both of them he felt that she had not wholly escaped him after all by and by he would go back and seek her favour by different means then she might perhaps forgive him and listen     chapter xv  the first misadventure   the breeze freshened fiercely with the red and fiery dawn and vane who had gone below was advised of it by being flung off the locker on which he sat with coffee and biscuits before him in the saloon the jug overturning spilled its contents upon his person the biscuits were scattered but he picked himself up in haste and scrambled out into the well he found the sloop slanted over with a good deal of her lee deck submerged in rushing foam and carroll bracing himself against the strain upon the tiller  ill let her come up when youre ready carroll remarked we had better get some sail off her if we mean to hold on to the mast  he put down his helm and the sloop forging round to windward rose upright with her heavy mainboom banging to and fro after that they were desperately busy for the next few minutes and vane wished they had engaged a hand in vancouver instead of waiting to hire a siwash somewhere up the coast there was a headsail to haul to windward which was difficult and the mainsheet to get in and then the two men standing on the slippery inclined deck struggled hard to haul the canvas down to the boom the jerking spar smote them in the ribs once or twice the reefing tackle beneath it was torn from their hands but they mastered the sail tying two reefs in it to reduce its size and the craft afterwards drove away with her lee rail just awash  you had better go down and get some biscuits vane said to his comrade you maynt have an opportunity later  it looks like that carroll agreed the winds backing northwards and that means more of it before long you can call if you want me  he disappeared below and vane sat at the helm with a frown on his face he knew that the breeze would increase and draw ahead which was unfortunate because they would have to beat fighting for every fathom they slowly made there was no help for it and he buttoned his jacket against the spray while by the time carroll came up the sloop was plunging sharply pitching showers of stinging brine all over her when the bows went down they drove her at it stubbornly most of the day making but little to windward while the seas got bigger and whiter until they had some trouble to keep the light boat they carried upon the deluged deck at last when she came bodily aft amidst a frothing cascade which poured into the well vane brought the sloop round and they stretched away to the eastwards until they could let go the anchor in smooth water beneath a wall of rock they were very wet and stiff with cold for winter was drawing near  well get supper said vane if the breeze drops at dusk well go on again  having eaten little since dawn they enjoyed the meal and carroll would have been content to remain at anchor afterwards the tiny saloon was comfortably warm and it would be pleasanter to lounge away the evening on a locker with his pipe instead of sitting amidst the bitter spray at the helm but vane was proof against his companions hints  with a head wind well be some time working up to the rancherie and then we have thirty miles of coast to search for the inlet hartley reached he said after that theres the valley to locate he was uncertain how far it lay from the beach  it couldnt be very far you wouldnt expect a man who was sick to make any great pace  i can imagine a man who knew he must reach the coast before he started making a pretty vigorous effort do you remember the time we crossed the divide in the snow  i could remember it if i wanted said carroll with a shiver its about the last thing im anxious to do  the trouble is that there are many valleys in this strip of country and we may have to try a number before we strike the right one vane went on i cant spend very much time over this search as soon as the man we put in charge of the mine has tried his present system long enough to give us something to figure on i want to see what can be done to increase our output we havent marketed very much refined metal yet  theres no doubt it would be advisable carroll who looked after their finances answered as ive pointed out you have spent a good deal of the cash you got when you turned the clermont over to the company in fact thats one reason why i didnt try to head you off this timberhunting scheme you cant spend many dollars over it and if the spruce comes up to expectations you ought to get them back it would be a fortunate change after your extravagance in england  that is a subject i dont want to talk about well go up and see what the weathers like  carroll shivered when they stood in the well a nipping wind came down across the darkening firs ashore but there was no doubt that it had fallen somewhat and he resigned himself when vane began to pull the tiers off the mainsail  in a few minutes they were under way the sloop heading out towards open water with two reefs down in her mainsail a great and ghostly shape of slanted canvas that swept across the dim furrowed plain of sea by midnight the breeze was as strong as ever but they had clear moonlight and they held on the craft plunging with flooded decks through the white combers while carroll sat at the helm battered by spray and stung with cold  when vane came up an hour or two later the sea was breaking viciously they held on and soon after day broke with its first red flush ominously high in the eastern sky stretched in towards the land with a somewhat sheltered bay opening up beyond a foamfringed point ahead of them carroll glanced dubiously at the white turmoil in the midst of which black fangs of rock appeared before he turned to his companion  will she weather the point on this tack he asked  shell have to said vane who was steering  they stood on though it occurred to carroll that they were not opening up the bay very rapidly the light was growing and he could now discern the orderly phalanxes of whitetopped combers that crumpled into chaotic spouting on the points outer end the sloop would not last long if she touched bottom there but once more after a glance at his companions face he kept silent after all vane was leader and when he looked as he did then he usually resented advice the mouth of the bay grew wider until carroll could see most of the forestgirt shore on one side of it but the surf upon the point was also growing unpleasantly near wisps of spray whirled away from it and vanished among the scrubby firs clinging to the fissured crags behind the sloop however was going to windward for vane was handling her with skill and she had almost cleared the point when there was a bang and the sloop stopped suddenly the comber to windward that should have lifted her up broke all over her flinging the boat on deck upon the saloon skylight and pouring inches deep over the coaming into the well vane was hurled from the tiller and cut his forehead for his wet face was smeared with blood but he had seized a big oar to shove her off when she swung upright moved and struck again the following sea hove her up there was another less violent crash and while vane dropped the oar and grasped the helm she suddenly shot ahead  shell go clear he shouted jump below and see if shes damaged  carroll got no farther than the scuttle for the saloon floorings on the depressed side were already awash and he could hear an ominous splashing and gurgling  its pouring into her he reported  vane nodded youll have to pump  we passed an opening some miles to lee wouldnt it be better if you ran back there carroll suggested  no said vane i wont run a yard theres another inlet not far ahead and well stand on until we reach it id put her on the beach here only that shed go to pieces with the first shift of wind to the westward  carroll agreed with this opinion but there is a great difference between running to leeward with the sea behind the vessel and thrashing to windward when it is ahead and he hesitated  get the pump started were going on vane said shortly  the pump was fortunately a powerful one and they had nearly two miles of smoother water before they stretched out of the bay upon the other track but when they did so carroll who glanced down again through the scuttle could not flatter himself that he had reduced the water  after half an hour of it he was breathless and exhausted and vane took his place the sea was higher the sloop wetter than she had been and there was no doubt that the water was rising fast inside her carroll wondered how far ahead the inlet his companion had mentioned lay and the next two hours were anxious ones to both of them turn about they pumped with savage determination and went back gasping to the helm to thrash the boat on they drove her remorselessly and she went through the combers swept and streaming while the spray scourged the helmsmans face as he gazed to weather their arms and shoulders ached from working in a cramped position but since there was no help for it they toiled doggedly until at last the crest of a crag they were heading for sloped away in front of them  a few minutes later they drove past the end of it into a broad lane of water with long ranks of firs dropping steeply to its edge the wind was suddenly cut off the combers fell away and the sloop crept slowly up the inlet which wound green and placid among the hills vane strode to the scuttle and looked down at the flood which splashed languidly to and fro below  its fortunate that were in another halfhour would have seen the end of her he said let her come up a little theres a smooth beach to yonder cove  she slid in quietly scarcely rippling the smooth surface of the tiny basin about which there rose great black firs and carroll laid her on the beach  now said vane drop the boom on the shore side to keep her from canting over and then well get breakfast well see where shes damaged when the tide ebbs  since most of their stores had lain in the flooded lockers from which there had been no time to extricate them the meal was not an appetising one they were however glad of it and rowing ashore afterwards they lay on the shingle in the sunshine while the sloop was festooned with their drying clothes  if she has only split a plank or two we can patch her up vane remarked there are all the tools well want in the locker  where will you get new planks from carroll inquired i dont think we have any spikes that would go through the frames  that said vane is the trouble i expect ill have to make a trip across to comox for them in a sea canoe were sure to come across a few siwash somewhere in the neighbourhood i cant say that this expedition is beginning fortunately  theres no doubt on that point carroll agreed  well said vane she has to be patched up and until i find that spruce im going on  carroll made no comment it was not worthwhile to object when vane was obviously determined     chapter xvi  the bush   it was a quiet evening nearly a fortnight after the arrival of the sloop and pale sunshine streamed into the cove little glittering ripples lapped lazily along the shingle and the placid surface of the inlet was streaked with faint blue lines where wandering airs came down from the heights above now and then an elfin sighing fell from the ragged summits of the tall black firs but it died away again and afterwards the silence was only broken by the pounding of a heavy hammer and the crackle of a fire  carroll sat beside the latter alternately holding a stout plank up to the blaze and dabbing its hot surface with a dripping mop a big sea canoe lay drawn up near the spot and one of its copperskinned siwash owners sat amongst the shingle stolidly watching the white men his comrade was inside the sloop holding a big stone against one of her frames while vane crouched outside her swinging a hammer  vane who was stripped to shirt and trousers had arrived from comox across the strait at dawn that morning in the sea canoe it was a long trip and they had had wild weather on the outward journey but he had set to work with characteristic energy as soon as he landed now though the sun was low he was working rather harder than ever with the flood tide which would shortly compel him to desist creeping up to his feet  carroll who watched him with quiet amusement was on the whole content that the tide was rising because his comrade had firmly declined to stop for dinner and he was conscious of a sharpened appetite it was comforting to reflect that vane would be unable to get the plank into place before the evening meal because if there had been any prospect of his doing so he would certainly have postponed the latter  by and by he stopped a moment and turned to carroll if you were any use in an emergency youd be holding up for me instead of that wooden image inside he remarked he will back the stone against any frame except the one im nailing  the difficulty is that i cant be in two places at the same time carroll pointed out shall i leave this plank you cant get it in tonight  im going to try vane answered grimly  he turned round to direct the siwash and then cautiously hammered in one of the wedges a little farther after which swinging back the hammer he struck a heavy blow the result was disastrous for there was a crash and one of the shores shot backwards striking him on the knee he jumped with a savage cry and next moment there was a sharp snapping and the end of the plank sprang out then another shore gave way and when the plank fell clattering at his feet he whirled the hammer round his head and hurled it violently into the bush this appeared to afford him some satisfaction and he strode up the beach with the blood dripping from the knuckles of one hand  thats the blamed siwashs fault he said i couldnt get him to back up when i put the last spike in  hadnt you better tell him to come out carroll suggested  no said vane if he hasnt sense enough to see that he isnt wanted he can stay where he is all night are you going to get supper or must i do that too  carroll set about preparing the meal which the two siwash partook of and afterwards departed with some paper currency then vane walking down the beach came back with the plank and after lighting his pipe pointed to one or two broken nails in it  thats the cause of the trouble he said it cost me a weeks journey to get the package of galvanised spikesi could have managed to split a plank or two out of one of these firs the storekeeper fellow assured me they were specially annealed for heading up if i knew who the manufacturers were id have pleasure in telling them what i think of them if they set up to make spikes they ought to make them and empty every keg that wont stand the test on to the scrap heap  carroll smiled the course his partner had indicated was the one he would have adopted he was characterised by a somewhat grim idea of efficiency and never spared his labour to attain it though the latter fact had now and then its inconveniences for those who had cooperated with him as carroll had discovered the latter had no doubt that vane would put the planks in if he spent a month over the operation  i wouldnt have had this trouble if youd been handier with tools he resumed  my abilities arent as varied as yours and the thing is bad economy carroll replied skill of the kind you mentioned is worth about three dollars a day  you were getting two dollars for shovelling in a mining ditch when i first met you  i was carroll assented goodhumouredly i believe another month or two of it would have worn me out its considerably pleasanter and more profitable to act as your understudy but a fairly proficient carpenter might have bungled the latter  vane looked embarrassed let it pass ive a pernicious habit of expressing myself unfortunately anyhow well start again on those planks first thing tomorrow  he stretched out his aching limbs beside the fire and languidly watched the firs grow dimmer and the mists creep in ghostly trails down the steep hillside until carroll broke the silence  wallace he said wouldnt it be wiser if you met that fellow horsfield to some extent  no said vane decidedly i have no intention of giving way an inch it would only encourage the man to press me on another point if i did im going to have trouble with him and the sooner it comes the better theres only room for one controlling influence in the clermont mine  in that case it might be as well to stay in vancouver as much as possible and keep your eye on him  the same idea has struck me since we sailed vane said the trouble is that until ive decided about the pulp mill hell have to go unwatched for the same reason that prevented you from holding up for me and steaming the plank  if any unforeseen action of horsfields made it necessary you could let this pulp project drop  no said vane you ought to understand why thats impossible drayton kitty and hartley count upon my exertions theyre poor folks and i cant go back on them if we cant locate the spruce or it doesnt seem likely to pay for working up theres nothing to prevent my abandoning the undertaking but im not at liberty to do so just because it would be a convenience to myself hartley got my promise before he told me where to search  he strolled away to the tent they had pitched on the edge of the bush but carroll sat a while smoking beside the fire he was suspicious of horsfield and foresaw trouble more particularly now his comrade had undertaken a project which seemed likely to occupy a good deal of his attention hitherto vane had owed part of his success to his faculty of concentrating all his powers upon one object  they rose at dawn next morning and by sunset had fitted the new planks two days later they sailed to the northwards and eventually found the rancherie hartley had mentioned where they had expected to hire a guide the rickety wooden building however was empty and vane pushed on again he had now to face an unseen difficulty because there were a number of openings in that strip of coast and hartleys description was of no great service in deciding which was the right one  during the next day or two they looked into several bights and seeing no valleys opening out of them went on again until one evening they ran into an inlet with a forestshrouded hollow at the head of it here they moored the sloop close in with a sheltered beach and after a nights rest got ready their packs for the march inland  they had a light tent without poles which could be cut when wanted two blankets an axe and one or two cooking utensils besides their provisions  in front of them a deep trough opened up in the hills but it was filled with giant forest through which no track led and only those who have traversed the dim recesses of the primeval bush can fully understand what this implies the west winds swept through that gateway reaping as they went and here and there tremendous trees lay strewn athwart each other with their branches spread abroad in horrible tangles some had fallen amidst the wreckage left by previous gales which the forest had partly made good and there was scarcely a rod of the way that was not obstructed by half rotten trunks then there were thick bushes and an undergrowth of willows where the soil was damp with thorny brakes and matted fern in between in places the growth was almost like a wall and the men who skirted the inlet were glad to scramble forward among the rough boulders and ragged driftwood at the waters edge for some minutes at a time until it was necessary to leave the beach behind  after the first few minutes there was no sign of the gleaming water they had entered a region of dim green shade where the moist air was heavy with resinous smells the trunks rose about them in tremendous columns thorns clutched their garments and twigs and brittle branches snapped beneath their feet the day was cool but the sweat of tense effort dripped from them and when they stopped for breath at the end of an hour vane estimated that they had gone a mile  ill be content if we can keep this up he said  it isnt likely carroll who glanced down at a big rent in his jacket replied with a trace of dryness  a little farther on they waded with difficulty through a large stream and carroll who stopped glanced round at a deep rift in a crag on one side of them  i dont know if that could be considered a valley but we may as well look at it he suggested  they scrambled towards it and reaching gravelly soil where the trees were thinner vane surveyed the opening it was very narrow and appeared to lose itself among the rocks the size of the creek which flowed out of it was no guide because those ranges are scored by running water  we wont waste time over that ravine he said i noticed a wider one farther on and well see what its like though hartley led me to understand that he came down a straight and gentlysloping valley the one were in answers the description  it was two hours before they reached the second opening and then vane unstrapping his packs clambered up the steep face of a crag when he came back his face was thoughtful and sitting down he lighted his pipe  this search seems to take us longer than i expected he said to begin with there are a number of inlets all of them pretty much alike along this part of the coast but i neednt go into the reasons for supposing that this is the one hartley visited taking it for granted that were right were up against another difficulty so far as i could make out from the top of that rock theres a regular series of ravines running back into the hills  hartley told you he came straight down to tidewater didnt he  thats not much of a guide vane replied the slope of every fissure seems to run naturally from the inland watershed to this basin hartley was sick and it was raining all the time and coming out of any of these ravines hed only have to make a slight turn to reach the water whats more he could only tell me he was heading roughly west and allowing that there was no sun visible that might have meant either northwest or southwest which gives us the choice of searching the hollows on either side of the main valley now it strikes me as most probable that he came down the latter but we have to face the question whether we should push straight on or search every opening that might be called a valley  whats your idea carroll rejoined  that we ought to go into the thing systematically and look at every ravine we come to  i guess youre right but i dont move another step tonight  ive no wish to urge you theres hardly a joint in my body that doesnt ache vane flung down his pack and stretched himself with an air of relief thats what comes of civilisation and soft living it would be nice to sit still while somebody brought me my supper  as there was nobody to do so he took up the axe and set about hewing chips off a fallen trunk while carroll made a fire then he cut the tent poles and a few armfuls of twigs for a bed and in half an hour the camp was pitched and a meal prepared they afterwards lay a while smoking and saying little beside the sinking fire the red light of which flickered upon the massy trunks and fell away again then they crawled into the tent and wrapped their blankets round them     chapter xvii  vane postpones the search   when vane rose early next morning there was frost in the air and when breakfast was ready the men ate hastily eager for the exertion that would put a little warmth into them  we had it a good deal colder on other trips i suppose ive been getting luxurious since i seem to resent it now said vane theres no doubt that winters beginning earlier than i expected up here as soon as you can strike the tent well move on  the valley grew wilder and more rugged as they proceeded in places its bottom was filled with muskegs cumbered with halfsubmerged decaying trunks of fallen trees and when they could not spring from one falling log to another they sank in slime and water to the knee they entered transverse valleys and after hours of exhausting labour abandoned the search of each in turn and plodded back to the one they had been following their boots and clothing suffered their packs were rent upon their backs and since men engaged in such work must be generously fed their provisions diminished rapidly  at length one lowering afternoon they were brought to a standstill by the river which forked into two branches one of which came foaming out on a cleft in the rocks this would have mattered less had it flowed across the level but just there it had scored itself out a deep hollow from which the roar of its turmoil rose in long reverberations carroll who was aching all over stood upon the brink and first of all gazed ahead he surmised from the steady ascent and the contours of the hills that the valley was dying out and that they should reach the head of it in another days journey the higher summits however were veiled in leaden mist and there was a sting in the cold breeze that blew down the hollow and set the ragged firs wailing then he glanced dubiously at the dim green water which swirled in deep eddies and boiled in white confusion among the fangs of rock sixty or seventy feet below not far away the stream was wider and he supposed in consequence shallower though it ran furiously  it doesnt look encouraging and we have no more food left than will take us back to the sloop if were economical he said do you think its worth while going on  i havent a doubt about it vane declared we ought to reach the head of the valley and get back here in two or three days  three days will make a big hole in the provisions  then well have to put up with short rations vane rejoined  if youre determined we may as well get on  he stepped cautiously over the edge of the descent and went down a few yards with a run while loosened soil and stones slipped away under him then he clutched a slender tree and proceeded as far as the next on his hands and knees after that it was necessary to swing himself over a ledge and he was on the whole astonished when he alighted safely on one below from which he could scramble down to the narrow strip of gravel between rock and water he was standing breathless looking at the latter when vane joined him the stones dipped sharply and two or three large boulders ringed about with froth rose near the middle of the stream which seemed to be running slacker on the other side of them  there was nothing to show how deep it was but carroll braced himself for an effort and sturdily plunged in  two steps took him up to the waist and he had trouble in finding solid bottom at the next because the gravel rolled and slipped away beneath his feet in the strong stream the current also dragged hard at his limbs and he set his lips tight when it crept up to his ribs then he lost his footing and was washed away plunging and floundering with now and then one toe resting momentarily upon the bottom until he was hurled against the first of the boulders with a crash that almost drove the little remaining breath out of his body he clung to it desperately gasping hard and then with a determined struggle contrived to reach the second stone against which the stream pressed him without finding any support for his feet a moment or two later vane was washed down towards him and grabbing at the boulder held on by it they said nothing to each other but they looked at the sliding water between them and the opposite bank carroll was getting horribly cold and felt the power ebbing out of him he thought if he must swim across he had better do so at once  launching himself forward he felt the flood lap his breast but as his arms went in he struck something violently with one leg and found that he could stand up on a submerged ledge this carried him a yard or two and though he stepped over the end of the ledge into deeper water he reached a strip of shelving shingle up which he staggered vane overtook him and they scrambled up the slope ahead which was a little less steep than the one they had descended the work warmed them slightly and they needed it but as they strode on again keeping to the foot of the hillside where the timber was less dense a cold rain drove into their faces it grew steadily thicker the straps began to gall their wet shoulders and their saturated clothing clung heavily about their limbs in spite of this they went on until nightfall when it was difficult to make a fire and after a reduced supper found a little humid warmth in their wet blankets  the next days work was much the same only that they crossed no rivers and it rained harder and when evening came carroll who had burst one boot was limping badly they made camp among the dripping firs which partly sheltered them from the bitter wind and shortly after supper both fell asleep  at evening next day they reached the head of the valley it was still raining and heavy mists obscured the summits of the hills but above the lower slopes of rocks glimmering snow ran up into the vapour there were a few balsams and hemlocks about them but no sign of a spruce  now said carroll i expect youll be satisfied  vane was no nearer to owning himself defeated than he had been when they first set out we know theres no spruce in this valley and thats something he replied when we come back again well try the next one  it has cost us a good deal to make sure of the fact  vanes expression changed we havent ascertained the cost just yet as a rule you dont make up the bill until youre through with the undertaking and it may be a longer one than either of us think now well turn upon our tracks  carroll recalled his speech afterwards but just then he only hitched his burden a little higher on his aching shoulders as he plodded after his comrade down the rainswept hollow and he had good cause to remember the march to the inlet it rained most of the way and their clothes were never dry parts of them indeed flowed in tatters about their aching limbs and before they had covered half the distance their boots were dropping to pieces what was more important their provisions were rapidly running out and they marched on a few handfuls of food carefully apportioned twice daily at last one night they lay down hungry with empty bags to sleep shelterless in the rain for they had thrown their tent away and carroll had some difficulty in getting on his feet next morning  i believe i can hold out until sundown though im far from sure of it he said youll have to leave me behind if we dont strike the inlet then  well strike it in the afternoon vane assured him  they set out as soon as they had reslung their packs and carroll limped and stumbled he managed however to keep pace with vane and some time after noon the latter cried out as a twinkling gleam among the trees caught his eye then the shuffling pace grew faster and they were breathless when at last they stopped and dropped their burdens beside the boat it was only at the third or fourth attempt they got her down to the water and the veins were swollen high on vanes flushed forehead when at last he sat down panting heavily on her gunwale  we ran her up quite easily though we had the slope to face then he remarked  you could scarcely expect to carry boats about without trouble after a march like the one weve made carroll pointed out  they ran her in and pulled off to the sloop when they sat down in the little saloon in which there was a mirror vane grinned  i knew you looked a deadbeat but id no idea i was quite so bad he said anyhow well get the stove lighted and some dry things on the next question iswhat shall we have for supper  thats simple carroll answered everything thats most tempting and the whole of it  some little time later they flung their boots and rent garments overboard and sat down to a feast the plates were empty when they rose and in another hour both of them were wrapped in heavy slumber     chapter xviii  jessie confers a favour   it was blowing fresh next morning from the southeast which was right ahead and vanes face was hard when he and carroll got the boat on deck and set about tying down two reefs in the mainsail  they got sail upon the sloop and drove her out into a confused head sea through which she laboured with flooded decks making very little to windward when night came a deluge killed the breeze and next day she lay rolling wildly in a heavy calm while light mist narrowed in the horizon and a persistent drizzle poured down upon the smoothlyheaving sea then they had light variable winds and their provisions were once more running out when they drew abreast of a little coaling port carroll suggested running in and going on to victoria by train but they had hardly decided to do so when the fickle breeze died away and the tidestream bore them past to the south they had no longer a stitch of dry clothing left and they were again upon reduced rations  still bad fortune dogged them for that night a fresh head wind sprang up and held steadily while they thrashed her south swept by stinging spray their tempers grew shorter under the strain and their bodies ached from the chill of their soddened garments and sitting hour by hour at the helm at last the breeze fell and shortly afterwards a trail of smoke and a half seen strip of hull emerged from the creeping haze astern of them  a lumber tug said vane she seems to have a raft in tow and it will probably be for draytons people if youll edge in towards her ill send him word that were on the way  there was very little wind just then and presently the tug was close alongside pitching her bows out of the slow swell while a mass of timber wonderfully chained together surged along astern a shapeless oilskinned figure stood outside her pilothouse balancing itself against the heave of the bridge which slanted and straightened  winstanley vane shouted  the figure waved an arm as if in assent and vane raised his voice again report us to mr drayton well come along as fast as we can  the man turned and pointed to the misty horizon astern youll get it from the north before tomorrow  then the straining tug and long wet line of working raft drew ahead while the sloop crawled on closehauled towards the south late that night however the mists melted away and a keen rushing breeze that came out of the north crisped the water she sprang forward when the ripples reached her the flapping canvas went to sleep and while each slack rope tightened a musical tinkle broke out at the bows it grew steadily louder and when the sun swung up red above the eastern hills she had piled the white froth to her channels and was driving forward merrily with little sparkling seas tumbling foamtipped after her the wind fell light as the sun rose higher but she ran on all day and the western sky was still blazing with a wondrous green when she stole into vancouver harbour  the light faded as they crept across the inlet before a faint breeze but when they had got the anchor over and the boat into the water carroll made out two dim figures standing on the wharf and waved a hand to them  its drayton i think he said kittys with him  they pulled ashore and drayton shook hands with them  ive been looking out for you since noon he said what about that spruce  there was eagerness in his voice and vanes face clouded we couldnt find a trace of it  draytons disappointment was obvious though he tried to hide it well he said resignedly ive no doubt you did all you could  of course kitty broke in were quite sure of that  vane thanked her with a glance he felt sorry for her and drayton they were strongly attached to each other and he had reason for believing that even with the advanced salary the man expected to get they would find it needful to study strict economy  im going to make another attempt i expect some of our difficulties will vanish after ive had a talk with hartley he said  kitty looked grave thats impossible she answered softly hartley died a week ago  vane started  im sorry he said hows celia  shes very sick there was concern in kittys voice hartley got worse soon after you left and she sat up all night with him after her work for the last two weeks now shes broken down and she doesnt seem to know if theyll take her back again at the hotel  i must go and see her said vane but wont you and drayton come with us and have dinner  drayton explained that this was out of the questionkittys employer who had driven in that afternoon was waiting with his team and the party left the wharf together a few minutes later vane shook hands with the girl and her companion  dont lose heart he said were far from beaten yet  they separated and after dinner vane who rejoiced in the unusual luxury of clean dry clothes walked across to call on nairn he was shown into a room where jessie horsfield was sitting but she rose with a slight start when he came in vane who had been preoccupied since he had heard kittys news did not notice it and jessies manner was reposeful and quietly friendly when she held out her hand  so you have come back she said have you succeeded in your search  vane was gratified it was pleasant to feel that she was interested in his undertaking  no he confessed im afraid i have failed  then said jessie with reproach in her voice you have disappointed me  it was skilful flattery since she had conveyed the impression that she had expected him to succeed which implied that she held a high opinion of his abilities  after all you must have had a good deal against you she resumed consolingly wont you sit down and tell me about it nairn i understand is writing some letters and he sent for mrs nairn just before you came in  she indicated a chair beside the open hearth and vane sat down opposite her where a low screen cut them off from the rest of the room vane who was still stiff and aching from exposure to the cold and rain revelled in the unusual sense of comfort in addition to this his companions pose was singularly graceful and the ease of it and the friendly smile with which she regarded him somehow implied that they were on excellent terms  its very nice to be here again he said  jessie looked up at him languidly he had spoken as he felt on impulse which was more gratifying than an obvious desire to pay her a compliment would have been  i suppose you wouldnt get many comforts in the bush she suggested  no said vane comforts of any kind are remarkably scarce up yonder as a matter of fact i cant imagine a country where the contrasts between the luxuries of civilisation and the other thing are sharper but that wasnt exactly what i meant  then what did you mean  i dont know that its worth explaining vane answered with an air of consideration we have rather luxurious quarters at the hotel but this room is somehow different its restfuli think its homelyinfact as i said its nice to be here  jessie understood that he had been attempting to analyse his feelings and had failed clearly to recognise that her presence contributed to the satisfaction he was conscious of she had no doubt that if he were a man of average susceptibility the company of an attractive woman would have some effect on him after his sojourn in the wilds but whether she had produced any deeper effect she could not determine nor did it appear judicious to prompt him unduly  but wont you tell me your adventures she said  it required a few leading questions to start him but at length he told the story  you see he said in conclusion it was lack of definite knowledge as much as the natural obstacles that brought us backand ive been troubled about the thing since we landed  jessies manner invited his confidence i wonder she said softly if you would care to tell me why  hartleys dead and i understand his daughter has broken down after nursing him its doubtful if her situation can be kept open and it may be some time before shes strong enough to look for another he hesitated in a way i feel responsible for her  you really arent responsible in the least jessie declared still i can understand the idea troubling you would you like me to help you  i can hardly ask it but it would be a relief to me vane answered with obvious eagerness  then if youll tell me her address ill go to see her and well consider what can be done  vane leaned forward impulsively you have taken a weight off my mind its difficult to thank you properly  i dont suppose it will give me any trouble of course it must be embarrassing to feel you had a helpless young woman on your hands  then a thought flashed into her mind as she remembered what she had seen at the station some months ago i wonder if the situation is an altogether unusual one to you she continued have you never let your pity run away with your judgment before  you wouldnt expect me to proclaim my charities vane objected humorously which was the only means of parrying the question that occurred to him  i think you are trying to put me off you havent given me an answer  i believe i was able to make things easier for somebody else not very long ago vane confessed reluctantly but without embarrassment i now see that i might have done harm without meaning to do so its sometimes extraordinarily difficult to help folkswhich is why im so grateful for your offer  for the next few moments jessie sat silent it was clear that she had misjudged him for although she was not one who demanded too much from human nature the fact that kitty blake had arrived in vancouver in his company had undoubtedly rankled in her mind now she acquitted him of any blame and it was a relief to do so she changed the subject abruptly  i suppose you will make another attempt to find timber she suggested  yes said vane in a week or two  he had hardly spoken when mrs nairn came in and welcomed him with her usual friendliness  im glad to see ye though yere looking thin she said why did ye not come straight to us instead of going to the hotel ye would have got as good a supper as they would give ye there  i havent a doubt of it vane declared on the other hand i hardly think even one of your suppers would quite have put right the defect in my appearance you mentioned you see the cause of it has been at work for some time  mrs nairn regarded him with halfamused compassion if yell come ower every evening well soon cure that i would have been down sooner if alec whos writing letters had not kept me there was a matter or two he wanted to ask my opinion on  i think that was very wise of him  his hostess smiled for one thing we had a letter from evelyn chisholm this afternoon shell be out to spend some time with us in about a month  evelyns coming here vane exclaimed with a sudden stirring of his heart  and why should she not come mrs nairn inquired i told ye some time ago that we partly expected her ye werena astonished then  she appeared to expect an explanation of the change in his attitude and as he volunteered none she drew him a few paces aside  if im no betraying a confidence evelyn writes that shell be glad to get away a while now ive been wondering why she should be anxious to leave home  she looked at him fixedly and to his annoyance he felt his face grow hot mrs nairn had quick perceptions and was now and then painfully direct  it struck me that evelyn was not very comfortable there he replied she seemed out of harmony with her people  mrs nairn glanced at him again with amusement in her eyes its no unlikely the reason may servefor the want of a better then she changed her tone yell away up to alec he told me to send ye  vane went out of the room but he left jessie in a thoughtful mood she had seen him start at the mention of evelyn and it struck her as significant since she had heard that he had spent some time with the chisholms on the other hand there was the obvious fact that he had been astonished to hear that evelyn was coming out which implied that their acquaintance had not progressed far enough to warrant the girls informing him besides evelyn would arrive for a month and jessie reflected that she would probably see a good deal of vane in the meanwhile she now felt glad that she had promised to look after celia hartley which would no doubt necessitate her consulting with him every now and then     chapter xix  vane foresees trouble   nairn was sitting at a writingtable when vane entered his room and after a few questions about his journey he handed the younger man one of the papers that lay in front of him  its a report from the mine he said  vane carefully studied the document  it only brings us back to our last conversation on the subject he remarked when his host glanced at him inquiringly we have the choice of going on as we are doing or extending our operations by an increase of capital in the latter case our total earnings might be larger but i hardly think there would be as good a return on the money actually sunk taking it all round i dont know what to think but if it appeared that there was a moral certainty of making a satisfactory profit on the new stock i should consent  nairn chuckled a moral certainty is no a very common thing in mining  i believe horsfields in favour of the scheme how far would you trust that man vane inquired  about as far as i could fling a bull by the tail the same thing applies to both of them  he has some influence hed find supporters  nairn saw that the meaning of his last remark which implied that he had no more confidence in jessie than he had in her brother had not been grasped by his companion but he did not consider it judicious to make it plainer instead he gave vane another piece of information horsfield and winter work into each others hands  but winter has no interest in the clermont  nairn smiled sourly he holds no shares in the mine but theres no much in the shape of mineral developments yon man has no an interest in since ye do not seem inclined to yield horsfield a point or two it might pay ye to watch the pair of them  vane who was aware that winter was a person of some importance in financial circles remained silent for a couple of minutes now he said at length every dollar we have in the clermont is usefully employed and earning a satisfactory profit of course if we put the concern on the market we might get more than it is worth from investors but that doesnt greatly appeal to me  its unnecessary to point out that a directors interest is no invariably the same as that of his shareholders nairn rejoined  its an unfortunate fact but id be no better off if i only got the same actual return on a larger amount of what would be watered stock  theres sense in that im no urging the schemethere are other points against it answered nairn  well said vane ill go up and look round the mine and then well have another talk about the matter  they changed the subject but vane walked back to his hotel in a thoughtful frame of mind and finding carroll in the smokingroom related his conversation with nairn  im a little troubled about the situation he concluded the clermont finances are now on a sound basis but it might after all prove advantageous to raise further capital and in such a case we would perhaps lie open to attack nairns inclined to be cryptic in his remarks but he seems to hint that it would be advisable to make horsfield some concessionin other words to buy him off  which is a course you have objections to  yes said vane very decided ones  i think that in a general way nairns advice is sensible where mining and other schemes are floated there are men who make a good living out of the operations theyre trained to the business theyve control of the dollars and when a new things put on the market they consider theyve the first claim on the pickings  you neednt elaborate the point vane broke in impatiently  you made your appearance in this city as a poor and unknown man with a mine to sell carroll went on disregarding tactful hints you laid down your terms and stuck to them launching your venture without considering their views you did the gentlemen ive mentioned out of their accustomed toll and ive no doubt that some of them were indignant its a thing you wouldnt expect them to sanction now however one who has probably others behind him is making overtures to you you ought to consider it a compliment a recognition of ability the question isdo you mean to slight these advances and go on as you have begun  thats my present intention vane answered  then you neednt be astonished if you find yourself up against a determined opposition by and by said carroll  i think my friends will stand by me vane looked at him steadily  thanks ive merely been pointing out what you may expect and hinting at the most judicious coursethough the latters rather against my natural inclinations id better add that ive never been particularly prudent and the opposite policy appeals to me if were forced to clear for action well nail the flag to the mast  it was spoken lightly because the man was serious but vane knew he had an ally who would support him with unflinching staunchness  im far from sure it will be needful he replied and they talked about other matters until they strolled off to their rooms  they spent the next week in the city where vane was kept occupied after which they sailed once more for the north and pushed inland until they were stopped by snow among the ranges without finding the spruce the journey proved as toilsome as the previous one and both the men were worn out when they reached the coast vane was determined on making a third attempt but he informed carroll that they would visit the mine before proceeding to vancouver they had heavy rain during the voyage down the strait and when on the day after reaching port the jaded horses they had hired plodded up the sloppy trail to the mine a pitiless deluge once more poured down on them  the light was growing dim among the dripping firs and a deeptoned roar came throbbing across their shadowy ranks by and by vane who was leading turned and glanced back at carroll  ive never heard the river so plainly before he said it must be unusually swollen  since the mine was situated on a narrow level flat between the hillside and the river carroll understood the anxiety in his comrades voice and urging the wearied horses they pressed on a little faster it was almost dark when they reached the edge of an opening in the firs and saw a cluster of ironroofed wooden buildings and a tall chimney stack in front of which the unsightly oredump extended wet and chilled and worn out as the men were there was comfort in the sight but vane noticed that a shallow lake stretched between him and the buildings on one side of it there was a broad strip of tumbling foam which rose and fell in confused upheavals and filled the forest with the roar it made vane drove his horse into the water and dismounting among the stumps before the oredump found a wet and soilstained man awaiting him a long trail of smoke floated away from the iron stack behind him and through the sound of the river there broke the clank and thud of harddriven pumps  you have got a big head of steam up salter he said  the man nodded we want it its taking me all my time to keep the water out of the workings leave your horsesill send along for themand ill show you what weve been doing after supper  id sooner go now while im wet vane answered  they went down into the mine the approach looked like a canal and they descended the shallow shaft amidst a thin cascade the tunnel they reached slanted for the lode dipped and the lights that twinkled here and there among the timbering showed shadowy halfnaked figures toiling in water which rose well up their boots further streams of it ran in from fissures and vanes face grew grave as he plodded through the flood with a lamp in his hand he spent an hour in the workings asking salter a question now and then and afterwards went back with him to one of the sheds where he dressed in dry clothes and sat down to a meal  when it was over and the table had been cleared he lay in a canvas chair beside the stove in which resinous billets snapped and crackled cheerfully the deluge roared upon the iron roof the song of the river rose and fell filling the place with sound and now and then the pounding and clanking of the pumps broke in  vane examined the sheet of figures salter handed him then he carefully turned over some of the pieces of stone the table was partly covered with  theres no doubt those specimens arent so promising and the cost of extraction is going up he said at length ill have a talk with nairn when i get back but in the meanwhile it looks as if we were going to have trouble with the water  its a thing ive been afraid of for some time salter answered we can keep down any leakage that comes in through the rocks though it means driving the pumps hard but an inrush from the river would beat us  vane let the matter drop and an hour later he retired to his wooden berth in a few minutes he was fast asleep but was awakened by a shrill note which he recognised as the whistle of the engine it was sounding the alarm and next moment he was struggling into his clothing then the door swung open and salter stood in the entrance lantern in hand with water trickling from him there was keen anxiety in his expression  floods lapping the bank top now he said theres a jamb in the narrow place at the head of the rapid and the waters backing up im going along with the boys  he vanished as suddenly as he had appeared and vane dragged on his jacket if the mine were drowned operations might be stopped for a considerable time what was more it would precipitate a crisis in the affairs of the company and necessitate an increase of its capital which he would sooner avoid  he was outside in less than a minute and stood still looking about him while the deluge lashed his face and beat his clothing against his limbs he could only make out a blurred mass of climbing trees on one side and a strip of foam cutting through the black level which he supposed was water in front of him his trained ears however gave him a little information for the clamour of the flood was broken by a sharp snapping and crashing which he knew was made by driftwood driving furiously against the boulders in that region the river banks are encumbered here and there with great logs partly burned by forest fires reaped by gales or brought down from the hillsides by falls of frostloosened soil a flood higher than usual sets them floating and on subsiding sometimes leaves them packed in a gorge or stranded in a shallow to wait for the next big rise now they were driving down and as salter had said jambing at the head of the rapid  suddenly a column of fierce white radiance leaped up lower downstream and vane knew that a big compressed air lamp had been carried to the spot where the driftwood was gathering even at a distance the brightness of the glare dazzled him so that he could see nothing else when he headed towards it he collided with a fir stump and struck it with his knee and in another minute the splashing about his feet warned him that he was entering the water having no wish to walk into the main stream he floundered to one side he was however getting nearer to the blaze and by and by he made out a swarm of figures scurrying about beneath it some of them had saws or axes for he caught the gleam of steel and broke into a run and presently carroll whom he had forgotten came up calling to him     chapter xx  the flood   when he reached the blast lamp which was raised on a tall tripod vane stood with his back to the pulsating blaze while he grasped the details of a somewhat impressive scene a little upstream of him the river leaped out of the darkness breaking into foaming waves and a wall of dripping firs flung back the roar it made the first rows of serried trunks standing out hard and sharp in the fierce white light nearer where he stood a projecting spur of rock narrowed in the river which boiled tumultuously against its foot while about halfway across the top of a giant boulder rose above the flood  vane could only just see it because a mass of driftwood which was momentarily growing stretched from bank to bank a big log drifting down sideways had brought up upon the boulder and once fixed had seized and held fast each succeeding trunk some had been driven partly out upon those that had preceded them some had been drawn beneath the latter and catching the bottom had jambed then the rest had been wedged by the current into the gathering mass trunks branches and brushwood all finding a place when the stream is strong a jamb as it is called usually extends downwards as well as rises as the water it pens back increases in depth until it forms a solid barrier from surface to bed if it occurs during a logdrive the river is choked with lumber bent figures were at work with axes at the shoreward end of the mass others had crawled out along the logs in search of another point where they could advantageously be attacked but vane watching them with practised eyes decided that they were largely throwing their toil away next he glanced downstream but powerful as the light was it did not pierce far into the darkness and the rain and the mad white rush of the rapid vanished abruptly into the surrounding gloom then he caught the clink of a hammer on a drill and seeing salter not far away strode towards him  how are you getting to work he asked  salter pointed to the foot of the rock they stood upon i reckoned if we could put a shot in yonder we might cut out stone enough to clear the butts of the larger logs that are keying up the jamb  youre wasting timestarting at the wrong place  its possible but what am i to do id sooner split that boulder or chop down to the king log there but the boys cant get across  i think i could vane answered ill try if its necessary  salter expostulated i want to point out that youre the boss director of this company i dont know what youre making out of it but you can hire men to do the kind of work you think of undertaking for three dollars a day  well let the boys try it if theyre willing vane raised his voice are any of you open to earn twenty dollars ill pay that to the man wholl put a stick of giantpowder in yonder boulder and another twenty to whoever can find the king log and chop it through  three or four of them crept cautiously along the driftwood bridge it heaved and worked beneath them the foam sluiced across it and the stream forced the thinner tops of shattered trees above the barrier it was obvious that the men were risking life and limb and there was a cry from the rest when one of them went down and momentarily disappeared he scrambled to his feet again but those behind him stopped bracing themselves against the stream kneedeep in rushing froth most of them had followed rough and dangerous occupation in the bush but they were not professional riverjacks trained to high proficiency in logdriving and one turning shouted to the watchers on the bank  this jambs not solid he explained shes working open and shutting and you cant tell where the breaks are he stooped and rubbed his leg and vane understood him to add figured i had it smashed  vane swung round towards carroll who was standing close by we give them a lead  salter ventured another remonstrance stay where you are how are you going to manage if the boys cant tackle the thing  they havent as much at stake as i have was vanes reply im a director of the company as you pointed out give me two sticks of giantpowder some fuse and detonators  after cramming the blasting material into his pocket vane called to carroll are you coming with me  since i cant stop you i suppose id better go carroll replied  they sprang down the bank vane crawled out on the working timber with carroll who carried a heavy hammer a few feet behind him the perilous bridge they traversed groaned beneath their feet but they had joined the other men before they came to any particularly troublesome opening then the cluster of wet figures was brought up by a gap filled with leaping foam in the midst of which brushwood swung to and fro and projecting branches ground on one another whether there was solid timber a foot or two beneath or only the entrance to some cavity by which the stream swept through the barrier there was nothing to show but vane set his lips and jumped he alighted on something that bore him and when the others followed floundering and splashing the deliberation which had hitherto characterised their movements suddenly deserted them they had reached the limit beyond which it was no longer useful  when they had crossed the gap vane and those behind him blundered on in hot fury they had risen to the demand on them and the curious psychic change had come now they must achieve success or face annihilation but in this there was nothing unusual it is the alternative offered to many a logdriver miner and sailorman  neither vane nor carroll nor any of those who assisted them had any clear recollection of what they did somehow they reached the boulder somehow they plied axe or ironhooked peevie while the unstable foamlapped platform rocked beneath their feet every movement entailed a peril no one could calculate but they savagely toiled on when vane began to swing a hammer above a drill or whom he got it from he did not know any more than he remembered when he had torn off and thrown away his jacket though the sticks of giantpowder which had been in his pocket lay close by upon the stone sparks sprang from the drill which carroll held and fell among the coils of snaky fuse but that did not trouble either and it was only when vane was breathless that he changed places with his companion  about them bowed figures that breathed in stertorous gasps grappled desperately with grinding smashing logs sometimes they were forced up in harsh distinctness by a dazzling glare sometimes they faded into blurred shadows as the pulsating flame upon the bank sank a little or was momentarily blown aside but all the while gorged veins rose on bronzed foreheads and toilhardened muscles were taxed to the uttermost at last when a trunk rolled beneath him carroll missed a stroke and realised with a shock of dismay that it was not the drill he had brought his hammer down upon  i couldnt help it he gasped where did i hit you  get on vane said hoarsely i can hold the drill  carroll struck for a few more minutes after which he flung down the hammer and inserted the giantpowder into the holes sunk in the stone next he lighted the fuse and warning the others they hastily recrossed the dangerous bridge they had reached the edge of the forest when a flash sprang up amidst the foam and a sharp crash was followed by a deafening drawnout uproar rending grinding smashing the jamb broke up hammered upon the partly shattered boulder and carrying it away or driving over it washed in tremendous ruin down the rapid when the wild clamour had subsided salter gave the men some instructions and then as they approached the lamp noticed vanes reddened hand  that looks a nasty smash you want to get it seen to he remarked  ill get it dressed at the settlement well make an early start tomorrow said vane we were lucky in breaking the jamb but youll have the same trouble over again any time a heavy flood brings down an unusual quantity of driftwood  its what id expect agreed salter  then something will have to be done to prevent it ill go into the matter when i reach the city  carroll and vane walked back to the shack where the former bound up his comrades injured hand and after a rest left the mine early next morning vane got his hand dressed when they reached the little mining town at the head of the railroad and on the following day they arrived in vancouver     chapter xxi  vane yields a point   the short afternoon was drawing towards its close when vane came out of a building in hastings street vancouver  the meeting went satisfactorily taking it all round he remarked to carroll who was with him  i think so agreed his companion but im far from sure that horsfield was pleased with the stockholders decision  vane nodded in a thoughtful manner after returning from the mine he had gone inland to examine a new irrigation property he had been asked to take an interest in and had only got back in time for a meeting of the clermont shareholders which nairn had arranged in his absence the meeting was just over and though vane had been forced to yield to a majority on some points he had secured the abandonment of a proposition he considered dangerous  though i dont see what the man could have gained by it im inclined to believe that if nairn and i had been absent hed have carried his reconstruction scheme he said that wouldnt have pleased me  i thought it injudicious carroll commented  it was only because we must raise more money i agreed to the issue of the new shares vane went on we ought to pay a fair dividend on such a moderate sum  you think youll get it  ive not much doubt  vane was capable and forceful but his abilities were rather of a practical than a diplomatic order and he was occasionally addicted to headstrong action knowing that he had a very cunning antagonist intriguing against him his companion had misgivings  shall we walk back to the hotel he asked  no said vane ill go across and see how celia hartleys getting on im afraid ive been forgetting her  then ill come too you may need me there are matters youre not to be trusted with alone  just then nairn came down the steps and waved his hand to them ye will no forget that mrs nairn is expecting both of ye this evening  he passed on and they set off together across the city towards the district where celia lived though the quarter in question may have been improved out of existence since some little time ago rows of lowrented shacks stood upon mounds of sweating sawdust which had been dumped into a swampy hollow leaky frail and fissured they were not the kind of places any one who could help it would choose to live in but vane found the sick girl still installed in one of the worst of them she looked pale and haggard but she was busily at work upon some millinery and the light of a tin lamp showed drayton and kitty blake sitting near her  you oughtnt to be at work you dont look fit vane said to celia and hesitated a moment before he continued im sorry we couldnt find that spruce but as i told drayton were going back to try again  the girl smiled bravely then youll find it next time im glad im able to do a little it brings a few dollars in  but what are you doing  making hats i did one for miss horsfield and afterwards friends of hers sent me some more to trim she said shed try to get me some work from one of the big stores  but youre not a milliner are you said vane who felt grateful to jessie for the practical way in which she had kept her promise to assist  celias something better kitty broke in shes a genius  the others laughed and vane anxious to turn the conversation away from miss horsfields action led them on to general chatter under cover of which he drew drayton to the door  the girl looks far from fit he said has the doctor been over lately  two or three days ago answered drayton weve been worried about her its out of the question that she should go back to the hotel and she can only manage to work a few hours daily theres another thingthe clerk of the fellow who owns these shacks has just been along for his rent its overdue  wheres he now  drayton laughed for the sounds of a vigorous altercation rose from farther up the unlighted street i guess hes yonder having some more trouble with his collecting  ill fix that matter anyway said vane who disappeared into the darkness  it was some time later when he reentered the shack and waited until a remark of celias gave him a lead  youre really a partner in the lumber scheme he said i cant see why you shouldnt draw some of your share of the proceeds beforehand  the first payment isnt to be made until you find the spruce and get your lease the girl reminded him youve already paid a hundred dollars we had no claim upon  that doesnt matter im going to find it  yes said celia with a look of confidence i think you will but and a flicker of colour crept into her thin facei cant take any more money until its done  vane failing in another attempt to shake her resolution dropped the subject and soon afterwards he and carroll took their departure they were sitting in their hotel waiting for dinner when carroll who lay in a luxurious chair looked up lazily  what are you thinking about so hard he inquired  vane glanced meaningly round the elaborately furnished room theres a contrast between all this and that rotten shack did you notice that celia never stopped sewing while we were in  i did said carroll i suppose youre going to propound another conundrum of a kind ive heard beforewhy you should have so many things you dont particularly need while miss hartley must go on sewing when shes hardly able for it in her most unpleasant shack i dont know if the fact that you found a mine answers the question but if it doesnt the things beyond your philosophy  come off vane bade him with signs of impatience your moralising gets on ones nerves anyhow i straightened out one difficultyi found the rent man whod been round worrying her and got rid of him  carroll groaned in mock dismay which covered some genuine annoyance with himself  whats the matter vane inquired do you want a drink  ill get over it carroll informed him it isnt the first time ive suffered from the same complaint but id like to point out that your chivalrous impulses may be the ruin of you some day why didnt you let drayton settle with the man you gave him a cheque i suppose  i did id only a few loose dollars on me now i see what youre driving at and i want to say that any little reputation i possess can pretty well take care of itself  just so no doubt it will be necessary but youre not the only person concerned  but whos likely to take notice of the thing  i cant tell but you make enemies as well as friends and youre walking in slippery places which youre not altogether accustomed to you cant meet your difficulties with the axe here  thats true assented vane and they went in to dinner  after the meal they walked across to nairns and when they had been ushered into a room in which several other guests were assembled vane sat down on a sofa beside jessie horsfield  i want to thank you i was over at miss hartleys this afternoon he began  i understood you were at the mining meeting  so i was your brother would tell that  vane broke off remembering that he had defeated horsfield  you were opposed to him but it doesnt follow that i share all his views perhaps i ought to be a stauncher partisan  if youll be just to both of us ill be satisfied  i suppose that means youre convinced of the equity of your cause she suggested  i expect i deserve the rebuke but arent you trying to switch me off the subject vane answered with a laugh its celia hartley i want to talk about  he did her injustice jessie felt that she had earned his gratitude and she had no objection to his expressing it  it was a happy thought of yours to give her hats and things to make im ever so much obliged to you i felt you could be trusted to think of the right thing an ingenious idea of that kind would never have occurred to me  it was very simple i noticed a hat and dress of hers which she owned she had made the girl has some talent im only sorry i cant keep her busy  couldnt you give her an order for a dozen hats id be glad to be responsible  the difficulty would be the disposal of them they would be of no use to you and i couldnt allow you to present them to me  i wish i could vane declared you certainly deserve them  this was satisfactory so far as it went though jessie would have preferred that his desire to bestow the favour should have sprung from some other motive than a recognition of her services to celia hartley she was however convinced that his only feeling towards the girl was one of compassion then she saw that he was looking at her with halfhumorous annoyance in his face  are you grieved i wont take those hats she asked  i am vane confessed and proceeded to explain with unnecessary ingenuousness im still more vexed with the state of things its typical ofi suppose i mean the restrictedness of this civilised life when you want to do anything in the bush you take the axe and set about it but here youre continually running up against some artificial obstacle  one understands that its worse in england said jessie but in regard to miss hartley ill recommend her to my friends as far as i can  just then vane made an abrupt movement and jessie realised by his expression that he had suddenly become oblivious of her presence she had no doubt about the reason for this because evelyn chisholm entered the room the lamplight fell upon her as she crossed the threshold and jessie recognised unwillingly that she looked surprisingly handsome handsome however was not the word vane would have used he thought evelyn looked exotic highly cultivated strangely refined as though she had grown up in a rarefied atmosphere in which nothing rank could thrive though evelyn had her faults the impression she made on him was perhaps more or less justifiable  then he remembered that the girl had been offered to him and he had refused the gift he wondered how he had exerted the necessary strength of will for he was conscious that admiration respect pity had now changed and melted into sudden passion his blood tingled and as it happened no change of his expression was lost upon his companion  laying a check upon his thoughts he resumed a desultory conversation with jessie though he betrayed himself several times during it and at length she let him go it was however some time before he secured a place beside evelyn he was now quiet and selfcontained  nairn promised me a surprise this evening but it has exceeded all my expectations he said how are your people  evelyn informed him that their health was satisfactory and added watching him the while gerald sent his best remembrances  ah said vane in a casual manner im glad to have them  evelyn was now convinced that mabel had been correct in concluding that he had assisted gerald financially though she was aware that nothing would induce either of the men to acquaint her with the fact  i understood from mrs nairn that you were away in the bush she said  he turned and regarded her steadily that was the case and im shortly going off again perhaps its fortunate that i may be away some time it will leave you more at ease  the last remark was more of a question than an assertion and evelyn knew the man could be direct she also esteemed candour  no she said i wouldnt wish you to think thatand i wouldnt like to believe that i had anything to do with driving you away  vane saw a faintly warmer tone show through the clear pallor of her skin but while his heart beat faster than usual he felt that she meant just what she said and nothing more he must proceed with caution which was on the whole foreign to him and shortly afterwards he left her  when he had gone evelyn sat thinking about him she had shrunk from the man in rebellious alarm when her parents would have bestowed her hand on him but even then and undoubtedly afterwards she had felt that there was something in his nature which would have attracted her had she been willing to allow it to do so now though he had said nothing to rouse it the feeling was stronger then she remembered with a rather curious smile her fathers indignation when vane had withdrawn from the field he had done this because she had appealed to his generosity and she had been grateful to him but unreasonable as she admitted the faint resentment she was conscious of to be the recollection of the fact that he had yielded to her wishes was somehow bitter  in the meanwhile carroll had taken his place by jessies side  i understand you steered your comrade satisfactorily through the meeting today she began  no objected carroll i cant claim any credit for doing so in matters of the kind vane takes full control and im willing to own that he drove us all including your brother on the course he chose  then its in other matters you exercise a little judicious pressure on the helm  the man looked at her in wellassumed admiration of her keenness i dont know how you guessed it but i suppose its a fact its however an open secret that vanes now and then unguardedly ingenuous indeed there are respects in which hes a babe by comparison well say with either of us  thats rather a dubious compliment jessie informed him what do you think of miss chisholm i suppose you saw a good deal of her in england  i spent a month or two in her company so did vane i fancy shes rather like him in several ways and there are reasons for believing that he thinks a good deal of her  having watched vane carefully when evelyn came in jessie was inclined to agree with him and she glanced round the room one or two people were moving about and the rest were talking in little groups but there was nobody very near and she fancied that she and her companion were safe from interruption  what were some of the reasons she asked  carroll had expected some question of this description and had decided to answer it plainly because it seemed probable that jessie would get the information out of him in one way or another he had also another motive which he thought a commendable one jessie had obviously taken a certain interest in vane but it could not have gone very far as yet and vane did not reciprocate it the latter was however impulsive while jessie was calculating and clever and carroll who was slightly afraid of her foresaw that complications might follow any increase of friendliness between her and his comrade he thought it would be better if she left vane alone  well he said since you have asked ill try to tell you  he proceeded to recount what had passed at the dene and jessie listened with an expressionless face  so he gave her upbecause he admired her she said at length  thats my view of it carroll agreed  jessie made no comment but he felt that she was hardly hit which was not what he had anticipated he began to wonder if he had acted judiciously and he glanced about the room it did not seem considerate to study her expression then a few moments later she turned to him with a smile in which there was the faintest hint of strain  i daresay you are right but there are one or two people i havent spoken to she said and moved away from him  some time after this mrs nairn came upon carroll standing for the moment alone its no often one sees ye looking moody she informed him was jessie no gracious  that said carroll smiling is not the difficulty im an unsusceptible and somewhat inconspicuous person not worth powder and shot so to speak for which im sometimes thankful i believe it saves me a good deal of trouble  then is it something vane has done that is on your mind doubtless ye feel him a responsibility  hes all that carroll confessed still you see ive constituted myself his guardian i dont know why because hed probably be very vexed if he suspected it  the gods give ye a good conceit o yourself mrs nairn exclaimed  i need it said carroll humbly this afternoon i let him do a most injudicious thing and now ive done another which i fear is worse on the whole i think id better take him away to the bush hed be safer there  ye will not no just now declared his hostess firmly  carroll made a sign of resignation oh well he said if you say so im quite willing to stand out and let things alone too many cooks are apt to spoil the kail  mrs nairn left him but she afterwards once or twice glanced thoughtfully at vane and evelyn who had once more drawn together     chapter xxii  evelyn goes for a sail   it was about the middle of the morning and vane sat in nairns office specimens of ore lately received from the mine were scattered about a table and nairn had some papers in his hand  weel he said when vane after examining two or three of the stones abruptly flung them down  the ores running poorer vane admitted on the other hand i partly expected this and theres better stuff in the reef were a little too high i look for more encouraging results when we start the lower heading  he went into details of the new operations and when he had finished nairn who had been jotting down some figures looked up  yon workings will cost a good deal he pointed out yell no be able to make a start until were sure of the money  we ought to get it  a month or two ago i would have agreed with ye but general investors are kittle cattle and the applications for the new stock are no numerous  the plain english of it is that the mine is not so popular as it was said vane impatiently  im thinking something of the kind nairn agreed and then proceeded with a cautious explanation the result of the first reduction and the way ye forced the concern on the market secured ye notice folks put their money on ye looking for sensational developments and when the latter are no forthcoming they feel a bit sore  theres nothing discouraging in our accounts even if the ore all ran as poor as thatvane pointed to the specimens on the tablethe mine could be worked on a paying basis we have issued no statements that could spread alarm  just so said nairn what was looked for was mair than a paying basisye have no come up to expectations forby its my opinion that damaging reports have somehow leaked out from the mine i see clouds on the horizon  bendle pledged himself to take up a big block of the shares pointed out vane if howitson does the same as he said he would our position would be secure as soon as it was known that they were largely interested others would follow them  now ye have it in a nutshellit would put a wet blanket on the project if they both backed down in the meanwhile we cannot hurry them  vane rose well leave it at that ive promised to take mrs nairn and miss chisholm for a sail  he went out and had got rid of the slight uneasiness the interview had occasioned him before he reached the waterfront where he found mrs nairn and evelyn awaiting him with carroll in attendance in another few minutes they were rowing off to the sloop and as they approached her the elder lady glanced with approval at the craft which swam a gleaming ivory shape upon the shining green brine  ye have surely been painting the boat she said was that for us  vane disregarded the last question she wanted it and paints comparatively cheap  it was a little thing but evelyn was pleased the girls had not been greatly considered at the dene and it was flattering to recognise that the man had thought it worth while to decorate his craft in her honour she did not ask herself if he had wished to please her he had invited her for a sail some days ago and he was thorough in everything he did he handed her and mrs nairn on board and when they sat down in the well he and carroll proceeded to hoist the mainsail it looked exceedingly large as it thrashed and fluttered above their heads and there seemed to be a bewildering quantity of ropes but evelyn was chiefly interested in watching vane  he was wonderfully quick but no movement was wasted his face was intent his glances sharp and she liked the crisp curt way in which he spoke to carroll the mans task was in one sense not important but he was absorbed in it then while carroll slipped the moorings he ran up the headsails and springing aft seized the tiller as the boat slanting over began to forge through the water it was the first time evelyn had ever travelled under sail and receptive as she was of all new impressions she sat silent a few minutes rejoicing in the sense of swift and easy motion the inlet was crisped by small white ripples and the boat with her boom broad off on her quarter drove through them a sparkling wedge of foam on her lee bow and a stream of froth sluicing past her sides overhead the great inclined sail cut sharply white against the dazzling blue and close by her vane sat gripping the tiller  they swept out through the gate of the narrows and vane luffed the boat up to a moderately fresh breeze its off the land and well have fairly smooth water he explained and added how do you like sailing  its glorious on a day like this she declared and looked back towards the distant snow if anything more were wanted there are the mountains too  vane smiled but there was a suggestive sparkle in his eyes yes he said we have them both and thats something to be thankful for the sea and the mountains the two grandest things in this world  if you think that how did you reconcile yourself to the city  im not sure ive done so he indicated the gleaming heights im going back up yonder very soon  mrs nairn glanced at carroll who affected to be busy with a rope then she turned to vane it will no be possible with winter coming on  its not really so bad then vane declared besides i expect to get my work done before the hardest weathers due  but ye cannot leave vancouver until ye have settled about the mine  i dont want to vane admitted thats not quite the same thing  it is with a good many people carroll interposed with a smile  in the meanwhile they were driving out to the southwards opening up the strait with the forests to port growing smaller and the short seas increasing in size the breeze was cold but the girl was warmly clad and the easy motion in no way troubled her the rush of keen salt air stirred her blood and all round her were spread wonderful harmonies of silverlaced blue and green through which the straining fabric that carried her swept on the mountains were majestic but except when tempests lashed their crags or torrents swept their lower slopes they were wrapped in eternal repose the sea was filled with ecstatic motion  the hills have their fascination its a thing i know she said to draw the helmsman out i think i should like the sea too but at first sight its charm isnt quite so plain  you have started him interposed carroll he wont refuse that challenge  vane accepted it with a smile which meant more than goodhumoured indulgence well he began the seas the same everywhere unbridled unchanging a force that remains as it was in the beginning once youre out of harbour under sail you have done with civilisation it has possibly provided you with excellent gear but it can do no more you stand alone stripped for the struggle with the elements  is it always a struggle evelyn asked to prompt him  always the seas as treacherous as the winds that vex it pitiless murderous when you have only sail to trust to you can never relax your vigilance you must watch the varying drift of clouds and the swing of the certain tides theres nothing and nobody to fall back upon when the breeze pipes its challenge you have sloughed off civilisation and must stand or fall by the raw natural powers man is born with and chief among them is the capacity for brutal labour the thrashing sail must be mastered the tackle cracking with the strain must be hauled in perhaps thats the charm of it for some of us whose lives are pretty smoothit takes one back as i said to the beginning  but havent human progress and machines made everybodys lives more smooth  vane laughed somewhat grimly oh no i think that can never be done so far somebody pays for the others ease at sea in the mine and in the bush man still grapples with a rugged naked world  the girl was pleased she had drawn him out and she thought he had in speaking kept a fair balance between too crude a mode of colloquial expression and poetic elaboration there was she knew a vein of poetic conception in him and the struggle he had hinted at could only be described fittingly in heroic language it was in one sense a pity that those who had the gift of it and cultivated imagination had for the most part never been forced into the fight but that was perhaps not a matter of much importance there were plenty of men such as her companion endowed with endurance who if they seldom gave their thoughts free rein rejoiced in the struggle and by them the worlds sternest work was done  after all she said we have the mountains in civilised england  vane did not respond with the same freedom this time he was inclined to think he had spoken too unrestrainedly  yes he agreed smiling you can walk about themwhere you wont disturb the grouseand theyre grand enough but if you look down you can see the motor dust trails and the tourist coaches in the valleys  but why shouldnt people enjoy themselves in that way  i cant think of any reason no doubt most of them have earned the right to do so but you cant rip up those hills with giantpowder where you feel inclined or set to work to root out some miles of forest the government encourages that kind of thing here  and thats the charm  yes said vane i suppose it is  id better explain carroll broke in men of a certain temperament are apt to fall a prey to fantasies in the newer lands any common sense they once possessed seems to desert them after that theyre never happy except when theyre ripping thingssuch as big rocks and treesto pieces and though theyll tell you its only to get out minerals or clear a ranch theyre wrong once they get the mine or ranch they dont care about it and set to work wrecking things again isnt that so mrs nairn  there are such crazy bodies agreed thelady i know one or two but if i had my way with them they should find one mine or build one sawmill  and then said carroll you would chain them up for good by marrying them  i would like to try but im no sure it would act in every case i have come across some women as bad as the men they would drive their husbands on maybeand she smiled in a halfwistful mannerits as well to do something worth the remembering when ye are young theres a long time to sit still in afterwards  half in banter and half in earnest they had given evelyn a hint of the master passion of the true colonist whose pride is in his burden afterwards mrs nairn led the conversation until carroll laid out in the saloon a somewhat elaborate lunch which he had brought from the hotel then the others went below leaving vane at the helm and carroll looked at him ruefully when they came up again  im afraid miss chisholms disappointed he explained  no said evelyn that would be most ungrateful i only expected a more characteristic example of sea cookery after what mr vane told us a lunch like the one you provided with glass and silver struck me as rather an anachronism  its better to be broken in to sea cookery gently vane interposed with some dryness  its a poor compliment to take it for granted that were afraid of a little hardship besides i dont think youre right  vane who left the helm to carroll went below and the latter smiled at evelyn  he wont be long he informed her he hasnt got rid of his primitive habits yet  vane came up satisfied in about ten minutes and glancing about him before he resumed the helm noticed that it was blowing fresher but it did not inconvenience the party and as they ran homewards the breeze gradually died away the broad inlet lay still in the moonlight when they crept across it with the water lapping very faintly about the bows and it was over a mirrorlike surface they rowed ashore nairn was waiting at the foot of the steps and evelyn walked back with him feeling she could not tell exactly why that she had been drawn closer to the sloops helmsman     chapter xxiii  vane proves obdurate   vane spent two or three weeks very pleasantly in vancouver for evelyn of whom he saw a good deal was gracious to him the embarrassment both had felt on their first meeting in the western city had speedily vanished they had resumed their acquaintance on what was ostensibly a purely friendly footing and since both avoided any reference to what had taken place in england it had ripened into a mutual confidence  this would have been less probable in the older country where they would have been continually reminded of what the chisholm family had expected of them but the past seldom counts for much in the new and changeful west whose inhabitants look forward to the future indeed there is something in its atmosphere which banishes regret and retrospection and when evelyn looked back at all she felt inclined to wonder why she had once been so troubled by the mans satisfaction with her company she decided that this could not have been the result of any aversion from him and that it was merely an instinctive revolt against the part her parents had wished to force upon her chisholm and his wife had blundered as such people often do for it is possible that had they adopted a perfectly neutral attitude everything would have gone as they desired  their mistake was nevertheless a natural one somewhat exaggerated reports of vanes prosperity had reached them but while they coveted the advantages his wealth might offer their daughter in their secret hearts they looked upon him as something of a barbarian which idea the opinions he occasionally expressed in their hearing did not dispel both feared that evelyn regarded him in the same light and it accordingly became evident that a little pressure might be required in spite of their prejudices they did not shrink from applying it  in the meanwhile several people in vancouver watched the increase of friendliness between the girl and vane mrs nairn and her husband did so with benevolent interest and it was by the formers adroit management which evelyn did not often suspect that they were thrown more and more into each others company jessie horsfield however looked on with bitterness she was a strongwilled young woman who had hitherto generally contrived to obtain what she had set her heart upon and she had set it upon this man indeed she had fancied that he returned the feeling but disillusionment had come on the evening when he had unexpectedly met evelyn her resentment against the girl grew steadily stronger until it threatened to prove dangerous on opportunity  there were however days when vane was disturbed in mind winter was coming on and although it is rarely severe on the southern seaboard it is by no means the season one would choose for an adventure among the ranges of the northern wilderness unless he made his search for the spruce very shortly he might be compelled to postpone it until the spring at the risk of being forestalled but there were two reasons which detained him he thought he was gaining ground in evelyns esteem and he feared the effect of absence while there was no doubt that the new issue of the clermont shares was in very slack demand to leave the city might cost him a good deal but he had pledged himself to go  the latter fact was uppermost in his mind one evening when he set off to call upon celia hartley and as it happened evelyn and mrs nairn were driving past as he turned off from a busy street towards the quarter in which she lived it had been dark some little time but evelyn had no difficulty in recognising him indeed she watched him for a few moments while he passed on into a more shadowy region where the gloom and dilapidation of the first small frame houses were noticeable and she wondered what kind of people inhabited it she did not think mrs nairn had noticed vane  you have never taken me into the district on our left she said  im no likely to was the answer were no proud of it  i suppose the chinese and other aliens live there evelyn suggested  they do said mrs nairn with some dryness im no sure however that theyre the worst  but one understands that you havent a criminal population  we have folks whore on the fringe of it only we see they live all together people who would be respectable live somewhere else except a few who have to consider cheapness but its no a recommendation to be seen going into yon quarter after dark  this left evelyn thoughtful since she had undoubtedly seen vane going there she considered herself a judge of character and generally trusted her intuitions and she believed the mans visit to the neighbourhood in question admitted of some satisfactory explanation on the other hand she felt that her friends should be beyond suspicion taking it all round she was rather vexed with vane and it cost her some trouble to drive the matter out of her mind though she succeeded in doing so  she did not see vane next day but the latter called upon nairn at his office during the afternoon  have you had any more applications for the new stock he asked  i have not said nairn neither bendle nor howiston has paid up yet  investors are shy thats a fact vane confessed its unfortunate ive already put off my trip north as long as possible i wanted to see things on a satisfactory basis before i went  a prudent wish i would advise ye to carry it out  what do you mean by that  something like this if the moneys no forthcoming we may be compelled to fall back upon a different plan and unless yere to the fore the decision of a shareholders meeting might not suit ye considering the position and the stock ye hold any views ye might express would carry mair weight than mine could do in your absence  vane drummed with his fingers on the table i suppose thats the case but ive got to make the journey with moderately good fortune it shouldnt take me long  ye would be running some risk if anything delayed ye and we had to call a meeting before ye got back  i see that but it cant be helped i expect to be back before im wanted anyway i could leave you authority to act on my behalf  after a further attempt to dissuade him nairn spread out one hand resignedly he who will to cupar maun be left to gang he said whiles i have wondered why any one should be so keen on getting there but doubtless a douce scottish town has mair attractions for a sensible person than the rugged northwest in winter time  vane who smiled at this went out and left him and when he reached home nairn briefly recounted the interview to his wife over his evening meal evelyn who was with them listened attentively  yon man will no hear reason nairn concluded hes thrawn  evelyn had already noticed that her host for whom she had a strong liking spoke broader scots when he was either amused or angry and she supposed that vanes determination disturbed him  but why should he persist in leaving the city when its to his disadvantage to do so as you lead one to believe it is she asked  if the latters no absolutely certain its very likely nairn informed her  you have only answered half my question evelyn pointed out  mrs nairn smiled alec she said is reserved by nature but if yere anxious for an answer i might tell ye  anxious hardly describes it evelyn replied  then well say curious the fact is vane made a bargain with a sick prospector in which he undertook to locate some timber the man had discovered away among the mountains he was to pay the other a share of its value when he got his government licence  is the timber very valuable  no broke in nairn one might make a fair business profit out of pulping it though the things far from certain  then why is mr vane so keen on finding it  the question gave mrs nairn a lead but she decided to say no more than was necessary the prospector died but that bound the bargain tighter in vanes opinion the man died without a dollar leaving a daughter wornout and ill with nursing him according to the arrangement his share will go to the girl  then said evelyn mr vane is really undertaking the search in order to keep his promise to a man who is dead and he will not even postpone it because if he did so this penniless girl might perhaps lose her share isnt that rather fine of him  on the whole ye understand the position nairn agreed if ye desire my view of the matter i would merely say that yons the kind of man he is  evelyn made no further comment though the last common phrase struck her as a most eloquent tribute she had heard vane confess that he did not want to go north at present and she now understood that to do so might jeopardise his interests in the mine but he was undoubtedly going he meant to keep his promisethis was what one would expect of him  as it happened he took her for a drive among the stanley pines one mild afternoon a few days later and though she knew she would regret his departure she was unusually friendly vane rejoiced at it but he had already decided that he must endeavour to proceed with caution and content himself in the meanwhile with the part of trusted companion for this reason he chatted lightly which he felt was safer during most of the drive but he once or twice responded without reserve when by chance or design she asked a leading question  i wonder if you ever feel any regret at having left england for this country she said  i did so pretty often when i first came out he answered in those days i had to work in icy water and carry massive lumps of rock  i dare say regret was a very natural feeling then but that wasnt quite what i meant  so i supposed vane confessed well id better own that when i spent a week or two in englandat the denei began to think i missed a good deal by not staying at home it struck me that the life you led had a singular charm everything went so smoothly there among the sheltering hills one felt that care and anxiety could not creep in somehow the place reminded me of avalon  the impression was by no means correct said evelyn but i dont think you have finished wont you go on  then if i get out of my depth you mustnt blame me by and by i discovered that charm wasnt the right wordthe place was permeated with a narcotic spell  narcotic said evelyn do you think the terms more appropriate  i do vane declared narcotics one understands are insidious things if you take them regularly in small doses they increase their hold on you until you become wrapped up in dreams and unrealities if however you get too big a dose at the beginning it leads to a vigorous revulsion its natures warning and remedy  youre not flattering said evelyn but i almost fancy you are right  we are told that man was made to struggle to use all his powers if he rests too long beside the still backwaters of life in fairylike dales theyre apt to atrophy and he finds himself slack and nerveless when he goes out to face the world again  evelyn nodded for she had felt and striven against the insidious influence he spoke of she had now and then left the drowsy dale for a while but the life she had then caught glimpses of was equally sheltered one possible only to the favoured few even the echoes of the real tense struggle seldom passed its boundaries  but you confessed not long ago that you loved the western wilderness she said you have spent a good deal of time in it you expect to do so again after all isnt that only exchanging one beautiful tranquil region for another the bush must be even quieter than the english dales  i expect i havent made the point quite clear when one goes up into the bush its not to lounge and dream there but to make war upon it with the axe and drill he pulled up his team and pointed to a clump of giant trees look here thats natures challenge to man in this country  evelyn confessed that it was a very impressive one the great trunks ran up far aloft tremendous columns before their higher portions were lost in the vaulted roof of sombre greenery they dwarfed the rig and team she felt herself a pigmy by comparison  theyre rather bigger than the average her companion resumed still thats the kind of thing you run up against when you buy land to make a ranch of or clear the ground for a mine chopping sawing up splitting those giants doesnt fill one with languorous dreams the only ones our axemen indulge in materialise its a bracing struggle there are leagues and leagues of trees shrouding the valleys in a shadow that has lasted since the world was young but you see the dawn of a wonderful future breaking in as the long ranks go down  once more without clearly intending it he had stirred the girl he had not spoken in that rather fanciful style to impress her she thought he had trusting in her comprehension merely given his ideas free rein but in doing so he had somehow made her hear the clear trumpetcall to action which for such men rings through the roar of the river and the song of the tall black pines  ah she said i dare say its a fine life in many ways but it must have its drawbacks the flesh must shrink from them  the flesh he said and laughed in this land it takes second placeexcept perhaps in the cities then he turned and looked at her curiously why should you talk of shrinking the bush couldnt daunt you you have courage  the girls eyes sparkled but it was not at the compliment his words rang with freedom the freedom of the heights where heroic effort was the rule in place of luxury she longed now as she had often done to escape from bondage to break away  ah well she said halfwistfully i expect its fortunate that such courage as i have may never be put to the test  though reticence was difficult vane made no comment he had spoken unguardedly already and he had decided that caution was desirable as it happened an automobile came up when he restarted his team and he looked round as he drove on again  its curious that i never heard the thing he said  i didnt either said evelyn and added as if any explanation were needed i was too engrossed in the trees but i think miss horsfield was in it  was she said vane in a very casual manner and evelyn for no reason that she was willing to admit was pleased  she had not been mistaken jessie horsfield was in the automobile and she had had a few moments in which to study vane and his companion the mans look and the girls expression had struck her as significant and her lips set ominously tight as the car sped on she felt she almost hated vane and there was no doubt that she entirely hated the girl at his side     chapter xxiv  jessie strikes   it was the afternoon before vanes departure for the north and evelyn sitting alone for the time being in mrs nairns drawingroom felt disturbed by the thought of it she sympathised with his object but she supposed there was a certain risk attached to the journey and that troubled her in addition to this there was another point on which she was not altogether pleased she had twice seen vane acknowledge a bow from a very pretty girl whose general appearance suggested that she did not belong to evelyns own walk of life and that very morning she had noticed him crossing a street in the young womans company vane as it happened had met kitty blake by accident and had asked her to accompany him on a visit to celia  evelyn did not think she was of a jealous disposition and jealousy appeared irrational in the case of a man whom she had dismissed as a suitor but the thing rankled in her mind while she considered it jessie horsfield entered the room  im here by invitation to join vanes other old friends in giving him a good sendoff she explained  evelyn noticed that jessie laid some stress upon her acquaintance with vane and wondered if she had any motive for doing so  i suppose you have known him for some time she said  oh yes was the careless answer my brother was one of the first to take him up when he came to vancouver  the phrase jarred on evelyn it savoured of patronage besides she did not like to think that vane owed anything to the horsfields  though i dont know much about it i understood they were opposed to each other she said coldly  their business interests dont coincide but it doesnt follow that they should disagree about anything else my brother did all he could to dissuade vane from going on with his search for the timber until the winter was over  i think it is rather fine of him to persist in it evelyn declared  jessie smiled though she felt venomous just then yes she agreed one undoubtedly feels that besides the things so characteristic of him the mans impulsively generous and not easily daunted he possesses many of the rudimentary virtues as well as some of the corresponding weaknesses which is very much what one would look for  what do you mean by that evelyn inquired suppressing her resentment though she was not prepared to pose as vanes advocate she was conscious of a growing antagonism against her companion  its difficult to explain and i dont know that the subjects worth discussing said jessie however what i think i meant was thisvanes of a type thats not uncommon in the west and its a type one finds interesting hes forcibly elementary which is the only way i can express it the restraints the rest of us submit to dont bind him he breaks through them  this so evelyn fancied was more or less correct indeed the mans disregard of hampering customs had pleased her but she allowed that some restraints were needful as it happened her companion followed up the same train of thought  when one breaks down or gets over fences its necessary to discriminate she went on lightly men of the berserker type however are more addicted to going straight through the lot in a way theyre consistenthaving smashed one barrier why should they respect the next  jessie as she was quite aware was playing a dangerous game one that might afterwards be exposed still the latter possibility was of less account because detection would come too late if she were successful she was acquainted with the salient points of evelyns character  theyre consistent if not always very logical she concluded after a pause one endeavours to make allowances for men of that description  something in her tone roused evelyn to sudden imperious anger it was intolerable that this woman should offer excuses for vane  what particular allowances do you feel it needful to make in mr vanes case she asked  now she was faced by the direct question jessie hesitated as a rule she was subtle but she could be ruthlessly frank and she was possessed by a hatred of the girl beside her  you have forced me to an explanation she expostulated the fact is that while he has a room at the hotel he has anestablishmentin a different neighbourhood unfortunately what you could best describe as a latin quarter is a feature of some western towns  it was a shock to evelyn one she found it hard to face though she was not convinced the last piece of information agreed with something mrs nairn had told her but although she had on one occasion had the testimony of her eyes in support of it jessies first statement sounded incredible  its impossible she declared  jessie smiled in a bitter manner its unpleasant but it cant be denied he undoubtedly pays the rent of a shack in the neighbourhood i mentioned  evelyn sat tensely still for a moment or two she dared not give rein to her feelings she would not betray herself but composure was extremely difficult  if that is so how is it that he is received everywhereat your house and by mrs nairn she asked  jessie shrugged her shoulders people in general are the more or less charitable in the case of a successful man apart from that mr vane has a good many excellent qualities as i said one has to make allowances  just then to evelyns relief mrs nairn came in and though the girl suffered during the time it was half an hour before she could find an excuse for slipping away alone then sitting in the gathering darkness in her own room she set herself to consider as dispassionately as possible what she had heard it was exceedingly difficult to believe the charge but jessies assertion was definite enough and one which if incorrect could be readily disproved nobody would say such a thing unless it could be substantiated and that led evelyn to consider why jessie had given her the information she had obviously done so with at least a trace of malice but this could hardly have sprung from jealousy because evelyn could not think that a woman would vilify a man for whom she had any tenderness besides she had seen vane entering the part of the town indicated where he could not have had any legitimate business hateful as the suspicion was it could not be contemptuously dismissed then she granted that she had no right to censure the man he was not accountable to her for his conduct but calm reasoning carried her no farther she was once more filled with intolerable disgust and burning indignation somehow she had come to believe in vane and he had turned out an impostor  it was about an hour later when vane and carroll entered the house with nairn and proceeded to the latters room where he offered them cigars  so yere all ready to sail the morn he said  vane who nodded handed him some papers theres your authority to act in my name if its required i expect to be back before theres much change in the situation but ill call at nanaimo where you can wire me if anything turns up during the three days it may take us to get there  i suppose theres no use in my saying anything more now but i cant help pointing out that as head of the concern you have a certain duty to the shareholders which you seem inclined to disregard carroll remarked  ive no doubt their interests will be as safe in nairns hands as in mine vane rejoined  i fail to see why ye could no have let the whole thing stand over until the spring said nairn the spruce winna run away  id have done so had it been a few years earlier but the whole country is overrun with mineral prospectors and timberrighters now every months delay gives somebody else a chance of getting in ahead of me  weel said nairn resignedly i can only wish ye luck but should ye be detained up yonder if one of ye could sail across to comox to see if theres any mail there it would be wise to do so he waved his hand no more of that well consider what tactics i had better adopt in case of delay  an hour had passed before they went down to join the guests who were arriving for the evening meal as a rule the western business man who is more or less engrossed in his occupation except when he is asleep enjoys little privacy and his friends sometimes compared nairns dwelling to the rotunda of an hotel the point of this was that people of all descriptions who have nothing better to do are addicted to strolling into the combined bazaar and lounge which is attached to many canadian hostelries  as it happened vane sat next to evelyn at table but after a quiet reply to his first observation she turned and talked to the man on her other side since the latter who was elderly and dull had only two topicsthe most efficient means of desiccating fruit and the lack of railroad facilitiesvane was somewhat astonished that she appeared interested in his conversation and by and by he tried again he was not more successful this time and his face grew warm as he realised that evelyn was not inclined to talk to him being a very ordinary mortal and not particularly patient he was sensible of some indignation which was not diminished when on looking round jessie horsfield who sat opposite favoured him with a compassionate smile he took his part in the general conversation however and the meal was over and the guests were scattered about the adjoining rooms when after impatiently waiting for the opportunity he found evelyn alone she was standing with one hand on a table looking rather thoughtful  ive come to ask what ive done he began  evelyn who was not prepared for this blunt directness felt disconcerted but she broke into a chilly smile  the questions rather indefinite isnt it she said do you expect me to be acquainted with all your recent actions  then ill put the thing in another waydo you mind telling me how i have offended you  the girl almost wished that she could do so appearances were badly against him but she felt that if he declared himself innocent she could take his word in the face of overwhelming testimony to the contrary unfortunately however it was unthinkable that she should plainly state the charge  do you suppose i should feel warranted in forming any opinion upon your conduct she retorted  but you have formed one and it isnt favourable  the girl hesitated a moment but she had the courage of her convictions and she felt impelled to make some protest  that she said looking him in the eyes is perfectly true  he looked more puzzled than guilty and once more she chafed against the fact that she could give him no opportunity of defending himself  well he said im sorry but it brings us back to my first question  the situation was becoming painful as well as embarrassing and evelyn perhaps unreasonably grew more angry with the man  im afraid she said you are either clever at dissembling or have no imagination  vane held himself in hand with an effort i dare say youre right on the latter point he informed her its a fact im sometimes thankful for it leaves one more free to go straight ahead now as i see the driedfruit man coming in search of you and you evidently dont mean to answer me i cant urge the matter  he turned away and left her wondering why he had abandoned his usual persistency unless it was that an uneasy conscience had driven him from the field it did not occur to her that the man had under strong provocation merely yielded to the prompting of a somewhat hasty temper in the meanwhile he crossed the room in an absentminded manner and presently found himself near jessie who made room for him at her side  it looks as if you were in disgrace tonight she said and waited with concealed impatience for his answer if evelyn had been clever or bold enough to give him a hint as to what he was suspected of jessie foresaw undesirable complications  i think i am he owned without reflection the trouble is that while i may deserve it on general grounds im unconscious of having done anything very reprehensible in particular  jessie was sensible of considerable relief the man was sore and resentful he would not press evelyn for an explanation and the breach would widen in the meanwhile she must play her cards skilfully  then that fact should sustain you she rejoined we shall miss you after tomorrow more than one of us of course its too late to tell you that you were not altogether wise in resolving to go  everybody has been telling me the same thing for the last few weeks vane informed her  then ill only wish you every success its a pity bendle and the other man havent paid up yet  she met his surprised look with an engaging smile you neednt be astonished theres not very much goes on in the city that i dont hear aboutyou know how men talk business here and its interesting to look on even when one cant actually take a hand in the game its said the watchers sometimes see most of it  to tell the truth its the uncertainty as to what those two men might do that has been chiefly worrying me  i believe i understand the position theyve been hanging fire havent they but ive reasons for believing theyll come to a decision before very long  vane looked troubled thats interesting but i ought to warn you that your brother  ive no intention of giving him away and as a matter of fact i think you are a little prejudiced against him after all hes not your greatest danger theres a cabal against you among your shareholders  she knew by the way he looked at her that he admired her acumen yes he agreed ive suspected that  there are two courses open to you the first is to put off your expedition  the answer was to the effect she had anticipated i cant do so for several reasons  the other is to call at nanaimo and wait until well say next thursday if theres need for you to come back i think it will arise by then but it might be better if you called at comox tooafter you leave the latter youll be unreachable well if it seems necessary ill send you a warning if you hear nothing you can go on  vane reflected hastily jessie as she had told him had opportunities of picking up valuable information about the business done in that city and he had confidence in her  thank you he said it will be the second service you have done me and i appreciate it anyway i promised nairn id call at nanaimo in there was a wire from him  its a bargain and now well talk of something else said jessie and she drew him into an exchange of badinage until noticing that evelyn once or twice glanced at her with some astonishment she presently got rid of him she could understand evelyns attitude and did not wish her friendliness with the offender to appear unnatural after what she had said about him  at length the guests began to leave but most of them had gone when vane rose to take his departure his host and hostess went with him to the door but though he once or twice glanced round eagerly there was no sign of evelyn he lingered a few moments on the threshold after mrs nairn had given him a kindly sendoff but nobody appeared in the lighted hall and after another word with nairn he went moodily down the steps to join jessie and carroll who were waiting for him below as the group walked down the garden path mrs nairn looked at her husband  i do not know what has come over evelyn this night she remarked  nairn followed jessies retreating figure with distrustful eyes weel he said im thinking yon besom may have had a hand in the thing  then he turned and they went in  a few minutes later jessie standing where the light of a big lamp streamed down upon her through the boughs of a leafless maple bade vane farewell at her brothers gate  if my good wishes can bring you success it will most certainly be yours she said and there was something in her voice which faintly stirred the man who was feeling very sore  thank you he said and she did not immediately withdraw the hand she had given him he was grateful to her and thought she looked unusually pretty with the sympathy shining in her eyes  you will not forget to wait at nanaimo and comox she went on  no said vane if you recall me ill come back at once if not ill go on with a lighter heart knowing that i can safely stay away  jessie said nothing further and he moved on she felt that she had scored and she knew when to stop the man had given her his full confidence     chapter xxv  the intercepted letter   the wind was fresh from the northwest when vane drove the sloop out through the narrows in the early dawn and saw a dim stretch of whiteflecked sea in front of him landlocked as they are by vancouver island the long roll of the pacific cannot enter those waters but they are now and then lashed into short tumbling seas sufficient to make their passage difficult for a craft no larger than the sloop carroll frowned when a comber struck the weather bow and a shower of stinging spray whipped his face  right ahead again he remarked but as i suppose youre going on wed better stretch straight across on the starboard tack well get smoother water along the island shore  they let her go and vane sat at the helm hour after hour drenched with spray hammering her mercilessly into the frothy seas they could have done with a second reef down for the deck was swept and sluicing and most of the time the lee rail was buried deep in rushing foam but vane showed no intention of shortening sail nor did carroll who saw that his comrade was disturbed in temper suggest it resolute action had he knew a soothing effect on vane as a matter of fact the latter needed soothing of late he had felt that he was making steady progress in evelyns favour and now she had most unexplainably turned against him but rack his brain as he would he could not discover the reason that he was conscious of no offence only made the position more galling  in the meanwhile the boat engrossed more and more of his attention it was a relief to drive her hard at some whitetopped sea and watch her bows disappear in it with a thud while it somehow eased his mind to see the smashedup brine fly half the height of her drenched mainsail there was also satisfaction in feeling the strain on the tiller when swayed down by a fiercer gust she plunged through the combers with the froth swirling perilously close to the coaming along her halfsubmerged deck  the day was cold the man who was compelled to sit almost still in a nipping wind was soon wet through but this in some curious way further tended to restore his accustomed optimism and goodhumour he had partly recovered both when as the sloop drove through the whiter turmoil whipped up by a vicious squall there was a crash forward  down helm shouted carroll the bobstays gone  he scrambled towards the bowsprit which having lost its principal support swayed upward in peril of being torn away by the sagging jib vane who first rounded up the boat into the wind followed him and for several minutes they had a struggle with the madlyflapping sail before they flung it bundled up into the well then they ran in the bowsprit and vane felt glad that although the craft had been rigged in the usual western fashion he had changed that by giving her a couple of headsails in place of one  shell trim with the staysail if we haul another reef down he said  it cost them some labour but they were warmer afterwards and when they went on again vane glanced at the bowsprit  well try to get a bit of galvanised steel in nanaimo he said i cant risk another smash  you had better be prepared for one if you mean to drive her as you have been doing carroll flung back the saloon scuttle youd have swamped her in another hour or two the cabin floorings are all awash  then hadnt you better pump her out retorted vane after that you can light the stove its beginning to dawn on me that its a long while since i had anything to eat  by and by they made a bountiful if somewhat primitive meal in turn sitting in the dripping saloon which was partly filled with smoke and carroll sighed for the comforts he had abandoned he did not however mention his regrets because he did not expect his comrades sympathy  the craft being under reduced sail drove along more easily during the rest of the afternoon and they ran into a little colliery town on the following day there vane replaced the broken bobstay with a solid piece of steel and then sat down to write a letter while carroll stretched his cramped limbs ashore  the letter was addressed to evelyn and he found it difficult to express himself as he desired the spoken word as he had discovered is now and then awkward to use but the written one is more evasive still and he shook his head ruefully over the production when he laid down his pen this was perhaps unnecessary for having grown calm he had framed a terse and forcible appeal to the girls sense of justice which would in all probability have had its effect on her had she received it though he hardly realised it the few simple words were convincing  having received no news from nairn or jessie they sailed again in a day or two bound for comox farther along the coast where there was a possibility of communications overtaking them but in the meanwhile matters which concerned them were moving forward in vancouver  it was rather early one afternoon when jessie called upon a friend of hers and found her alone mrs bendle was a young and impulsive woman from one of the eastern cities and she had not made many friends in vancouver yet though her husband whom she had lately married was a man of some importance there  im glad to see you she said greeting jessie eagerly its a week since anybody has been in to talk to me and toms away again  jessie made herself comfortable in an easychair before she referred to one of her companions remarks  where has mr bendle gone now she asked  into the bush to look at a mine he left this morning and it will be a week before hes back then hes going across the selkirks with that clavering man about some irrigation scheme  this suggested one or two questions which jessie desired to ask but she did not frame them immediately it must be dull for you she said sympathetically  i dont mean to complain her companion informed her toms reasonable the last time i said anything about being left alone he bought me the pair of ponies  youre fortunate in several ways there are not a great many people who can make such presents but while everybody knows how your husband has been successful lately im a little surprised that hes able to go into claverings irrigation scheme its an expensive one but i understand they intend to confine it to a few which means that those interested will have to subscribe handsomely  tom said her companion likes to have a number of different things in hand he told me it was wiser when i said i couldnt tell my friends back east what he really is because he seemed to be everything at once but your brothers interested in a good many things too isnt he  i believe so answered jessie still im pretty sure he couldnt afford to join clavering and at the same time take up a big block of shares in mr vanes mine  but tom isnt going to do the latter now  jessie was almost startled this was valuable information which she could scarcely have expected to obtain so easily there was more she desired to ascertain but she had no intention of making any obvious inquiries  its generally understood that mr vane and your husband are on good terms she said you know him dont you  ive met him at one or two places and i like him but when i mention him tom smiles he says its unfortunate mr vane can only see one thing at once and that the one which lies right in front of his eyes for all that ive heard him own that the man is likeable  then its a pity hes unable to stand by him now  i really believe tom was half sorry he couldnt do so last night he said something that suggested it i dont understand much about these matters but howitson was here talking business until late  jessie was satisfied her hostesss previous incautious admission had gone a long way but to this was added the significant information that bendle was inclined to be sorry for vane the fact that he and howitson had decided on some joint action after a long private discussion implied that there was trouble in store for the absent man unless he could be summoned to deal with the crisis in person jessie wondered if nairn knew anything about the matter yet and decided that she would try to sound him in the meanwhile she led her companion away from the subject and they discussed millinery and such matters until she took her departure  it was early in the evening when she reached nairns house which she had thought it better to arrive at a little before he came home and was told that mrs nairn and miss chisholm were out but were expected back shortly evelyn had been by no means cordial to her since their last interview and mrs nairns manner had been colder but jessie decided to wait and for the second time that day fortune seemed to play into her hands  it was dark outside but the entrance hall was brightly lighted and she could see into it from where she sat highlytrained domestics are generally scarce in the west and the maid had left the door of the room open by and by there was a knock at the outer door and a young lad came in with some letters in his hand he explained to the maid that he had been to the post office and had brought his employers private mail then he withdrew and the maid who first laid the letters carelessly on a little table also retired banging a door behind her the concussion shook down the letters and several fluttering forward with the sudden draught fell near the threshold of the room jessie rose to replace them  when she reached the door she stopped abruptly for she recognised the writing on one envelope there was no doubt it was from vane and she noticed that it was addressed to miss chisholm jessie picked it up and when she had laid the others upon the table stood with it in her hand  has the man no pride she said half aloud  then she looked about her listening greatly tempted and considering there was no sound in the house evelyn and mrs nairn were out and she was cut off from its other occupants by a closed door nobody would know that she had entered the hall and if the letter were subsequently missed it would be unlikely that any question regarding its disappearance would ever be asked if there was no response from evelyn vane she thought would not renew his appeal jessie had no doubt that the letter contained an appeal of some kind which might lead to a reconciliation and she knew that silence is often more potent than an outbreak of anger she had only to destroy the letter and the breach between the two people whom she desired to separate would widen automatically  there was little risk of detection but standing tensely still with set lips and her heart beating faster than usual she shrank from the decisive action she could still replace the letter and look for other means of bringing about what she wished she was selfwilled and endowed with few troublesome principles but until she had poisoned evelyns mind against vane she had never done anything flagrantly dishonourable then while she waited irresolute a fresh temptation seized her in the shape of a burning desire to learn what the man had to say he would reveal his feelings in the message and she could judge the strength of her rivals influence over him  yet she hesitated with a halfinstinctive recognition of the fact that the decision she must make was an eventful one she had transgressed grievously in one recent interview with evelyn but while she had no idea of making reparation she could at least stop short of a second offence she had perhaps not gone too far yet but if she ventured a little farther she might be driven on against her will and become inextricably involved in an entanglement of dishonourable treachery  the issue hung in the balancethe slightest thing would have turned the scalewhen she heard footsteps outside and the tinkle of a bell moving with a start she slipped back into the room just before the maid opened the adjacent door in another moment or two she thrust the envelope inside her dress and gathered her composure as mrs nairn and evelyn entered the hall the former approached the table and turned over the handful of letters  two for ye from england evelyn and one or two for me she said and as jessie noticed flashed a quick glance at her companion nothing else she added i had thought vane would maybe send a bit note from one of the island ports to say how he was getting on  then jessie rose to greet her hostess the question was decided it was too late to replace the letter now she could not remember what they talked about during the next halfhour but she took her part until nairn came in and contrived to have a word with him before leaving mrs nairn had gone out to give some instructions about supper and when evelyn followed her jessie turned to nairn  mr vane would be at comox now she said have you any idea of recalling him of course i know a little about the clermont affairs  nairn glanced at her with thoughtful eyes im no acquainted with any reason that would render such a course necessary  evelyn reappeared shortly after this and on the whole jessie was glad of it but she excused herself from staying for the evening meal and walked home thinking hard it was needful that vane should be recalled and though he had written to evelyn she still meant to send him word he would be grateful to her and indignant and wounded as she was she would not own herself beaten she would warn the man and afterwards perhaps allow nairn to send him a second message  on reaching her brothers house she went straight to her own room and tore open the envelope the colour receded from her face as she read and sinking into a chair she sat still with hands clenched the message was terse but it was stirringly candid and even where the man did not fully reveal his feelings in his words she could read between the lines there was no doubt that he had given his heart unreservedly into her rivals keeping  for a while she sat still and then stooping swiftly seized the letter which she had dropped and rent it into fragments her eyes had grown hard and cruel love of the only kind she was capable of had suddenly turned to hate what was more it was a hate that could be gratified  a little later horsfield came in and though she was very composed now she noticed that he looked at her in an unusual manner once or twice during the meal that followed  you make me feel you have something on your mind she said at length  thats a fact horsfield confessed the man was attached to and rather proud of his sister  well  horsfield leaned forward confidentially see here he said ive always imagined that you would go far and im anxious to see you do so i wouldnt like you to throw yourself away  his sister could take a hint but there was information she desired and the man was speaking with unusual reserve  oh she said with a slight show of impatience you must be plainer  then you have seen a good deal of vane and in case you have any hankering after his scalp i think id better mention that theres reason to believe he wont be worth powder and shot before very long  ah said jessie with a calmness which was difficult to assume you may as well understand that there is nothing between vane and me i suppose you mean that howitson and bendle are turning against him  something like that horsfield agreed in a tone which implied that her answer had afforded him relief the man has trouble in front of him  jessie changed the subject what she had gathered from mrs bendle was fully confirmed but she had made up her mind evelyns lover might wait for the warning which could save him but he should wait in vain     chapter xxvi  on the trail   it was a long wet sail up the coast with the wind ahead and carroll was content when on reaching comox vane announced his intention of stopping there until the mail came in immediately after its arrival carroll went ashore and came back emptyhanded  nothing he said personally im pleased nairn could have advised us here if there had been any striking developments since we left the last place  i wasnt expecting to hear from him vane replied  carroll read keen disappointment in his face and was not surprised although the absence of any message meant that it was safe for them to go on with their project which should have afforded his companion satisfaction  they got off shortly afterwards and stood out to the northwards  most of that day and the next two they drifted with the tides through narrowing waters though now and then for a few hours they were wafted on by light and fickle winds at length they crept into the inlet where they had landed on the previous voyage and on the morning after their arrival set out on the march there was on this occasion reason to expect more rigorous weather and the load each carried was an almost crushing one where the trees were thinner the ground was frozen hard and even in the densest bush the undergrowth was white and stiff with frost while when they could see aloft through some chance opening a forbidding grey sky hung over them  on approaching the rift in the hillside which he had glanced at when they first passed that way vane stopped a moment  i looked into that place before but it didnt seem worth while to follow it up he said if youll wait ill go a little farther along it  though the air was nipping carroll who was breathless was content to remain where he was and he spent some time sitting upon a log before a faint shout reached him then he rose and making his way up the hollow found his comrade standing upon a jutting ledge  i thought you were never coming the latter remarked climb up ive something to show you  carroll joined him with difficulty and vane stretched out his hand  look yonder he said  carroll looked and started they stood in a rocky gateway with a river brawling down the chasm beneath them but a valley opened up in front filled with sombre forest it ran back almost straight between stupendous walls of hills  it answers hartleys description he said after all i dont think its extraordinary we should have taken so much trouble to push on past the right place  hows that vane demanded  carroll sat down and filled his pipe its the natural result of possessing a temperament like yours somehow youve got it firmly fixed into your mind that everything worth doing must be hard  ive generally found it so  i think said carroll grinning youve generally made it so theres a marked difference between the two if any means of doing a thing looks easy you at once conclude it cant be the right way which is a mode of reasoning that has never convinced me in my opinion its more sensible to try the easiest method first  as a rule that leads to your having to fall back upon the other one and a frontal attack on a difficultys often quicker than considering how you can work round its flank in this case ill own we have wasted a lot of time and taken a good deal of trouble that might have been avoided but are you going to sit here and smoke  until ive finished my pipe carroll answered i expect well find tobacco among other things getting pretty scarce before this expedition ends  he carried out his intention and they afterwards pushed on up the valley during the rest of the day it grew more level as they proceeded and in spite of the frost which bound the feeding snows there was a steady flow of water down the river which was free from rocky barriers vane who now and then glanced at the latter attentively stopped when dusk was drawing near and fixed his gaze on the long ranks of trees that stretched away in front of him fretted spires of sombre greenery lifted high above a colonnade of mighty trunks  does anything in connection with this bush strike you he asked  its stiffness if thats what you mean carroll suggested smiling these big conifers look as if theyd been carved theyre impressive in a way but theyre too artificial  thats not what i mean vane informed him impatiently  to tell the truth said carroll i didnt suppose it was anyway these trees arent spruce theyre red cedar the stuff they make the roofing shingles of  precisely just now shingles are in good demand in the province and with the wooden towns springing up on the prairie western millers can hardly send roofing material across the rockies fast enough besides this i havent struck a creek more adapted for running logs down and the last sharp drop to tidewater would give power for a mill im only puzzled that none of the timberlease prospectors has recorded the place  thats easy to understand said carroll like you theyd no doubt first search the most difficult spots to get at  they went on in another minute and pitched their light tent beside the creek when darkness fell  by the by i thought you were disappointed when you got no mail at comox carroll remarked at length feeling that he was making something of a venture  i was said vane  this was not encouraging but carroll persisted thats strange because your hearing nothing from nairn left you free to go ahead which one would suppose was what you wanted  vane as it happened was in a confidential mood though usually averse from sharing his troubles he felt he needed sympathy id better confess i wrote miss chisholm a few lines from nanaimo  ah said carroll softly and she didnt answer you now i couldnt well help noticing that you were rather in her bad graces that night at nairns no doubt youre acquainted with the reason  im not vane replied thats just the trouble  carroll reflected he had an idea that miss horsfield was somehow connected with the matter but this was a suspicion he could not mention  well he said as i pointed out youre addicted to taking the hardest way when we came up here before you marched past this valley chiefly because it was close at hand but i dont want to dwell on that has it occurred to you that you did something of the same kind when you were at the dene the way that was then offered you was easy  this is not the kind of subject one cares to talk about but you ought to know i couldnt allow them to force miss chisholm upon me against her will it was unthinkable besides looking at it in the most coldblooded manner it would have been foolishness for which wed both have to pay afterwards  im not so sure of that said carroll thoughtfully there were the sabine women among other instances didnt they cut off their hair to make bowstrings for their abductors  his companion made no answer and carroll deciding that he had ventured as far as was prudent talked of something else until they crept into the little tent and soon afterwards they fell asleep  they started with the first of the daylight next morning but the timber grew denser and more choked with underbrush as they proceeded and for several days they wearily struggled through it and the clogging masses of tangled withered fern besides this they were forced to clamber over fallen trunks when the ragged ends of the snappedoff branches caught their loads their shoulders ached their boots were ripped their feet were badly galled but they held on stubbornly plunging deeper into the mountains all the while  soon after setting out one morning they climbed a clearer hillside to look about them high up ahead the crest of the white range gleamed dazzlingly against leaden cloud in a burst of sunshine below dark forest still wrapped in gloom filled all the valley and in between on the middle slopes a belt of timber touched by the light shone with a curious silvery lustre though it was some distance off probably a days journey allowing for the difficulty of the march vane gazed at it earnestly the trees were barethere was no doubt of that for the dwindling ranks diminished by the distance stood out against the snowstreaked rock like rows of rather thick needles set upright their straightness and the way they glistened suggested the resemblance  ominous isnt it carroll said at length if this is the valley hartley came down and everything points to that we should be getting near the spruce  vanes face grew set yes he agreed there has been a big fire up yonder but whether it has swept the lower ground or not is more than i can tell well find out early tomorrow     chapter xxvii  the end of the search   the two men made a hurried breakfast in the cold dawn and not long afterwards they were struggling through thick timber when the light suddenly grew a little clearer carroll remarked upon the fact and vanes face hardened  were either coming to a swamp or the track the fire has swept is close in front the latter said  a thicket lay before him but he smashed savagely through the midst of it the undergrowth snapping and crackling about his limbs then there was a network of tangled branches to be crossed and afterwards reaching slightly clearer ground he broke into a run three or four minutes later he stopped breathless and ragged with his rent boots scarcely clinging to his feet and carroll who came up with him gazed eagerly about  the living forest rose behind them an almost unbroken wall but ahead the trees ran up in detached and blackened spires their branches had vanished every cluster of sombregreen needles and delicate spray had gone the great rampikes as they are called looked like shafts of charcoal about their feet lay crumbling masses of calcined wood which grew more and more numerous where there were open spaces farther on and then the bare black columns ran on again up the valley and the steep hill benches on either hand it was a weird scene of desolation impressive to the point of being appalling in its suggestiveness of widespread ruin  for the space of a minute the men gazed at it and then vane stretching out his hand pointed to a snowsheeted hill  thats the peak hartley mentioned he said in a voice which was strangely incisive give me the axe  he took it from his comrade and striding forward attacked the nearest rampike twice the keen blade sank noiselessly overhead scattering a black dust in the frosty air and then there was a clear ringing thud after that vane smote on with a determined methodical swiftness until carroll grabbed his shoulder  look out he cried its going  vane stepped back a few paces the trunk reeled and rushed downwards there was a deafening crash and they were enveloped in a cloud of gritty dust through the midst of it they dimly saw two more great trunks collapse and then somewhere up the valley a series of thundering shocks which both knew were not echoes broke out the sound jarred upon carrolls nerves as the thud of the felled rampike had not done but vane picked up one of the chips and handed it to him  we have found hartleys spruce he said  carroll did not answer for a minute after all when defeat must be faced there was very little to be said though his companions expression troubled him its grim stolidity was portentous  i suppose he remarked at length nothing could be done with it  vane pointed to the butt of the tree which showed a space of clean wood surrounded by a blackened rim  you cant make marketable pulp of charcoal and the price would have to run pretty high before it would pay for ripping most of the log away to get at the residue he answered harshly  but there may be some unburned spruce farther on carroll urged  its possible said vane im going to find out  this was a logical determination but in spite of his recent suggestion carroll realised that he would have abandoned the search there and then had the choice been left to him in which he did not think he was singular after all they had undergone the shock of the disappointment was severe he could have faced a failure to locate the spruce with some degree of philosophical calm but to find it at last useless was very much worse but he did not expect his companion to turn back yet before he desisted vane would seek for and examine every unburned tree what was more carroll who thought the search could serve no purpose would have to accompany him then the latter noticed that vane was waiting for him to speak and he decided that this was a situation which he had better endeavour to treat lightly  i think ill have a smoke he said im afraid any remarks i could make wouldnt do justice to the occasion language has its limits  he sat down on the charred log and took out his pipe before he proceeded a brûlées not a nice place to wander about in when theres any wind and ive an idea theres some coming though its quiet now  shut in as they were in the deep hollow with the towering snows above them it was impressively still and in conjunction with the sight of the black desolation the deep silence reacted upon carrolls nerves he longed to escape from it to make a noise though this if done unguardedly might bring more of the rampikes thundering down he could hear tiny flakes of charcoal falling from them and though the fire had long gone out a faint and curious crackling as if the dead embers were stirring he wondered if this were some effect of the frost it struck him as disturbing and weird  well work right round the brûlée said vane then i suppose we had better head back for vancouver though well look at that cedar as we go down something might be made of it im not sure weve thrown our time away  you wouldnt be sure of such a thing said carroll it isnt in you  vane disregarded this a new constructive policy was already springing up out of the wreck of his previous plans theres a good mill site on the inlet but as its a long way from the railroad well have to determine whether it would be cheaper to tow the logs down or split them up on the spot he went on ill talk it over with drayton hell no doubt be useful and theres no reason why he shouldnt earn his share  do you believe the arrangement you made with hartley applies to the cedar  of course said vane i dont know that the other parties could insist upon the original termswe can discuss that later but though it may be modified the arrangement stands  his companion considered the matter dispassionately as an abstract proposition here was a man who in return for certain information respecting the whereabouts of a marketable commodity had undertaken to find and share it with his informant the commodity had proved to be valueless but during the search for it he had incidentally discovered something else was he under any obligation to share the latter with his informants heirs  carroll decided that the question could only be answered in the negative but he had no intention of disputing his comrades point of view in the first place this would probably only make vane more determined or ruffle his temper and in the second carroll who felt very dubious about the prospect of working the cedar profitably was neither a covetous nor an ambitious person which was perhaps on the whole fortunate for him  vane as his partner realised was ambitious but in place of aspiring after wealth or social prominencethe latter of which had indeed of late began to pall on himhis was a different aim to rend the hidden minerals from the hills to turn forests into dressed lumber to make something grow dollars are often though not always made that way but while he affected no contempt for them in vanes case their acquisition was undoubtedly not the end fortunately he was not altogether singular in this respect  when he next spoke there was however no hint of altruistic sentiment in his curt inquiry are you going to sit there until you freeze  carroll got up and they spent the rest of the day plodding through the brûlée with the result that when darkness fell vane had abandoned all idea of working the spruce next morning they set out for the inlet and one afternoon during the journey they came upon several fallen logs lying athwart each other with their branches spread in a horrible tangle between vane proceeded to walk along one log which was tilted up several yards above the ground balancing himself carefully upon the rounded surface and carroll followed until the end of a broken branch which he evidently had not noticed caught in the leaders clothes next moment there was a sharp snapping and vane plunged down into the tangle beneath while carroll stood still and laughed it was not an uncommon accident  vane however did not reappear nor was there any movement among the halfrotten boughs and withered sprays and carroll moving forward hastily looked down into the hole he was disagreeably surprised to see his comrade lying rather white in face upon his side  im afraid youll have to chop me out he said and his voice was hoarse get to work i cant move my leg  moving farther along the log carroll dropped to the ground which was less encumbered there and spent the next quarter of an hour hewing a passage to his comrade then as he stood beside him hot and panting vane looked up  its my lower leg the left he said bones broken i felt it snap  carroll turned from him for a moment in consternation looking out between the branches he could see the lonely hills tower pitilessly white against the blue of the frosty sky and the rigid firs running back as far as his vision reached upon their lower slopes there was no touch of life in all the picture everything was silent and motionless and its desolation came near to appalling him when he looked round again vane smiled wryly  if this had happened farther north it would have been the end of me he said as it is its awkward  the word struck carroll as singularly inadequate but he made an effort to gather his courage when his companion broke off with a groan of pain  its lucky we helped that doctor when he set petes leg at bryants mill he said can you wait a few minutes  vanes face was beaded with damp now but he tried to smile it strikes me he answered ill have to wait a mighty long time  carroll turned and left him he was afraid to stand still and think but action was a relief it was some time before he returned with several strips of fabric cut from the tent curtain and the neatest splints he could extemporise from slabs of strippedoff bark and the next halfhour was a trying one to both of them sometimes vane assisted him with suggestionsonce he reviled his clumsinessand sometimes he lay silent with his face awry and his lips tight set but at length it was done and carroll stood up breathing hard  ill fasten you on to a couple of skids and pull you out he said then ill make camp  he managed it with difficulty pitched the tent above vane whom he covered with their blankets and made a fire outside  are you comfortable now he inquired  vane looked up at him with a somewhat ghastly grin i suppose im about as comfortable as could be expected anyhow ive got to get used to the thing six weeks is the shortest limit isnt it  carroll confessed that he did not know and presently vane resumed its lucky that the winters arent often very cold so near the coast  the temperature struck carroll as low enough but he made no answer to his disgust he could think of no cheering observation for there was no doubt that the situation was serious they were cut off from the sloop by leagues of tangled forest which a vigorous man would find it difficult to traverse and it would be weeks before vane could use his leg no human assistance could be looked for and they had only a small quantity of provisions left besides this it would not be easy to keep the sufferer warm in rigorous weather  ill make supper youll feel better afterwards he said at length  then dont be too liberal vane warned him  the latter fell into a restless doze after the meal and it was dark when he opened his eyes again  i cant sleep any more and we may as well talkthere are things to be arranged he said in the first place as soon as i feel a little easier youll have to sail across to comox and hire some men to pack me out when youve sent them off youll make for vancouver and get a timber licence and find out how matters are going on  that said carroll firmly is out of the question nairn can look after our mining interestshes a capable manand if the things too much for him they can go to smash besides they wont give you a timber licence without full particulars of area and limits and weve blazed no boundaries anyhow im staying right here  vane began to protest but carroll raised his hand arguments not conducive to recovery youre on your back unfortunately and ill give way to you as usual as soon as youre on your feet again but not before  id better point out that well both be hungry by then the provisions wont last long  then ill look for a deer as soon as i think you can be left and now well try to talk of something more amusing  can you see anything humorous in the situation  i cant carroll confessed still there may be something of that description which i havent noticed yet by the way the last time we were at nairns i happened to cross the room near where you and miss horsfield were sitting and i heard her ask you to wait for something at nanaimo or comox i thought it curious  she told me to wait so she could send me word to come back if it was needful  ah said carroll i wont ask why she was willing to do soit concerns you more than mebut i fancy that as regards your interests in the clermont a warning from her would be worth as much as one from nairn that is if she could be depended on  have you any doubt upon the subject  dont get angry perhaps ive talked too much we have to think of your injury  im not likely to forget it vane informed him but i dare say youre right in one respectas an amusing companion youre a dead failure and talking isnt as easy as i imagined  he lay silent afterwards and though he had disclaimed any desire for sleep worn by the march and pain as he was his eyes presently closed carroll however sat long awake and afterwards admitted that he felt badly afraid deer are by no means numerous in some parts of the bush they had not seen one during the journey and though there was a little food left on board her it was a long way to the sloop  once or twice for no obvious reason he drew aside the tent flap and looked out the sky was cloudless and darkly blue and a sickle moon gleamed in it keen and clear with frost below the hills were washed in silver majestic but utterly cheerless and lower still the serrated tops of the rigid firs cut against the dreary whiteness after each glimpse of them carroll drew his blanket tighter round him with a shiver very shortly when the little flour and pork were gone and their few cartridges had been expended he would be reduced to the condition of primitive man cut off from all other resources he must then wrest what means of subsistence he could from the snowy wilderness by brute strength and cunning and such instruments as he could make with his unassisted hands except that an axe of pennsylvania steel was better than a stone one civilisation has its compensations and carroll longed for a few more of them that night  on rising next morning he found the frost keener and he spent the day and a number of those that followed in growing anxiety which was only temporarily lessened when he once succeeded in killing a deer there was almost a dearth of animal life in the lonely valley sometimes at first vane was feverish often he was irritable and the recollection of the three or four weeks he spent with him afterwards haunted carroll like a nightmare at last when he had spent several days in vain search for a deer and the provisions were almost exhausted he and his companion held a council of emergency  theres no use in arguing vane declared youll rig me a shelter of green boughs outside the tent and close to the fire i can move from the waist upwards and if its necessary drag myself with my hands then you can chop enough cordwood to last a while cook my share of the eatables and leave me while you go down to the sloop theres half a bag of flour and a few other things id be uncommonly glad of on board her  carroll expostulated but it was evident that his companion was right and next morning he started for the inlet taking with him the smallest possible portion of their provisions so long as he had enough to keep him from fainting on the way it was all he required because he could renew his stores on board the boat the weather broke during the march driving snow followed him down the valley and by and by gave place to bitter rain the withered underbush was saturated the soil was soddened with melting snow and after the first scanty meal or two he dare risk no delay he felt himself flagging from insufficient food and it was obvious that he must reach the sloop before he broke down he had tobacco but that failed to stay the gnawing pangs and before the march was done he was on the verge of exhaustion forcing himself onward drenched and grim of face scarcely able to keep upon his bleeding feet  it was falling dusk and blowing fresh when he limped down the beach and with a last effort launched the light dinghy and pulled off to the sloop she rode rather deep in the water but that did not trouble him most wooden craft leak more or less and it was a considerable time since he had pumped her out clambering wearily on board he made the dinghy fast and then stood still a moment or two looking about him with his hand on the cabin side thin flakes of snow drifted past him the firs were rustling eerily ashore and ragged wisps of cloud drove by low down above their tops little frothy ripples flecked the darkening water with streaks of white and splashed angrily against the bows of the craft the prospect was oppressively dreary and the wornout man was glad that he was at last in shelter and could snatch a few hours rest  thrusting back the slide he stepped below and lighted the lamp the brightening glow showed him that the boats starboard side was wet high up and though there was a good deal of water in her this puzzled him until an explanation suggested itself they had moored the craft carefully but he supposed she must have dragged her anchor or kedge and swung in near enough the shore to ground towards lowtide then as the tide left her she would fall over on her starboard bilge because they had lashed the heavy boom down on that side and the water in her would cover the depressed portion of her interior this reasoning was probably correct but he did not foresee the result until after lighting the stove and putting on the kettle he opened the provision locker which was to starboard then he saw with a shock of dismay that the stock of food they had counted on was ruined the periodically submerged flour bag had rotted and burst and most of its contents had run out into the water as the boat righted with the rising tide the prepared cereals purchased to save cooking had turned to mouldy pulp and the few other stores were in much the same condition there were only two sound cans of beef and a few ounces of unspoiled tea in a canister  carrolls courage failed him as he realised it but he felt that he must eat and sleep before he could grapple with the situation he would allow himself a meal and a few hours rest and crawling out while the kettle boiled he shortened in the cable and plied the pump then he went below and feasted on preserved beef and tea gauging the size of each slice with anxious care until he reluctantly laid the can aside after that he filled his pipe and stretching out his aching limbs on the port locker which was comparatively dry soon sank into heavy sleep     chapter xxviii  carroll seeks help   carroll slept for several hours before he awakened and sat up on the locker shivering he had left the hatch slightly open and a confused uproar reached him from outsidethe wail of windtossed trees the furious splash of ripples against the bows and the drumming of the halliards upon the mast there was no doubt that it was blowing hard but the wind was off the land and the sloop in shelter  filling his pipe he set himself to think and promptly decided that it would have been better had he gone down to the sloop in the beginning before the provisions had been spoiled instead of in the end reluctance to leave his helpless companion had mainly prevented him from doing this but he had also been encouraged by the possibility of obtaining a deer now and then it was clear that he had made a mistake in remaining but it was not the first time he had done so and the point was unimportant the burning question was what must he do now  it would obviously be useless to go back with rations that would barely suffice for the march vane still had food enough to keep life in one man for a little while on the other hand it would not be a long sail to comox with a strong northerly wind and if the sloop would face the sea that was running he might return with assistance before his comrades scanty store was exhausted getting out the mildewed chart he laid off his course carefully trimmed and lighted the binnacle lamp and going up on deck hauled in the kedge anchor he could not break the main one out though he worked savagely with a tackle and deciding to slip it he managed to lash three reefs in the mainsail and hoist it with the peak left down then he sat down to gather breathfor the work had been cruelly heavybefore he let the cable run and hoisted the jib  she paid off when he put up his helm and the black loom of trees ashore vanished he thought he could find his way out of the inlet but he only knew that he had done so when the angry ripples that splashed about the boat suddenly changed to confused tumbling combers they foamed up in swift succession on her quarter but he fancied she would withstand their onslaught so long as he could prevent her from screwing up to windward when she lifted it would need constant care and if he failed the next comber would no doubt break on board his task was one that would have taxed the vigilance of a strong wellfed man and carroll had already nearly reached the limit of his powers  his case however was by no means an unusual one the cost of the subjugation of the wilderness is the endurance of hunger and thirst cold and crushing fatigue and somebody pays to the uttermost farthing carroll sitting drenched strung up and hungry at the helm was merely playing his part in the struggle though he found it cruelly hard  it was pitch dark but he must gaze ahead and guess the track of the pursuing seas by the angle of the spouting white ridge abreast of the weather shrouds he had a compass but when his course did not coincide with safety it must be disregarded the one essential thing was to keep the sloop on top and to do so he had frequently to let her fall off dead before the mad white combers that leaped out of the dark by and by his arms began to ache from the strain of the tiller and his wet fingers grew stiff and clawlike the nervous strain was also telling but that could not be helped he must keep the craft before the sea or go down with her there was one consolationshe was travelling at a furious speed  at length morning broke over a leaden sea that was seamed with white and he glanced longing at the meatcan on the locker near his feet he could reach it by stooping though he dare not leave the helm but he determined to wait until noon before he broke his fast again it could not be very far to comox but the wind might drop then he began to wonder how he had escaped the perils of the night he had come down what was really a wide and not quite straight sound passing several unlighted islands before starting he had decided that he would run so long and then change his course a point or two but he could not be sure that he had done so he had a hazy recollection of seeing surf and once a faint loom of land but he supposed he had avoided it halfconsciously or that chance had favoured him  in the afternoon the wind changed a little backing to the northwest the sky grew brighter and he made out shadowy land over his starboard quarter by and by he recognised it with a start it was the high ridge north of comox and as he had run farther than he had expected he must try to hoist the peak of the mainsail and haul her on the wind there was danger in rounding her up but it must be faced though a sea foamed across her as he put down his helm another followed but he scrambled forward and struggled desperately to hoist the downhanging gaff the halliards were swollen he could scarcely keep his footing on the deluged deck that slanted steeply under him he thought he could have mastered the banging canvas had he been fresh but worn out as he was drenched with spray and buffeted by the shattered tops of the seas the task was beyond his power giving it up he staggered back breathless and almost nerveless to the helm  he could not reach comox which lay to windward with the sail halfset but it was only seventy miles or thereabouts to nanaimo and not very much farther to vancouver the breeze would be fair to either and he could charter a launch or tug for the return journey letting her go before the sea again he ate some canned meat ravenously tearing it with one hand  shortly afterwards a grey mass rose out of the water to port and he supposed it was texada there were mines on the island and he might be able to engage a rescue party but he reflected that he could not beat the sloop back to windward unless the breeze fell which it showed no signs of doing it would be more prudent to go on to vancouver where he would be sure of getting a steamer but he closed with the long island a little and dusk was falling when he made out a boat in the partial shelter of a bight standing in closer he saw that there were two men in the craft and driving down upon her he backed the jib and ran alongside  there was a crash as he struck the boat and an astonished and angry man clutched the sloops rail  now what in the name of thunder he began and stopped struck by carrolls ragged appearance  can you take this sloop to vancouver the latter inquired  i could if it was worth while was the cautious answer it will be a mighty wet run  seven dollars a day until youre home again said carroll a bonus if you can sail her with the whole reefed mainsail upi wont stick at a few dollars can your partner pull that boat ashore alone if not cast her adrift ill buy her  hell make the beach said the other jumping on board seven dollars sounds a square deal i wont put the screw on you  then help me hoist the peak carroll bade him after that you can take the helm im played out  the man who shouted something to his companion seized the halliards and the sloop drove on again furiously with an increased spread of canvas while carroll stood holding on by the coaming while the boat dropped back  ill leave you to it he informed the new helmsman its twentyfour hours since ive had more than a bite or two of food and some weeks since i had a decent meal  you look like it the other informed him been up against it somewhere  carroll who did not reply crawled below and managed to light the stove and make a kettleful of tea he drank a good deal of it and nearly emptied the remaining small meatcan which he presently held out for his companions inspection standing beneath the hatch  theres some tea left but this is all there is to eat on board the craft he said youre hired to take her to vancouverand youd better get there as soon as you can  the bronzed helmsman nodded she wont be long on the way if the mast holds up  have you seen any papers lately carroll inquired ive been up in the bush and im interested in the clermont mine it looked as if there might be some changes in the companys prospects when i went away  i noticed a bit about it in the colonist a while back was the answer they sold out to another concern or amalgamated with it i dont remember which  carroll was not astonished the news which implied that he must be prepared to face a more or less serious financial reverse struck him as a fitting climax to his misadventures  its pretty much what i expected and im going to sleep he said i dont want to be wakened before its necessary  he crawled below and he had hardly stretched himself out upon the locker before his eyes closed when he opened them feeling more like his usual self he saw that the sun was above the horizon and recognised by the boats motion that the wind had fallen going out he found her driving through the water under her whole mainsail and the helmsman sitting stolidly at the tiller the man stretched out a hand and pointed to the hazy hills to port  well fetch the narrows some time before noon he said if youll take the helm i guess well halve that meat for breakfast  his prediction proved correct for carroll reached his hotel about midday and hastily changing his clothes set off to call on nairn he had not recovered his mental equipoise and in spite of his long sound sleep he was still badly jaded physically on arriving at the house he was shown into a room where mrs nairn and her husband were sitting with evelyn waiting for the midday meal the elder lady rose with a start of astonishment when he walked in  man she said whats wrong yere looking like a ghost  it was not an inapt description carrolls face was worn and haggard and his clothes hung slack on him  ive been feeling rather unsubstantial of late as the result of a restricted diet he answered with a smile and sat down in the nearest chair while nairn regarded him with carefully suppressed curiosity  yere ower lang in coming he remarked where did ye leave your partner  carroll sat silent a moment or two his eyes fixed on evelyn it was evident that his sudden appearance unaccompanied by vane which he felt had been undesirably dramatic had alarmed her at first he felt compassionate and then he was suddenly possessed by hot indignation this girl with her narrow prudish notions and coldblooded nature had presumed to condemn his comrade unheard for an imaginary offence the thing was at once ludicrous and intolerable if his news brought her dismay let her suffer his nerves it must be remembered were not in their normal condition  yes he said in answer to his hosts first remark ive gathered that we have failed to save the situation but i dont know exactly what has happened you had better tell me  mrs nairn made a sign of protest but her husband glanced at her restrainingly  ye will hear his news in good time he informed her and turned to carroll in a few words the capital wasna subscribed it leaked out that the ore was running poor and we held an emergency meeting with vane away i could put no confidence into the shareholdersthey were anxious to get from underand horsfield brought forward an amalgamation scheme his friends would take the property over on their valuation i and a few others were outvoted the scheme went through and when the announcement steadied the stock which had been tumbling down i exercised the authority given me and sold your shares and vanes at considerably less than their face value ye can have particulars later what i have to ask now is where is vane  the mans voice grew sharp the question was flung out like an accusation but carroll still looked at evelyn he felt very bitter against her  i left him in the bush with no more than a few days provisions and a broken leg he said  then in spite of evelyns efforts to retain her composure her face blanched and carrolls anger vanished because the truth was clear vane had triumphed through disaster his peril and ruin had swept his offences away the girl who had condemned him in his prosperity would not turn away from him in misfortune in the meanwhile the others sat silent gazing at the bearer of evil news until he spoke again  i want a tug to take me back at once if she can be got he said ill pick up a few men along the waterfront  nairn rose and went out of the room the tinkle of a telephone bell reached those who remained and he came back a minute or two later  ive sent whitney round he announced hell come across if theres a boat to be had and now ye look as if ye needed lunch  its several weeks since i had one said carroll with a smile  the meal was brought in but for a while he talked as well as ate relating his adventures in somewhat disjointed fragments while the rest sat listening he was also pleased to notice something which suggested returning confidence in him in evelyns intent eyes as the tale proceeded when at last he had made the matter clear he added if i keep you waiting youll excuse me  his hostess watched his subsequent efforts with candid approval and looking up once or twice he saw sympathy in the girls face instead of the astonishment or disgust he had half expected when he had finished his hostess rose and carroll stood up but nairn signed to him to resume his place  im thinking ye had better sit still a while and smoke he said  carroll was glad to do so and he and nairn conferred together until the latter was called to the telephone  ye can have the brodick boat at noon tomorrow he said on his return  that wont do carroll objected heavily send whitney round again i must sail tonight  he had some difficulty in getting out the words and when he rose his eyes were half closed walking unsteadily he crossed the room and sank into a big lounge  i think he resumed if you dont mind ill go to sleep  nairn merely nodded and when after sitting silent a minute or two he went softly out the wornout man was already wrapped in profound slumber as it happened nairn received another call by telephone and left in haste for his office without speaking to his wife with the result that the latter and evelyn returning to the room by and by in search of carroll found him lying still the elder lady raised her hand in warning as she bent over the sleeper and then taking up a light rug spread it gently over him evelyn too was stirred to sudden pity for the mans attitude was eloquent of exhaustion  they withdrew gently and had reached the corridor when mrs nairn turned to the girl  when he first came in ye blamed that man for deserting his partner she said  evelyn confessed it and her hostess smiled meaningly are ye no rather ready to blame  im afraid i am said evelyn with the colour creeping into her face as she remembered an instance in which she had condemned another person hastily  in this case said her companion ye were very foolish the man came down for help and if he could not get it he would go back his lone if all the way was barred with ice and he must walk on his naked feet love of womans strong and the fear of death is keen but ye will find now and then a faith between man and man that neither would sever she paused and looked at the girl fixedly as she asked what of him that could inspire it  evelyn did not answer she had never seen her hostess in this mood and she was also stirred but the elder lady went on again the virtue of a gift lies in part but no altogether with the giver whiles it may be bestowed unworthily but im thinking its no often the bond that will drag carroll back to the north again to his death if it is needful has no been spun from nothing  evelyn had no doubt that mrs nairn was right loyalty most often demanded a worthy object to tender service to it sprang from implicit confidence mutual respect and strong appreciation it was not without a reason vane had inspired it in his comrades breast and this was the man she had condemned the latter fact however was by comparison a very minor trouble vane was lying helpless and alone in the snowy wilderness in peril of his life and she knew that she loved him she realised now when it might be too late that had he in reality been stained with dishonour she could have forgiven him indeed it had only been by a painful effort she had maintained some show of composure since carroll had brought the disastrous news and she felt she could not keep it up much longer  what she said to mrs nairn she could not remember but escaping from her she retired to her own room to lie still and grapple with an agony of fear and contrition  it was two hours later when she went down and found carroll who still looked drowsy about to go out his hostess had left him for a moment in the hall and meeting the girls eyes he smiled at her reassuringly  dont be anxious ill bring him back he said  then mrs nairn appeared and in a few moments carroll went out without another word to evelyn she did not ask herself why he had taken it for granted that she would be anxious she was beyond any petty regard for appearances it was consoling to remember that he was vanes tried comrade one of the men who kept their word     chapter xxix  jessies contrition   after leaving mrs nairn carroll walked towards horsfields residence in a thoughtful mood because he felt it incumbent upon him to play a part he was not particularly fitted for in a somewhat delicate matter uncongenial as his task was it was one which could not be left to vane who was even less to be trusted with the handling of such affairs and carroll had resolved as he would have described it to straighten out things  his partner had somehow offended evelyn and though she was now disposed to forgive him the recollection of his suppositious iniquity might afterwards rankle in her mind though vane was innocent of any conduct she could with reason take exception to it was first of all needful to ascertain the exact nature of the charge against him carroll who had for several reasons preferred not to press this question upon evelyn had a strong suspicion that jessie horsfield was at the bottom of the trouble there was also a clue to followvane had paid the rent of celia hartleys shack and he wondered if jessie could by any means have heard of it if she had done so the matter would be simplified because he had a profound distrust of her a recent action of hers was he thought sufficient to justify this attitude  he found her at home reclining gracefully in an easychair in her drawingroom and though she did not seem astonished to see him he fancied her expression hinted at suppressed concern  i heard you had arrived alone and i intended to come over and make inquiries as soon as i thought mrs nairn would be at liberty she informed him  carroll had found the direct attack effective in evelyns case and he determined to try it again then he began it says a good deal for your courage he had never doubted that she possessed the latter quality and she displayed it now  so she said calmly you have come as an enemy  not exactly it didnt seem worth while though theres no doubt you betrayed usvane waited for the warning you could have sentso far as it concerns our ruined interests in the clermont the things done and cant be mended well let that question go the most important point is that if you had recalled us as you promised vane would now be safe and sound  this shot told the girls face became less imperturbable there was eagerness and a suggestion of fear in it then has any accident happened to him she asked sharply  hes lying in the bush helpless in imminent peril of starvation  go on said the girl with signs of strain clearly perceptible in her voice  carroll was brief but he made her understand the position after which she turned upon him imperiously then why are you wasting your time here  its a reasonable question i cant get a tug to take me back until noon tomorrow  ah said jessie and added you will excuse me for a minute  she left him astonished he had not expected her to take him at a disadvantage as she had done with her previous thrust and now he did not think she had slipped away to hide her feelings that did not seem necessary in jessies case though he believed she was more or less disturbed she came back presently looking calm and sat down again  my brother will be here in a quarter of an hour she informed him things are rather slack and he had half promised to take me for a drive i have called him up through the telephone  carroll did not see how this bore upon the subject of their conversation but he left her to take the lead  did vane tell you i had promised to warn him she asked  to do him justice he let it out before he quite realised what he was saying id better own that i partly surprised him into giving me the information  the expedient seems a favourite one with you said jessie i suppose no news of what has happened here can have reached him  none if its any consolation he has still an unshaken confidence in you carroll assured her with blunt bitterness  the girl showed faint signs of confusion but she sat silent for the next few moments and during them it flashed upon her companion with illuminating light that he had heard celia hartley say miss horsfield had found her orders for millinery this confirmed his previous suspicion that jessie had discovered who had paid the rent of celias shack and that she had with deliberate malice informed evelyn distorting her account so that it would tell against vane there were breaks in the chain of reasoning which led him to this conclusion but he did not think jessie would shrink from such a course and he determined to try a chance shot  vanes inclined to be trustful and his rash generosity has once or twice got him into trouble he remarked and went on as if an explanation were needed its miss hartleys case im thinking about just now ive an idea he asked you to look after her am i right  as soon as he had spoken he knew he had hit the mark jessie did not openly betray herself but there are not many people who can remain absolutely unmoved when unexpectedly asked a startling question besides the man was observant and had strung up all his faculties for the encounter he saw one of her hands tighten on the arm of her chair and a hint of uneasiness in her eyes and it sufficed him  yes she said i recommended her to some of my friends i understand she is getting along satisfactorily  carroll felt compelled to admire her manner he believed she loved his comrade and had nevertheless tried to ruin him in a fit of jealous rage she was now keenly regretting her success but though he thought she deserved to suffer she was bravely facing the trying situation it was one that was rife with dramatic possibilities and he was grateful to her for avoiding them  you are going back tomorrow she said after a brief silence i suppose you will have to tell your partner what you have discovered here as soon as you reach him  carroll had not intended to spare her but now he felt almost compassionate and he had one grain of comfort to offer i must tell him that his shares in the clermont have been sacrificed i wonder if that is all you meant  jessie met his inquiring gaze with something very like an appeal and then spread out her hands in a manner to indicate that she threw herself upon his mercy  it is not all i meant she confessed  then if its any relief to you ill confine myself to telling him that he has been deprived of his most valuable property i dare say the news will hit him hard enough but though he may afterwards discover other facts for himself on the whole i shouldnt consider it likely as i said hes confiding and slow to suspect  he read genuine gratitude which he had hardly expected in the girls face but he raised his hand and went on in the rather formal manner which he felt was the only safe one to assume i had however better mention that i am going to call upon miss hartley after that i shall be uncommonly thankful to start back for the bush he paused and concluded with a sudden trace of humour ill own that i feel more at home with the work that waits me there  jessie made a little gesture which while it might have meant anything was somehow very expressive and just then there were footsteps outside next moment horsfield walked into the room  so youre back he said  yes said carroll shortly beaten at both endstheres no use in hiding it  horsfield showed no sign of satisfaction and carroll afterwards admitted that the man behaved very considerately  well he said though you may be surprised to hear it im sorry unfortunately our interests clashed and i naturally looked after mine once upon a time i thought i could have worked hand in hand with vane but our ideas did not coincide and your partner is not the man to yield a point or listen to advice  carroll was aware that horsfield had by means which were far from honourable deprived him of a considerable portion of his possessions he had also betrayed his fellow shareholders in the clermont mine selling their interests doubtless for some benefit to himself to another company for all that carroll recognised that since he and vane were beaten as he had confessed recriminations and reproaches would be useless as well as undignified he preferred to face defeat calmly  its the fortune of war he replied what you say about vane is correct but although it is not a matter of much importance now it was impossible from the beginning that your views and his ever should agree  too great a difference of temperament i dare say youre right vane measures things by a different standardmines perhaps more adapted to the marketplace but where have you left him  in the bush miss horsfield will no doubt give you particulars ive just told her the tale  she called me up at the office and asked me to come across at once will you excuse us for a few minutes  they went out together and jessie who came back alone sat down and looked at carroll in a diffident manner  i suppose she said one could hardly expect you to think of either of us very leniently but i must ask you to believe that i am sincerely distressed to hear of your partners accident this was a thing i could never have anticipated but there are amends i can make every minute you can save is precious isnt it  carroll agreed and she resumed then i can get you a tug my brother tells me the atlins coming across from victoria and should be here early this evening he has gone back to the office to secure her for you though she was fixed to go off for a log boom  thank you said carroll its a great service  jessie hesitated i think my brother would like to say a few words when he returns can i offer you some tea  i think not said carroll smiling for one thing if i sit still much longer i shall no doubt go to sleep again as i did at nairns which would be neither seemly nor convenient if im to sail this evening besides now weve arranged an armistice it might be wiser not to put too much strain on it  an armistice  i think that describes it carrolls manner grew significant the word implies a cessation of hostilitieson certain terms  jessie could take a hint and his meaning was clear unless she forced him to do so he would not betray her to his comrade who might never discover the part she had played but he had given her a warning which might be bluntly rendered as hands off there was only one course open to herto respect it she had brought down the man she loved but it was clear that he was not for her and now the unreasoning fury which had driven her to strike had passed she was troubled with contrition there was nothing left except to retire from the field and it was better to do so gracefully for all that there were signs of strain in her expression as she capitulated  well she said i have given you a proof that you have nothing to fear from me my brother is the only man in vancouver who could have got you that tug for this evening i understand the sawmill people are very much in need of the logs she was engaged to tow  she held out her hand and carroll took it though he had not expected to part from her on friendly terms  i owe you a deal for that he said and turned away  his task however was only half complete when he left the house and the remaining portion was the more difficult but he meant to finish it he preferred to take life lightly he had trifled with it before disaster had driven him out into the wilds but there was resolution in the man and he could force himself to play an unpleasant part when it was needful fortune also favoured him as she often does those who follow the boldest course  he had entered hastings street when he met kitty and celia the latter looked thin and somewhat pale but she was moving briskly and her face was eager when she shook hands with him  we have been anxious about youthere was no news she said is mr vane with you how have you got on  we found the spruce said carroll its not worth millinga forest fire has wiped most of it outbut we struck some shingling cedar we may make something of  but wheres mr vane  in the bush ive a good deal to tell you about him but we cant talk here i wonder if we could find a quiet place in a restaurant or if the park would be better  the park said kitty decidedly  they reached it in due time and carroll who had refused to say anything about vane on the way found the girls a seat in a grove of giant firs and sat down opposite to them though it was winter the day as is often the case near vancouver was pleasantly mild  now he began my partner is a singularly unfortunate person in the first place the transfer of the clermont property which you have no doubt heard of means a serious loss to him though he is not ruined yet he talks of putting up a shingling mill in which drayton will be of service and if things turn out satisfactory you will be given an interest in it  he added the last sentence as an experiment and was satisfied with the result  never mind our interests cried kitty what about mr vane  for the third time since his arrival carroll made the strongest appeal he could to womanly pity drawing with a purpose a vivid picture of his comrades peril and suffering nor was he disappointed for he saw consternation compassion and sympathy in the girls faces so far the thing had been easy but now he hesitated and it was with difficulty he nerved himself for what must follow  he has been beaten out of his stock in the mine hes broken down in health and in danger but by comparison that doesnt count for very much with him he continued he has another trouble and though im afraid im giving things away in mentioning it if it could be got over it would help him to face the future and set him on his feet again  then he briefly recounted the story of vanes regard for evelyn making the most of his sacrifice in withdrawing from the field and again he realised that he had acted wisely a love affair appealed to his listeners and there was a romance in this one that heightened the effect of it  but miss chisholm cant mean to turn from him now said celia  carroll looked at her meaningly no she turned from him before he sailed she heard something about him  his companions appeared astonished but she couldnt have heard anything that anybody could mind kitty exclaimed indignantly hes not that kind of man  its a compliment said carroll i think he deserves it at the same time hes a little rash and now and then a mans generosity is open to misconception in this case i dont think one could altogether blame miss chisholm  kitty glanced at him sharply and then at celia who at first looked puzzled and afterwards startled then the blood surged into kittys cheeks oh she said as if she were breathless i was once afraid of something like this you mean were the cause of it  the course he followed was hateful to carroll but the tangle could not be straightened without somebodys feelings being hurt and it was his comrade he was most concerned about  yes he said quietly i believe you understand the situation  he saw the fire in kittys eyes and that celias face was also flushed but he did not think their anger was directed against him they knew the world they lived in and for that matter he could share their indignation he resented the fact that a little thing should bring such swift suspicion upon them he was however not required to face any disconcerting climax  well said celia why did you tell us this  i think you both owe vane something and you can do him a great favour now carroll informed her  kitty looked up at him dont ask me too much mr carroll im irish and i feel like killing somebody  its natural said carroll with a sympathetic smile ive now and then felt much the same thing its probably unavoidable in a world like this however i think you ought to call upon miss chisholm after ive gone though you had better not mention that i sent you you can say you came for news of vaneand add anything you consider necessary  the girls looked at one another and at length though it obviously cost her a struggle kitty said to celia firmly we will have to go then she faced round towards carroll if miss chisholm wont believe us shell be sorry we came  carroll made her a slight inclination shell deserve it if shes not convinced but it might be better if you didnt approach her in the mood youre in just now  kitty rose signing to celia and he turned back with them towards the city feeling a certain constraint in their company and yet conscious of a strong relief it had grown dark when he returned to nairns house  where have ye been his host inquired i had a clerk seeking ye all round the city i cannot get ye a boat before the morn  carroll saw that mrs nairn shared her husbands desire to learn how he had been occupied evelyn was also in the room  there were one or two little matters that required attention and i managed to arrange them satisfactorily he said among other things ive got a tug and i expect to sail in an hour or two miss horsfield found me the vessel  he noticed evelyns interest and was rather pleased to see it if she were disposed to be jealous of jessie it could do no harm nairn however frowned  im thinking it might have been better if ye had not troubled jessie he commented  im sorry i cant agree with you carroll retorted the difference between this evening and noon tomorrow is a big consideration  weel said nairn resignedly i canna deny that  carroll changed the subject but some time later mrs nairn sat down near him in the temporary absence of her husband and evelyn  we will no be disturbed for two or three minutes she said ye answered alec like a scotsman before supper and put him off the track though thats no so easy done  youre too complimentary he declared the genuine caledonian caution cant be acquired by outsiders its a gift  ill no practise it now said the lady yeer no so proud of yourself for nothing what have ye been after  carroll crossed his finger tips and looked at her over them since you ask the question i may say this if miss chisholm has two lady visitors during the next few days you might make sure she sees them  what are their names  miss hartley the daughter of the prospector who sent vane off to look for the timber miss blake who as you have probably heard once came down the west coast with him in company with an elderly lady and myself  mrs nairn started then she looked thoughtful and finally broke into a smile of open appreciation  now she said i understand i did not think it of ye yere no far from a genius  thanks said carroll modestly i believe i succeeded better than i could have expected and perhaps than i deserved  then they were interrupted for nairn walked hastily into the room  theres one of the atlins deck hands below he announced hes come on here from horsfields to say the boats ready with a full head of steam up and the packers ye hired are waiting on the wharf  carroll rose and became in a moment intent and eager tell him ill be down almost as soon as he is he said youll have to excuse me  two minutes later he left the house and fervent good wishes followed him from the party on the stoop he did not stop to acknowledge them but shortly afterwards the blast of a whistle came ringing across the roofs from beside the waterfront     chapter xxx  convincing testimony   one afternoon three or four days after carroll had sailed evelyn sat alone in mrs nairns drawingroom a prey to confused regrets and keen anxiety she had recovered from the first shock caused by carrolls news but though she could face the situation more calmly she could find no comfort anywherevane was lying helpless and famishing in the frostbound wilderness she knew she loved the man indeed she had really known it for some time and it was that which had made jessies revelation so bitter now fastidious in thought and feeling as she was she wondered if she had been too hard upon him it was becoming more and more difficult to believe that he could have justified her disgust and anger but this was not what troubled her most she had sent him away with cold disfavour he was threatened by many dangers it was horrible to think of what might befall him before assistance arrived and yet she could not drive the haunting dread out of her mind  she was in this mood when a maid announced that two visitors wished to see her and when they were shown in she found it difficult to hide her astonishment as she recognised in kitty the very attractive girl she had once seen in vanes company it was this which prompted her to assume a chilling manner though she asked her guests to be seated neither of them appeared altogether at her ease and there was indeed a rather ominous sparkle in kittys blue eyes the latter began the conversation  mr carroll was in town not long ago she said have you had any news of him since he sailed  evelyn did not know what to make of the question and she answered coldly no we do not expect any word for some time  im sorry said kitty were anxious about mr vane  on the surface the announcement appeared significant but the girls boldness in coming to her for news was unexplainable to evelyn puzzled as she was her attitude became more discouraging  you know him then she said  something in her tone made celias cheeks burn and she drew herself up  yes she said we know him both of us i guess its astonishing to you but i met him first when he was poor and getting rich hasnt spoiled mr vane  evelyn was once more puzzledthe girls manner savoured less of assurance than of wholesome pride which had been injured kitty however broke in  we had no cards to send in but im kathleen blake and this is celia hartleyit was her father sent mr vane off to look for the spruce  ah said evelyn a little more gently addressing celia i understand your father died  kitty flashed a commanding glance at celia who spoke yes that is correct he left me ill and worn out without a dollar and i dont know what i should have done if mr vane hadnt insisted on giving drayton a little money for me on account he said because i was a partner in the venture then miss horsfield got me some work to do at home among her friends mr vane must have asked her to it would be like him  evelyn sat silent for a few moments celia had given her a good deal of information in answer to a very simple remark but she was most impressed by the statement that jessie who had prejudiced her against vane had helped the girl at his request it was difficult to believe she would have done so had there been any foundation for her insinuations if celia spoke the truth and evelyn somehow felt this was the case the whole thing was extraordinary  now said celia its no way surprising im grateful to mr vane and anxious to hear if mr carroll has reached him this was spoken with a hint of defiance but the girls voice changed i am anxious its horrible to think of a man like him freezing in the bush  her concern was so genuine and yet somehow so innocent that evelyns heart softened  yes she said its dreadful then she asked a question whos the mr drayton you mentioned  kitty blushed becomingly this was her lead hes a kind of partner in the lumber scheme im going to marry him hes as firm a friend of mr vanes as any one theres a reason for thati was in a very tight place once left without money in a desolate settlement where there was nothing i could do when mr vane helped me but perhaps that wouldnt interest you  for a moment her doubts still clung to their hold in evelyns mind and then she suddenly drove the last of them out with a stinging sense of humiliation she could not distrust this girl it was jessies suggestion that was incredible  it would interest me very much she said  kitty told her story effectively but with caution laying most stress upon vanes compassion for the child and her invalid mother she was rather impressed by miss chisholm but she supposed the latter was endowed with some of the failings common to human nature  evelyn listened to her with confused emotions and a softened face she was convinced of the truth of the simple tale and the thought of vanes keeping his monied friends and directors waiting in vancouver in order that a tired child might rest and gather shells upon a sunny beach stirred her deeply it was so characteristic exactly what she would have expected him to do  thank you she said quietly when kitty had finished and then flinging off the last of her reserve she asked a number of questions about drayton and celias affairs before her visitors left all three were on friendly terms but evelyn was glad when they took their departure  she wanted to be alone to think though in spite of the relief she was conscious of her thoughts were far from pleasant and foremost among them figured a crushing sense of shame she had wickedly misjudged a man who had given her many proofs of the fineness of his character the evil she had imputed to him was born of her own perverted imagination she was no better than the narrowminded conventional pharisees she detested who were swift to condemn out of the uncleanness of their selfrighteous hearts then as she began to reason it flashed upon her that she was perhaps wronging herself her mind had been cunningly poisoned by an utterly unscrupulous and wholly detestable woman and she flamed out into a fit of imperious anger against jessie she had a hazy idea that this was not altogether reasonable since she was to some extent fastening the blame she deserved upon another person but it did not detract from the comfort the indulgence in her indignation brought her  when she had grown calmer mrs nairn came in and mrs nairn was a discerning lady it was not difficult to lead evelyn on to speak of her visitors for the girls pride was broken and she felt in urgent need of sympathy but when she had described the interview she felt impelled to avoid any discussion of its more important issues  i was surprised at the girls manner she concluded it must have been embarrassing to them but they were really so delicate over it and they had so much courage  mrs nairn smiled although one has travelled with thirdrate strolling companies and the other has waited in an hotel weel maybe your surprise was natural ye cannot all at once get rid of the ideas and prejudices ye were brought up with  i suppose that was it said evelyn thoughtfully  her companions eyes twinkled then if yere to live among us happily yell have to try in the way ye use the words some of the leading men in this country were no brought up at all  do you imagine that im going to live here  mrs nairn gathered up one or two articles she had brought into the room with her and moved towards the door but before she reached it she looked back at the girl  it occurred to me that the thing was no altogether impossible she said  an hour afterwards evelyn went down into the town with her and in one of the streets they came upon jessie leaving a store the latter was not lacking in assurance and she moved forward to meet them but evelyn gazed at her with a total disregard of her presence and walked quietly on there was neither anger nor disdain in her attitude to have shown either would have been a concession she could not make the instincts of generations of gentlyreared englishwomen were aroused as well as the revulsion of an untainted nature from something unclean  jessies cheeks turned crimson and a malevolent light flashed into her eyes as she crossed the street mrs nairn noticed her expression and smiled at her companion  im thinking its as weel ye met jessie after she had got the boat for carroll she said  the remark was no doubt justified but the fact that jessie had been able to offer valuable assistance failed to soften evelyn towards her it was merely another offence  in the meanwhile the tug had steamed northwards towing the sloop which would be required and after landing the rescue party at the inlet steamed away again before she had disappeared carroll began his march and his companions long remembered it two of them were accustomed to packing surveyors stores through the seldomtrodden bush and the others had worked in logging camps and chopped new roads but though they did not spare themselves they lacked their leaders stimulus carroll with all his love of ease could rise to meet an emergency and he wore out his companions before the journey was half done he scarcely let them sleep he fed them on canned stuff to save delay in lighting fires and he grew more feverishly impatient with every mile they made he showed it chiefly by the tight set of his lips and the tension in his face though now and then when fallen branches or thickets barred the way he fell upon the obstacles with the axe in silent fury for the rest he took the lead and kept it and the others following with shoulders aching from the pack straps and laboured breath suppressed their protests  like many another made in that country it was an heroic journey one in which mind and body were taxed to the limit delay might prove fatal the loads were heavy fatigue seized the shrinking flesh but the unrelenting will trained in such adventures mercilessly spurred it on toughened muscle is useful and in the trackless north can seldom be dispensed with but mans strength does not consist of that alone there are occasions when the stalwart fall behind and die  in front of them as they progressed lay the unchanging forest tangled choked with fallen wreckage laced here and there with stabbing thorns appalling and almost impenetrable to the stranger they must cleave their passage except where they could take to the creek for an easier way and wade through stingingly cold water or flounder over slippery fangs of rock and iceencrusted stones there was sharp frost among the ranges and the brush they broke through was generally burdened with clogging snow they went on however and on the last day carroll drew away from those who followed him it was dark when he discovered that he had lost them but that did not matter for now and then faint moonlight came filtering down and he was leaving a plain trail behind his shoulders were bleeding beneath the biting straps he was on the verge of exhaustion but he struggled forward panting heavily and rending his garments to rags as he smashed through the brakes in the darkness  the nightit seemed a very long onewas nearly over when he recognised the roar of a rapid that rang in louder and louder pulsations across the snowsprinkled bush he was not far from the end now and he became conscious of an unnerving fear the ground was ascending sharply and when he reached the top of the slope the question he shrank from would be answered for him if there was no blink of light among the serried trunks he would have come too late  he reached the summit and his heart jumped then he clutched at a drooping branch to support himself shaken by a reaction that sprang from relief a flicker of uncertain radiance fell upon the trees ahead and down the bitter wind there came the reek of pungent smoke after that for the bush was slightly more open carroll believed he ran and presently came crashing and stumbling into the light of the fire then he stopped too stirred and out of breath to speak for vane lay where the red glow fell upon his face smiling up at him  well he said youve come ive been expecting you but on the whole i got along not so badly  carroll flung off his pack and sat down beside the fire then he fumbled for his pipe and began to fill it hurriedly with trembling fingers  sorry i couldnt get through sooner he explained the stores on board the sloop were spoiled i had to go on to vancouver but there are things to eat in my pack  hand it across said vane i havent been faring sumptuously the last few days no sit still im supple enough from the waist up  he proved it by the way he leaned to and fro as he opened the pack and distributed part of its contents among the cooking utensils while carroll who assisted now and then did not care to speak the sight of the mans gaunt face and the eagerness in his eyes prompted him to an outbreak of feeling which was rather foreign to his nature and which he did not think vane would appreciate when the meal was ready the latter looked up at him  ive no doubt this journey cost you something partner he said  then they ate cheerfully and carroll who watched his friends efforts with appreciation told his story in broken sentencessometimes with his mouth rather full for he had not troubled about much cooking since he left the inlet afterwards they lighted their pipes but by and by carrolls fell from his relaxing grasp  i cant get over this sleepiness he explained i believe i disgraced myself in vancouver by going off in the most unsuitable places  i dare say it was natural said vane with some dryness anyway hadnt you better hitch yourself a little farther from the fire  carroll did so and lay still afterwards but vane kept watch during the rest of the night until in the dawn the packers appeared     chapter xxxi  vane is reinstated   breakfast was over and the two men wrapped in blankets lay on opposite sides of the fire now that they had a supply of provisions haste was not a matter of importance and the rescue party needed a rest carroll was aching all over his body and somewhat disturbed in mind because he had not said anything about their financial affairs to his comrade yet and the subject must be mentioned  what about the clermont vane asked at length you neednt trouble about breaking the news come right to the point  then to all intents and purposes the company has gone under its been taken over by horsfields friends nairn has sold our stockat considerably less than its face value and carroll added a brief account of the absorption of the concern  ah said vane whose face set hard i anticipated something of the kind last night i saw how you kept clear of the matter  but you said nothing  no said vane id had time to consider the thing while i lay here and it didnt look as if i could have got an intelligible account out of you but you may as well mention how much nairn got for the shares  he lay smoking silently for a few minutes after carroll told him and the latter was strongly moved to sympathy since he thought it was not his financial reverse but one indirect result of it which would hit his comrade hardest  well said vane grimly i suppose ive done what my friends would consider a mad thing in coming up here and i must face the reckoning  carroll wondered if their conversation could be confined to the surface of the subject because there were depths it would be better to leave undisturbed  after all youre far from broke he said as cheerfully as he could you have what the clermont stock brought in and you may make something out of this shinglesplitting scheme  there was bitterness in vanes laugh when i left vancouver for england i was generally supposed to be well on the way to affluence and there was some foundation for the idea i had floated the clermont in the face of opposition people believed in me i could have raised what dollars i required for any new undertaking now a good deal of my money and my prestige is gone folks have very little confidence in a man who has shown himself a failure besides i may be a cripple  carroll could guess his companions thoughts there was a vein of stubborn pride in him and he had no doubt decided it was unfitting that evelyns future should be linked to that of a ruined man this was an exaggerated view because vane was in reality far from ruined and even if he had been so he had in him the ability to recover from his misfortunes still the man was obstinate and generally ready to make a sacrifice for an idea carroll however consoled himself with the reflection that evelyn would probably have something to say upon the subject if she were given an opportunity and he thought mrs nairn would contrive that she had one  i cant see any benefit in making things out as considerably worse than they are he said  nor can i vane agreed after all i was getting pretty tired of the city and i suppose i can raise enough to put up a smallpower mill it will be a pleasant change to take charge for a year or two in the bush ill make a start at the thing as soon as im able to walk  this was significant because it implied that he did not intend to remain in vancouver where he would have been able to enjoy evelyns company but carroll made no comment and by and by vane spoke again  didnt you mention last night that it was through miss horsfield you got the tug he asked i was thinking about something else at the time  yes said carroll she made horsfield put some pressure on the people who had previously hired the boat  ah said vane thats rather strange  for a moment he looked puzzled but almost immediately his face grew impassive and carroll knew that he had some idea of jessies treachery he was however sure that any suspicions his comrade entertained would remain locked up in his breast  im grateful to her anyway the latter resumed i believe i could have held out another day or two but it wouldnt have been pleasant  carroll began to talk about the preparations for their return which he soon afterwards set about making and early next morning they started for the sloop carrying vane upon a stretcher they had brought though they had to cut a passage for it every here and there they reached the vessel safely and after some trouble in getting him below and on to a locker carroll decided to sail straight for vancouver they were favoured with moderate fair winds and though the boat was uncomfortably crowded she made a quick passage and stole in through the narrows as dusk was closing down one tranquil evening  as it happened evelyn had spent part of the afternoon on the forestcrested rise above the city up which new dwellings were then creeping though they have no doubt spread beyond it and back into the bush by now from there she could look down upon the inlet and she had visited the spot frequently during the last few days watching eagerly for a sail that did not appear there had been no news of carroll since the skipper of the tug reported having landed him and the girl was tormented by doubts and anxieties she had just come back and was standing in mrs nairns sittingroom when she heard the tinkle of the telephone bell a moment or two later her hostess entered hastily  its a message from alec she cried hes heard from the wharf vanes sloops crossing the harbour ill away down to see carroll brings him here  evelyn turned to follow her but mrs nairn waved her back no she said firmly yell bide where ye are see they get plenty lights onat the stairhead and in the passageand the room on the left of it ready  she was gone in another moment and evelyn who carried out her instructions afterwards waited with what patience she could assume at last there was a rattle of wheels outside followed by a voice giving orders and then a tramp of feet the sounds brought her a strange inward shrinking but she ran to the door and saw two tattered men awkwardly carrying a stretcher up the steps while carroll and another assisted them then the light fell upon its burden and half prepared as she was she started in dismay vane whom she had last seen in vigorous health lay partly covered with an old blanket which had slipped off him to the waist and his jacket looked a mass of rags his hat had fallen aside and his face showed hollow and worn and pinched then he saw her and a light sprang into his eyes but next moment carrolls shoulder hid him and the men plodded on towards the stairs they ascended them with difficulty and the girl waited until carroll came down  i noticed you at the door and i expect you were a little shocked at the change in vane he said what he has undergone has pulled him down but if you had seen him when i first found him youd have been worse startled hes getting on quite satisfactorily  evelyn was relieved to hear it but carroll who had paused continued as soon as the doctor comes well make him more presentable but as im not sure about the last bandages i put on he cant be moved till then afterwards hell no doubt hold an audience  there was nothing to do but wait and evelyn again summoned her patience before long a doctor arrived and carroll followed him to vanes room alone the latters face was very impassive though carroll waited in tense suspense while the doctor stripped off the bandages and bark supports from the injured leg he examined it attentively and then looked round at carroll  you fixed that limb when it was broken in the bush he said  yes said carroll with a desperate attempt to treat the matter humourously but i really think we both had a hand in the thing my partner favoured me with his views i disclaim some of the responsibility  then i guess youve been remarkably fortunate which is perhaps the best way of expressing it  vane raised his head and fixed his eyes upon the speaker it wont have to be rebroken ill be able to walk without a limp  i should say the latters very probable  vanes eyes glistened and he let his head fall back  its good news better than i expected now if you could fix me up again id like to get dressed ive felt like a hobo long enough  the doctor nodded indulgently we can venture to change that state of affairs but ill superintend the operation  it was some time before vanes toilet was completed and then carroll surveyed him with humorous admiration  you do us credit and now i suppose i can announce that youll receive he said  nairn and his wife and evelyn came in and the former who shook hands with vane very heartily afterwards looked down at him with twinkling eyes  id have been glad to see ye however ye had come he said and vane fully believed him for a that this is no the way i could have wished to welcome ye  when a man wont take his friends advice what can he expect said vane  let it be a warning if the making of your mark and dollars is your object ye must stick to it and think of nothing else ye cannot accumulate riches by spreading yourself and philanthropys no lucrative except maybe to a few  its good counsel but im thinking thats a pity his wife remarked what would ye say evelyn  the girl was aware that the tone of light banter had been adopted to cover deeper feelings which those present shrank from expressing but she ventured to give her thoughts free rein  i agree with you in one respect she said but i cant believe that the object mentioned is mr vanes only one he would never be willing to pay the necessary price  it was a delicate compliment uttered in all sincerity and vanes worn face grew warm he was however conscious that it would be safer to avoid being serious and he smiled  well he said looking for timber rights is apt to prove expensive too i had a haunting fear i might be lame until the doctor banished it id better own that id no great confidence in carrolls surgery  carroll keeping strictly to the line the others had chosen made him an ironical bow but evelyn was not to be deterred  it was foolish of you to be troubled she declared it isnt a fault to be wounded in an honourable fight and even if the mark remains there is no reason why one should be ashamed of it  mrs nairn glanced at the girl rather sharply but carroll came to his comrades assistance  strictly speaking there wasnt a wound he pointed out fortunately it was what is known as a simple fracture if it had been anything else im inclined to think i couldnt have treated it  nairn chuckled as if this met with his approval but his wife turned round and they heard a patter of footsteps on the stairs  yon bell has kept on ringing since we came up she said i left word i was no to be disturbed weelas the door openedwhat is it minnie  the receptionrooms plumb full announced the maid who was lately from the bush if any more folks come along i wont know where to put them  now the door was open evelyn could hear a murmur of voices on the floor below and next moment the bell rang violently again which struck her as a testimonial to the injured man vane had not spent a long time in vancouver but he had the gift of making friends having heard of the sloops arrival they had come to inquire for him and there was obviously a number of them  mrs nairn glanced interrogatively at carroll it does not look as if they could be got rid of by a message  i guess hes fit to see them carroll answered well hold the levée if hed only let me id like to pose him a bit  mrs nairn with evelyns assistance did so instead rearranging the cushions about the man in spite of his confused and halfindignant protests and during the next half hour the room was generally full people walked in made sympathetic inquiries or exchanged cheerful banter until mrs nairn forcibly dismissed the last of them after this she declared that vane must go to sleep and paying no heed to his assertion that he had not the least wish to do so she led her remaining companions away  a couple of hours had passed when she handed evelyn a large tumbler containing a preparation of whippedup eggs and milk  ye might take him this and ask if he would like anything else she said im weary of the stairs and i would not trust minnie shes handiest at spilling things  its the third and id better say firmly the limit carroll remarked then he assumed an aggrieved expression as evelyn moved off with a tray i cant see why i couldnt have gone i believe ive discharged my duties as nurse satisfactorily  evelyn shared his suspicions her hostesss artifice was a transparent one but she nevertheless fell in with it she had only seen vane in the company of others this might be the same again tomorrow and there was something to be said by intuition as much as reason she knew that there was something working in his mind something that troubled him and might trouble her it excited her apprehension and animated her with a desire to combat it that she might be compelled to follow an unconventional course did not matter this man was hersand she could not let him go  she entered his room collectedly he was lying neatly dressed upon a couch with his shoulders raised against the end of it for he had thrown the cushions which had supported him upon the floor as she came in he leaned down in an attempt to recover them and finding himself too late looked up guiltily the fact that he could move with so much freedom was a comfort to the girl she set down the tray on a table near him  mrs nairn has sent you this she said and the laugh they both indulged in drew them together  then her mood changed and her heart yearned over him he had gone away a strong selfconfident prosperous man and he had come back defeated broken in health and fortune and terribly worn her pity shone in her softening eyes  do you wish to sleep she asked  no vane assured her id a good deal sooner talk to you  well said evelyn i have something to say im afraid i was rather unpleasant to you the evening before you sailed i was sorry for it afterwards it was flagrant injustice  then i wonder why you didnt answer the letter i wrote at nanaimo  for a very good reason i never got it  vane considered this for a few moments after all he said it doesnt matter now im acquitted  absolutely  do you know he said ive still no idea of my offence  evelyn was exceedingly glad to hear it but a warmth crept into her face and as the blood showed through the delicate skin he fixed his eyes intently upon her  it was all a mistake im sorry still she declared penitently  oh he said in a different tone i wouldnt trouble about it the satisfaction of being acquitted outweighs everything else besides ive made a number of rather serious mistakes myself the search for that spruce for instance is supposed to be one  no said evelyn decidedly whoever thinks that is wrong it is a very fine thing you have done it doesnt matter in the least that you were unsuccessful  you believe that  of course how could i believe anything else  the mans face changed again and once more she read the signs whatever doubts and halfformed resolutionsand she had some idea of themhad been working in his mind were dissipating  well he said ive sacrificed the best of my possessions and destroyed the confidence of folks who to serve their ends would have helped me on isnt that a serious thing  no its really a most unimportant one iand the slight pause gave the assertion forcei really mean it  vane partly raised himself with one arm and there was no doubting the significance of his intent gaze  i believe i made another blunderin england i should have had more courage and have faced the risk but you might have turned against me then  i dont think thats likely said evelyn lowering her eyes  the man leaned forward towards her but the hand he stretched out fell short and the trivial fact once more roused her compassion for his helplessness  you can only mean one thing he said you wouldnt be afraid to face the future with me now  i wouldnt be afraid at all said evelyn quietly  by and by mrs nairn tapped at the door and smiled rather broadly when she came in then she shook her head in reproach  ye should have been asleep a while since she said to vane and turned to evelyn is this the way ye intend to look after him  she waved the girl towards the door and when she joined her in the passage kissed her effusively  yeve got the man i would have chosen for ye she said                                  the end
