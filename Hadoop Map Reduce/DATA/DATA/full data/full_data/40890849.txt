commonplace incidents  319     the heart of a woman  baroness orczy     chapter i  which tells of a very commonplace incident   no no she was not going to gushnot even though there was nothing in the room at this moment to stand up afterward before her as dumb witness to a moments possible weakness less than nothing in fact space might have spoken and recalled that moment    infinite nothingness might at some future time have brought back the memory of it    but these dumb impassive objects    the fountain pen between her fingers the dull uninteresting hotel furniture covered in red velvetan uninviting red that repelled dreaminess and peace the ormolu clock which had ceased long ago to mark the passage of time weariedas it no doubt was poor thingby the monotonous burden of a bronze psyche gazing on her shiny brown charms in an utterly blank and unreflective bronze mirror while obviously bemoaning the fracture of one of her smooth bronze thighs indeed louisa might well have given way to that overmastering feeling of excitement before all these things they would neither see nor hear they would never deride for they could never remember  but a wood fire crackled on the small hearth    and    and those citroncoloured carnations were favourite flowers of his    and his picture did stand on the top of that ugly little louis philippe bureau    no no it would never do to gush for these things would see    and though they might not remember they would remind  and louisa counted herself one of the strong ones of this earth just think of her name have you ever known a louisa who gushed who called herself the happiest woman on earth who thought of a manjust an ordinary man mind youas the best the handsomest the truest the most perfect hero of romance that ever threw a radiance over the entire prosy world of the twentieth century  louisas believe me do no such things the mays and the floras the lady barbaras and lady edithas look beatific and charming when clasping their lilywhite hands together and raising violet eyes to the patterned ceiling paper above them they exclaim oh my hero and my king  but louisas would only look ridiculous if they behaved like that    louisa harris too    louisa the eldest of three sisters the daughter of a wealthy english gentleman with a fine estate in kent an assured position no troubles no cares nothing in her life to make it sad or sordid or interesting    louisa harris and romance    why she was not even pretty she had neither violet eyes nor hair of ruddy gold the latter was brown and the former were gray    how could romance come in the way of gray eyes and of a girl named louisa  can you conceive for instance one of those adorable detrimentals of low degree and empty pocket who have a way of arousing love in the hearts of the beautiful daughters of irascible millionaires can you conceive such an interesting personage i say falling in love with louisa harris  i confess that i cannot to begin with dear kind squire harris was not altogether a millionaire and not at all irascible and penniless owners of romantic personalities were not on his visiting list  therefore louisa living a prosy life of luxury got up every morning ate a copious breakfast walked out with the dogs hunted in the autumn skated in the winter did the london season and played tennis in the summer just as hundreds and hundreds of other wellborn wellbred english girls of average means average positions average education hunt dance and play tennis throughout the length and breadth of this country  there was no room for romance in such a life no time for it    the life itself was so full alreadyso full of the humdrum of daily rounds of common tasks that the heart which beat with such ordinary regularity in the seemingly ordinary breast of a very ordinary girl did so all unconscious of the intense pathos which underlay this very ordinary existence  vaguely louisa knew that somewhere beyond even the land of dreams there lay all unknown all mysterious a glorious world of romance a universe peopled by girlish imaginings and the sensitive creating thoughts of poets by the galloping phantasies of superexcited brains and the vague longings of ambitious souls a universe wherein dwelt alike the memories of those who have loved and the hopes of those who suffer but when she thought of it all she did so as one who from the arid plain gazes on the cool streams and golden minarets which the fairy fata morgana conjures on the horizon far away she looked on it as all unreal and altogether beyond her ken she shut her eyes to the beautiful mirage her heart against its childish yearnings  such things did not exist they were not for herlouisa harris the little kitchenmaid at the court who on sunday evenings went off giggling her chubby face glowing with pride and the result of recent ablutions on the arm of jim the third gardener knew more about that world of romance than wellbred wellborn young ladies ever dreamed of in their commonplace philosophy  and louisa harris had always shut down the book which spoke of such impossible things and counted herself one of the strong ones of the earth  therefore now with lukes letter in her hand in which he tells her in a very few words that he loves her beyond anything on earth and that he only waits the day when he can call her his own his very own dearly loved wife why should louisaprosy healthyminded healthybodied louisasuddenly imagine that the whole world is transfiguredthat the hotel room is a kind of antechamber to heaventhat the red velvet uncompromising chairs are clouds of a roseate hue and that the bronze psyche with the broken thigh is the elusive fairy who with morganalike wand hath conjured up this mirage of glorious visions which mayhap would vanish again before long  she went up to the window and rested her forehead against the cool pane she might be ever so strong she could not help her forehead feeling hot and her eyes being full of tearstears that did not hurt as they fell  outside the weather was indeed prosy and commonplace rain was coming down in torrents and beating against the newspaper kiosk over the way on the roofs of tramways and taxiautos making the electric light peep dimly through the veil of wet drowning by its incessant patter to which the gusts of a november gale made fitful if loud accompaniment the shouts of the cochers on their boxes the rattle of wheels on the stone pavement even at times the shrill whistle for cabs emanating from the porch of the brilliantly lighted palace hotel  it was close on halfpast six by the clock of the gare du nord opposite the express from ostend had just come invery late of course owing to the gale which had delayed the mail boat louisa straining her eyes watched the excited crowd pouring out of the station in the wake of porters and of piles of luggage jabbering shouting and fussing like an army of irresponsible pigmies men in blouses and men in immaculate bowler hats women wrapped in furs clinging to gigantic headgear that threatened to leave the safe refuge of an elaborate coiffure or of well fixed gargantuan hatpins midinettes in fashionable skirts and highheeled shoes country women in wool shawls that flapped round their bulky forms like the wings of an overfed bat all hurrying and jostling one another in a mad endeavour to avoid the onrush of the innumerable taxiautos which in uncountable numbers wound in and out of the slower moving traffic like the erratic thread of some living tangled skein  just the everyday prosy life of a small but ambitious capital struggling in the midst of an almost overpowering sense of responsibility toward the whole of europe in view of its recent great colonial expansion  louisa gave an impatient sigh  even the strong ones of the earth get wearied of the daily round the common task at times she and aunt were due to dine at the british embassy at eight oclock it was only halfpast six now and obviously impossible to sit another two hours in this unresponsive hotel room in the company of red velvet chairs and the bronze psyche  aunt in conjunction with her maid annette was busy laying the foundations of an elaborate toilette louisa was free to do as she pleased she got a serviceable ulster and a diminutive hat and sallied forth into the streets she did not want to think or to dream nor perhaps did she altogether wish to work off that unusual feeling of excitement which had so unaccountably transformed her ever since lukes letter had come  all she wanted was to be alone and to come out of herself for awhile she had been alone all the afternoon save for that brief half hour when aunt discussed the obvious over a badly brewed cup of tea it was not that kind of aloneness which louisa wanted now but rather the solitude which a crowded street has above all the power to give  there is a kind of sociability in any room be it ever so uncompromising in the matter of discomfort but a crowded street can be unutterably lonely either cruelly so or kindly as the case may be  to louisa harris the commonplace society girl accustomed to tea fights to dances and to dinner parties the loneliness of this crowded little city was eminently welcome with her dark ulster closely buttoned to the throat the small hat tied under her chin with everything on her weatherproof and unfashionable she attracted no notice from the passersby  not one head was turned as with a long breath of delight she sallied forth from under the portico of the hotel out into the muddy busy street not one glance of curiosity or interest so freely bestowed in the streets of foreign capitals on a solitary female figure if it be young and comely followed this very ordinarylooking english miss  to the crowd she was indifferent these men and women hurrying along pushing jostling and scurrying knew nothing of luke nor that she louisa harris was the happiest woman on earth  she turned back toward the boulevard meaning to take a brisk walk all along the avenue of trees which makes a circuit round the inner part of the town and which ultimately would lead her back to the gare du nord and the palace hotel it was a walk she had often done before save for one or two busy corners on the way it would be fairly solitary and peaceful  louisa stepped out with an honest british tread hands buried in the pockets of her serviceable ulster head bent against the sudden gusts of wind she did not mind the darkness of the illlighted wide boulevard and had every intention of covering the two miles in a little more than half an hour  how the time sped it seemed as if she had only just left the hotel and already surely not a quarter of a mile away she could see glimmering the lights of the place namur the halfway point of her walk  she was in the boulevard waterloo where private houses with closed portecochères add nothing to the municipal lighting of the thoroughfare  trams had been rushing past her in endless succession but now there was a lull close by her a taxiauto whizzed quickly past and came to a standstill some hundred yards away near the pavement and not far from an electric light standard  louisa with vacant eyes attached on that cab but with her mind fixed on a particular room in a particular house in grosvenor square where lived a man of the name of luke de mountford continued her walk those same vacant eyes of hers presently saw the chauffeur of the taxiauto get down from his box and open the door of the cab and then her absent mind was suddenly brought back from grosvenor square london to the boulevard waterloo in brussels by a terrible cry of horror which had broken from that same chauffeurs lips instinctively louisa hurried on but even as she did so a small crowd which indeed seemed to have sprung from nowhere had already gathered round the vehicle  murmurs of what is it what is it mingled with smothered groans of terror as curiosity caused one or two of the more bold to peer into the gloomy depths of the cab shrill calls brought a couple of gardiens to the spot in a moment louisa found herself a unit in an eager anxious crowd asking questions conjecturing wondering horrorstruck as soon as a plausible and graphic explanation came from those who were in the forefront and were privileged to see  a manmurdered  but how  the chauffeur got down from his box    and looked in    ah mon dieu  what did he see  a man    he is quite young    only about twenty years of age  stabbed through the neck  stabbedbah  right through the neck i tell you    just below the ear i can see the wound quite small as if done with a skewer  allons voyons voyons came the gruff accents from the two portly gardiens who worked vigorously with elbows and even feet to keep the crowd somewhat at bay  louisa was on the fringe of the crowd she could see nothing of courseshe did not wish to see that which the chauffeur saw when first he opened the door of his cabbut she stood rooted to the spot feeling that strange unexplainable fascination which one always feels when one of those great life dramas of which one reads so often and so indifferently happens to be enacted within the close range of ones own perception  she gleaned a phrase here and theresaw the horrorstricken faces of those who had seen the placid bovine expression of the two gardiens more inured to such sights and calmly taking notes by the light of the electric standard  but to think that i drove that rascally murderer in my cab and put him down safe and sound not ten minutes ago came with the adjunct of a loud oath from the irate chauffeur  how did it all occur  the gardiens tried to stem the flow of the drivers eloquence such details should first be given to the police voyons but what were two fat mouchards against twenty stalwart idlers all determined to hearand then there were the womenthey were determined to know more  louisa bent her ear to listen she was just outside the crowdnot a part of itand there was no really morbid curiosity in her it was only the call of the imagination which is irresistible on these occasionsthe prosy matteroffact highbred girl could not just then tear herself away from that cab and the tragedy which had been enacted therein in the mysterious darkness whilst the unconscious driver sped along ignorant of the gruesome burden which he was dragging to its destination  voila he was saying with many ejaculations and expletives and a volley of excited gestures outside the parc near the theatre two bourgeois hailed me and one of them told me to draw up at the top of the galerie st hubert which i did the same onethe one who had told me where to gogot out clapped the door to and spoke a few words to his friend who had remained inside  what did he say  oh i couldnt hear and i didnt listen but after that he told me to drive on to boulevard waterloo no 34 and here i am  you suspected nothing  nothing how should i two bourgeois get into my cab i see nothing i hear nothing one of them gets out and tells me to drive on farther how should i think theres anything wrong  what was the other man like the one who spoke to you  ma foi i dont know    it was raining so fast and pitch dark just outside the parc lightsand he did seem to keep in the shadownow i come to think of itand his caphe wore a capwas pulled well over his faceand the collar of his coat was up to his nose it was raining so i didnt really see him properly i saw the other one betterthe one who has been murdered  but the rotund gardiens had had enough of this moreover they would hear all about it at full length presently as for the crowdit had no business to know too much  they hustled the excited driver back on to his box and themselves got into the cab beside itthe dead man stabbed in the neck from ear to earthe wound quite small as if it had been done with a skewer  the gardiens ordered the chauffeur to drive to the commissariat and louisa turned away with a slight shiver down her spine and her throat choked with the horror of what she had only guessed     chapter ii  once more the obvious   you dont suppose for a moment i hope that a girl like louisa would allow her mind to dwell on such horrors mysterious crimes in strange citiesand in london too for a matter of thatare alas of far too frequent occurrence to be quite as startling as they should be  a day or two later louisa harris and her aunt lady ryder crossed over to england they had spent five weeks in italy and one in brussels not with a view to dreaming over the beauties of the italian lakes or over the art treasures collected in the museums of brussels but because lady ryder had had a bronchial catarrh which she could not shake off and so her doctor had ordered her a thorough change bellaggio was selected and louisa accompanied her they stayed at the best hotels both in bellaggio and in brussels where lady ryder had several friends whom she wished to visit before she went home  nothing whatever happened that should not have happened everything was orderly and well managed the courier and the maid saw to tickets and to luggage to hotel rooms and sleeping compartments it was obviously their mission in life to see that nothing untoward or unexpected happened but only the obvious  it was clearly not their fault that miss harris had seen a cab in which an unknown man happened to have been murdered  louisa with a view to preventing her aunt from going to sleep after dinner and thereby spoiling her nights rest had told her of the incident which she had witnessed in the boulevard waterloo and lady ryder was genuinely shocked she vaguely felt that her niece had done something unladylike and odd which was so unlike louisa  the latter had amused herself by scanning a number of english papers in order to find out what was said in london about that strange crime which she had almost witnessedthe man stabbed through the neck from ear to ear and the wound so small it might have been done with a skewer but with characteristic indifference london paid but little heed to the mysterious dramas of a sister city a brief account of the gruesome discoverya figurative shrug of the shoulders as to the incompetence of the belgian police who held neither a clue to the perpetrator of the crime nor to the identity of the victim just a strangeran idler brussels was full of strangers just now his nationality who knows his individuality there seemed no one to care the police were active no doubt but so far they had discovered nothing  two men the murderer and the murdered engulfed in that great whirlpool known as humanity small units of no importance since no one seemed to care interesting to the detective whose duty it was to track the crime to its perpetrator interesting to the reporter who could fill a column with accounts of depositions of questionings of examinations interesting to the afterdinner talker who could expatiate over the moral lessons to be drawn from the conception of such a crime  but the murdered man goes to his grave unknown and the murderer wanders cainlike on the face of the earthas mysterious as unknown as silent as his victim     chapter iii  and now almost like a dream   everything went on just as conventionwhose mouthpiece for the moment happened to be lady ryderdesired just as louisa surmised that everything would the letters of congratulations the stately visits from and to lord radclyffe lukes uncle the magnificent diamond tiara from the latter the rope of pearls from luke the silver salvers and inkstands and enamel parasol handles from everybody who was anybody in london society  louisas portrait and that of luke hastily and cheaply reproduced in the halfpenny dailies so that she looked like a white negress with a cast in her eye and he like the mutilated hero of lhomme qui rit the more elegant halftone blocks in the sixpenny weeklies under the popular if somewhat hackneyed heading of the earl of radclyffes heir and his future bride miss louisa harris it was all there just as it had been for hundreds of other girls and hundreds of other young men before louisa had discovered that there was only one man in the whole wide world and that beyond the land of diamond tiaras and of society weddings there was a fairy universe immense and illimitable whereon the sun of happiness never set and whither no one dared venture alone only hand in hand with that other being the future mate the pupil and teacher of love the only one that mattered  and the wedding was to be in four weeks from this day the invitations were not out yet for louisa closely pressed by luke had only just made up her mind half an hour ago about the date strangely enough she had been in no hurry for the wedding day to come luke had been so anxious so crestfallen when she put him off with vague promises that she herself could not account for this strange reticence within herso unworthy a levelheaded conventional woman of the world  but the outer lobby of the fairy universe was surpassingly beautiful and though the golden gates to the inner halls beyond were ajar and would yield to the slightest pressure of louisas slender fingers yet she was glad to tarry awhile longer were they not hand in hand what mattered waiting since eternity called beyond those golden gates  this morning however conventionstill voiced by lady ryderwas more vigorous than was consistent with outward peace louisa worried by aunt and with the memory of lukes expression of misery and disappointment when last night she had again refused to fix the wedding day chided herself for her silly fancies and at eleven oclock set out for a stroll in battersea park her mind made up her unwonted fit of sentimentality smothered by the louder voice of commonsense  she and luke always took their walks abroad in battersea park in the morning hours they were free there from perpetual meetings with undesired companyall outside company being undesirable in the lobby of the fairy universe louisa had promised to meet luke in the tropical garden at halfpast eleven she was always punctual and he always before his time she smart and businesslike in her neat tailormade gown and close hat which defied wind and rain he always a little shamefaced when he took her neatly gloved hand in his as most english young men are apt to be when sentiment for the first time happens to overmaster them  today she saw him coming toward her just the same as on other days he walked just as briskly and held himself as erect as he always did but the moment that he was near enough for her to see his face she knew that there was something very wrong in the world and with him some one from the world of eternity beyond had seen fit to push the golden gates closer together so that now they would not yield quite so easily to the soft pressure of a womans hand  what is it luke she asked very quietly as soon as her fingers rested safely between his  what is what he rejoined foolishly and speaking like a child and with a forced almost inanelooking smile on his lips  what has happened she reiterated more impatiently  nothing he replied that need worry you i think shall we sit down here you wont catch cold and he indicated a seat well sheltered against the cold breeze and the impertinent gaze of the passersby  i never catch cold said louisa smiling in spite of herself at lukes funny awkward ways but we wont sit down let us stroll up and down shall we you can talk better then and tell me all about it  theres not much to tell at present and no occasion to worry  theres nothing that worries me so much as your shillyshallying luke or the thought that you are making futile endeavours to keep something from me she retorted almost irritably this time for strangely enough her nervesshe never knew before this that she had anywere slightly on the jar this morning  i dont want to shillyshally little girl he replied gently nor to keep anything from you there will you put your hand on my arm arry and arriet eh well never mind theres no one to see  he took her handthat neatly gloved small hand of hersand put it under his arm for one moment it seemed as if he would kiss that tiny and tantalizing place just below the thumb where the pink palm shows in the opening of the glove luke was not a demonstrative lover he was shy and english and abrupt but this morningwas it the breath of spring in the air the scent of the roman hyacinths in that bed over there or merely the shadow of a tiny cloud on the uniform blue of his lifes horizon that gave a certain rugged softness to his touch as his hand lingered over that neat glove which nestled securely in among the folds of his coat sleeve  now she said simply  have you he asked with abrupt irrelevance read your paper all through this morning  not all through only the important headlines  and you saw nothing about a claim to a peerage  nothing  well thats all about it a man has sprung up from nowhere in particular who claims to be my uncle arthurs son and therefore heir presumptive to the title and all  luke heaved a deep sigh as if with this brief if ungrammatical statement his own heart had been unburdened of a tiresome load  your uncle arthur she repeated somewhat bewildered  yes you never knew him did you  no she said i never knew him though as a baby i must have seen him i was only three i think when he died but i never heard that he had been married i am sure father never knew  nor did i nor did uncle rad nor any of us the whole thing is either a thunderbolt or    an imposture  tell me she said a little more clearly luke dear will you i am feeling quite muddled and now it was she who led the way to the isolated seat beneath that group of silver birch whose baby leaves trembled beneath the rough kiss of the cool april breeze  they sat down together and on the gravelled path in front of them a robin hopped half shyly half impertinently about and gazed with tiny inquisitive eyes on the doings of these big folk all around them the twitter of bird throats filled the air with its magic its hymn to the reawakened earth and drowned in this pleasing solitude the distant sounds of the busy city that seemed so far away from this secluded nook inhabited by birds and flowers and by two dwellers in fata morganas land  tell me first said louisa in her most prosy most matter of fact tone of voice all that is known about your uncle arthur  well up to now i individually knew very little about him he was the next eldest brother to uncle rad and my father was the youngest of all when uncle rad succeeded to the title arthur was heirpresumptive of course but as you know he diedas was supposed unmarriednineteen years ago and my poor dear father was killed in the hunting field the following year i was a mere kid then and the others were babiesorphans the lot of us my mother died when edith was born uncle rad was said to be a confirmed bachelor he took us all to live with him and was father mother elder brother elder sister to us all bless him  luke paused abruptly and louisa too was silent only the song of a thrush soaring upward to the skies called for that blessing which neither of them at that moment could adequately evoke  yes said louisa at last i knew all that  lord radclyffe and his people were all of the same world as herself she knew all about the present mans touching affection for the children of his youngest brother but more especially for luke on whom he bestowed an amount of love and tender care which would have shamed many a father by its unselfish intensity that affection was a beautiful trait in an otherwise not very lovable character  i daresay resumed luke after a little while that i have been badly brought up i mean in this way that ifif the whole story is trueif uncle arthur did marry and did have a son then i should have to go and shift for myself and for jim and frank and edith of course uncle rad would do what he could for us but i should no longer be his heirand we couldnt go on living at grosvenor square and  arent you rambling on a little too fast dear said louisa gently whilst she beamed with an almost motherly smilethe smile that a woman wears when she means to pacify and to comforton the troubled face of the young man  of course i am he replied more calmly but i cant help it for some days now ive had a sort of feeling that something was going to happenthatwell that things werent going to go right and this morning when i got up i made up my mind that i would tell you  when did you hear first and from whom  the first thing we heard was last autumn there came a letter from abroad for uncle rad it hadnt the private mark on it so mr warren opened it along with the rest of the correspondence he showed it to me the letter was signed philip de mountford and began my dear uncle i couldnt make head or tail of it i thought it all twaddle youve no idea what sort of letters uncle rad gets sometimes from every kind of lunatic or scoundrel you can think of who wants to get something out of him well this letter at first looked to me the same sort of thing i had never heard of any one who had the right to say dear uncle to uncle radbut it had a lot in it about blood being thicker than water and all the rest of it with a kind of request for justice and talk about the cruelty of fate the writer however asserted positively that he was the only legitimate son of mr arthur de mountford whothis he professed to have only heard recentlywas own brother to the earl of radclyffe the story which he went on to relate at full length was queer enough in all conscience i remember every word of it for it seemed to get right away into my brain then and there as if something was being hammered or screwed straight into one of the cells of my memory never really to come out again  and yet whenwhen we were first engaged rejoined louisa quietly you never told me anything about it  ill tell you directly how that was i remembered and then forgotif you know what i meanand now it has all come back at the time i thought the letter of this man who called himself philip de mountford nothing but humbug so did mr warren and yet he and i talked it over and discussed it between us for ever so long it all sounded so strange uncle arthurso this man said who called himself philip de mountfordhad married in martinique a halfcaste girl named adeline petit who was this same philips mother he declares that he has all the papersmarriage certificates or whatever they are calledto prove every word he says he did not want to trouble his uncle much only now that his mother was dead he felt all alone in the world and longed for the companionship and affection of his own kith and kin all he wanted he said was friendship then he went on to say that of course he did not expect his lordship to take his word for all this he only asked for an opportunity to show his dear uncle all the papers and other proofs which he held that he was in real and sober truth the only legitimate son of mr arthur de mountford own brother to his lordship  how old is this manthis philip de mountfordsupposed to be  well he said in that first letter that the marriage took place in the parish church of st pierre in martinique on the 28th of august 1881 that he himself was born the following year and christened in the same church under the name of philip arthur and registered as the son of mr arthur collingwood de mountford of fords mount in the county of northampton england and of adeline de mountford née petit his wife  twentyfour years ago said louisa thoughtfully and he only claims kinship with lord radclyffe now  thats just rejoined luke where the curious part of the story comes in this philip de mountfordi dont know how else to call himsaid in his first letter that his mother never knew that mr arthur de mountford was anything more than a private english gentleman travelling either for profit or pleasure but in any case not possessed of either wealth or social position between you and me dear i suppose that this adeline petit was just a halfcaste girl without much knowledge of what goes on in the world and why she should have married uncle arthur i cant think  if she did marry him you mean  if she did marry him as you say said luke with a singular want of conviction which louisa was not slow to remark  you think that this young mans story is true then  i dont know what to think and thats the truth  tell me more added louisa simply  well this philips story goes on to say that his fatheruncle arthurapparently soon tired of his exotic wife for it seems that two years after the marriage he left martinique and never returned to it to the day of his death  pardon said louisa in her prim little way my interrupting you but have any of youlord radclyffe i mean or any of your friendsany recollection of your uncle arthur living at martinique for awhile two years seems a long time  as a matter of fact uncle arthur was a bit of a wastrel you know he never would study for anything he passed into the navyvery well too i believebut he threw it all up almost as soon as he got his commission and started roaming about the world i do know for a fact that once his people had no news of him for about three or four years and then he turned up one fine day as if he had only been absent for a weeks shooting  when was that  i cant tell you exactly i was only a tiny kid at the time not more than three years old i should say yes i do remember now i come to think of it that uncle arthur was home the christmas after my third birthday i have a distinct recollection of my dad telling me that uncle arthur was one of my presents from father christmas and of my thinking what a rotten present it was later on in the nursery all of us children were rather frightened of him and we used to have great discussions as to where this uncle came from the christmas present theory was soon exploded because of some difficulty about uncle arthur not having been actually found in a stocking and his being too big anyway to be hidden in one so we fell back on jims suggestion that he was the man in the moon come down for a holiday  you she said had your third birthday in 1883  yes  that was the year then that your uncle arthur came home from his wanderings about the world during which he had never given any news of himself or his doings to any member of his family  by jove lou what a splendid examining magistrate youd make was lukes unsophisticated comment on louisas last remark  but she frowned a little at this show of levity and continued quietly  and your uncle according to this socalled philip de mountford was married in 1881 in martinique his son was born in 1882 and he left martinique in 1883 never to return  hang it all lou exclaimed the young man almost roughly that is all surmise  i know it is dear i was only thinking  thinking what  that it all tallies so very exactly and that thisthis philip de mountford seems in any case to know a great deal about your uncle arthur and his movements in the past  theres no doubt of that and  luke paused a moment and a curious blush spread over his face the englishmans inborn dislike to talk of certain subjects to his women folk had got hold of him and he did not know how to proceed  as usual in such cases the womanunmoved and businesslikeput an end to his access of shyness  the matter isor may betoo serious dear for you to keep any of your thoughts back from me at this juncture  what i meant was he said abruptly that this philip might quite well be uncle arthurs son you know but it doesnt follow that he has any right to call himself philip de mountford or to think that he is uncle rads presumptive heir  that will of course depend on his proofshis papers and so on she assented calmly has any one seen them  at the timeit was sometime last novemberthat he first wrote to uncle rad he had all his papers by him he wrote from st vincent have i told you that  no  well it was from st vincent that he wrote he had left martinique i understand in 1902 when st pierre if you remember was totally destroyed by volcanic eruption it seems that when uncle arthur left the french colony for good he lodged quite a comfortable sum in the local bank at st pierre in the name of mrs de mountford of course he had no intention of ever going back there and anyhow he never did for he died about three years later the lady went on living her own life quite happily apparently she did not hanker much after her faithless husband i suppose that she never imagined for a moment that he meant to stick to her and she certainly never bothered her head as to what his connections or friends over in england might be amongst her own kith and kin the halfcaste population of a french settlement she was considered very well off almost rich after a very few years of grasswidowhood she married again without much scruple or compunction which proves that she never thought that her english husband would come back to her and then came the catastrophe  what catastrophe  the destruction of st pierre you remember the awful accounts of it the whole town was destroyed every building in the placethe local bank the church the presbytery the postofficewas burned to the ground everything was devastated for miles around and thousands perished of course  i remember  mrs de mountford and her son philip were amongst the very few who escaped their cottage was burned to the ground but she with all a frenchwomans sense of respect for papers and marks of identification fought her way back into the house even when it was tottering above her head in order to rescue those things which she valued more than her life the proofs that she was a respectable married woman and that philip was her lawfully begotten son her second husbandi think from reading between the lines that he was a native or at best a halfcastewas one of the many who perished but mrs de mountford and philip managed to reach the coast unhurt and to put out to sea in an open boat they were picked up by a fishing smack from marie galante and landed there it is a small islandfrench settlement of courseoff guadeloupe they had little or no money and how they lived i dont know but they stayed in marie galante for some time then the mother died and philip made his way somehow or other to roseau in dominica and thence to st vincent  when was that  last year i suppose  and she said meditating on all that she had heard it was in st vincent that he first realized who he wasor might be  well in a british colony it was bound to happen whether somebody put him up to it out there or whether he merely sucked the information in from nowhere in particular i cant say certain it is that he did soon discover that the name he bore was one of the best known in england and that his father must as a matter of fact have been own brother to the earl of radclyffe so he wrote to uncle rad  louisa was silent she was absorbed in thought and for the moment luke had come to the end of what he had to sayor rather of what he meant to say just now that there was more to come louisa well knew commonplace women have a way of intuitively getting at the bottom of the thoughts of people for whom they care louisa guessed that beneath lukes levity and his schoolboyish slangwhich grew more apparent as the man drew to the end of his narrativethat beneath his outward flippancy there lay a deep substratum of puzzlement and anxiety  the story as told by luke sounded crude enough almost melodramatic right out of the commonplace range of louisas usual everyday life whilst she sat listening to this exotic tale of secret and incongruous marriage and of those earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which had seemed so remote when she had read about them nine years ago in the newspapers she almost thought that she must be dreaming that she would wake up presently in her bed at the langham hotel where she was staying with aunt and that she would then dress and have her breakfast and go out to meet luke and tell him all about the idiotic dream she had had about an unknown heir to the earldom of radclyffe who was a negroor almost soand was born in a country where there were volcanoes and earthquakes  how far removed from her at this moment did aunt seem and father and the twins surely they could not be of the same world as this exotic pretender to uncle radclyffes affection and to lukes hitherto undisputed rights and as father and aunt and mabel and chris were very much alive and very real then this socalled philip de mountford must be a creature of dreams  or else an imposter  she had said this aloud thus breaking in on her own thoughts and his a feeling of restlessness seized her now she was cold too for the april breeze was biting and had searched out the back of her neck underneath the sable stole and caused her to shiver in the spring sunshine  let us walk she said a littleshall we     chapter iv  nothing really tangible   they walked up the gravelled walk under the chestnut trees whereon the leaf buds luscious looking with their young green surface delicately tinged with pink looked over ready to burst into fanshaped fulness of glory the wellkept paths the orderly flower beds and smoothly trimmed lawns looked all so simple so obvious beside the strange problem which fate had propounded to these two young people walking up and down side by sideand with just a certain distance between them as if that problem was keeping them apart  and that intangible reality stood between them causing in luke a vague sense of shamefacedness as if he were guilty toward louisa and in her a feeling of irritation against the whole world around her for having allowed this monstrous thing to happenthis vague shadow on lifes pathway on the life of the only man who mattered  people passed them as they walked the curious the indifferent men with bowler hats pulled over frowning brows boys with caps carelessly thrust at the back of their heads girls with numbed fingers thrust in worn gloves tiptilted noses blue with cold thin illfitting clothes scarce shielding attenuated shoulders against the keen spring blast  just the humdrum everyday crowd of london the fighters the workers toiling against heavy odds of feeble health insufficient food scanty clothing the poor that no one bothers about less interesting than the unemployed labourer less picturesque less noisy they passed and had no time to heed the elegantly clad figure wrapped in costly furs or the young man in perfectly tailored coat who was even now preparing himself for a fight with destiny beside which the daily struggle for halfpence would be but a mere skirmish  instinctively they knewthese twothe society girl and the easygoing wealthy manthat it was reality with which they would have to deal that instinct comes with the breath of fate a warning that her decrees are serious not to be lightly set aside but pondered over that her materialized breath would not be a phantom or a thing to be derided  truth or imposture which  neither the man nor the girl knew as yet but realitywhatever else it was  they walked on for awhile in silence another instinctthe conventional onehad warned them that their stay in the park had been unduly prolonged there were social duties to attend to calls to make luncheon with lord radclyffe at grosvenor square  so they both by tacit consent turned their steps back toward the town  a man passed them from behind walking quicker than they did as he passed he looked at them both intently as if desirous of arresting their attention of course he succeeded for his look was almost compelling louisa was the first to turn toward him then luke did likewise and the passerby raised his hat respectfully with a slight inclination of head and shoulders that suggested foreign upbringing  once more convention stepped in and luke mechanically returned the salute  who was that asked louisa when the passerby was out of ear shot  i dont know replied luke i thought it was some one you knew he bowed to you  no she said to you i think funny you should not know him  but silence once broken constraint fled with it she drew nearer to luke and once more her hand sought his coat sleeve with a light pressure quickly withdrawn  now luke she said abruptly reverting to the subject how do you stand in all this  i  yes what does lord radclyffe say  he laughs the whole thing to scorn and declares that the man is an impudent liar  he saw she asked the first letter the one that came from st vincent  yes mr warren and i did not think we ought to keep it from him  of course not she assented then he said that the letter was a tissue of lies  from beginning to end  he refused she insisted to believe in the marriage of your uncle arthur out there in martinique  he didnt go into details he just said that the whole letter was an impudent attempt at blackmail  and since then  he has never spoken about it  until today she asked  he hasnt spoken he replied insisting on the word even today two or three times i think letters came for him in the same handwriting mr warren did not open them of course and took them straight to uncle rad they always bore foreign postmarks some from one place some from another but uncle rad never referred to them after he had read them nor did he instruct mr warren to reply then the letters ceased and i began to forget the whole business i didnt tell you because uncle rad told me not to talk about the whole thing it was beneath contempt he said and he didnt want the tittletattle to get about  then she asked what happened  a week ago a letter came with a london postmark on it the address and letter were both typewritten and the latter covered four sheets of paper and was signed philip de mountford bar the actual story of the marriage and all that the letter was almost identical to the first one which came from st vincent mr warren had opened it for it looked like a business one and he waited for me in his office to ask my opinion about it of course we had to give it to uncle rad it had all the old phrases in it about blood being thicker than water and about longing for friendship and companionship and all that there was no hint of threats or demand for money or anything like that  of course not she said whilst lord radclyffe is alive the young man has no claim  only he rejoined that of kinship  lord radclyffe need not do anything for him  already there was a note of hostility in louisas even voice the commonplace woman was donning armour against the man who talked of usurping the loved ones privileges  i wish he insisted that i could have got the letter from uncle rad to show you it was so simple and so sensible all he asks is just to see uncle rad personally to feel that he has kindred in the world he knows he says that beyond goodwill he has no claim now as a matter of fact he has something more substantial than that for uncle arthur had a little personal property about fifteen thousand pounds which he left to us four childrenjim and frank and edie and me and which i for one wouldnt touch if i knew for certain that this philip was his son  but she argued you say that the man does not speak of money  she hated the talk about money for she had all that contempt for it which women have who have never felt the want of it it would have been so simple if the intruder had only wanted money she would not have cared a little bit if luke had none or was not going to have any it was his right which she would not hear of being questioned his right in lord radclyffes affections in his household and also his rights in the future when lord radclyffe would be gone  you are sure she insisted that he does not want money  i dont think he replied that he does just now he seems to have a little he must have had a little since he came over from st vincent and is staying at a moderately good hotel in london no he wants to see uncle rad because he thinks that if uncle rad saw him blood would cry out in response it appears that now he has lodged all his papers of identification with a london lawyera very good firm mind youand he wants uncle rads solicitor to see all the papers and to examine them that seems fair to me doesnt it to you  very fair indeed she mused  what i mean he added with great conviction is that if those papers werent all right he wouldnt be so anxious for uncle rads solicitors to have a look at them would he  no  and after awhile she reiterated more emphatically  certainly not  i must say he concluded that the whole thing simply beats me  but what does lord radclyffe say now  nothing  how do you mean nothing  just what i say he wont talk about the thing he wont discuss it he wont answer any question which i put to him my dear boy the man is a palpable impudent impostor a blackmailer and thats all i can get out of him  he wont see the man  wont hear of it  and wont he let his solicitormr dobson isnt itmeet the other lawyer  he says he wouldnt dream of wasting old dobsons time  then whats going to happen  i dont see he said what is going to happen  wont you have a talk about it all with mr dobson and see what he says  i cant very well do that strictly speaking its none of my businessas yet i couldnt consult uncle rads lawyers without uncle rads consent  another one then  he shrugged his shoulders obviously undecided what to do he had thought very little about himself or his future in all this his thoughts had dwelt mostly on lord radclyffefather mother brother sister to them all bless him and then he had thought of her he looked round him with eyes that scarcely saw for they really were turned inward to his own simple soul and to his loving heart right up against that very simplicity of soul a duty stood clear and uncompromising a duty yet to be performed the real aim and end of all that he had said so far but he did not know how best to perform such a duty  simple soulsunlike the complex psychological phenomena of modern timesare apt to be selfless to think more of the feelings of others than of analyzing their own various sensations and luke knew that what he considered his duty would not be quite so obvious to louisa and that by fulfilling it he would give her pain     chapter v  just an obvious duty   but it was she who gave him an opening  luke she said its all very well but the matter does concern you in a way far more so in fact than it does lord radclyffe nothing can make any difference to lord radclyffe but if what this young man asserts is all true then it will make a world of difference to you  i know that thats just the trouble  you were thinking of yourself  no i was thinking of you  of me  yes he said now very abruptly quite roughly and crudely not choosing his words lest they helped to betray what he felt and all that he felt if what this man says is true then i am a penniless nonentity whom you are not going to marry  you are talking nonsense luke and you know it was all she said and she said it very quietly very decisively he was talking nonsense of course for whatever happened or didnt happen there was one thing in the world that was absolutely undeniably impossible and that was that she should not marry luke  whilst she louisa harris plain uninteresting commonplace louisa harris was of this world her marriage with luke must be people in this present day matteroffact world didnt have their hearts wrenched out of them they were not made to suffer impossible and unendurable tortures then why should she louisa harris be threatened with such a cataclysm  i am not he was saying rather tonelessly talking nonsense lou i have thought all that over its over eight days since that letter came eight times twentyfour hours since i seemed in a way to see all my future through a thick black cloud and ive had time to think i saw you too through that thick black cloudi saw you just as you are exquisite beautiful like a jewel that should forever remain in a perfect setting i  he broke off abruptly and mechanically his hand went up to his forehead and eyes where was he he gave a sudden quaint laugh  what a drivelling fool you must think me lou  she looked straight at him pure of soul simple of heart with a passion of tenderness and selfabnegation as yet dormant beneath the outer crust of a conventional education and of commonplace surroundings but with the passion there nevertheless and it was expressed in the sudden strange luminosity of her eyesi would not have you think that they were tearsas they met and held his own  they didnt say anything more just then people of their type and class in england do not say much you know under such circumstances they have been drilled not to drilled and drilled from childhood upward from the time when after a fall and a cut lip or broken tooth the tears have to be held back lest the words snivel or crybaby be mentioned but quietude does not necessarily mean freedom from pain a cut lip hurts worse when it is not wetted with tears  it was only the shadow that was hovering over these two as yet nothing really tangible and the shadow was not between them she would not let it come between them if it covered him it should wrap her too the commonplace woman had no fear of its descent only as far as it affected him  nothing she said after awhile could make a difference to our marriage luke except of course if you ceased to care  or you lou he suggested meekly  do you think she retorted that i should just because you had no money  not he owned because of that but i should be such a nonentity i have no real profession and there are the others jim in the blues costs a fearful lot a year and frank in the diplomatic service must have his promised allowance i have read for the bar but beyond that what am i  your uncles right hand she retorted firmly his agent his secretary his factotum all rolled into one you manage his estates his charities his correspondence you write his speeches and control his household lord radclyffeevery one says it in londonwould not be himself at all without luke de mountford behind him  thats not what i mean lou  what do you mean  i mean that  he paused a moment then added with seeming irrelevance  we all know that uncle rad is a curious kind of man if this story turns out to be true he would still say nothing but he would fret and fret and worry himself into his grave  the story she argued obstinately will not turn out to be true its not like you luke to jump at conclusions or to be afraid of a nightmare  i am not afraid he rejoined simply but i must look at possibilities yes dear he continued more forcibly it is possible that this story is true no good saying that it is impossible improbable if you like but not impossible look at it how you like you must admit that it is not impossible uncle arthur may have married in martinique he was out there in 1881 he may have had a son his telling no one about his marriage is not to be wondered at he was always reticent and queer about his own affairs this philip may possibly be uncle rads sole and rightful heir and i may possibly be a beggar  she uttered an exclamation of incredulity luke a beggar luke the one man in all the world different from every other man luke ousted by that stranger upstart  god hath too much sense of humour to allow so ridiculous a fate to work her silly caprice  and she said with scorn because of all these absurd possibilities you talk of breaking off your engagement to me do you care so little as all that luke  he did not reply but continued to walk beside her just a yard or so apart from her turning his steps in the direction of the gates toward the albert bridge their nearest way home shemeekly now for already she was sorryturned to look at him something in his attitude the stoop of the shoulders usually so square and erect the hands curiously clasped behind his back told her that her shaftvery thoughtlessly aimedhad struck even deeper than it should  i am so sorry dear she said gently  his look forgave her even before the words were fully out of her mouth but with characteristic reticence he made no reply to her taunt strangely enough she was satisfied that he should say nothing the look which did not reproach even whilst it tried to conceal the infinite depth of the wound so lightly dealt had told her more than any words could do whatever luke decided to do it would be from a sense of moral obligation that desire for doing the right thingin the worldly sense of the termwhich is inherent in englishmen of a certain class no sentiment save that of a conventional one of honour would be allowed to sway her destiny and his  conventionalitythat same strained sense of honour and dutydecreed that under certain mundane circumstances a man and woman should not mate differences of ancestry of parentage of birth and of country divergence of taste of faith of beliefall these matter not one jot but let the man be beggared and the woman rich and convention steps in and says it shall not be  these two bowed to that decree unconventional in so far that they both made the sacrifice out of the intense purity of their sentiment to one another they made an absolutely worldly sacrifice for a wholly unworldly motive luke would as soon have thought of seeing louisa in a badly fitting serge frock and paying twopence for a twomile ride in an omnibus as he would expect to see a diamond tiara packed in a cardboard box it would be unfair on the jeweller who had made the tiara thus to subject it to rough treatment and it would be equally unfair on the creator of louisa to let her be buffeted about by the cruder atoms of this world  louisa only thought of luke and that perhaps he would feel happier in his mind if she allowed him to make this temporary sacrifice  there is such wonderful balm in selfimposed sacrifice  what she asked simply do you want me to say luke  only thatthat you wont give me up altogether unless  here he checked himself abruptly was there ever an englishman born who could talk sentiment at moments such as this luke was no exception to that rule there was so much that he wanted to say to louisa and yet the very words literally choked him before he could contrive to utter them  dont she said quietly let us even refer to such things luke i do not believe in this shadow and i cannot even understand why you should worry about it but whatever happens i should never give you up never we will put off fixing the day of our wedding since we have made no announcement this wont matter at all but i only agree to this because i think that it is what you would like i fancy that it would ease your mind as for breaking our engagement in the futurein case the worst happenswell it shall not be with my consent luke unless you really cease to care  they had reached the gate close to the bridge life pulsated all round them the life of the big city callous noisy and cruel omnibuses cabs heavy vans rattled incessantly past them people jostled one another hurrying and scurrying pigmies and ants adding their tiny load of work of care of sorrow to the titanic edifice of this living world  louisas last words remained unanswered luke had by his silence said everything there was to say they stood on the pavement for a moment and luke hailed a passing taxicab  at the corner opposite an omnibus pulled up on its way westward a man stepped off the curb ready to enter it louisa caught his eye and he raised his hatthe man who had passed them in the park just now     chapter vi  just a disagreeable old man   the luncheons at grosvenor square were always rather dull and formal but louisa did not mind that very much she was used to dull and formal affairs they were part and parcel of her daily life london society is full of it the dull and formal dominate the othersvulgar if more livelywere not worth cultivating  then she almost liked lord radclyffe because he was so fond of luke and even then almost was a big word no oneexcept lukecould really like the old man he was very bad tempered very dictatorial a perfect tyrant in his own household his opinions no one dared contradict no one cared to argue with him and his advanced tory views were so rabid that he almost made perverts from the cause of all those whom he desired to convince  and even these were few for lord radclyffe had no friends and very few acquaintances he had a strange and absolute dislike for his fellow men he did not like seeing people he hated to exchange greetings to talk or to mingle with any crowd that was purely on pleasure bent he went up to the house and made speechespolitical philanthropic economic speecheswhich luke prepared for him and which he spoke without enthusiasm or any desire to please this he did not because he liked it or took any interest in things political philanthropic or economic but only because he considered that a man in his position owed certain duties to the stateduties which it would be cowardly to shirk  but he really cared nothing for the thoughts of others for their opinions their joys or their sorrows he had schooled himself not to care to call philanthropy empty sentiment politics senseless ambition economics grasping avarice  his was a life entirely wrapped up in itself in youth he had been very shy a shyness caused at first by a serious defect of speech which though cured in later years always left an unconquerable diffidence an almost morbid fear of ridicule in its train  because of this i think he had never been a sportsmanor rather had never been an athlete for he was splendid with a gun and the finest revolver shot in england so ive been told and an acknowledged master of fence but with bat ball or racquet he was invariably clumsy  he had always hated to be laughed at and therefore had never gone through the rough mill of a tyro in athletics or in games arthur one of his brothers had been a blue at oxford the other one jamesyou remember james de mountford was the celebrated cricketer but he the eldest always seemed to remain outside that magic circle of sport the great ring of many links which unites englishmen one to another in a way that no other conformity of tastes of breeding or of religion can ever do  because of this diffidence too no doubt he had never married i was told once by an intimate friend of his that old radas he was universally calledhad never mustered up sufficient courage to propose to any woman and as he saw one by one the coveted matrimonial prizesthe pretty girls whom at different times he had admired sufficiently to desire for wifesnapped up by more enterprising wooers his dour moroseness grew into positive chronic illhumour  he liked no one and no one liked him and during sixty years of life he had succeeded in eliminating from his entire being every feeling of sentiment save one he had to all appearances an absolutely callous heart he cared neither for dog nor horsehe ordered a splendid mare to be shot without the slightest compunction after she had carried him in the hunting field and in the park faithfully and beautifully for over eight years just because she had shied at a motorcar and nearly thrown him he was not cruel you know just callous in all respects save one void of all sentimenthe called it sentimentalitysave in his affection for luke  luke had beenever since he was a growing ladthe buffer in the establishment between the irascible master and the many subordinates from mr warrenthe highly paid and greatly snubbed secretarydown to the maids below stairs one and all brought troubles complaints worries to mr luke no one dared approach his lordship a word out of season brought instant dismissal and no one thought of leaving a place where besides excellent wages there was the pleasure of waiting on mr luke never mr de mountford you notice always mr luke he had grown up amongst the household winston the old coachman had taught him to ride mary now housekeeper then a nurse had bathed him in a washhand basin when he was less than eighteen inches long  therefore the atmosphere of the gloomy old house pleased louisa harris with the perfect and unconscious selfishness of a woman in love she gauged everything in life just as it affected luke she even contrived to like lord radclyffe he trod on every one of her moral and spiritual corns it is true he had that lofty contempt for the entire feminine sex which pertains to the oriental more than to the more civilized western races he combated her opinions both religious and political without any pretence at deference he smoked very strong cigars in every room in the house without the slightest regard for the feelings of his lady visitors he did or left undone a great many other things which would tend to irritate and even to offend a woman accustomed to the conventional courtesies of daily social life but when luke entered a room where but a moment ago lord radclyffe had been venting his chronic illhumour on an offending or innocent subordinate the old mans dour face would become transfigured irradiated with a look of pride and of joy at sight of the man on whom he had lavished all the affection of which his strong nature was capable  luke could do no wrong luke was always right he could argue with his lordship contradict him obtain anything he liked from him eternal contradictions of human nature the childless man in perfect adoration before a brothers son the callous hardhearted misanthrope soft as wax in the hands of one man     chapter vii  the part played by a fivepound note   and it was into this atmosphere of gloom and of purposeless misanthropy that louisa harris brought this morning the cheering sunshine of her own indomitable optimism  she knew of course from the first that the subject which interested every one in the house more than any other subject could ever do was not to be mentioned in lord radclyffes presence but she was quite shrewd enough to see that dear old lukeunsophisticated and none too acute an observerhad overestimated his uncles indifference to the allabsorbing matter  the old mans faceusually a mirror of contemptuous cynicismlooked to the womans keener insight distinctly troubled and his surly silence was even more profound than hitherto  he hardly did more than bid louisa a curt how de do when she entered and then relapsed into moroseness wholly unbroken before luncheon was announced  jimin the blueswas there when she arrived and edie came in a few moments later breathless and with hat awry and tawny hair flying in all directions straight from a tussle with the dogs and the sharp wind in the park  evidently no secret had been made before these two of the strange events which had culminated this very morning in their brothers avowal to louisa and the postponement sine die of the wedding but equally evidently these young creatures absorbed in their own life their own pursuits and amusements were not inclined to look on the matter seriously  their sky had been so absolutely cloudless throughout their lives that it was impossible for them at the moment to realize that the dark shadow on the distant horizon might possibly conceal thunder in its filmy bosom  ediejust over twenty years of age and already satiated with the excitement of three london seasons her mind saturated with novel reading and on the lookout for some new sensationswas inclined to look on the affair as an exhilarating interlude between the shrove tuesday dance at wessex house and the first drawingroom in may jimin the bluesvery eligible as a possible husband for the daughters of ambitious mammas a trifle spoiled a little slow of wit and not a little selfsatisfieddismissed the whole incident as tommyrot  when louisa first greeted them edie had whispered excitedly  has he told you  and without waiting for a direct reply had continued with unabated eagerness  awful exciting dont you think  but jim with the elegant drawl peculiar to his kind had suppressed further confidences by an authoritative  awful rot i call it dont you luke is soft to worry about it  strangely enough at luncheon it was lord radclyffe who brought up the subject matter edie with the tactlessness of youth had asked a pointblank question  well she said when is that wedding to be and what are we bridesmaids going to wear i warn you i wont have whitei hate a white wedding  then as no answer came she said impatiently  i wish youd name the day you two stupids awfully soft i call it hanging about like this  luke would have said something then but louisa interposed  it is all my fault edie she said you know i want to take the twins out myself this season i must give them a real good time before i marry  bosh remarked edith unceremoniously mabel and chris will have a far better time when you are married and can present them yourself tell them from me that its no fun being out and the longer they put it off the better theyll enjoy themselves later on besides colonel harris will take them about  father hates sitting up late hazarded louisa somewhat lamely  the truth of the matter is here broke in lord radclyffe dryly that luke had persuaded you to put off the wedding because of this dd impostor who seems to have set you all off by the ears  edie laughed and said bosh jim growled and murmured rot  luke and louisa were silent the while lord radclyffes closelyset dark piercing eyes wandered from one young face to the other louisa feeling uncomfortable beneath that none too amiable scrutiny did not know what to say but luke quietly remarked after awhile  youre right uncle it is my doing but lou agrees with me and we are going to wait until this cloud is properly cleared up  if any one else had spoken so clearly and decisively in direct contradiction to the old mans obvious wishes in the matter the result would have been an outburst of illhumour and probably a volley of invectives not unmixed with more forcible language but since it was luke who had spokenand luke could do no wronglord radclyffe responded quite gently  my dear boy he said and it was really touching to hear the hard voice soften and linger on the endearing words i have told you once and for all that the story of this socalled philip de mountford is a fabrication from beginning to end there is absolutely no reason for you to fret one single instant because of the lies a blackmailer chooses to trump up as for your putting off your wedding one single hour because of this folly why it is positive nonsense i should have thought you had more commonsenseand miss harris too for a matter of that  luke was silent for a moment or two while edie tossed her irresponsible young head with the gesture of an absolute i told you so jim muttered something behind his heavy cavalry moustache louisa with head bent and fingers somewhat restless and fidgety waited to hear what luke would say  if only he said you would consent uncle rad to let mr dobson go through this mans papers  what were the good of wasting mr dobsons time retorted lord radclyffe with surprising good humour i know that the man is an impostor i dont think it he reiterated emphatically i know it  how  before the old man had time to reply the butlersober solemn parkercame in with a card on a salver which he presented to his master lord radclyffe took up the card and grunted as he glanced at it he always grunted when he was threatened with visitors  why he said gruffly and he threw the card back onto the salver havent you told mr warren  mr warren said solemn parker is out my lord  then ask mr dobson to call another time  its not mr dobson hisself my lord but a young gentleman from his office  then tell the young gentleman from the office that i havent time to bother about him  shall i see him sir asked luke ready to go  certainly not retorted the irascible old man stay where you are you have got miss harris to entertain  the young gentleman resumed parker with respectful insistence said he wouldnt keep your lordship five minutes he said hed brought some papers for your lordships signature  the tower farm lease uncle rad remarked luke  i think mr luke assented the butler that the young gentleman did mention the word lease  why has that confounded warren taken himself off just when i want him was lord radclyffes gruff comment as he rose from the table  let me go sir insisted luke  no hang it boy you cant sign my namenot yet anyway i am not yet a helpless imbecile show the young man into the library parker i cant think why dobson is always in such a confounded hurry about leasessending a fool of a clerk up at most inconvenient hours  still muttering half audibly he walked to the library door which parker held open for him and even this he did not do without surreptitiously taking hold of lukes hand and giving it a friendly squeeze for a moment it seemed as if luke would follow him despite contrary orders he paused undecided standing in the middle of the room louisas kind gray eyes following his slightest movement  jim stolidly pulled the cigar box toward him and edie with chin resting in both hands looked sulky and generally out of sorts  parkersilent and correct of mienhad closed the library door behind his master and now with noiseless tread he crossed the diningroom and opened the other doorthe one that gave on the hall louisa instinctively turned her eyes from luke and sawstanding in the middle of the halla young man in jacket suit and overcoat who had looked up with palpitating eagerness expressed in his face the moment he caught sight of parker  it was the same man who had lifted his hat to luke and to herself in battersea park this very morning luke saw him too and apparently also recognized him  thats why he bowed to us lukein the parkyou remember she said as soon as the door had once more closed on parker and the visitor  funny that you didnt know him she continued since luke had made no comment  i didnt he remarked curtly  didnt what  i did not and do not know this man  not mr dobsons clerk  luke did not answer but went out into the hall parker was standing beside the library door which he had just closed having introduced the visitor into his lordships presence  parker said luke abruptly what made you tell his lordship that that young gentleman came from mr dobson  the question had come so suddenly that parkerpompous dignified parkerwas thrown off his balance and the reply which took some time in coming sounded unconvincing  the young gentleman he said slowly told me mr luke that he came from mr dobson  no parker asserted luke unhesitatingly he did nothing of the sort he wanted to see his lordship and got you to help him concoct some lie whereby he could get what he wanted  a grayish hue spread over parkers pink and flabby countenance  lord help me mr luke he murmured tonelessly how did you know  i didnt replied luke curtly i guessed now i know  i didnt think i was doing no harm  no harm by introducing into his lordships presence strangers who might be malefactors  already luke at parkers first admission had gone quickly to the library door here he paused with his hand on the latch uncertain if he should enter the house was an old one wellbuilt and stout from within came the even sound of a voice speaking quite quietly but no isolated word could be distinguished parker was floundering in a quagmire of confused explanations  malefactor mr luke he argued that young man was no malefactor he spoke ever so nicely and he had plenty of money about him i didnt see i was doing no harm he wanted to see his lordship and asked me to help him to it  and queried luke impatiently paid you to help him eh  i thought replied the man loftily ignoring the suggestion that taking in one of mr dobsons cards that was lying in the tray could do no harm i thought it couldnt do no harm the young gentleman said his lordship would be very grateful to me when he found out what id done  and how grateful was the young gentleman to you parker  to the tune of a fivepound note mr luke  then as you have plenty of money in hand you can pack up your things and get out of this house before ive time to tell his lordship  mr luke  dont argue do as i tell you  i must take my notice from his lordship said parker vainly trying to recover his dignity  very well you can wait until his lordship has been told  mr luke  best not wait to see his lordship parker take my word for it  very well mr luke  there was a tone of finality in lukes voice which apparently parker did not dare to combat the man looked confused and troubled what had seemed to him merely a venial sinthe taking of a bribe for a trivial servicenow suddenly assumed giant proportionsa crime almost punished by a stern dismissal from mr luke  he went without venturing on further protest and luke left standing alone in the hall once more put his hand on the knob of the library door this time he tried to turn it but the door had been locked from the inside     chapter viii  and thus the shadow descended   from within the hum of a mans voicespeaking low and insistentlystill came softly through luke with the prodigality of youth would have given ten years of his life for the gift of secondsight to know what went on between those four walls beyond the door where he himself stood expectant undecided and more than vaguely anxious  luke  it was quite natural that louisa should stand here beside him having come to him softly noiselessly like the embodiment of moral strength and a commonsense which was almost a virtue  uncle rad he said quietly has locked himself in with this man  who is it luke  the man who calls himself philip de mountford  how do you know  how does one he retorted know such things  and parker let him in  he gave parker a fivepound note parker is only a grasping fool he concocted the story of mr dobson and the lease he is always listening at keyholes and he knows that mr dobson often sends up a clerk with papers for uncle rads signature those things are not very difficult to manage if one man is determined and the other corruptible its done sooner or later  is lord radclyffe safe with that man do you think  god grant it he replied fervently  jim and edie made a noisy irruption into the hall and luke and louisa talked ostentatiously of indifferent thingsthe weather lent and the newest play until the young people had gathered up coats and hats and banged the street door to behind them taking their breeziness their optimism away with them out into the spring air and leaving the shadows of the oncoming tragedy to foregather in every angle of the luxurious house in grosvenor square  and there were luke de mountford and louisa harris left standing alone in the hall just two very ordinary very simplesouled young people face to face for the first time in their uneventful lives with the dark problem of a grim might be a locked door between them and the decisions of fate a world of possibilities in the silence which now reigned beyond that closed door  they wererememberwholly unprepared for it untrained for any such eventuality wellbred and wellbrought up yet were they totally uneducated in the great lessons of life it was as if a man absolutely untutored in science were suddenly to be confronted with a mathematical problem the solution or nonsolution of which would mean life or death to him the problem lay in the silence beyond the locked doorsilence broken now and again by the persistently gentle hum of the mans voicethe strangersbut never by a word from lord radclyffe  uncle rad said luke at last in deep puzzlement has never raised his voice once i thought that there would be a rowthat he would turn the man out of the house dear old chap he hasnt much patience as a rule  what shall we do luke she asked  how do you mean  you cant go on standing like that in the hall as if you were eavesdropping the servants will be coming through presently  you are right lou he said as usual ill go into the diningroom i could hear there if anything suspicious was happening in the library  you are not afraid luke  for uncle rad you mean  of course  i hardly know whether i am or not no he added decisively after a moments hesitation i am not afraid of violencethe fellow whom we saw in the park did not look that sort  he led louisa back into the diningroom where a couple of footmen were clearing away the luncheon things the melancholy parker placed cigar box and matches on a side table and then retiredsilent and with a wealth of reproach expressed in his round beady eyes  soon luke and louisa were alone he smoked and she sat in a deep armchair close to him saying nothing for both knew what went on in the others mind  close on an hour went by and then the tinkle of a distant bell broke the silence voices were heard somewhat louder of tone in the library and lord radclyffes sounded quite distinct and firm  ill see you again tomorrow he said at mr tell me the name and address again please  the door leading from library to hall was opened a footman helped the stranger on with coat and hat then the street door banged to again and once more the house lapsed into silence and gloom  i think i had better go now  louisa rose and luke said in matteroffact tones  ill put you into a cab  no she said i prefer to walk i am going straight back to the langham will you go to the ducies at home tonight  yes he said just to see you  youll know more by then  i shall know all there is to know  luke she said you are not afraid  it was the second time she had put the question to him but this time its purport was a very different one he understood it nevertheless for he replied simply  only for you  why for me  because lou you are just all the world to meand a man must feel a little afraid when he thinks he may lose the world  not me luke she said you would not lose mewhatever happened  let me get you a cab  he was english you see and could not manage to say anything just then the floodgates of sentiment might burst asunder now with the slightest word uttered that was not strictly commonplace louisa understood else she had not loved him as she did it never occurred to her to think that he was indifferent nay more his sudden transition from sentiment to the calling of a cabfrom sentiment to the trivialities of life pleased her in its very essence of incongruity  i said i would walk she reminded him smiling  then she gave him her hand it was still gloveless and he took it in his turning the palm upward so that he might bury his lips in its delicately perfumed depths his kiss almost scalded her flesh his lips were burning hot passion held in check will consume with inward fire whilst its expression often cools like the nereids embrace  he went to the door with her and watched her slender trim figure walking rapidly away until it disappeared round the corner of the square  when he turned back into the hall he found himself face to face with lord radclyffe not uncle radbut an altogether different man an old man now with the cynical lines round the mouth accentuated and deepened into furrows the eyes hollow and colourless the shoulders bent as if under an unbearable load  uncle rad said luke speaking very gently forcing his voice to betray nothing of anxiety or surprise can i do anything for you  but even at sight of his nephew of the man who had hitherto always succeeded in dissipating by his very presence every cloud on the misanthropes brow even at sight of him lord radclyffe seemed to shrink within himself his face became almost ashen in its pallor and lines of cruel hardness quite disfigured his mouth  i want to be alone today he said dryly tell them to send me up some tea in the afternoon ill go to my room nowi shant want any dinner  but sir wont you  i want to be alone today the old man reiterated tonelessly and to be left alone  very well sir  lord radclyffe walked slowly toward the staircase lukehis heart torn with anxiety and sorrowsaw how heavy was the old mans step how listless his movements the younger mans instinct drew him instantly to the side of the elder he placed an affectionate hand on his uncles shoulder  uncle rad he said appealingly cant i do anything for you  lord radclyffe turned and for a moment his eyes softened as they rested on the face he loved so well his wrinkled hand sought the firm young one which lingered on his shoulder but he did not take it only put it gently aside then said quietly  no my boy theres nothing you can do except to leave me alone  then he went up stairs and shut himself up in his own room and luke saw him no more that day     chapter ix  which tells of the inevitable result   and now a month and more had gone by and the whole aspect of the world and of life was changed for luke not for louisa because she womanlike had her life in love and love alone love was unchanged or if changed at all it was ennobled revivified purified by the halo of sorrow and of abnegation which glorified it with its radiance  for luke the world had indeed changed with the advent of philip de mountford that spring afternoon into the old house in grosvenor square life for the other nephewfor luke once the dearly lovedbecame altogether different  that one moment of softness when lord radclyffea bent and broken old manwent from the library up the stairs to his own room determined to be alone and gently removed lukes affectionate hand from his own bowed shoulders that one moment of softness was the last that passed between unclealmost fatherand nephew after that coldness and cynicism the same as the old man had meted out to every one around himsave lukefor years past now there was no exception coldness and cynicism to all and to the intruder the new comer to philip de mountford an unvarying courtesy and constant deference that at times verged on impassive submission  and the change i must own did not come gradually have i not said that only a month had gone by and arthurs son from the land of volcanoes and earthquakes had already conquered all that he had come to seek he who had been labelled an impostor and a blackmailer tookafter that one interviewhis place in the old mans mind if not in his heart heaven only knowsfor no one else was present at that first interviewwhat arguments he held what appeals he made he came like a thief bribing his way into his uncles presence and stayed like a dearly loved son a master in the house  and luke was shut out once and for all from lord radclyffes mind and heart can you conceive that such selfless affection as the older man bore to the younger can live for a quarter of a century and die in one hour yet so it seemed luke was shut out from that innermost recess in uncle rads heart which he had occupied undisputed from childhood upward now he only took his place amongst the others with jim and edie and frank children of the younger brother of no consequence in the house of the reigning peer  luke with characteristic pridecharacteristic indolence mayhap where his own interests were at stakewould not fight for his rightful positionhis by right of ages twenty years of affection of fidelity and comradeship  the day following the first momentous interview lord radclyffe spent in lawyers companymr davies in finsbury court then mr dobson in bedford row the latter argued and counselled though papers might be to all appearances correct and quite in order there was no hurry to come to a decision but lord radclyffewith that same dictatorial obstinacy with which he had originally branded the claimant as an impostor and a blackmailernow clung to his reversed opinion convincedbeyond doubt apparentlythat philip de mountford was his brother arthurs son he insisted on acknowledging him openly as his heir and on showering on him all those luxuries and privileges which luke had enjoyed for so many years  indignant and mentally sore jim and edie protested with all the violence of youth violence which proved as useless as it was illconsidered luke said nothing for he foresaw that the end was inevitable he set about making a home for his younger brothers and sister to be ready for them as soon as the cataclysm came when philip de mountford usurping every right would turn his cousins out of the old home  frank absent at santiagoa young attaché out at his first posthad been told very little as yet luke had tried to break the news to him in a guarded letter which received but the following brief and optimistic answer  why old man whats the matter with you worrying over such rubbish take my advice and go to carlsbad your liver must be out of order  but the catastrophe came nevertheless sooner even than was expected edies language grew very unguarded in philips presence and jimin the bluesdid not watch over his own manners when the new cousin was in the house  one evening when luke was absentas was very often the case nowand the family gathering consisted of lord radclyffesullen and morose philip pleasantly condescending and jim and edie snubbed and wrathful a difference in political opinion between the young people set a spark to the smouldering ashes  philipstill pleasantly condescendingdid not say much that evening though he had been called a cad and an upstart and told to go back to his nigger relations but the next morning jim and edie received a curt admonition from lord radclyffe during which they were told that if such a disgraceful exhibition of impertinence occurred again they would have to go and pitch their tent elsewhere  they brought their grievance to luke told him all that they had treasured up in their rebellious young hearts against the usurper and much that they had hitherto kept from the elder brother who already god knows had a sufficient load of disappointment to bear  what could luke do but promise that jim and edie should in future have a house of their own wherein neither usurper nor upstarts would have access and where they could nurse their wrath in peace and unsnubbed  for the first time since many many days luke was alone with his uncle in the library philip was out and lord radclyffe was taken unawares  what luke would never have dreamed of doing for himself he did for his brothers and sister he made appeal to his uncles sense of right of justice and of mercy  uncle rad he said you have told us all so often that this should be a home for us all it doesnt matter about me but the othersjim and ediethey havent offended you have they  lord radclyffe was fretful and irritable when luke first came in it had almost seemed as if he would order him to go such an old man he lookedsour and morosehis clothes hung more loosely than before on an obviously attenuated frame he seemed careworn and worried and lukes heart which could not tear itself away from the memories of past kindness ached to see the change  would you he asked insistently would you rather we went away uncle rad  the old man shifted about uneasily in his chair he would not meet lukes eyes any more than he would take his hand just now  jim and edie he said curtly are very illmannered and philip feels  he passed his tongue over his lips which were parched and dry a lookit was a mere flashalmost of appeal passed from his eyes to luke  then said luke simply it is thisthis philip whom jim and edie have offended not you uncle rad  philip is your uncle arthurs son rejoined lord radclyffe speaking like a fretful child in a thin voice that cracked now and again he will be the head of the family presently  not interposed luke earnestly before many years are past i trust and pray for all our sakes uncle rad  the sooner continued the old man not heeding the interruption those young jackanapes learn to respect him the better it will be for them  jim and edie have been a little spoiled by your kindness sir they are finding the lesson a little hard to learn perhaps they had better go and study elsewhere  lord radclyffe made no reply silence was full of potent meaning of submission to anothers more dominant personality of indifference to everything save to peace and quiet  suppressing a sigh of bitter disappointment luke rose to go  then he said the sooner i make all arrangements the better theres only the agreement for the flat to sign and we can move in next week  wheres the flat queried the old man hesitatingly  in exhibition road kensington close to the park edie loves the park and it wont be far from barracks for jim  but youve no furniture how will you furnish a flat dont go yet continued lord radclyffe seeing that luke was preparing to take his leave philip wont be here till tea time  i am afraid sir that i dont care to steal a few minutes of your company just when philip is absent i would rather not see you at all than see you on sufferance  you are very obstinate and tiresomeand you make it so difficult for me i want to hear about the furnitureand how you are going to manage  lou is helping edie to get what is wanted replied luke smiling despite the heavy weight of disappointment in his heart it was pitiable to see the old mans obvious feeling of relief in the absence of the man who was exercising such boundless influence over him  but have you money luke he asked  not overmuch sir but enough  the fifteen thousand pounds your father left you  yes and thats about all  and the fifteen thousand pounds from your uncle arthur  i dont know about that sir i think that should go back to uncle arthurs son  nonsense nonsense retorted lord radclyffe querulously ive talked to dobson about that your uncle arthur left that money to youand not to his son he had his own reasons for doing this dobson thinks so too  it is very kind of mr dobson to trouble about my affairs but  the money was left to you persisted the old man and to jim and edie and frank  they will do whatever they like with their share but i could not touch a penny of uncle arthurs money  what will you do  i dont know yet uncle i have only had a month in which to think of so muchand there was the new flat to see to  lord radclyffe rose and shuffled toward luke he dropped his voice lest the library walls had ears  ill not forget you lukepresentlywhen i am goneand that wont be longill provide for youmy will  dont uncle rad for gods sake and the cry was wrung from a heart overburdened with pity and with shame  and without waiting to take more affectionate leave luke hurried from the room     chapter x  life must go on just the same   they met at dances and at musical at homes for the world wagged just as it had always done and heredont you thinklies the tragedy of the commonplace luke and louisa with the whole aspect of life changed for them with a problem to face of which hitherto they had no conception and the solution of which meant a probing of soul and heart and mindluke and louisa had to see the world pass them by the same as heretofore with laughter and with tears with the weariness of pleasure and the burdens of disappointment  the world stared at themcurious and almost interestedsearching wounds that had only just begun to ache since indifferent hands had dared to touch them and convention said thou shalt not seem to suffer thou shalt pass by serene and unmoved thou shalt dance and sing and parade in park or ball room thou art my puppet and i have nought to do with thy soul  so luke and louisa did as convention bade them and people stared at them and asked them inane questions that were meant to be delicate but were supremely tactless people too wondered what they meant to do when the engagement would be duly broken off or what colonel harrisslouisas fatherattitude would be in all this somehow after the first excitement consequent on lord radclyffes open acknowledgment of the claimant things had tamed off somewhat luke de mountford looked just the same as before although awhile ago he had been heir to one of the finest peerages in england and now was a penniless son of a younger son i dont know whether people thought that he ought to look entirely different now or whether he should henceforth wear shabby dress clothes and gloves that betrayed the dry cleaner certain it is that when luke entered a reception room a dozen lips were readyhad they dared or goodbreeding allowedto frame the question  well and what are you going to do now  or  do tell us how it feels to find ones self a beggar all of a sudden  enterprising hostesses made great attempts to gather all parties in their drawing rooms with strategy worthy of a better cause they manœuvred to invite philip de mountford and lord radclyffe and luke and louisaall to the same dinner partypromising themselves and their other guests a subtle enjoyment at sight of these puppets dancing to rousing tunes beside which the most moving problem play would seem but tame entertainment  but philip de mountfordthough as much sought after now as luke had been in the pastdeclined to be made a show of for the delectation of bored society women he declined all invitations on his own and lord radclyffes behalf  so people had to be content to watch luke and louisa  they were together at the ducies at home there was a crush a hungarian band from germany a russian singer from bayswater a great many diamonds and incessant gossip  luke de mountford is hereand miss harris have you seen them  oh yes we met on the stairs and had a long chat  how do they seem  oh quite happy  they dont care  do they mean to break off the engagement  i have heard nothing have you  louisa harris has a nice fortune of her own  and lord radclyffe will provide for luke  i dont think so he practically turned him out of the house you know  not really  i know it for a positive fact my sister has just got a new butler who left lord radclyffes service the very day philip de mountford first walked into the house  old parker i remember him  he says lord radclyffe turned all the family out bag and baggage they were so insolent to philip  then its quite true  that this philip is the late arthur de mountfords son  quite true i believe lord radclyffe openly acknowledges it he is satisfied apparently  so are the lawyers i understand  oh how do you do miss harris so glad to see you looking so well  this very pointedly as louisa perfectly gowned smiling serenely ascended the broad staircase  i have not been ill lady keogh  oh no of course not and how is mr de mountford  you can ask him yourself  and louisa passed on to make way for luke and the same remarks and the same question were repeated ad infinitum until a popular waltz played by the hungarian gentlemen from germany drew the fashionable crowd round the musicians platform  then luke and louisa contrived to make good their escape and to reach the halflanding above the heads of numerous young couples that adorned the stairs the hum of voices the noise of shrill laughter and swish of skirts and fans masked their own whisperings the couples on the stairs were absorbed in their own little affairs they were sitting out here so that they might pursue their own flirtations  luke and louisa could talk undisturbed  they spoke of the flat in exhibition road and of the furniture that louisa had helped edie to select  there are only a few odds and ends to get now louisa was saying coal scuttles and wastepaper baskets that sort of thing i hope you dont think that we have been extravagant edie i am afraid had rather luxurious notions  poor edie  oh i dont think she minds very much life at grosvenor square in the past month has not been over cheerful  then as luke made no comment she continued in her own straightforward matteroffact waythe commonplace woman facing the ordinary duties of life  now that the flat is all in order you can all move in whenever you likeand then luke you must begin to think of yourself  of you lou he said simply  oh theres nothing she said to think about me  there you are wrong lou and you must not talk like that our engagement must be officially broken off colonel harris has been too patient as it is  father she rejoined does not wish the engagement broken off  all these people he said nodding in the direction of the crowd below will expect some sort of announcement  let them  lou you must take back your word  how does one take back ones word luke have you ever done it i shouldnt know how to  she looked at him straight her eyes brilliant in the glare of the electric lamps not a tear in them or in his her face immovable lest indifferent eyes happened to be turned up to where these two interesting people sat only a quiver round the lips a sign that passion palpitated deep down within her heart below the bond street gown and the diamond collar the soul within the puppet  she held his glance forcing him into mute acknowledgment that his philosophy his worldliness was only veneer and that he had not really envisaged the hard possibility of actually losing her  oh these men of this awful conventional world how cruel they can be in that proud desire to do what is rightwhat their code tells them is rightno law of god or nature thatonly convention the dictates of other men hard on themselves selfless in abnegation but not understanding that the dearest gift they can bestow on a woman is the right for her to efface herself the right for her to be the giver of love of consolation of sacrifice  commonplace plain sensible louisa understood everything that luke felt those great luminous eyes of hers tearless yet brilliant read every line on that face drilled into impassiveness  no one else could have guessed the precise moment at which softness crept into the hard determination of jaw and lips no ear but hers could ever have perceived the subtle change in the quivering breath from hard obstinacy that drew the nostrils together and set every line of the face to that indrawing of the heavy air around caused by passionate longing which hammered at the superexcited brain and made the sinews crack in the mighty physical effort at selfrepression  but to all outward appearance perfect calm correct demeanour the attitude and tone of voice prescribed by the usages of this socalled society  lou he said it is not fair to tempt me i should be a miserable cur if i held you to your word i am a penniless beggara wastrel now without a profession without prospects soon to be without friends  he seemed to take pleasure in recalling his defects and she let him ramble on women who are neither psychological puzzles nor interesting personalities have a way of listening patiently whilst a tortured soul eases its burden by contemplating its own martyrdom  i am a penniless beggar he reiterated i have no right to ask any woman to share my future dull and humdrum existence a few thousands is all i have i think that edie will marry soon and then i can go abroadi must go abroadi must do something  well do it together luke  i feel he continued rebellious now and wrathful all the primary instincts alive in him of selfpreservation and the desire to destroy an enemy i feel that if i stayed in england i should contrive to be even with that blackguard his rights by god i would never question those the moment i knew that he was uncle arthurs son i should have been ready to shake him by the hand to respect him to stand aside as was his due but his attitudethe influence he exercises over uncle radhis rancour against us all jim and edie what had they done to be all turned out of the house like a pack of poor relationsand poor uncle rad  he checked himself for she had put a hand on his coat sleeve  luke it is no use she said  you are right lou and i am a miserable wretch if you only knew how i hate that man  dont she said let us think of him  how can i help it he robs me of you  no she rejoined not that  her hand still rested on his arm and he took it between both his the couples in front of them all down the length of stairs paid no heed to them and through the hum of voices from a distant room beyond came softly wafted on the hot still air the strains of the exquisite barcarolle from the contes d hoffmann  louisa smiled confidently proudly he held her hand and she felt that hishot and dryquivered in every muscle at her touch the commonplace woman had opened the magic book of love she had turned its first pages the opening chapters had been simple unruffled uncrumpled by the hand of men or of fate but now at last she read the chapter which all along she knew was bound to reach her ken the leaves of the book were crumpled fate with cruel hand had tried to blur the writing the psychological problem of todaythe one that goes by the name of modern womanwould no doubt ponder ere she tried to read further she would analyze her feelings her thoughts her sensations she would revel over her own heartache and delight in her own soul agony but simpleminded conventional louisa did none of these things she neither ruffled her hair nor dressed in illmade serge clothes her dress was perfect and her hand exquisitely gloved she did nothing out of the way she only loved one man altogether beyond herself and she understood his passionate love for her and all that troubled him in this world in which they both lived  i love that barcarolle dont you she said after awhile  i did not hear it he replied  luke  its no use lou he said under his breath you must despise me for being a drivelling fool but i have neither eyes nor ears now i would give all i have in the world to lie down there on the floor now before you and to kiss the soles of your feet  how could i despise you luke for that  put your hand on my knee just for a moment lou i think i shall go mad if i dont feel your touch  she did as he asked her and he was silent until the last note of the barcarolle died away in a softly murmured breath  what a cowardly wretch i am he said under cover of the wave of enthusiastic applause which effectually covered the sound of his voice to all ears save hers i think i would sell my soul for a touch of your hand and all the while i know that with every word i am playing the part of a coward if colonel harris heard me he would give me a sound thrashing a dog whip is what i deserve  i have told you she rejoined simply that father does not wish our engagement to be broken off he sticks to your cause and will do so through thick and thin he still believes that this philip is an impostor and thinks that lord radclyffe has taken leave of his senses  she spoke quite quietly matteroffactly now pulling by her serene calm lukes soul back from the realms of turbulent sensations to the prosy facts of today and hein answer to her mute dictate and with a movement wholly instinctive and mechanicaldrew himself upright and passed his hand over his ruffled hair and the jeopardized immaculateness of shirt front and cuffs  philip de mountford he said simply is no impostor lou he has been perfectly straightforward and mr dobson for one who has seen all his papers thinks that there is no doubt whatever that he is uncle arthurs son his clerkmr downingwent out to martinique you know and his first letters came a day or two ago all inquiries give the same result and downing says that it is quite easy to trace the mans life step by step from his birth in st pierre past the dark days of the earthquake and the lonely life at mariegalante mrs de mountford was a halfcaste native as we all suspected but the marriage was unquestionably legal downing has spoken to people in martinique and also in mariegalante who knew her and her son or at any rate of them i cannot tell you everything clearly but there are a great many links in a long chain of evidence and so far mr dobson and his clerk have not come across a broken one that the mrs de mountford who died at mariegalante was uncle arthurs wife and that philip is his son i am afraid no one can question he has quite a number of letters in his possession which uncle arthur wrote after he had practically abandoned wife and child i think it was the letters that convinced uncle rad  lord radclyffe she remarked dryly has taken everything far too much for granted  he is convinced louand thats all about it  he is she retorted more hotly than was her wont acting in a cruel and heartless manner even if this philip is your uncle arthurs son even if he is heir to the peerage and the future head of the family there was no reason for installing him in your home luke and turning you and the others out of it  i suppose rejoined luke philosophically the house was never really our home what uncle rad gave freely he has taken away again from us i dont suppose that we have the right to complain  but what will become of you all  we must scrape along frank must have his promised allowance or hell never get along in the service and five hundred pounds a year is a big slice out of a thousand jim too spends a great deal uncle rad never stinted him with money for it was he who wanted jim to be in the blues now he may have to exchange into a less expensive regiment i think edie will marry soonreggie duggan has been in love with her for the past two yearsshe may make up her mind now  but you luke  he did not know if he ought to tell her of his plans the ostrich farm out in africathe partnership offered to him by a cousin of his mothers who was doing remarkably well but who was getting old and wanted the companionship of one of his kind it was a living anywaybut a giving up of everything that had constituted life in the pastand the giving up of his exquisite lou how could he ask her to share that life with himthe primitive conditions the total absence of luxuries the rough everyday existence  and lou so perfectly dressed so absolutely modern and dainty waited on hand and foot  but she insisted seeing that he was hesitating and was trying to keep something from her  what about you luke  he had not time to reply for from the hall below a shrill voice called to them both by name  mr de mountford miss harris the young people want to dance youll join in wont you  already he was on his feet every trace of emotion swept away from his face together with every crease from his immaculate dress clothes and every stray wisp of hair from his wellgroomed head not a man torn with passion fighting the battle of life against overwhelming odds casting away from him the hand which he would have given his last drop of blood to possessonly the man of the world smiling while his very soul was being wrungonly the puppet dancing to the conventional worlds tune  dancing he said lightly ratherlady ducies may i have this first waltz nooh i say thats too bad the first lancers then good lou may i have this dance  and the world went on just the same     chapter xi  and there are social duties to perform   the first november fog  the world had wagged on its matteroffact way for more than six months now since that day in april when philip de mountfordunder cover of lies told by parkerhad made his way into lord radclyffes presence more than five months since the favoured nephew had been so unceremoniously thrust out of his home  spring had yielded to summer summer given way to autumn and already winter was treading hard on autumns heels the autumn session had filled london with noise and bustle with political dinner parties and monster receptions with new plays at all the best theatres and volumes of ephemeral literature  and all that wastonightwrapped in a dense fog the first of the season quite a stranger too in london for scientists had asserted positively that the era of the traditional peasouper was over the metropolis would know it no more  colonel harris was in town with his sister lady ryder and louisa and swearing at london weather in true country fashion he declared that fogs paralyzed his intellect that he became positively imbecile not knowing how to fight his way in the folds of such a black pall taxicab drivers he mistrusted in fact he had all an old sportsmans hatred of mechanically propelled vehicles whilst he flatly refused to bring valuable horses up to town to catch their death of cold whilst waiting about in the fog  so luke had promised to pilot the party as far as the danish legation where they were to dine tonight this was the only condition under which colonel harris would consent to enter one of those confounded motors  colonel harris had remained loyal to the core to luke and to his fortunes it is a way old sportsmen have and he had never interfered by word or innuendo in louisas actions with regard to her engagement his daughter was old enough he said to know her own mind she liked luke and it would be shabby to leave him in the lurch now that the last of the society rats were scurrying to leave the sinking ship they were doing it too in a mighty hurry the invitations which the penniless younger son received toward the end of the london season were considerably fewer than those which were showered on him at its beginning before the world had realized that philip de mountford had come to stay and would one day be earl of radclyffe with a rent roll of eighty thousand pounds a year and the sore need of a wife  it had all begun with the bridge parties luke would no longer play since he could no longer afford to lose a quarters income at one sitting uncle rad used to shrug indifferent shoulders at such losses and place blank checks at the dear boys disposal imagine then how welcome luke was at bridge parties and how very undesirable now  then he could no longer make return for hospitable entertainments he had no home to which to ask smart friends lord radclyffe though a monster of illhumour gave splendid dinner parties at which luke was quasi host now it was all give and no take and the givers retired one by one quite unregretted by luke who thus was spared the initiative of turning his back on his friends they did the turning quite politely but very effectually luke scarcely noticed how he was dropping out of his former circle he was overabsorbed and really did not care moreover his dress clothes were getting shabby  tonight at the langham when he arrived at about seven oclock so as to have an undisturbed half hour with lou colonel harris greeted him with outstretched hand and a cordial welcome  hello luke my boy how goes it with you  louisa said nothing but her eyes welcomed him and she drew him near her on to the sofa in front of the fire and allowed her hand to rest in his for she knew how he loved the touch of it people were beginning to say that louisa harris was getting old she never had been goodlooking poor thing but always smart very smartnow she was losing her smartness and what remained  she had come up to town this autumn in last autumns frocks and the twins were after all being chaperoned by their aunt would that absurd engagement never be broken off fancy louisa harris married to a poor man why she did not know how to do her hair and dresses were still worn fastened at the back and would be for years to come louisa harris and no french maid cheap corsets and cleaned gloves it was unthinkable  perhaps the engagement was virtually broken offanyhow the wedding could never take place  unless philip de mountford happened to die  but it did not look as if the engagement was broken off not at any rate on this raw november evening when there was a dense fog outside but a bright cheery fire and plenty of light in the little sitting room at the langham and luke sat on the sofa beside louisa and plain louisain last autumns gownlooking at him with her candid luminous eyes  how is lord radclyffe asked colonel harris  badly replied luke i am afraid he looks very feeble and his asthma i know must bother him he was always worse in foggy weather  he ought to go to algeciras he always used to  i know assented luke dejectedly  cant something be done surely luke you havent lost all your influence with him  every bit sir why i hardly ever see him  hardly ever see him ejaculated colonel harris and i am afraid that he swore  i havent been to grosvenor square for over six weeks i am only allowed to see him when philip is out or by special permission from philip i wont go under such conditions  how that house must have altered  you wouldnt know it sir all the old servants have gone one after the other they had rows with philip and left at a months notice i suppose he has no idea how to set about getting new onesi know i shouldnt theres only a man and his wife a sort of charwoman who cleans and cooks and the man is supposed to look after uncle rad but he doesnt do it for he is half seas over most of the time  good god murmured colonel harris  they have shut up all the rooms except the library where uncle rad and philip have their meals when they are at home but they lunch and dine at their club mostly  what club do they go to i called in at the atheneum last night thinking to find radclyffe there but the hall porter told me that he never went there now  no he and philip have joined some new club in shaftesbury avenuethe veterans i think it is called  some low mixedup kind of place old radclyffe must be out of his senses  he likes it so he tells me because people dont come and bother him there  i should think not indeed i wouldnt set foot in such a place  he goes there most evenings and so does philipand its so bad for uncle rad to be out late these foggy nights  you ought to make an effort and stop it luke  i have made many efforts sir but as a matter of fact i had made up my mind to make a final one tonight uncle rad ought to go abroad and i thought i would try to impress this on philip he cant be a bad man  oh cant he was colonel harriss muttered comment  at any rate if i have no influence he has and he must exert it and get uncle rad down to algeciras or anywhere he likes so long as it is well south  luke paused awhile his face flushed with this expression of determination which must have caused his pride many a bitter pang then he resumed more quietly  its rather humiliating isnt it to go to that man as a suppliant  dont go as a suppliant my boy you must insist on your uncle being properly looked after  colonel harris thought all that sort of thing so easy one always does before one has had a genuine tussle with the unpleasant realities of life to the good country squire with an assured position an assured income assured influence it seemed very easy indeed to insist he himself never had to insist things occurred round him and at his word as it were of themselves  but louisa knowing how matters stood made no suggestion she knew that luke would do his best but that that best was of little avail now as philip de mountford arranged so it would all come about  friends and wellwishers could but pray that the intruder was not a bad man and that he had his uncles health at heart  she gave the signal to go saying simply  we mustnt be late for dinner father must we  and she rose to go held back by the hand by lukes fervent insistence  he could not accustom himself to part from her as he often had to do it seemed absurd but undeniable he was supremely happy in her company and snatched as much of it as ever he could but the wrench was always awful and louisasubtly comprehensivewas conscious of the terrible pain which she gave him at every parting she felt the repercussion of it in all her nerves although her sound commonsense condemned the sensation as unreal  tonight the feeling was even stronger than it had ever been before at her first suggestion that it was time to go an elusive current passed from him to her he had been holding her hand and his had been cool and only slightly on the quiver from time to time when her own fingers pressed more markedly against his but now all at once it seemed as if a sudden current of lava had penetrated his veins his hand almost scorched her own and though visibly it did not move yet she felt the pulses throbbing and trembling beneath the flesh the look of misery in his face made her own heart ache though she tried to smile with easy gaiety  tomorrow we go to the temple show together dont forget luke  her words seemed to recall him from another world and he quickly enough pulled himself together and helped her on with her cloak colonel harris with the gentle tactfulness peculiar to kind hearts had loudly announced that he would be waiting in the hall  anything the matter luke she asked as soon as her father had gone from the room  he contrived to smile and to look unconcerned  not particularly he replied  you seem different tonight somehow  how different  i cant explain but you are not yourself  myself more than ever my adoration for you is more uncontrolledthat is all  she wrapped herself up in her furs for it was silence that gave the best response and then he said quite calmly  will you go first ill switch off the light  father will be waiting down stairs she rejoined  then she went past him and out through the door and he had to go back to the mantelpiece where one of the electric light switches was he turned off the light the room remained in darkness save where the dying embers of the fire threw a red glow on the sofa where she had sat with him and the footstool on which her evening shoe had rested  and the conventional man of the world schooled from childhood onward to discipline and selfcontrol fell on both knees against that mute footstool and leaning forward he pressed his burning lips against the silk cushions of the sofa which still bore the impress and the fragrance of her exquisite shoulders  then he too went out of the room     chapter xii  shall a man escape his fate   on the way to the danish legation colonel harris asked luke what his plans were for the evening  i shall replied luke call at grosvenor square i may find uncle rad or philip or both at home i mean to have a good tussle about this wintering abroad its really most important  i call it criminal retorted colonel harris keeping a man in london who has been used to go south in the winter for the past twenty years at least  uncle rad is still fairly well now though i do think he looks more feeble than usual he ought to go at once  but suggested louisa he oughtnt to go alone  no he certainly ought not  would mr de mountford go with him  i dont think so  this new man of his then  that said luke hotly would be madness the man is really a drunkard  but somebody ought to go  edie would be only too willingif she is allowed  edie exclaimed louisa  and she added with a smile  what will reggie duggan have to say to that  nothing he replied quietly reggie duggan has cried off  you dont mean that  he has given up edie who has little or nothing a year and become engaged to marian montagu who has eight thousand pounds a year of her own  poor edie murmured louisa whilst colonel harriss exclamation was equally to the point and far more forcible and more particularly concerned the honourable reginald duggan  yes rejoined luke it has hit her hard coming on the top of other things theres no gainsaying the fact is there colonel harris that we four brothers and sister owe something to uncle arthurs son  the handle of a riding whip came from out the depths of colonel harriss fur coat stupid way parsons have of saying that to wish a man dead is tantamount to murder i am committing murder now for a matter of that for i wish that blackguard were buried in one of his native earthquakes  would to god added luke that wishing alone would do it  there was so much wrath such hatred and contempt in those words that louisa instinctively whispered  hush luke dont talk like that  and colonel harris somewhat ostentatiously cleared his throat and said  dont let us think of that confounded philip  luke took leave of colonel harris and of louisa at the door of the danish legation he waited on the carpeted curb beneath the awning until he saw her white evening cloak disappear in the doorway  the fog had become very dense just here where a number of carriage lamps threw light around one could distinguish faces and forms immediately close to one but as luke turned away from the brilliant lights he realized how thick was the pall which enveloped london tonight he looked at his watch it was close upon eight the next few minutes brought him to the door of lord radclyffes house  he rang but obtained no answer he rang again and again and finally came to the conclusion that his uncle and cousin were as usual dining out and that the elderly couple who did perfunctory service in the house were either asleep or out of earshot or had taken the opportunity of seeking amusement in a neighbouring public house  but luke was worried about lord radclyffe moreover he had made up his mind that he would speak to him and to philip tonight with regard to the imperative wintering abroad for the old man  the veterans club was unknown to luke but shaftesbury avenue was not he turned into oxford street and as taxicabs were now a forbidden luxury he hailed a passing omnibus and jumped into it and thus was rapidly conveyed into the very heart of the fog which had found its haven around piccadilly circus     chapter xiii  they have no heart   as to what occurred in the heart of the fog on that night in november four years ago most of you no doubt will remember those who do not i must refer to the morning papers of the following day  a perfect harvest for journalists gossip and detail sufficient to fill column upon column of newspaper gossip that grew as the hours sped on and the second day of fog pursued its monotonous course  a man had been found murdered in a taxicab his throat stabbed through from ear to ear the jugular pierced life absolutely extinct the murderer vanished  drama in the midst of reality  such things are you know no amount of socalled realistic literature no amount of sneers at what is dubbed melodrama will prevent this fact occurringand occurring very frequently in the streets of a mighty city  just a man murdered and the murderer disappeared a very real thing that and london has had to face such facts often enough more often than has an audience at drury lane or the adelphi the superiorminded critic who spells british drama with a capital b and d and pronounces it pritish trama sat in the stalls of a london theatre on this very same foggy evening in november four years ago the play was one that did not appeal to the superiorminded critic it was just a simple tale of jealousy which led to the breaking of that great commandment thou shalt do no murder  and the superiorminded critic yawned behind a well gloved hand and dubbed the play melodramatic unreal and stagey quite foreign to the life of today but just at that hourbetween nine and ten oclocka man was murdered in a taxicab and his murderer vanished in the fog  london doesnt dub such events melodrama she does not sneer at them or call them unreal she knows that they are real there is nothing stagey or artificial about them they have even become commonplace  they occur so often and most often whilst society dines or dances and the elect applaud with languid grace the newest play by mr bernard shaw  only in this case the event gained additional interest the murdered man was a personality some one whom everybody that was anybody had talked about gossiped and discussed for the past six months some one whom few had seen but many had heard aboutphilip de mountfordthe son of the late arthur de mountfordradclyffes newly found heir you know  the news spread as only such news can spread and when society poured out from theatres from houses in grosvenor square or from the diningroom of the carlton every one had heard the news  it was as if the sprite of gossip had been busy whispering in overwilling ears  philip de mountford has been murdered  he was found in a taxicab his throat was cut from ear to ear  no no not cut i understand pierced through with a sharp instrumenta stiletto i presume  how horrible  poor lord radclyffesuch a tragedy  hell never live through it  he has looked very feeble lately  the scandal round the late arthurs name broke him up i think  it seems arthur de mountford had married a negress  no no philip did not look like a halfcaste i saw him once or twice he was dark but nice looking  still there was some scandal about the marriage  nothing to what this scandal will be  what scandal  seek whom the crime benefits you know  then you thinkyou really think luke de mountford did it  i thought so the moment i heard the story  ive always thought that luke de mountford a queer sort of fellow  and he took his cousins advent very badly  well one cant wonder at that exactlyto lose a future peerage all of a suddenand he has no private fortune either  poor beggar  i heard there were awful rows between the cousins until lord radclyffe himself turned luke and the others out of the house  and now philip de mountford has been murdered  and the police will seek him whom the crime benefits  it certainly looks very suspicious  a real cause célèbre wont it be exciting  something to read about in ones morning papers  i shall try and get reserved seats for the trial i hate a crush dont you  will they hang him do you think  if he is found guiltyenglish justice is no respecter of persons  how awful  and tittletattle senseless talk inane remarks were wafted on the grimy wings of the fog they penetrated everywhere in the lobbies of the theatres the boudoir of madame and the smoking room of my lord they penetrated to the magnificent reception rooms of the danish legation and louisa heard the remarks even before she knew the full details of the story louisa had a welltrained contralto voice and had been asked to sing in the course of the evening just as she stood in an outer room selecting her music she heard a group of idlersmen and womentalking over the mysterious murder in the taxicab  they had at first been unconscious of her presence she had her back toward them turning over the leaves of of her song suddenly there was a hush in the conversation one of the chatterboxes must have pointed her out to the others  whereupon louisa serene and smiling a roll of music in her hand joined the merry group  please she said dont stop i have heard nothing yet and of course i want to know  one of the men laughed inanely and the ladies murmured silly nothings  oh said some one it maynt be true such lots of wild rumours get about  what asked louisa placidly maynt be true some one said just now that philip de mountford has been murdered  well murmured one of the ladies they say it was mr de mountford but they cant be sure can they  the group was dissolving almost it seemed as if it had vanished into thin air when louisa first heard them talking there were about a dozen men and women a brilliant throng of gaily plumaged birds now the ladies remembered that they wanted to hear the latest infant prodigy who had been engaged to entertain the guests at the postdinner reception tonight and the men too feeling uncomfortable and awkward made good their escape  peoplethe pleasureloving people of todayhave no use for latent tragedy excitement yes and drama but only from the secure distance of a private seat at an old bailey trial the murder of philip de mountford could be discussed with quite an amount of enjoyment between a dinner party and a ball supper but not in louisa harriss presence by gad too much of a good thing you know  within a very few minutes louisa found herself almost alone just the one or two near her to whom she had directly spoken andfortunatelycolonel harris in the doorway come to look for his daughter  the infant with the violin he said as soon as he caught sight of louisa is just finishing his piece poor little rat you promised you would sing next lou what songs have you got  i was just making a selection when you came father what would you like me to sing  with an unexpressed sigh of relief the last two of the original group of gossips dwindled away into the reception room beyond congratulating themselves on having successfully engineered their exit  dooced awkward dont you know miss harris asking questions  i suppose she doesnt realize  she will soon enough  she ought to have broken off her engagement long ago  isnt it awfulpoor thing  louisa left alone with her father could allow her nerves to ease their fearful tension she had no need to hide from him the painful quiver of her lips or the anxious frown across her brow  do you know she asked anything about this awful business father  theres a lot of gossip he replied his voice was not only gruff but hoarse which showed that he was strangely moved  but she insisted some truth in the gossip  they say philip de mountford has been murdered  who says so  some people have come on from the theatres and men from the clubs the streets are full of itand evening papers have brought out midnight editions which are selling like hot cakes  and do they say that luke has killed philip de mountford  nowith some hesitationthey dont say that  but they hint at it  newspaper tittletattle  how much is actual fact  i understand he explained that at nine oclock or thereabouts two men in evening dress hailed a passing taxicab just outside the lyric theatre in shaftesbury avenue and told the chauffeur to drive to hyde park corner just by the railings of the green park the driver drew up there and one of the two men got out as he reclosed the door of the cab he leaned toward the interior and said cheerfully slong old man see you tomorrow then he told the chauffeur to drive on to 1 cromwell road opposite the museum and turning on his heel disappeared in the fog when the chauffeur drew up for the second time no one alighted from the cab so he got down from his box and opened the door  the other man murmured louisa vaguely was in the cabdead  thats about it  with his throat pierced from ear to ear by a sharp instrument which might have been a skewer  you have heard it all then  no no she said hurriedly  the room was swaying round her the furniture started hopping and dancing louisa who had never fainted in her life felt as if the floor was giving way under her feet memory was unloading one of her storehouses looking over the contents of a hidden cell wherein she had put away a strange winter scene in brussels a taxicab the illlighted boulevard the chauffeur getting down from his box and finding a man crouched in the farther corner of the cabdeadwith his throat pierced from ear to ear by an instrument which might have been a skewer and memory was raking out that cell clearing it in every corner trying to find the recollection of a certain morning in battersea park a year ago when louisa recounted her impressions of that weird scene and told the tale of this crime which she had almost witnessed memory found a distinct impression that she had told the tale at full length and with all the details which she knew she remembered talking it all over and that when she did so the ground in battersea park was crisp with the frost under her feet and an inquisitive robin perched himself on the railings and then flew away accompanying her and another all the way along as far as the gates  two pictures vivid and distinct that evening in brussels and the morning in battersea park her first meeting with luke after his letter to herthe letter which had come to her in the palace hotel and which had made her the happiest woman in all the world memorysatisfiedhad at last emptied the storehouse of that one cell and left louisa harris standing here staring at her father her ears buzzing with the idle and irresponsible chatter of society jackdaws her mind seeing all that had happened outside 1 cromwell road the cab stopping the chauffeur terrified the crowd collecting the police taking notes her mind saw it as if her bodily eyes had been there and all that her father told her seemed but the recapitulation of what she knew already  where she said after awhile is the dead man now  i dont know he replied i should imagine they would keep the body at the police station until the morning i dont suppose theyd be such mugs as to disturb lord radclyffe at this time of night the shock might kill the old man  i suppose they are quite sure that it is philip de mountford who was killed  why yes he had his pocketbook his cards his letters on him and money toorobbery was not the object of the crime  it was philip de mountford then  good god yes of whom were you thinking  i was thinking of luke she replied simply  the old man said nothing more had he spoken at all then it would have been to tell her that he too was thinking of luke and that there was perhaps not a single person in the magnificent house at that moment who was notin some way or anotherthinking of luke  the hostess came in elegant and worldly with banal words to request the pleasure of hearing miss harris sing  it is so kind of you she said to offer i have never heard you you know and people say you have such a splendid voice but perhaps you would rather not sing tonight  she spoke english perfectly but with a slight scandinavian intonation which seemed to soften the banality of her words being foreign she thought less of concealing her sympathy and was much less fearful of venturing on delicate ground  she held out a small exquisitely gloved hand and laid it almost affectionately on the younger womans arm  i am sure you would rather not sing tonight she said kindly  indeed countess why should you think that retorted louisa lightly i shall be delighted to sing i wonder which of these new songs you would like best there is an exquisite one by guy dhardelot shall i sing that  and her excellency who so charmingly represented denmark in english society followed her guest into the reception room she admired the elegant carriage of the english girl the slender figure the soft abundant hair  and her excellency sighed and murmured to herself  they are stiff these english and oh they have no feeling no sentiment  and a few moments later when louisa harriss really fine voice firm and clear echoed in the wide reception room her excellency reiterated her impressions  these english have no heart she sings and her lover is suspected of murder bah they have no heart     chapter xiv  the tale had to be told   and whilst the morning papers were unfolded by millions of english men and women and the details of the mysterious crime discussed over eggs and bacon and buttered toast philip de mountford the newly found heir presumptive to the earldom of radclyffe was lying in the gloomy mortuary chamber of a london police court whither he had been conveyed in the same cab whose four narrow walls jealously guarded the secret of the tragedy which had been enacted within their precincts  lord radclyffe had been aroused at ten oclock the previous night by representatives of the police who came to break the news to him it was not late and the old man was not yet in bed he had opened the front door of his house himself his servantshe explained curtlywere spending their evening more agreeably elsewhere  the houseeven to the police officersappeared lonely and gloomy in the extreme and the figure of the old man who should have been surrounded by every luxury that rank and wealth can give looked singularly pathetic as he stood in his own doorway evidently unprotected and uncared for and suspiciously demanding what his late visitors business might be  very reluctantly on hearing the latters status he consented to admit them he did not at first appear to suspect that anything wrong might have happened or that anything untoward could occasion this nocturnal visit in fact he seemed unconscious of the lateness of the hour  he walked straight into the library where he had obviously been sitting for an armchair was drawn to the fire a reading lamp was lighted on the table and papers and magazines lay scattered about  the police officer in plain clothes who stood with his subordinate somewhat undecided hardly knew how to begin it was a hard task to break such awful news to this lonely old man  at last it was done the word accident and your nephew were blurted out by the man in command but hardly were these out of his lips than lord radclyffelivid and tremblinghad jumped to his feet  luke he contrived to exclaim and his voice was almost choked his lips and hands trembled beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead something has happened to luke  no no my lord thats not the namephilip was on the card and on the lettersphilip de mountfordthat was i think the poor gentlemans name  and an accident has happened to mr philip de mountford  the voice was quite different now no longer choked with anxiety calm and as if mildly interested in passing events it was obvious even to the strangers present that one nephew was of far greater moment than the other  i am afraid my lord that its worse than an accident  the officer paused a moment satisfied that he was doing all that was necessary and possible to mitigate the suddenness of the blow  its foul play he said at last thats what it was  foul play what do you mean by that  mr philip de mountford has been murdered my lordhis body now lies at the police stationwould you wish him conveyed home at once my lordor wait until after the inquest  there was silence in the room for a moment or two while the oldfashioned clock ticked stolidly on at the awful announcement which indeed might have felled a younger and more vigorous man lord radclyffe had not moved he was still standing his hand resting on the table beside the piled up newspapers the light of the lamp veiled by a red shade illumined the transparent delicacy of the highbred hand the smooth black surface of the coat and the glimmering whiteness of the shirt front with its single pearl stud the face itself was in shadow and thus the police officer saw little or nothing of that inward struggle for selfmastery which was being put so severely to the test  lord radclyffe face to face with the awful event strove by every power at his command to remain dignified and impassive the lessons taught by generations of ancestors had to bear fruit now when a representative of the ancient name stood confronting the greatest crisis that one of his kind has ever had to facethe brutal vulgar fact of a common murder the realities of a sordid life brought within the four walls of a solemn aristocratic old house  for a moment before he spoke again the old man looked round about him the tall mahogany bookcases filled with silent friends the busts of dryden and of milton the globes in their mahogany casings all heirlooms from the generations of de mountfords who had gone before  it seemed as if the present bearer of the historic name called all these mute things to witness this present degradation a crime had smirched the family escutcheon for to some mindsthose who dwell on empyrean heights to which the matteroffact sordidness of everyday life never reachesto those minds the victim is almost as horrible as the assassin  lord radclyffe however fought his own battle silently not with one tremor or one gasp would he let the two men see what he felt conventionality wielded her iron rod in this shabby old library just as she had done in the ball room of the danish legation and whilst not two hundred yards away louisa harris sang guy dhardelots songs and smilingly received praise and thanks for her perfect performance so here the old man never flinched  he gave to his nerves the word of command and as soon as he had forced them to obey he looked straight at the police officer and said quite calmly  please tell me all that i ought to know  he sat in his highbacked chair curtly bidding the two men to sit down he made no attempt to shade his face and eyes once the battle fought and won he had nothing more to hide his own face rigid and still his firm mouth and smooth brow were mask enough to conceal the feelings within  the officer gave the details at full length he told lord radclyffe all that was known of the mysterious crime the old man listened in silence until the man had finished speaking then he asked a few questions  you have a clue of course  i think so my lord replied the officer guardedly  can i help in any way  any information my lord that you think might help us would of course be gladly welcomed  the man who hailed the cab in shaftesbury avenuewhat was he like i could help you if i knew  ill have his description properly written out my lord and bring it you in the morning  cant you tell me now every moment lost is irretrievable in cases like these  i am afraid my lord that i cannot tell you definitely now theres a dense fog outsideand  the chauffeurs descriptions are vague interposed lord radclyffe with a sneer the eternal excuses for incompetence  my lord protested the man  all right all right no offence meant i assure you you must pardon an old mans irritabilitythe news you have brought me does not make for evenness of temper i rely on your department to clear this matter up with the least possible scandal  i am afraid that scandal is inevitable retorted the officer dryly for he still felt sore at lord radclyffes illtempered thrust we shall have to rake up a great deal of what might be unpleasant to many parties  why should it be unpleasant  we shall have to know something of the murdered mans past of his associates beforebefore he was able to establish his claim to your lordships consideration  i have no doubt that the late philip de mountford had many undesirable associates in the past remarked lord radclyffe curtly  the silence which followed was tantamount to a dismissal the officer rose to go he felt nettled at the old mans obvious sneers they had been like a cold douche over his enthusiasm for the case had already drifted into his hands and it promised to be the most interesting and most sensational criminal case of modern times  you have not he said before taking his leave told me my lord what you wish done about the body  surely replied lord radclyffe querulously it is too late now to make any arrangements what is the time  half past ten my lord  surely tomorrow morning we can discuss all that  just as you wish of course  tomorrow morningas early as you like my servants will be at home thenthe house will be readyand i can make arrangementsor else well wait as you say until after the inquest  the sound of a bell broke the silence that ensued  you must excuse me said his lordship dryly my servants are out and theres some one at the front door  i can hear footsteps below stairs my lord remarked the officer  ah i believe youre right those two blackguards must have come home and i didnt know it they do pretty much as they like  shuffling uncertain footsteps were heard across the hall the officer said hurriedly  one more thing my lordyou will pardon me asking butyou had not thought oferoffering a reward  what for  the apprehension of the murderer or useful information that would lead to conviction  oh ah yes a reward by all means of course ill give a reward to stimulate incompetence eh  what will your lordship make it asked the officer determined this time to show no resentment  two hundredfive hundredhave what you likeso long as you get that brute  five hundred my lord would stimulate us all  very well said lord radclyffe briefly good evening  good evening my lord and tomorrow morning well be ready for the body to be taken away if you wish it but the inquest will be the day after so perhaps it might be best to wait until then at the coroners court victoria my lordsouth kensington you knoweverything will be all right good evening my lord  the two men took their leave glad enough to have done with the unpleasant interview  as they walked to the door that gave from the library on the hall it was opened from the outside and a seedylooking man dressed in shabby evening clothes that bore many traces of past libations walked unceremoniously midway into the room  will you see mr luke de mountford he muttered addressing his master  certainly not replied his lordship its much too late ask mr luke to call again tomorrow and you and your wife can go to bed     chapter xv  and many must be questioned   by the time the police officers reached the outer hall door luke had received his order of dismissal he stood on the step for a moment undecided what to do and saw the two men coming out of his uncles study  they raised their hats as they met him on the door step and one of them said politely  mr luke de mountford  that is my name replied luke  mine is traversattached to scotland yard could i ask you a few questions  certainly but not in my uncles house i think  of course not where do you suggest  here on the door step if you like  hardly might i trouble you to step into a cab with me and to come as far as victoria police court  its very late isnt it i have an engagement at eleven close by here  he was going to fetch colonel harris and louisa at the danish legation and pilot them home to the langham  its an important matter mr de mountford retorted the man are you lodging anywhere near here  in exhibition road kensington  ah close to cromwell road  not far  then where shall it be mr de mountford  why not in the cab remarked luke  just as you like  the taxicab which had brought the police officers was standing some few paces farther on its strong lights only just piercing the intensity of the fog and its throbbings as the taximeter marked off twopences with unerring rapidity filled the night with their strangely familiar sound  the three men got into the cab the officer telling the chauffeur to remain stationary until told to move on  i know very little about the business mrertravers remarked luke as soon as all three of them had stowed themselves fairly comfortably in the interior of the vehicle i suppose it is about this ghastly affair that you wanted to speak to me  yes sir it was about that i thought you could give us some information about the late mr de mountfords past life or his former friends  i know nothing retorted luke dryly of my cousins past or present life he did not confide in me  but you were good friends interposed the other quickly  we knew each other very little  and tonight  i saw him at his club  where was that  the veterans in shaftesbury avenue  about what time  between eight and nine  you had some talk with him  yes  pleasant talk asked the officer indifferently  family affairs rejoined luke dryly  and you parted from him  somewhere about nine  in the club  in the club  the door steps  no the lobby  he was alone then i meanbesides yourself was no one with him  no one the hall porter stood there of course  no one joined him afterward  that i cannot say when i parted from him he was alone  you know that mr philip de mountford was murdered in a taxicab between shaftesbury avenue and hyde park corner soon after nine oclock  i have heard most of the details of that extraordinary crime  and you can throw no light on it at all  none how could i  nothing insisted the police officer occurs to you at this moment that might help us in any way to trace the murderer  nothing whatever  the man was silent it seemed as if he was meditating how best to put one or more questions up to now these had been curt and to the point and as they followed one another in quick succession there was a marked difference in the attitude both of the questioner and the questioned the police officer had started by being perfectly deferentialjust like a man accustomed to speak with people whose position in the world compelled a certain regard he had originally addressed luke as sir just as he had invariably said my lord to lord radclyffe but now he spoke much more curtly there was a note of demand in every question which he put a peremptoriness of manner which did not escape the observation of his interlocutor  as the one man became more aggressive so did luke also change his manner there had been affable courtesy in his first reply to the questions put to him a desire to be of help if help was needed but with his senses attuned by anxiety and nerve strain to distinguish subtle difference of manner and of intention he was quick enough to notice that he himself was as it were in a witness box with a counsel ready enough to bully or to trip up any contradictory statement  not that luke realized the reason of this change the thought that he could be suspected of a crime was as far removed from his ken as the desire to visit the moon he could not understand the officers attitude it puzzled him and put him on his guardbut it was just the instinct of selfpreservation of caution which comes to men who have had to fight the world and who have met enemies where they least expected to find one  do you remember now resumed travers after that slight pause which had seemed very long to luke but as a matter of fact had only lasted a short minute whether you saw mr philip de mountford speaking with any one when you left him in the lobby of the club  i told you said luke impatiently that he was alone except for the hall porter  alone in the whole club house  alone reiterated luke with measured emphasis in the lobby of the veterans club  how many rooms has the club  i dont know it was the first time i had ever been there  did you know any of the staff  nosince i had never been there before  you were not known to any member of the staff  not that i know of  you were shown into the club rooms without being known there at all  the veterans club is a new one and its rules apparently are not very strict i asked if mr de mountford was in the club and was told that i should find him in the smoking room and i did  how long did your interview with mr de mountford last  about three quarters of an hour i should say  and it was of a perfectly amicable nature  of a perfectly indifferent nature corrected luke  and after the interview what did you do  i walked out of the club  but after that  i walked about  in the fog this in an undisguised tone of surprise  in the fog  in what direction  really here rejoined luke with a sudden show of resentment mrertravers i fail to see how my movements can be of concern to you  he was certainly not going to tell this man that he had made his way through the fog as far as the residence of the danish minister and that he had walked up and down for over an hour outside that house like a lovesick fool like a doting idiot because he knew that if he waited patiently he would presently hear the faint echo of a welltrained contralto voice whose mellowness would come to him through the closed windows of the brilliantly illumined mansion and would ease for a moment the wild longing of his heart  what the man near him said in answer to his retort he really could not say he had not heard for in a moment his thoughts had flashed back to that lonely vigil in the fog to the sound of her voice which came oh so faintly to his ear and then to the first breath of gossip that came from the passersby the coachmen and chauffeurs who had drawn up in long rows along the curb the idlers who always hang about outside in the cold and the damp when a society function is in progress the pickersup of unconsidered trifles lost or willingly bestowed  from these he had first heard the news vaguely at first for he did notcould notrealize that the amazing thing which was being commented on and discussed had anything to do with him the talk was of murder and soon the name of de mountford was mentioned the details he got were very confused and the open allusions as to seek whom the crime will benefit never really reached his brain which was almost numb with the violence of the shock  his first thought after that was to go and see uncle rad he had for the moment almost forgotten louisa every other interest in life sank to nothingness beside the one clear duty uncle rad would be alone the awful news must be broken very gradually to uncle rad he had hurried to grosvenor square only to find that emissaries of the police had forestalled him in his duty  all this he could not explain to the man travers it would have sounded lame and barely plausible nowadays men do not walk outside houses wherein their liege lady dwells and if they do they do not choose a foggy night for the sentimental dalliance he was thankful therefore that travers put no further questions to him and merely said with a return to his original politeness  i am greatly obliged to you sir i dont think i need detain you any longer you said you had an engagement later on wont you keep this cab  luke thanked him but refused the offer of the cab  it is close by he said  may i call on you tomorrow morning sir  if it is necessary  i am afraid so you see we dont like to trouble lord radclyffe and we must try and obtain knowledge of certain facts and verify others  quite so well tomorrow then  thank you sir your address is  fairfax mansions exhibition road  such a nice neighbourhood no fog there tonight i think  i hope not good night  good night sir  luke made his escape from the cab he was afraid of missing louisa and her father his thoughts were somewhat in a whirl andbeing overburdened with matters of paramount importancewere inclined to dwell on trifles  i ought he reflected to have taken that mans cab it might be difficult to get another and colonel harris hates waiting in a crowded hall     chapter xvi  and the puppets danced   and so he went to meet louisa and colonel harris at the danish legation and found them a taxicab and generally saw to their comparative comfort  there was no restraint between the three of them it was as natural to them all to avoid speaking of important matters on the door step of a neighbours house as it was to eat or drink or breathe so luke asked if the dinner had been enjoyable and the reception crowded and colonel harris comfortably complained of both he hated foreign cooking and society crushes and had endured both tonight no doubt the terrible events of this night as yet mere shadowshardly admitted to be realwere weighing on the kind old mans usual hearty spirits  but so versed were they all in the art of make believe that each one individually was able to register in the innermost depths of an anxious heart the firm conviction that the other had not heard  luke was convinced that the gruesome and sordid news could not have penetrated within the gorgeous mansion where lou in an exquisite gown had sung modern songs in her pure contralto voice he felt sure that neither lou nor colonel harris had heard that philip de mountford had been murdered in a taxicab and that police officers had thought fit to speak to himlukein tones of contemptuous familiarity nay more now that he himself sat thus opposite goodnatured prosy sensible colonel harris he began to think that he must have been dreaming that the whole thing could not have occurred but that he had imagined it all whilst leaning against the gardenrailings trying to strain his ears so that they should hear the soft faint echo of that pure contralto voice  perhaps the wish had been father to the thought whilst gazing up at those brilliantly illumined windows he might in his heart of hearts have wished the nonexistence of philipnot his death but the annihilation of the past few months the nonadvent of the intruder and thus wishing he may have imagined the whole thingthe murder in the cab the police officer on the door step of the old home in grosvenor square  a sense of supreme wellbeing encompassed him now lou sat opposite to him he could not distinguish her face in the gloom only the outline of her head with the soft brown hair perfectly dressed by the hand of an accomplished maid lou the personification of modernity of ordinary commonplace life but exquisitejust the woman whom he loved with every fibre of his heart every tendril of his being and every sense within him a soft perfume of sweet peas clung to her gown and was wafted to his nostrils he closed his eyes and drew in a long breath of supreme delight now and then as the cab gave a jerk his knee came in contact with hers and down on the ground quite close to his own there rested a small neatly shod foot the sole of which he would have given his hearts blood to kiss  oh yes he was quite quite happy this was reality his exquisite louisa the outline of her perfect head the touch of her knee the scent of sweet peas which intoxicated him and whipped his senses to madness and to dreams it was reality and the other was only the wild phantasmagoria of a wild imaginationthe insane thought born of insane desire in the darkness which enveloped him and lou he could you see give free rein to himself the world was not gaping conventionality held no sway within these four narrow walls the puppet could loosen the string which had forced it to dance it could lie placid for awhile dead to the world but enjoying its own existence and its own vitality  and lou watching him in that same darkness which concealed him entirely save to her eyes of watchfulness believed that he had heard nothing as yet she vaguely combated the desire to tell him everything then and there so that he should hear the worst and the best from her lips rather than through indifferent channels later on  but with that subtle perception peculiar to herthe modern commonplace woman of the worldshe divined that he was living for the moment in a world of his own from which it was sacrilege to try and drag him away  just then the cab drew up outside the langham hotel the everyday world had returned with its flaring electric lights its hall porters its noise and bustle and chased away the illusions of the past few moments luke jumped out ready to help lou downa happy second that for her hand must needs rest in his  the glare of the electric lamp above fell full on his face which was serene placid the usual mask of supreme indifference only louisa read beyond the mask and as her hand rested in his for just a thought longer than conventionality allowed she realized that he knew everything the murder the horror and the suspicion which had touched him already with the tip of its sable wing  her eyes and the pressure of her hand bade him goodnight and she passed on into the lighted hall of the hotel he followed colonel harris into the lobby  you have heard he asked quickly and in a whisper lest lou should hear  yes replied the other  and louisa does she know  gossip was all over the confounded place was colonel harriss muttered comment  but youve heard no details  no have you  very little only what the police officer chose to tell me  then queried the older man its an absolute fact  absolute unfortunately  hm as to thathave you seen your uncle  no i went round as soon as i knew but the police had forestalled me and broken the news to him  but why didnt you see him  he sent word that he would rather i come back in the morning philips influence still prevalent you see  well its a confounded business ejaculated colonel harris with hearty conviction but im not going to lament over it after alls said and done its a very simple way out of an impossible situation  a very horrible way  bah  and the goodnatured old man shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of supreme indifference  well said luke quietly its late now sir youll want to get to bed  well retorted the other with quite a touch of joviality its an ill windyou know  good night sir  good night my boy how will you get back  oh a taxi is the quickest edie might have heard something and be anxious i must hurry home now  louisa was standing in the hall at the top of the steps luke raised his hat to her and having shaken hands with colonel harris quietly turned to go and was soon lost in the gloom beyond  no one who had been standing in the lobby of the hotel would have guessed that these three people who had talked and bowed and shaken hands so quietly were facing one of lifes most appalling most overwhelming tragedies  the worlds puppets had been strung up again because indifferent eyes were there to watch and gape and in the presence of these modern bulls of bashan the puppets danced to the prevalent tune     chapter xvii  and what of the secret   when luke arrived at his uncles house early the next morning he was met in the hall by doctor newington who was descending the stairs and who gravely beckoned to the young man to follow him into the library  they called me in last night he said in reply to lukes quick and anxious query the butleror whatever he may betold me that he was busy fastening up the front door preparatory to going to bed when he heard a heavy thud proceeding from the library he found his master lying full length on the floor the head had come in violent contact as he fell with the corner of this table blood was trickling from a scalp wound and lord radclyffe himself was apparently in a swoon the man is a regular coward and a fool besides he left his master lying just as he had fallen but fortunately he knew me and knew where to find me and within ten minutes i was on the spot and had got lord radclyffe into bed  is it asked luke anything serious  lord radclyffe has not been over strong lately he has had a great deal to put up with and at his age the system is not sufficiently elastic orhow shall i put itsufficiently recuperative to stand either constant nerve strain or nagging worries  i dont know interposed luke stiffly that my uncle has had either nerve strain or worry to put up with  oh rejoined the doctor whose gruff familiarity seemed to lukes sensitive ear to be tainted with the least possible note of impertinence i am an old friend of your uncle you know and of all your family there isnt much that has escaped my observation during the past year  you have not yet told me doctor said luke a shade more stiffly than before what is the matter with lord radclyffe  there was distinct emphasis on the last two words  doctor newington shrugged his shoulders goodhumouredly  your uncle has had something in the nature of a stroke he said bluntly and he fixed keen lightcoloured eyes on those of luke watching the effect which the newsbaldly and crudely putwould have on the young mans nerves he was a man with what is known as a fashionable practice he lived in hertford street and his rounds were encircled by the same boundaries as those of the rest of mayfair he had had plenty of opportunity of studying those men and women who compose the upper grades of english society they and their perfect sangfroid their welldrilled calm under the most dire calamities or most unexpected blows had often caused him astonishment when he was a younger man fresh from hospital work and from the haunts of humbler folk who had no cause or desire to hide the depth of their feelings now he was used to his fashionable patients and had ceased to wonder and lukes impassiveness on hearing of his uncles sudden illness did not necessarily strike him as indifference  is it serious asked luke  serious of course assented the doctor  do you mean that lord radclyffes life is in danger  at sixty years of age life is always in danger  i dont mean that rejoined luke with a slight show of impatience is lord radclyffe in immediate danger  no with great care and constant nursing he may soon rally though i doubt if he will ever be as strong and hearty as he was this time last year  then what about a nurse  ill send one down today but  yes  lord radclyffes present household iswell hardly adequate to the exigencies of a long and serious illnesshe ought to have a day and a night nurse i can send both but they will want some waiting on and of course proper meals and ordinary comforts  i can see to all that thank you for your advice  a good and reliable cook is also necessarywho understands invalid cookingall that is most important  and shall be attended to at once is there anything else  perfect rest and quiet of course are the chief things  i shant worry him you may be sure and no one else is likely to come near him  except the police remarked the doctor dryly  the police  the grave events of the night before and those that were ready to follow one another in grim array for the next few days had almost fled from lukes memory in face of the otherto him more seriouscalamityhis uncles illness  oh ah yes he said vaguely i had forgotten  the nurses rejoined the doctor with a pompousness which somehow irritated luke will have my authorization to forbid any one having access to lord radclyffe for the present i will write out the certificate now and this you can present to any one who may show a desire to exercise official authority in the matter of interviewing my patient  i daresay that i can do all that is necessary at the inquest and so onlord radclyffe need not be worried  he mustnt be worried to begin with he would not know any one and he is wholly unable to answer questions  that settles the matter of course so if you will write the necessary certificate ill see the police authorities at once on the subject would lord radclyffe know me do you think added the young man after a slight pause of hesitancy  well replied the doctor evasively i dont think i would worry him today well see how he gets on  hell probably ask for me  that is another matter and if he does you must of course see him but unless there is a marked improvement during the day he wont ask for any one  luke was silent a moment or two while the doctor sat down at the writing table and sought for pen and ink  very well he said after awhile well leave it at that lord radclyffei can promise you thisshall on no account be disturbed without permission from you how soon will the nurse arrive  within the hour the night nurse will come after tea  doctor newington wrote out and signed the usual medical certificate to the effect that lord radclyffes state of health demanded perfect quietude and rest and that he was unable to see any one or to answer any questions he read his own writing through very carefully then folded the paper in half and handed it to luke  this he said will make everything all right and ill call again in a couple of hours time you wont forget the cook  no i wont forget the cook  when the doctor had taken his leave luke stood for a moment quietly in the library he folded up the medical certificate which he had received at the hands of doctor newington and carefully put it away in his pocketbook  you wont forget the cook  i dont think that ever in his life before had luke realized the trivialities of life as he did at this moment remember that he was quite man of the world enough quite sufficiently sensible and shrewd and english to have noticed that the degree of familiarity in the doctors manner had passed the borderland of what was due to himself the tone of contemptuous indifference savoured of impertinence and there was something more than that  last night when luke wandered up and down outside the brilliantly lighted windows of the danish legation trying to catch a few muffled sounds of the voice he so passionately loved to hear he heard the first rumours that an awful crime had been committed which for good or ill would have such farreaching bearings on his own future but he had also caught many hints vague suggestions full of hidden allusions of which the burden was seek whom the crime benefits  luke de mountford was no fool men of his stampwe are accustomed to call them commonplacetake a very straight outlook on life they are not hampered by the psychological problems which affect the moral balance of a certain class of people of today they have no sexual problems to solve theirs is a steady wholesome and clean life and the mirrors of nature have not been blurred by the breath of psychologists  luke had never troubled his head about his neighbours wife about his horse or his ass or anything that is his therefore his vision about the neighbour himself had remained acute  although i must admit that at this stage the thought that he might actually be accused of a low and sordid crime never seriously entered his head he nevertheless felt that suspicion hovered round him that some people at any rate held it possible that since he would benefit by the crime he might quite well have contemplated it  the man travers thought so certainly the doctor did not deem it impossibleand of course there would be others  no wonder that he stood and mused once more the aspect of life had changed for him he was back in that position from which the advent of the unknown cousin had ousted him so easilythe cousin who had come had seen and had conquered the one thing needfulthe confidence and help of uncle rad  by what means he had succeeded in doing that had been the great mystery which had racked lukes mind ever since he felt his uncles affection slipping away from him  uncle rad who had loudly denounced the man as an impostor and a blackmailer before he set eyes on him was ready to give him love and confidence the moment he saw him and luke was discarded like an old coat that no longer fitted the affection of years was turned to indifference and what meant more still the habits of a lifetime were changed lord radclyffe tyrannical and didactic became a nonentity in his own household the grand seigneur imbued with every instinct of luxury and refinement became a snuffy old hermit uncared for not properly waited on feeding badly and living in one room  all this philip de mountford had accomplished entirely by his mere presence the waving of a wanda devils wandand the metamorphosis was complete what magic was there in the man himself what in the tale which he told what subtle charm did he wield that the news of his terrible death should strike the old man down as some withered old tree robbed of its support  now he lay dead murdered only god knew as yet by whom people suspected luke because fate had given a fresh turn to her wheel and reinstated him in the pleasing position from which the intruder had ousted him  luke de mountford was once more heir presumptive to the earldom of radclyffe and the stranger had taken the secret of his success with him to the grave     chapter xviii  it would not do you know   since lord radclyffe was too ill to attend to anything or to see any one it devolved upon luke to make what arrangements he thought fitting for the lying in state and the subsequent obsequies of the murdered man for the present philip de mountford lay in the gloomy mortuary chamber of the victoria police court luke had sent over massive silver candelabra flowers and palms and all the paraphernalia pertaining to luxurious death  the dead man laynot neglectedonly unwatched and alone surrounded by all the evidences of that wealth which he had come a very long way to seek but which fate and a murderers hand had snatched with appalling suddenness from him  and in the private sitting room at the langham louisa harris sat opposite her father at breakfast a pile of morning papers beside her plate she herself silent and absorbed  thats a queer tale colonel harris was saying the papers tell about that murder in brussels a year agothough i must say that to my mind there appears some truth in what they say what do you think louisa  i hardly know she replied absently what to think  the details of that crime which was committed about a year ago are exactly the same as those which relate to this infernal business of last night  are they really  no one could have saidand louisa herself least of allwhy she was unwilling to speak on that subject she had never told her father or any one for a matter of that exceptthat she had been so near to the actual scene of that mysterious crime in brussels and that she had known its every detail  and i must say reiterated colonel harris emphatically that i agree with the leading article in the times one crime begets another if that hooliganor whatever he wasin brussels had not invented this new and dastardly way of murdering a man in a cab and then making himself scarce and sending the cab spinning on its way no doubt philip de mountford would be alive now not that that would be a matter for great rejoicings still a crime is a crime and if we were going to allow blackguards to be murdered all over the place by other blackguards where would law and order be  he was talking more loudly and volubly than was his wont and he took almost ostentatiously quantities of food on his plate which it was quite obvious he never meant to eat he also steadily avoided meeting his daughters eyes but at this juncture she put both elbows on the table rested her chin in her hands and looked straight across at her father  its no use dear she said simply  no use what he queried with ungrammatical directness  no use your pretending to talk at random and to be eating a hearty breakfast when your thoughts are just as much absorbed as mine are  hm he grunted evasively but was glad enough to push aside the plateful of eggs and bacon which indeed he had no desire to eat  you have she continued gently read all the papers just as i have and you know as well as i do what to read between the lines when they talk of clues and of certain sensational developments  of course i do he retorted gruffly but its all nonsense  of course it is but worrying nevertheless  i dont see how such rubbish can worry you  not she said for myself but for luke he must have got an inkling by now of what is going on  of course he has and if he has a grain of sense hell treat it with the contempt it deserves  its all very well father but just think for a moment place yourself in lukes position the very idea that you might be suspected must in itself be terrible  not when you are innocent he rejoined with the absolute certitude of a man who has never been called upon to face any really serious problem in life i shouldnt care what the rabble said about me if i had a clear conscience  louisa was silent for a moment or two then she said  luke is different somehow he has been different lately  he has a lot to put up with with old radclyffe going off his head in that ridiculous way  but louisa did not reply to that suggestion she knew well enough that it was neither lord radclyffes unkindness nor the arrogance of the new cousin that had changed and softened lukes entire nature  the day that he had sat beside her on the stain at lady ducies ball the completeness of the change had been fully borne in on her when luke said to her i would give all i have in the world to lie on the ground before you and to kiss the soles of your feet she knew that love had wrought its usual exquisite miracle the absorption of self by another the utter sinking of the ego before the high altar of the loved one she knew all that but dear old colonel harris had forgottenperhaps he had never known  that knowledge comes to so few nowadays life psychology and sexual problems have taken the place of the divine lesson which has glorified the world since the birth of lilith  all that louisa now remarked to her kind and sensible father was  you know dear suspicion has killed a man before now it was but a very little while ago that a noblehearted gentleman preferred death to such dishonour  youve got your head he retorted full of nonsense lou try and be a sensible woman now and think of it all quietly is there anything you would like me to do for instance  yes if you will  what is it  couldnt you see uncle ryder  at scotland yard you mean  he is at the head of the criminal investigation department isnt he  ive always understood so  would he see you do you think at his office  tom not see me exclaimed colonel harris of course he would what do you want me to see him about  he could tell you exactly how matters stood with regard toto luke couldnt he  he could but would he  you can but try  its a great pity your aunt is out of town you might have heard a good deal from her  oh sir thomas never tells aunt anything thats professional said louisa with a smile shed be forever making muddles  i am sure she would he assented with deep conviction  do you think i might go with you  what to toms i dont think he would like that lou and it wouldnt quite do you know  perhaps not she agreed with hardly even a sigh of disappointment she was so accustomed you see to being thwarted by convention whenever impulse carried her out of the bounds which the world had prescribed moreover she expected to see luke soon he would be sure to come directly after an early visit to grosvenor square  she helped her father on with his coat she was almost satisfied that he should go alone she would have an hour with luke if he came early and it was necessary that she should have him to herself before too many people had shouted evil and good news congratulations opprobrium and suspicions at him  colonel harris she knew would get quite as much if not more information out of his brotherinlaw sir thomas ryder than he could do if shea mere womanhappened to be present at the interview sir thomas would trust colonel harris with professional matters which he never would confide to a woman and louisa trusted her father implicitly  she knew that despite the grumblings and crustiness peculiar to every englishman when he is troubled with domestic matters whilst sitting at his own breakfast table her father had lukes welfare just as much at heart as she had herself     chapter xix  not all about it   colonel harris sent in his card to sir thomas ryder he had driven over from the langham in a hansomholding taxicabs in even more wholehearted abhorrence than before he inquired at once if sir thomas was in his private sanctum and if so whether he might see him  curiously enough the chief usually quite inaccessible to the casual visitorwhether relative or strangerreceived his brotherinlaw immediately  hello will he said by way of greeting the way englishmen have of saying that they are pleased to see one another  hello responded colonel harris in the same eloquent tone  and the two old boys shook hands  sir thomas then resumed his official chair behind his huge desk and motioned his brotherinlaw to an armchair close by  have a cigar said the host  thanks rejoined the other  the box was handed across a havana selected  the cigars were lighted and for quite three minutes the two men smoked in silence one of them had come here to find out how much of his daughters happiness lay in jeopardy the other knew what was in the balance the danger to his nieces happiness the terrible abyss of misery which yawned at her feet  but both sat there and enjoyed their cigars they were dressed with scrupulous care in the uniform prescribed by the world in which they lived as being suitable for gentlemen of their position and of their age frock coats and dark gray trousers immaculate collar and tie with pearl pin both wore a seal ring on the little finger of the left hand and a watch chain of early victorian design they might be twins but for their faces convention had put a livery on them which they would on no account have discarded  but the faces were very different colonel harris carried his sixty years as easily as if they had been forty there were not many lines on his round chubby face with its red cheeks and round childlike eyes the heavy cavalry moustache once auburn now almost white hid the expression of the mouth but one felt judging by the eyes and the smooth forehead which continued very far now onto the back of his head that if one were allowed a peep below that walruslike face adornment one would see a mouth that was kind and none too firm the mouth of a man who had led other men perhaps but who had invariably been led by his women folk  now sir thomas ryder wasor rather is for he is still in perfect health and full vigoura very different type of man you have no doubt seen him about townfor he takes a constitutional in the park every day on his way to his work and he goes to most first nights at the theatresand if so you will have admired the keen sharp face the closely set eyes the mobile mouth free from moustache or beard the face is furrowed all over especially round the eyes yet he does not look old that is because of the furrows they form a wonderful network round his eyes giving them an expression of perpetual keen amusement the hair is pale in colournot white but fadedand scanty sir thomas wears it carefully brushed across the top of his head with a parting on the left side  he has a trick when he is thinking deeply of passing his handwhich is white slender and taperingover that scanty covering of what but for it would be a bald cranium  some people said that sir thomas ryder was a man without any sentiment others that he was a slave to red tape but no one denied the uncontrovertible fact that he was the right man in the right place  he looked the part and always acted it and fewer blunders had undoubtedly been committed in the detective department of the metropolitan police since sir thomas ryder took the guiding reins in hand  i suppose he said at last that youve come to see me about this de mountford business  i have replied colonel harris simply  well its not a pleasant business  i know that the papers are full of it and its all a confounded damnable business tom and thats all about it  unfortunately its not all about it rejoined sir thomas dryly  thats what louisa says women are so queer about things of that sort and the papers are full of twaddle she is anxious about luke  i dont wonder  but its all nonsense isnt it  what is  colonel harris did not reply immediately for one thing he did not know exactly how to put his own fears and anxieties into words they were so horrible and so farfetched that to tell them plainly and baldly to his brotherinlaw to this man with whom he was soberly smoking a cigar in a soberlooking office whilst hansoms and taxicabs were rattling past in the street below within sight and hearing seemed little short of idiocy he was not a man of deep penetrationwas colonel harrisno great reader of thoughts or of character he tried to look keenly at sir thomass shrewd face but all he was conscious of was a network of wrinkles round a pair of eyes which seemed to be twinkling with humour  humour at this moment great heavens above  i wish he blurted out somewhat crossly at last youd help me out a bit tom hang it all man all this officialism makes me dumb  dont said sir thomas blandly let it do that will and the speakers eyes seemed to twinkle even more merrily than before  well then tell me something about luke  luke de mountford mused the other as if the name recalled some distant impression  yes luke de mountford who is engaged to louisa your niece man and shes breaking her heart with all the drivel these newspapers talk and i couldnt bear it any longer so ive come to you tom and you must tell me what truth there is in the drivel and thats all i want to know  sir thomas ryder seemed whilst the other thus talked volubly to have suddenly made up his mind to say more than had originally been his intention anyway he now said with abrupt directness  if my good will by drivel you mean that in the matter of the assassination of philip de mountford in a taxicab last night grave suspicion rests on his cousin luke then theres a great deal of truth in the drivel  colonel harris received the sudden blow without much apparent emotion he had been sitting in an armchair with one hand buried in his trousers pocket the other holding the cigar  now he merely glanced down at the cigar for a moment and then conveyed it to his lips  what he asked does that mean exactly  that unless luke de mountford will within the next fortyeight hours answer certain questions more satisfactorily than he has done hitherto he will be arrested on a charge of murder  that is impossible protested colonel harris hotly  impossible why  becausebecausehang it all man you know luke de mountford do you believe for a moment that he would commit such a dastardly crime why the boy wouldnt know how to plan such villainy let alone carry it through  my dear will rejoined the other quietly the many years which i have spent at this desk have taught me many things among others i have learned that every man is more or less capable of crime it only depends what the incentivethe temptation if you like to call it soor the provocation happens to be  but here there was no provocation no temptation no  colonel harris paused abruptly he felt rather than saw his brotherinlaws eyes in their framework of wrinkles resting with obvious sense of amusement upon his wrathful face no temptation and what of a peerage and a fortune lost that could only be regained by the death of the intruder no provocation and what of the brother and sister turned out of the old home the good simpleminded man had sense enough to see that here if he wished to speak up for luke he was on the wrong track  what questions he said abruptly does luke not answer satisfactorily  how he spent certain hours of yesterday evening  he was dancing attendance on louisa and me  oh was he well thats satisfactory enough at what time did you part from him  well he escorted us to the danish legation where we were dining  at what time was that  eight oclock dinner  but he was not dining at the danish legation  no he came and fetched us again soon after eleven  thats right but between whiles  between whiles  yes between eight and soon after eleven  welli supposei dont knowyes of course i do what a stupid ass i am luke told me himself that he was going to see his uncle at the something club in shaftesbury avenue  the veterans  yes thats itthe veterans luke wanted to persuade old radclyffe to go abroad for the benefit of his healthalgecirasthat was it  quite so rejoined sir thomas dryly and luke de mountford went to the veterans club in shaftesbury avenue and he asked to see lord radclyffe who was a more or less regular habitué at that hour on being told that lord radclyffe was not there that evening but that mr de mountford was in the smoking room luke elected to go in and presumably to have a talk with his cousin  i didnt know that said colonel harris  no but we did let me tell you what followed the hall porter of the club showed luke into the smoking room and less than five minutes later he heard loud and angry words proceeding from that room that a quarrel was going on between the two cousins was of course obvious one or two members of the club remarked on the noise and one gentleman actually opened the smoking room door to see what was going on he seems to have heard the words blackguard and beggar pleasingly intermingled and flying from one young man to the other this witness knew philip de mountford very well by sight but he had never seen luke but remember that luke denies neither the interview nor the quarrel the former lasted close on an hour and lord radclyffes journey to algeciras was the original topic of discussion at about nine oclock luke emerged from the smoking room the hall porter saw him he was then very pale and almost tottered as he walked men do get at times intoxicated with rage you know will  i know that and i can well imagine what happened at that interview radclyffe had become such a confounded fool that he would not move or do anything without this philips permission and luke was determined to get him down to algeciras at once as philip was at the club he thought that he would tackle him then and there  quite so he did tackle him and equally of course the two men quarrelled  but hang it all ones not going to murder every man with whom one quarrels  stop a moment will as you say one does not murder every man with whom one quarrels but you must admit that this is altogether an exceptional case there was more than a mere quarrel between these two men there was deadly enmityjustified enmity ill own on lukes side we have already come acrossit was not very difficulttwo or three of the servants who were in lord radclyffes house before luke and his brother and sister were finally turned out of it they all have tales to tell of the terrible rows which used to go on in the house between the cousins you will must know how luke hated this philip de mountford  again colonel harris was silent what was the use of denying such an obvious truth  you wanted continued the other man quietly to hear the truth will and youve got it for louisas sake for all our sakes in fact i made up my mind to tell you allor mostthat is officially known to me at this moment you must get louisa out of town at oncetake her abroad if you can and keep english newspapers away from her  she wont come said colonel harris firmly  oh yes she will if you put it the right way  which saying on the part of the acute chief of our criminal investigation department was but a further proofif indeed such proofs were still needed nowadaysof how little clever men know of commonplace women  the case will be extremely unpleasant resumed sir thomas who was quite unconscious of the ignorance which he had just displayed it will be hateful for you and quite impossible for louisa  always supposing retorted the other that luke is guilty which neither i nor louisa will admit for a moment  that rejoined sir thomas is as you please  he put down his cigar crossed one leg over the other leaned back in his chair and folded his tapering hands together putting finger to finger with the gesture of one who is dealing with a youthful mind and has much to explain  look here will he resumed i have three men standing in my outer office at the present moment two of them have come back after having questioned the past servants of the grosvenor square household there was the butler parker and an elderly housekeeper both of whom are in service in the west end the woman tried to screen luke and to make light of the many quarrels which broke out between the cousins on all possible occasions but she broke down under our fellows sharp questions she had to admit that the arrogance of the one man often drove the other to unguarded language and that she had on more than one occasion heard the men servants of the house say that they would not be astonished if murder ensued one day well we have these two witnesses and can easily get hold of the two or three footmen who expressed those particular views so much for the past six months now for last night the third man who is out there waiting for me to see him is frederick power hall porter at the veterans club the story which he told to our mr travers is so important in its minutest detail that i have decided to question him myself so that i may leave no possible loophole to doubt or to inaccuracy in the retelling i am going to send for the man now you come and sit round here the other side of my desk from this position you will be able to watch the mans face as well as hear what he has got to say now would you like that  right you are tom was colonel harriss brief method of acknowledging his brotherinlaws kindness in thus breaking a piece of red tape and setting aside a very strict official rule he did as sir thomas directed and sat down in the recess behind the chiefs desk in a comfortable armchair with his back to the curtained window  he would not acknowledge even to himself how deeply stirred he was by all that he had heard and now by the anticipation of what was yet to come emotionlike he was experiencing nowhad never come his way before now he had lost his only son on the modder riverthat had been sorrow of an acute kind he had laid a much loved wife to rest in the village churchyard close to his stately home in kent and he had escorted his late beloved sovereign to her last resting place on that nevertobeforgotten day close on five years ago now those three events in his life had been the great strains to which his nerves and sensibilities had been subjected in the past  but this was altogether different the sensations which the good man experienced were such that he scarcely knew them himself he had faced sorrow before never dishonoursome one elses dishonour of coursestill it touched him very nearly for though he might not be a very keen observer he dearly loved his daughter and dishonour seemed to be touching her striking at her through luke     chapter xx  and thats the truth   frederick power was shown in  i wont have you think that there was anything remarkable about the man or anything that wouldeven momentarilydistinguish him from any number of other hall porters who wear a uniform and peaked cap have the air of having seen military service and wear a couple of medals on a welldeveloped chest  he was perfectly respectful all the more so because sir thomas was general sir thomas ryder kcba fact which impressed the exsoldier far more than any other exalted title nonmilitary in character would have done  he saluted and stood at attention and as he gave answer to sir thomass preliminary questions his words rang out clear and direct obviously truthful as if echoing in the barrack yard at 6 am of a frosty spring morning  your name is  frederick power sir  you are hall porter at the veterans club in shaftesbury avenue  yes sir  you were in the lobby of the club last night as usual  yes sir  and mr philip de mountford who is a member of the club was in the smoking room at eight oclock yesterday evening  yes sir  he came almost every evening i understand  thats right sir  alone mostly  not often sir lord radclyffe was with him most evenings  and lord radclyffe and mr de mountford dined together on those occasions in the club diningroom  yes sir  but last night mr de mountford was alone  yes sir he had some dinner at about half past seven and then he went to the smoking room  later on a gentleman called to see him  thats right sir it was about a quarter past eight the gentleman asked to see lord radclyffe but i said that is lordship adnt come to the club this night then the gentleman asked if mr de mountford was in and i said yes  and you showed him into the smoking room  i told im he would find mr de mountford in the smoking room yes sir  isnt that rather against club rules to allow strangers to walk in and out of the rooms  well sir the veterans is a new cluband the committee aint very partiklar  i see  so far the questions and answers had followed on one another in quick succession sir thomas ryder with his clever lean head held somewhat on one side appeared to be reciting a welllearned lesson so even and placid was the tone of his voice and so indifferent the expression of his furrowed face one leg was crossed over the other and his tapering hands white and wrinkled like his face toyed with a large ivory paper knife hardly whiter in colour than they  he had not told frederick power to sit down as he might have done in the case of a witness who was a civilian he preferred to keep the man standing and at attention confident that he would thus get clearer and sharper replies  well then he resumed after a brief interval during which he had modified his position somewhat but had not varied the placid expression of his face you told the visitor that he would find mr de mountford in the smoking room what happened after that  the gentleman walked in sir and he shut the door sir after im  did you hear anything that went on inside the room  no sir i didnt pay no attention at first sir  then afterward after awhile you did pay attention didnt you  yes sir i did the door of the smoking room is quite close to the entrance sir and presently i heard loud voices like as if the two gentlemen was quarrelling  did you hear what was said  no sir not the words but the voices they sounded awful and one other gentleman e come along from the diningroom and asked me what the noise was about there aint many members now at the veterans sir and being a foggy night we was partiklar quiet but this gentleman e was curious about the noise so e just opened the smoking room door and peeped in and then i did ear a few words  what were they  abuse sir mostly one gentleman was goin on awful but i couldnt rightly say which one it was i eard the word beggar and lazy idling goodfornothing but i couldnt rightly say oo said em  how long did this go on  oh a long time sir i couldnt say for sure after a bit it got quiet in the smoking room and at about nine oclock or soon after the visitor come away and e asked me for a light  what did he seem like then  i thought ed been drinking sir his face was all queer and pale and moistlike and is and shook like anything when he lighted is cigarette  mr de mountford did not come out with him  no sir not just then but e come out of the smoking room a moment or two later whilst is visitor was still in the all mr de mountford e was quite calm sir didnt look at all as if ed been aving a quarrel ed his cigar between is lips his at on and is overcoat over is arm  did he speak to the visitor then  not right away sir e seemed to be esitating like at first then e came forward and e says i am going back to grosvenor square now would you like to see uncle rad about this business yourself but i warn you that e is of the same mind as myself  and what did the other gentleman say  e just kind o laughed and shrugged his shoulders and said ive no doubt of that  then after that did they agree to go to grosvenor square together  i dont rightly know sir if the two gentlemen said anything about that but the visitor e went out first and mr de mountford followed im into the outer lobby then e turned and spoke to me  who did  mr de mountford sir the other gentleman wasnt a yard away from im and must ave eard every word e said  what did he say  e said to me power i say youve no business to allow people to enter the club rooms like that you must keep them waiting in the all one will get hopelessly pestered by beggars at this rate them were mr de mountfords very words sir id take my bible oath to every one of em and the other gentleman e was in the outer lobby sir and e must ave eard every syllable i caught sight of is face and my word there was murder in is eye  thatll do power admonished sir thomas thus checking the mans flow of excited eloquence  very good sir replied the other humbly  and after that what happened  both gentlemen went off sir i tried to look after em but the fog was that thick one couldnt see ones and before ones eyes  so you lost sight of them just outside the clubhouse  thats right sir  and did you see either of these two gentlemen since then  no sir and the mans voice dropped to a solemn whisper mr de mountford was murdered in a taxicab sirmust ave been soon after e left the club  very soon i should say but the other  i saw the other gentleman this morning sir  where  mr travers from the police sir e called to see me at the club and e took me in a taxicab to grosvenor square and told the shoffer sir to pull up by the curb on the garden side then e told me to watch a partiklar ouse opposite and see oo was goin in or out i didnt arf like it sir because im not supposed to absent myself for very long of a morning though the committee aint very partiklar but mr travers e was of the police sir so i thought it was right to do as e told me  quite right and what did you see  nothing much for close on an hour sir a carriage drew up to the door of the ouse and an elderly gentleman got out mr travers told me that it was the doctor e rang the bell and went into the ouse then after a bit oo did i see walking down the street and straight up to the front door of the partiklar ouse id been told to look at but mr de mountfords visitor of last night  you recognized him  couldnt mistake im sir  did you call mr traverss attention to him  yes sir i told im that was the gentleman ood ad an awful quarrel with mr philip de mountford at the club last night  thats all power i wont trouble you further now  no trouble sir  your position at the club is a permanent one  yes sir  you are always to be found there  always sir whenever you want me  well send a line to the chief superintendent at scotland yard in case your plans get suddenly modified and you are no longer to be found at the club  not likely sir thank you sir good morning  good morning  sir thomas touched the electric button in the wall behind him and a man in a dark blue uniform appeared frederick power was dismissed he saluted both gentlemen and turning on his heel in proper military fashion he marched out of the room obviously delighted with his own importance and with the adventure which varied so pleasantly the monotonous evenness of his existence     chapter xxi  have another cigar   well william what do you think of it all  the two men had sat in silence for quite a considerable time after frederick power had marched out of the room colonel harris buried in thought was in no hurry to talk things over sir thomas rydera very busy manwas the more impatient of the two  i must tell you he said seeing that his brotherinlaw seemed disinclined to speak that our man travers as soon as power had pointed luke out to him went and rang the bell at radclyffes house and quickly enough established beyond a doubt that the man who had just entered it was mr luke de mountford i tell you this now so as to disabuse your mind once and for all in case you should imagine that this might be a case of mistaken identity moreover you yourself know and have admitted to me that lukes intention was to seek out his uncle and his cousin at the veterans club after he parted from you at eight oclock last night  yes said colonel harris i know that i was not thinking of mistaken identity  you rejoined the other were thinking of luke and so am i i have thought little of any one else since first the crime was reported to me last night and long before travers gleaned the outlines of the story which power has just amplified for us i vaguely guessed at the broad lines of it now that i know it in all its details i can see the whole scene in the lobby of the veterans club before me you may believe me or not as you like but as a matter of fact i know quite a good deal about luke de mountford i have often met him of course and though we have never been very intimatefor i am a busy man and have but little time for intimacy with my fellowmeni have had many opportunities of studying him he has a very curious power of selfcontrolalmost an abnormal one i call it and a morbid hatred of public scenes or scandal this of course he shares with a great many men of his class and his selfcontrol is all the more remarkable as he is not by any means the impassive young man about town which he pretends to be well that same power i suppose stood him in good stead in the lobby of the veterans club in powers picturesque parlance there was murder in his eye of course he had been provoked beyond the bounds of endurance and if he had rushed at philip de mountford and strangled him then and there no one would have been astonished i should continued sir thomas with emphasis because it would not have been like the luke whom i had studied the picture of two gentlemen at fisticuffs like a pair of navvies would not have been an edifying one and lukeas i know himwould above all wish not to make a spectacle of himself before the hall porter or before a crowd in the anteroom of a secondrate club he naturallyfor that sort of thing becomes second naturepulled himself together and walked out into the street  you must not think for a moment that sir thomas ryder was habitually a talkative man englishmen of his class and type are rarely talkative and sir thomass position and occupation had rendered him less communicative than most but colonel harris and he had been brother officers friends long before family ties were closely knit by marriage and he considered the present crisis a very serious one  he had had enough to do with crime in the past few years since he had obtained the interesting post which he now occupied but never with a crime which affected him personally as this one did luke de mountford was of course nothing to him except in connection with louisa harris but this was a strong tie louisa was his own wifes niece she was the daughter of a friend of a brother officer no one who is not in some manner or other in touch with military men can have the slightest idea of how much those two magic words mean brother officer what magnetism lies in them what appeal they make to all that is most loyal most willing most helpful in a man  sir thomas felt that the mud of irretrievable disgrace which was bound to smirch luke de mountford would in no small measure redound on louisa too instinctively too all his sensibilities recoiled against the idea of a gentleman one of his own caste being dragged in this peculiarly loathsome mire it seemed impossible that that type of man should commit a murdera murderjust an ordinary brutal commonplace murder such as the rough and tumble herd of humanity commit when under the stress of vulgar passions greed avarice jealousy it was this juxtaposition of the mean and sordid against his own class that revolted sir thomas ryder he was loyal to his brother officer in his endeavour to induce him to keep out of all that mud which would be scattered all round presently when the papers came out with their sensational headlines but he was alsoperhaps more soloyal to his caste his was the esprit de corps not only of militarism but of birth and breeding he would not if he could have a gentleman held up to opprobrium and if this could be avoided by the unfortunate criminals flight from justicewell sir thomas was ready and willing to take upon his shoulders the burden of contempt and ridicule which the press and the general public would presently be hurling at him and at his department for their hopeless incompetence in allowing a murderer to escape  therefore he was putting the case against luke more clearly and with a greater wealth of detail before his brotherinlaw than the conscientious discharge of duty should have allowed in fact we see sir thomas rydera hard disciplinarian a hide and tape bound officialfreely transgressing the most elementary rules which duty prescribes he was sitting in his private office with his brotherinlaw giving away secrets that belonged not to him but to his department conniving through the words which he spoke at the fleeing from justice of a criminal who belonged not to him but to the state  he was making the case against luke de mountford to appear as black as it was in effect so that colonel harris and louisa might take fright and induce the unfortunate man to realize his danger in time and to shrink from facing the consequences of his own terrible deed  but colonel harriswith the obstinacy of those who throughout life have never led but have always been ruledwould not see the case through his brotherinlaws spectacles he clung to his own repudiation of the possibility of luke de mountfords guilt he behaved quite unconsciously just as louisa would have wished him to behave had she been present here to prompt him  to sir thomass most convincing exposé of the situation he lent an attentive ear but the shrug of his shoulders when the other man paused to take breath was in itself a testimony of loyalty to lukes cause  hang it all man he said you are not going to sit there and tell me that luke de mountfordthe man whom i myself would have chosen as a soninlaw had lou not forestalled methat luke would commit a deliberate murder in the name of commonsense tom why its unthinkable do you mean to say that you actually believe that luke after he left that godforsaken club joined his cousin again as if nothing had happened that he got into a taxicab with him and poked him through the neck whilst the man was looking another way  roughly speaking assented sir thomas i believe thats what happened  and you call yourself a shrewd detective exclaimed colonel harris hotly and you hold the lives of men practically in the hollow of your hand why man have you forgotten one thing he continued his gruff voice assuming a note of triumph the most important in all this damnable business  what have i forgotten will asked the other not at all ruffled by the gallant colonels sudden tone of contempt  the weapon tom  i havent forgotten the weapon rejoined sir thomas calmly  oh yes you have do you mean to tell me that luke de mountford habitually walks about the streets of london with an italian stiletto in his trousers pocket for i am told that it was with a thing of that sort that the murder was committed or according to you did luke escort louisa to a dinnerparty with the avowed intention at the back of his mind of committing a murder later on if occasion offered did he bring an italian stiletto from home when he came to meet his fiancée at the langham hotel or did he buy one on the way to the veterans club which of these cockandbull theories do you hold tom  neither admitted sir thomas with a placid smile  then concluded colonel harris contemptuously you think that luke wasas i saidin the habit of carrying an italian stiletto in his trousers pocket  no rejoined the other still unruffled but i know that luke de mountford is in the habit of carrying a snakewood walking stick which he once boughtyears agosomewhere abroad and the top of which contains a short pointed dagger which fits into the body of the stick and whats more you know that stick too will you have often seen it are you prepared to swear that luke hadnt it with him last night  he hadnt it with him  you are prepared to swear to that insisted the other earnestly  colonel harris was silent for the first time since the beginning of this long interview he felt as if all the blood in his body was receding back to his heart causing it to beat so wildly that he thought it was about to choke him the colour fled from his cheeks and the cigar dropped from between nerveless fingers swift as lightning a recollection came back to hima vision of luke entering the sittingroom of the langham hotel with his coat on and his hat and stick in the left hand  but he would not give in even nownot on such paltry surmises any number of men he knew carried sticks that contained weapons of selfdefence he himself possessed a very murderouslooking swordstick which he had once bought in paris he fought down this oncoming attack of weakness and blamed himself severely for it too it savoured of disloyalty to louisa and to luke he stooped and picked his cigar up and looked his brotherinlaw boldly in the face  i wouldnt he said swear either way whether luke had his stick with him last night or not i know that stick of course i have got one very like it myself  so have i rejoined sir thomas with his placid smile  and if thats one of the proofs on which you are going to accuse my future soninlaw of having committed a murder then all i can say is tom that you and i are seeing the last of one another today  but sir thomas took this threat as he had taken colonel harriss undisguised expressions of contempt with perfect equanimity  if he said quietly i did accuse luke de mountford or any other man of murder on such paltry grounds as that will you would be perfectly justified in turning your back on me if for no other reason than that i should then be an incompetent ass  well what more is there then  only this will that the stick which you have so often seen in luke de mountfords hand was found this morning inside the railings of green park it bears unmistakable signs of the use to which it was put last night  you meanthat it was stained  how long a time elapsed between the beginning of that query and its last words colonel harris could not say the uttering of the words was a terrible effort they seemed to choke him ere they reached his lips a buzzing and singing filled his ears so that he did not hear sir thomass reply but through a strange veil which half obscured his vision he saw his brotherinlaws slow nod of affirmation for the first time in his life the man who had fought against naked savages in the swamps or sands of africa who had heard unflinching the news of the death of his only son felt himself totally unnerved he heard as in a dream the hum of the busy city in the street below hansoms and omnibuses rattling along the road the cries of news vendors or hawkers the bustle of humdrum everyday life and through it the ticking of his own watch in his waistcoat pocket  he remembered afterward how strangely this had impressed him that he could hear the ticking of his own watch he had never been conscious before of such an acute sense of hearing and yet the buzzing and singing in his ears went on and he was horribly painfully conscious of silly trivial thingsthe ticking of his watch which obsessed him the irregularity in the design of the wall paper the broken top of the inkstand on sir thomass desk  the great allimportant fact had escaped momentarily from his consciousness he forgot that philip de mountford had been murdered and that lukes stick bloodstained and damning had been found inside the railings of the park  a cycle of time went byan eternity or else a few seconds sir thomas ryder pulled open the long drawer of his monumental desk  colonel harris watched him doing it and long before sir thomas took a certain something from out the drawer the colonel knew what that something would be  a familiar thing enough the colonel had seen it over and over again in luke de mountfords hand a slender stick of rich looking dark wood only very little thicker at the top than at the base and with a silver band about six inches from the top on the band the initials l de m daintily engraved  put it away tom for gods sake colonel harris hardly recognized his own voice he had spoken more from a sudden instinct of shrinking from loathsome objects than from any real will of his own one glance at the stick had been enough it was thickly coated with mud and about six inches from the top there where the silver band showed a deep dark cleft between it and the length of the stick there were other stainsobvious stains of blood  yet colonel harris had seen worse sights than this in zululand and at omdurman but on this stained stick that discoloured silver band he felt it impossible to look  i have broken it to you will as gently as i could said sir thomas not quite as placidly as before he too was not unmoved by the distress of his old friend you see that i had no option but to tell you all you must keep out of all this old man and above all you must keep louisa out of it take her abroad will as soon as you can  she wont go murmured the father dully  nonsense  she wont go he reiterated she has given her heart to luke  shell soon forget him  not she  and shell be horrifiedwhen she knows  shell not believe it  if he is wise hell plead guiltyhis solicitor will advise him to do that it is his one chance     his one chance queried the other vaguely  of escaping the gallows if he pleads guilty many extenuating circumstances will be admittedhis own spotless reputationand also intense provocation hell get a life sentence or even perhaps  but with a loud oath the most forcible one he had ever uttered in his life colonel harris had jumped to his feet and brought a heavy fist crashing down upon the table  and by the living god tom he said ill not believe it no not for all your witnesses and your cross questionings and your damnable proofs no ill not believe it and i know that my girl will not believe it eithernot until we hear the word guilty spoken by lukes own lips and well not leave london well not go abroad well not desert luke for i swear by god that i dont believe that he is an assassin  men who have always been accounted weak often have moments of unexpected strength colonel harris now seemed to tower morally and mentally over his brotherinlaw the passion of loyalty was in him and caused his eyes to sparkle and his cheeks to glow the oath he uttered he spoke with fervour there would be no faltering no wavering in his defence of luke  sir thomas waited a minute or two allowing his old friend to recover his normal selfcontrol as well as his breath which was coming and going in quick gasps then he said quietly  as you will old man have another cigar     chapter xxii  then the miracle was wrought   when colonel harris once more arrived at the langham he found luke and louisa comfortably installed in front of the fire in the private sittingroom up stairs she was leaning back against the cushions her head resting in her hand he at the foot of the sofa his hands encircling one knee gazing now and then into the fire now and then into her face  not troubled creatures these not man and woman fighting a battle against life against the world for honour for peace and for love not souls racked by painful memories of the past or grim dread of the future only two very ordinary human beings with a life behind them of serene contentment social duties worthily performed a smooth lake whereon not a ripple of sorrow or disgrace ever dared to mar the shiny surface  and the ruling passion strong in death was stronger still in face of this new life to be led the life of tomorrow full of the unknown the ugly the sordid and mean full of nameless dangers and of possible disgrace the puppets were still dancing moved by the invisible strings held by the hand of the implacable giant called convention they danced even as though no gaping and ravenous lions no bulls of bashan were there to see even before each other they hid the secret mysteries of their hearts he his overwhelming passion for her she her dread for his immediate future  they had not forborne to talk of philip de mountfords death they would not have admitted that there was anything there that could not be discussed with perfect indifferenceshe reclining against the cushions and he in immaculate morning coat with hair smoothly brushed and speckless tie and linen talking of things which meant life or death for them both  he had told her all he knew his visit to philip at the veterans club his quarrel with him the hatred which he bore to the man that was dead he made no secret of the police officers questionings nor of doctor newingtons extraordinary attitude  one would think those fellows had a suspicion that i had murdered philip he said quite lightly  and her face never moved whilst she listened to these details analyzing them in her mind comparing them with those at which the morning papers had hinted the clues and startling developments to obtain confirmation of which her father had gone out to seek sir thomas ryder  luke de mountford would no more have dreamed of telling louisa of the dark suspicions which really threatened him than he would have laid bare before her some hideous wound if he happened to be suffering from one the police officers insolence and the doctors easy contempt had sounded a note of warning of what was imminent but beyond that he had no fear why should he have and having none why worry lou with plaints that might agitate her  remember that he individually was quite convinced that philips murderer would soon be discovered he too had read his morning paper and knew as well as anybody that for the moment suspicion rested upon him seek whom the crime will benefit was a phrase freely used in the press this morning but it was only a question of time an unpleasant phase to be traversed some mud that presently would have to be brushed off no use to worry louisa with it fortunately she took it lightly too she was far too sensible to attach importance to such nonsense  nevertheless mud thrown in such boundless profusion was apt to hurt very considerably luke had to set his teeth this morning when he perused the times and even now there was in him a sensation of having been bruised all over after his second interview with travers and his talk with doctor newington in the library louisa did him good she was calm and sensible and a woman of the world she never puzzled luke nor had she that vague longing to be misunderstood the peculiar attribute of the woman of today in face of her serenity he almost despised himself for the intensity of his own passion she was so pure so womanly in her tenderness a girl still she was hardly conscious of passion but she knew that he was in painmorally and mentally in painand that worse was yet to come and she the commonplace sensible girl brought forth her full array of calm and of triviality checking by a placid smile the faintest onrush of passion in him for passion could but torture him now when his very soul was troubled and every nerve on the jar  and thus colonel harris found them  when he entered louisa was recounting to luke the menu of last nights dinner  and homard à la danoise was a perfect dream she was saying i suppose it would not be etiquette to ask her excellency for the recipe  luke rose as the colonel entered and passed his hand across the back of his smooth head a gesture peculiarly english and peculiarly his own the older man was undoubtedly the most troubled of the three  its a damnable business this he said as soon as he had shaken luke by the hand and thrown off hat and coat  does sir thomas ryder asked luke lightly also think that i have murdered philip  he knew where colonel harris had been louisa had not thought of keeping this from him  toms a fool retorted the colonel involuntarily  it was tantamount to an avowal luke never flinched he even contrived to smile louisa sat up very straight and with an instinctive movement gave the sofa cushions a nervy shake up but her eyes were fastened on luke  dont worry sir said luke very quietly ill get out of it all in good time  of course you will damn it all ejaculated the other fervently  the inquest you know is tomorrow  it was luke who spoke and colonel harris looked up quickly  then he said surely some light will be thrown on this mysterious business  lets hope so sir rejoined luke dryly  has uncle ryder told you anything fresh father anything that we dont yet know  colonel harris did not reply and louisa knew that there was something that uncle ryder had said something awful which had caused her father to wear the troubled look which had terrified her the moment he came in  something awfulwhich would affect luke  wont you tell us father she said what uncle ryder told you luke ought to know  oh rejoined luke theres no hurry im sure colonel harris will tell me presently lou you were coming to the park this morning i suppose we cant go to the temple garden show very well  not very well i think she replied but ill come for a walk after lunch with pleasure father must tell us now what uncle ryder said  then as colonel harris still seemed to hesitate she became more insistent and her voice more firm  father dear she said i must know as well as luke  the old man took a turn up and down the room with hands behind his back he would not look either at louisa or at luke for it would be easier to tell them everything without meeting their eyes and he had to tell them everything to her as well as to him it was no longer any use trying to avoid the subject pretending that it was trivial unworthy of discussion  facts had to be faced at last like the dervishes at omdurman and a plan of campaign decided on in the event of momentary defeat  ryder he began quite abruptly at last had the hall porter of that confounded club up to his room while i was there and questioned him before me  he could suggested luke only repeat the story which we all know already i never denied seeing philip at the club or quarrelling with him for a matter of that hang it all i have often quarrelled with him before  yes rejoined the colonel theyve ferreted out the old servants of your uncles household and heard innumerable stories of quarrels  exaggerated i expect but what of it  and that hall porter didnt mince matters either damn him  philip remarked luke dryly shouted pretty loudly i did not  the porter said that when you left the club you had murder in your eye  possibly  you had overheard philips last remark to the porter  yessomething about pestering beggars i was ready to make him swallow his words but i loathe a scene before people like those who frequent the veterans club  i wish to goodness you had gone for him then and there  why  this accursed business would not have occurred  oh yes it wouldsooner or later  what makes you say that  philip must have had an enemy  who murdered him last night you think  an enemy assented luke who evidently laid in wait for him and murdered him last night it is bound to come out at the inquest  about this enemy queried colonel harris vaguely  why yes rejoined luke a little impatiently surely the police have made other investigations they are not just fastening on me and on no one else  could you asked louisa help the police in that luke  no he replied i know absolutely nothing about philip or about his past life  did lord radclyffe  i dont know  he has been questioned has he not  he is too ill to see any one doctor newington declares that he must not attempt to see any one his condition is critical moreover he is only partly conscious  but  theres philips lawyer davies said luke the police ought to be in communication with him it is positively ridiculous the way they seem to do nothing in the way of proper investigation but only make up their minds that i have killed my cousin why they dont even seem to trouble about the weapon with which the murder was committed  the weapon  the ejaculation spoken hardly above a whisper had come from colonel harris once more the old man feltas he had done in his brotherinlaws officethat every drop of blood in him had receded back to his heart and that he would choke if he attempted to utter another word  they say continued luke quietly that philip was killed by the thrust of a sharp dagger or stiletto right through the neck well where is that dagger have they found it or traced it to its owner  then as colonel harris was still silent he reiterated once more  did sir thomas tell you if they had found the weapon  and colonel harris nodded and murmured  yes  actually found the weapon insisted luke  yes  where  behind the railingsin green parkclose to hyde park corner  was it a stiletto or a dagger or what  it was a stick with a dagger fitting into it a snakewood stick it was covered with mud andother stains  there was silence in the room now for the space of a few brief seconds a silence solemn and full of meaning all through this rapid succession of questions and answers between colonel harris and luke louisa had kept her eyes fixed upon the younger mans face had seen light indifference at possible danger alternating with impatience at the singular obstinacy of his accusers throughout this time the face she knew so well mirrored that perfect calm which she understood and admired since it was the reflex of a calm untroubled soul  but now there came a change in the face or rather not in the face but in the soul behind it the change came at colonel harriss last words a change so subtle so undetermined that she was quite sure her father had not perceived it but movement there was none one mere almost imperceptible quiver of the eyelidsnothing more the mouth beneath the slight fair moustache had not trembled the brow remained smooth the breath came and went as evenly as before  but the change was there nevertheless the gray tint just round the eyes the stony look in the pupils themselves a tiny speck of moisture round the wing of each nostril colonel harris had not looked at luke whilst he spoke of the stick he was staring straight in front of him hardly conscious of the silence which had cast a strange and mystic spell on these three people standing here in the banal atmosphere of a london hotel  it was luke who broke the silence he said quite quietly asking the question as if it related to a most trivial most indifferent matter  did sir thomas show you the stick  the colonel nodded in acquiescence  it was my stick i suppose  the query was so sudden so unexpected that colonel harris instinctively uttered an exclamation of amazement  luke by god man are you mad  louisa said nothing she was trying to understand the ununderstandable luke almost smiled at the other mans bewilderment  no sir he said not mad i think i only want to know how i stand  how you stand man ejaculated colonel harris with uncontrolled vehemence great heavens dont you realize that here is some damned conspiracy as mysterious as it is damnable and that you will have to look this seriously in the face if you dont wish to find yourself in the dock before the next four and twenty hours  i am replied luke simply looking the matter squarely in the face sir but i dont quite see how i can avoid standing in the dock as you say before the next four and twenty hours you see i had quarrelled with philip and my stickwhich contained a daggerwas found in the park covered with mud as you say and other stains  but hang it all man you did not murder your cousin  this was not a query but an assertion colonel harriss loyalty had not wavered but he could not contrive to keep the note of anxiety out of his voice nor did he reiterate the assertion when luke made no answer to it  once more the latter passed his hand over the back of his head you know that gesture it is so english and always denotes a certain measure of perturbation then he said with seeming irrelevance  i suppose i had better go now  his eyes sought louisas trying to read what she thought and felt imagine the awful moment for he loved her as you know with that intensity of passion of which a nature like hisalmost cramped by perpetual selfcontainmentis alone capable then to have to stand before her wondering what the next second would reveal hardly daring to exchange fear for certitude because of what that certitude might be  he sought her eyes and had no difficulty in finding them they had never wandered away from his face to himthe ardent worshipperthose eyes of hers had never seemed so exquisitely luminous he read her soul then and there as he would a book a soul full of trust and brimming over with compassion and with love colonel harris was loyal to the core he clung to his loyalty to his belief in luke as he would to a rock fearful lest he should flounder in a maze of wonderment of surmises of suspicions god help him but in louisa even loyalty was submerged in a sea of love she cared nothing about suspicions about facts about surmises she had no room in her heart for staunchness it was all submerged in love  there was no question no wonderment no puzzle in the eyes which met those of luke you see she was just a very ordinary kind of woman  all she knew was that she loved luke and all that she conveyed to him by that look was just love  only love  and loveomnipotent strange and capricious lovewrought a curious miracle then for colonel harris was present in the room mind you a thirdif not an altogether indifferentparty there where at this moment these two should have been alone  it was colonel harriss presence in the room that transformed the next instant into a wonderful miracle for luke was down on his knees before his simplesouled lou she had yielded her hand to him and he had pressed an aching forehead against the delicately perfumed palm  in face of that love which she had given him he could only worship and would have been equally ready to worship before the whole world and therein lay the miracle do you not agree you who know englishmen of that class and stamp can you conceive one of them falling on his knees save at the bidding of omnipotent love and by the miracle which makes a man forget the whole world defy the whole world give up the whole world driven to defiance to forgetfulness to selfsacrifice for the sake of the torturing exquisite moments of transcendental happiness     chapter xxiii  why all this mystery   i have often smiled myself at the recollection of luke de mountford walking that selfsame afternoon with louisa harris up and down the long avenue of the ladies mile the selfsame luke de mountford who had knelt at his lous feet in humble gratitude for the love she gave him the selfsame luke de mountford who stood under suspicion of having committed a dastardly and premeditated murder  the puppets were once more dangling on the string of convention they had readjusted their masks and sunk individuality as well as sentiment in the whirlpool of their worlds opinion  louisa had desired that luke should come with her to the park since convention forbade their looking at chrysanthemums in the temple gardens on the day that philip de mountford lay dead in the mortuary chamber of a london police court but everybody belonging to their own world would be in the park on this fine afternoon and yet the open air the fragrance of spring flowers in the formal beds would give freedom to the breath there would not reign the oppressive atmosphere of teatable gossip the early tulips bowing their stately heads would suggest aloofness and peace  and so they went together for a walk in the park for she had wished it and he would have followed her anywhere where she had bidden him to go  he walked beside her absolutely unconscious of whisperings and gossip which accompanied them at every step  i call it bad form was a very usual phrase enunciated by many a rouged lip curled up in disdain  this was hurled at louisa harris the woman in such cases always contrives to get the lions share of contempt  showing herself about with that man now i call it vulgar  they say hell be arrested directly after the inquest tomorrow i have it on unimpeachable authority  oh i understand that he has been arrested already asserted a lady whose information was always a delightful mixture of irresponsible vagueness and firm conviction  how do you mean  well you see he is only out onwhat do they call iti mean he has had to give his word that he wont run awayor something i heard herbert say something about that at lunchoh what lovely tulips i dote on that rich coppery red dont you  then does he go about in black maria escorted by a policeman  probably  this somewhat more vaguely for the surmise was doubtful  i cant understand louisa harris can you  oh she thinks its unconventional to go about with a murderer she only does it for notoriety  but the countess of flintshire who wrote novels and plays under the elegant nom de plume of maria annunziata was deeply interested in luke and louisa and stopped to talk to them for quite a considerable time she said she wanted to draw luke de mountford out so interesting to get the impressions of an actual murderer you know  the men felt uncomfortable englishmen always do when the unconventional hovers about in their neatly ordered atmosphere commonsensein their casewhispered loudly inking that this man in the sackville street clothes member of their own clubs by jove could not just be a murderer hang it all harris would not allow his daughter to go about with a murderer  so they raised their hats as they passed by louisa harris and said hello how de do to luke quite with a genial smile  but luke and louisa allowed all this world to wag on its own irresponsible way they were not fools they knew their milieu they guessed all that was being said around them and all that remained unspoken they had come here purposely in order to see and to be seen to be gossiped about to play their rôle of puppet before their world as long as life lasted and whilst chance and circumstance still chose to hold up the edifice of their own position of their consideration mayhap of their honour  the question of the crime had not been mooted between them again after the understanding the look from her to him and his humble gratitude on his knees they had left the mystery severely alone he had nothing to say and she would never question content that she would know in good time that one day she would understand what was so ununderstandable just now  colonel harris alone was prostrated with trouble not that he doubted luke but like all sobersensed englishmen he loathed a moral puzzle whilst he liked and trusted luke he hated the mystery which now met him at every turn just as much as he hated the socalled problem plays which alien critics try to foist on an unwilling anglosaxon public  he would have loved to hear lukes voice saying quite frankly  of course i did not kill my cousin i give you my word colonel that i am incapable of such a thing  that was the only grievance which the older man of the world had against the younger one the want of frankness worried him luke was innocent of course but dn it why didnt he say so  and how came that accursed stick behind the railings of the park     chapter xxiv  a herd of cackling geese   when at ten oclock the next morning louisa harris entered the victoria coroners court accompanied by her father the coroner and jury were just returning from the mortuary at the back of the building whither they had gone in order to look upon the dead  already the small room was crowded to its utmost holding capacity louisa and colonel harris had some difficulty in making their way through the groups of idlers who filled every corner of the gangway  the air was hot and heavy with the smell of the dust of ages which had gathered in the nooks and crannies of this dull and drabby room it mingled with irritating unpleasantness with the scent of opoponax or heliotrope that emanated from lace handkerchiefs and with the pungent odours of smelling salts ostentatiously held to delicate noses  louisa matteroffact commonplace louisa looked round at these unaccustomed surroundings with the same air of semiindifferent interest with which she would have viewed a secondrate local music hall had she unaccountably drifted into one through curiosity or desire  she saw a dull drabby paper on the wall and dull drabby hangings to the single window which was set very high close to the ceiling the latter once whitewashed was now covered with uneven coatings of grime  in the centre of the room a long table littered at one end with papers tied up in bundles of varying bulk with pieces of pink tape also a blotting pad pen ink and papermore paperthe one white note in the uniform harmony of drabby brown and in among this litter that encumbered the table a long piece of green baize covering a narrow formless something which louisa supposed would be revealed in due course  on each side of the table were half a dozen chairs of early victorian design upholstered in leather that had once been green to these chairs a dozen men were even now making their way each taking his seat in solemn silence men in overcoats and with velvet collars somewhat worn at the back of the neckit seemed to louisa as if they were dressed in some kind of uniform so alike did their clothes appear she looked at their faces as they filed inhaggard faces rubicund jolly faces faces which mirrored suspicion faces which revealed obstinacy the whole of middle class england personified in these typical twelve men all wearing overcoats with shabby velvet collars who were to decide today how and when philip de mountford heir presumptive to the earl of radclyffe had been done to death  louisa and her father were able at last to reach the forefront of the crowd where chairs had been reserved for them immediately facing the table at the farther end of which the coroner already sat louisa recognized mr humphreys one of mr dobsons clerks who did his best to make her and colonel harris comfortable farther on sat mr davies who had been philip de mountfords solicitor when he had first desired an interview with lord radclyffe louisa knew him by sightluke had on one occasion pointed him out to her  luke and mr dobson were even now making their way to the same group of seats they hadlike the jury and the coronerbeen in the mortuary to have a last look at the murdered man louisa thought that luke looked years older than he had done yesterday she saw him standing for a moment right against the dull drabby background of the court room wall and it seemed as if something of that drabbiness had descended upon his soul youth seemed to have gone out of him he appeared to be looking out onto a dreary world through windows obscured by grime  there was a look not so much of dejection as of absolute hopelessness in the face no fear or anxietyonly a renunciation but this was only for one moment the next he had caught sight of her and the look of blank dejection in his eyes suddenly gave place to one of acute and intolerable pain the face which usually was so calm and placid in its impassive mask of highbred indifference was almost distorted by an expression of agony which obviously had been quite beyond control  the whole thing was of course a mere flash less than a quarter of a second perhaps in duration and already luke was just as he had always been a correct wellborn english gentleman perfect in manner perfect in attitude and bearing under whatever circumstances fate might choose to place him  mr dobson spoke to him and he at once followed his friend and solicitor across the body of the court room to the row of reserved chairs in front of the crowd  a whisper went round the room and louisa with cool indifference turned to greet those among the crowd whom she had recognized as acquaintances and friends some were sitting others standing back against the walls in the rear lady ducies was there excited and overdressed with a large hat that obstructed the view of a masculinelooking woman who sat immediately behind her and who seemed quite prepared to do battle against the obstruction  farther on sat the countess of flintshire novelist and playwright eager and serious notebook in hand and a frown between her brows denoting thought and concentration of purpose she bowed gravely to louisa and contrived to attract lukes attention so that he turned toward her and she was able to note carefully in indelible pencil in a tiny notebook that a murderer about to meet his just fate may bestow an infinity of care on the niceties of his own toilet  n b the next play written by the countess of flintshire better known to the playgoing public as maria annunziata had an assassin for its principal hero but the play found no favour with actormanagers and though it subsequently enjoyed some popularity in the provinces it was never performed on the london stage  louisa looked on all these people with eyes that dwelt with strange persistency on trivial details the countess of flintshires notebook lady ducies hat the masculine attire of the militant suffragette in the rearall these minor details impressed themselves upon her memory in after years she could always recall the vision of the court room with its drabby background to a sea of ridiculous faces  for they all seemed ridiculous to herall these peoplein their obvious eager agitation they had pushed one another and jostled and fought their way into this small stuffy room the elegant ladies with their scent bottles the men about town with their silk hats and silvertopped canes they were all ready to endure acute physical discomfort for the sake of witnessing the harrowing sight of one of their own kind being pilloried before the mob it was just a pinch of spice added to the savourless condiment of everyday life then there were the others those who had come just out of idle curiosity to hear a few unpleasant details or to read a few unwholesome pages in the book of life of people who lived in a different world to their own  ridiculous they seemed all of them louisa felt a sudden desire to laugh aloud as she realized how very like a theatre the place was with its boxes its stalls and its galleries but in this case those who usually sat in stalls or boxes displaying starched shirtfronts bare shoulders and bad manners they were the actors now made to move or dance or sing to squirm or to suffer for the delectation of pit and gallery  on the left a group of young men with keen young faces all turned toward luke and toward louisa and her father notebooks protruded out of greatcoat pockets fountain pens and indelible pencils snuggled close to hand lucky the lightning artist who could sketch for the benefit of his journalistic patrons a rough outline of the gentleman with more than one foot in the dock close by a couple of boys in blue uniform with wallet at the side and smart pillbox cap on the head stood ready to take messages fractions of news hurried reports to lessfavoured mortals whose duty or desire kept them away from this scene of poignant interest  louisa saw them all as in a vivid dream never afterward could she believe that it had all been reality the coroner the jury the group of journalists the idle whispering pushing crowd the loud murmurs which now and again reached her ear  oh you may take it from me that tomorrow hell stand in the dock  such brazen indifference ive never seen  and theyve actually found the dagger with which he murdered the wretched man  brrr it makes me feel quite creepy  yes he was at your at home dear wasnt he a week ago  oh one had to ask him for forms sake you know  poor lord radclyffe what a terrible blow for him  they say hell never recover his speech or the use of his limbs  silence there  the cackling herd of geese stopped its whisperings astonished at being thus reproved louisa again felt that irrepressible desire to laugh they were so funny she thought so irresponsible these people who had come to gape at luke  now they were silent and orderly at the bidding of authority an old woman with black bonnet and rusty jacket was munching sandwiches in a corner seat a young man at the farther end of the room was sharpening a leadpencil  by the door through which a brief while ago coroner and jury also luke and mr dobson had filed outthe door which apparently gave in the direction of the mortuarya small group in shabby clothes had just entered the court room escorted by one of the ushers the latter made his way to the coroners table and whispered to that gentleman somewhat animatedly louisa could not catch what he said but she saw that the coroner suddenly lost his morose air of habitual ennui and appeared keen and greatly interested in what he heard  he gave certain instructions to the usher who beckoned to the group in the shabby clothes they advanced with timid anxious gait a world of unspoken apologies in their eyes as they surveyed the brilliant company through which they had to pass the feathers on lady ducies hat attracted the attention of one of thema young girl with round black eyes and highly decorated headgear she nudged her companion and pointed to the gargantuan hat and both the girls giggled almost hysterically  the man in front led the way he was pale and cadaverous looking with scanty hair and drooping moustache in shape he was very like a beetle with limbs markedly bowed and held away from his stooping body there were five of them altogether three women and two men louisa was interested in them vaguely wondering who they were  that they were personages of importance in this case was apparent from the fact that the usher was bringing some chairs for the women and placing them close to those on which sat the solicitors and luke and louisa herself the men were made to stand close by and remained just where they had been told to stay tweed cap in hand miserably conscious of the many pairs of eyes that were fixed upon them  who are these people do you know  lady ducies was leaning forward and had contrived to catch lukes ear  he turned round very politely  how do you do mr de mountford she continued in her shrill treble which she took no trouble to subdue you hadnt seen me had you  no lady ducies he replied i had not  i dont wonder she commented placidly you must feel so anxious who are these common people over there do you know  no i do not  some of your late cousins former associates perhaps suggested lady flintshire maria annunziata who sat close by  my dear how can you suggest such a thing retorted the other they are so common  silence there  and once more the cackling geese were still     chapter xxv  the fog was dense i couldnt rightly see   the curtain went up on the first act of the play it was not perhaps so interesting from the outset as the audience would have wished and the fashionable portion thereof showed its impatience by sundry coughings and whisperings which had to be peremptorily checked now and again by a loud  silence there and a threat to clear the court  the medical officer was giving his testimony at great length as to the cause of death technical terms were used in plenty and puzzled the elegant ladies who had come here to be amused the jury listened attentively and the coronerhimself a medical manasked several very pertinent questions  the thrust he asked of doctor blair who was medical officer of the district through the neck was effected by means of a long narrow instrument with two sharp edges a dagger in fact  a dagger or a stiletto or a skewer replied the doctor any sharp twoedged instrument would cause a wound like the one in the neck of the deceased  was death instantaneous  almost so  he explained at some length the intricacies of the human throat at the points where the murderers weapon had entered the neck of his victim louisa listened attentively every moment she expected to see the coroners hand wandering to the piece of green baize in front of him and then drawing it away disclosing a snakewood stick with silver ferrule stained and showing the rise of the dagger sheathed within the body of the stick every moment she expected to hear the query  is this the instrument which dealt the blow  but this apparently was not to be just yet the opaque veil of green baize was not to be lifted that certain long something was not to be revealed the something that would condemn luke irrevocably absolutely to disgrace and to death  only one of the members of the jurylouisa understood that he was the foremanasked a simple question  would he said the witness explain whether in his opinion thethe unknown murdererthei mean  he floundered a little in the phrase having realized that in his official capacity he must keep an open mindand in that open mind of an english juryman there could for the present dwell no certainty that a murdereran unknown murdererdid exist  they were all herehe and the others and the coronerin order to find out if there had been a murder committed or not  the coroner one elbow on the table one large hand holding firmly the somewhat fleshy chin looked at the juryman somewhat contemptuously  you mean he queried with an obvious effort at patience  i mean resumed the man more firmly in this present instance would a certain medical or anatomical knowledge be necessary in order to strikeeror to thrustso preciselyjust on the right spot to cause immediate death  with amiable condescension the coroner put the query to the witness in more concise words  no no replied the doctor quickly now that he had understood the question the thrust argues no special anatomical knowledge most laymen would know that if you pierce the throat from ear to ear suffocation is bound to ensue it was easily enough done  when the deceaseds head was turned away asked the coroner  why yesto look out on the fog perhaps or at a passerby it would be fairly easy if the wouldbe murderer was quick and determined and the victim unsuspecting  and doctor blair with long tapering fingers pointed toward his own throat giving illustration of how easily the deed might be done  given the requisite weapon of course  after a few more courteous questions of a technical kind the first witness was dismissedonly momentarily for he would be required againwhen the green baize would be lifted from the hidden something which lay there ready to hand and the medical man be asked to pronounce finally whether indeed the dagger stick was the requisite weapon for the deed which had been so easy of accomplishment  the chauffeur who had driven the taxicab was the next witness called a thickset man in dark blue melton coat and peaked cap he came forward with that swinging gait which betrayed the excoachman  he gave his evidence well and to the point he had been hailed on the night in question by two gentlemen in evening dress it was in shaftesbury avenue just opposite the lyric theatre and a little while after he had heard st martins church clock strike nine oclock the fog was so dense he added you could not see your hand before your eyes  he had just put down at the apollo and had crossed over to the left going down toward piccadilly when the two swells hailed him from the curb he couldnt rightly see them because of the fog but he noticed that both wore high hats and the collars of their overcoats ware turned up to their ears he hardly saw their faces but he noticed that one of them carried a walking stick  or it might ave been a umbrella he added after a moments hesitation i couldnt rightly say  you must have seen the faces of your fares argued the coroner if you saw that one of them carried a walking stickor an umbrella you must have seen something of their faces he reiterated more emphatically  i didnt retorted the man gruffly was you out in that there fog sir if you was youd know ow you couldnt see your and before your eyes i saw the point of the stickor the umbrella i couldnt rightly say whichonly because one of them gents waved it at me when e was ailing methats ow i seed the point  the coroner allowed the question of identification to drop clearly nothing would be got out of the man the gentlemen he declared entered the cab and then one of them gave directions to him putting his head out of the right hand window  i didnt turn to look at im he said bluntly i could ear is voice plain enoughso why should i take a look at im ow did i know there was a goin to be murder done in my cab and me wanted to say what the murderer looked like  he looked round the room defiantly as if expecting applause for this display of sound commonsense opposed to the coroners tiresome officialism  and what directions asked the latter did the gentleman give you  to go along piccadilly replied the witness till e told me to stop  and when did he tell you to stop  by the railings of green park just by yde park corner one of em puts is ead out of the window and calls to me to pull up  which you did  which i did and one of em gets out and standin on the curb e leans back to the interior of the cab and says slongsee you tomorrow and then e says to me no 1 cromwell road and disappears in the fog  surely you saw him then  no the fog was like pea soup there though it looked clearer on knightsbridge away and e got out left side of course i was up on my box right and sidea long way from im i could see a man standin there but not is face is at was pulled down right over is eyes and is coat collar up to is ears  had he his stickor umbrellawith him then  yes with is ands in is pockets and the tip pointing upward like a soldiers bayonet  you saw that and not his face once more insisted the coroner making a final effort to draw some more definite statement out of the man it would help justice so much if only this witness were less obstinate no one would believe that he really saw nothing of the face of the man who had twice spoken to him he may not have seen it clearly not the upper part of the face perhaps but surely he saw the mouth that had actually framed the words  but the chauffeur was obstinate he was not going to swear away the life of a man whom he had not rightly seen only through a fog as thick as pea soup this was the fortress behind which after awhile he entrenched himself  in vain did the coroner pleased at having gained this slight advantage try to draw him further explaining to him with the quiet patience of a man moved by official ambition that far from jeopardizing the life of any man he might be saving that of an innocent one falsely accused through circumstantial evidence in vain did he press and argue the man was obstinate after a very long while only and when the coroner had almost given up arguing and crossexamining he admitted that he did think that the gentleman who directed him to no 1 cromwell road had a moustache  but mind he added hurriedly i wont swear to it for i didnt rightly seethe fog was that dense in the park and e wasnt the same as the one oo told me to go along piccadilly until e stopped me the dead man done that  how do you know came as a quick retort from the coroner since you declare you could not see the faces  the first gent oo spoke to me replied the chauffeur somewhat sullenly now ad no air on is face the second one i think adbut i cant rightly say i wouldnt swear to neither and i wont swear he reiterated with gruff emphasis  a sigh went round the room a tremor of excitement the palpitation of many hearts and indrawing of many breaths no one spoke no one framed the thought that was uppermost in the mind of every one of the interested spectators of this strange and ununderstandable drama the dead man who lay in the mortuary chamber was cleanshaved but luke de mountford wore a moustache  lady ducies feathers nodded in the direction of the literary countess who went by the name of maria annunziata and the latter made hasty notes in her diminutive book  but louisa leaned slightly forward so as to catch fuller sight of luke and she encountered his eyes fixed steadily upon her  after that the driver of the cab concluded his evidence more rapidly there was little more there than what every one had already learned from the newspapers the second pulling up in cromwell road this time the silent fare the descent from the box the discovery of the huddled figure in the far corner of the cab the call for the police  people listened with less attention thoughts were busy with the contemplation of a picture two men one cleanshavedthe dead man of courseand the other wearing a moustache the first link in the chain of evidence against the assassin had been forged and was ready to be rivetted to the next  the crowd in the body of the court could only obtain a view of the top of luke de mountfords head it was smooth and fair of that english fairness of tint which is golden when the light catches it and the group of elegantly dressed women who came here today in order to experience an altogether novel sensation shuddered with delightful excitement as they thought of black maria and handcuffs and crowds of police officers in blue a jumble of impressions ran riot in frivolous and irresponsible minds foremost amongst which was one that the public was not longer allowed to witness a final scene on the gallows     chapter xxvi  the next witness please   the air grew more and more heavy as the morning dragged on it was now close on twelve oclock  frederick power hall porter of the veterans club had finished his evidence with the precision of a soldier he had replied curtly and to the point to every question put to him and had retold all that had occurred on that foggy night in the smoking room and the lobby of the veterans club in shaftesbury avenue  it was but a repetition of what he had told sir thomas ryder in colonel harriss presence the day before louisa had had it all at full length from her father she had drawn the whole story out of him point by point just as the man had told it originally colonel harris reluctant to tell her was gradually driven to concealing nothing from her moreover since she had made up her mind to attend the inquest she might as well hear it all from him first the better to be prepared for the public ordeal  though she knew it all she listened attentively to every word which frederick power uttered lest her father hadin telling heromitted some important detail she heard again at full length the account of lukes visit to the veterans club his desire to see philip de mountford the interview in the smoking room behind closed doors the angry words of obvious violent quarrelling  then lukes return to the lobby his departure the final taunt spoken by philip and the look of murder in his eye sworn to by the hall porter she listened to it all and heard without flinching the last question which the coroner put to the witness  did mr de mountfords visitor carry a stick when he left the club  e ad a stick sir when e came was the porters reply and i anded it to im myself when e left  louisa had been sitting all this while at the extreme end of the row of chairs right up against the wall she sat with her back to the wall her head leaning against it her hands hidden within the folds of a monumental sable muff lying idly in her lap she had her father on her right and beyond him mr dobson and his clerk she saw them all in profile as they looked straight before them at the coroner and at each succeeding witness  luke sat farther on and as he was slightly turned toward her she could watch his face all the while that she listened to the hall porters evidence it was perfectly still the features as if moulded in wax the eyes which actually were a clear hazel appeared quite dark and almost as if they had sunk back within their circling lids he sat with arms folded and not a muscle in face or body moved no stonecarved image could have been more calm none could have been so mysterious  louisa tried to understand and could not she watched him not caring whether the emptyheaded fools who sat all round saw her watching him or not  when the coroner asked the hall porter about the stick and the man gave his reply luke turned and met louisas fixed gaze the marblelike stillness of his face remained unchanged only the eyes seemed as if they darkened visibly at least to her it seemed as if a velvety shadow crept over them an inscrutable an ununderstandable shadow and the rims assumed a purple hue  it was her fancy of course but lukes eyes were naturally bright of varying tones of gray blue or green with never a shadow beneath them now they appeared cavernous and dark and again as he met her gaze that swift flash of intense misery  no longer had she the feeling that she was living in a dream no longer that this was a theatre wherein she and luke and the dead man were puppets dancing and squirming for the benefit of shallowhearted dolts that sense of unreality left her together with the hysterical desire to laugh which had plagued her so in the earlier part of the proceedings on the contrary now an overwhelming feeling of intense reality oppressed her so that she could have screamed with the awful soul agony which the sight of lukes misery had caused her  all her nerves were on the rack her every faculty concentrated on the one supreme desire to understand and to know  love the omnipotent had encountered an enemygrim unexplained mysteryand he sat pondering almost cowed by this first check to his supreme might louisa had sought and compelled lukes gaze and love had gleamed in one great flash out of her eyes yesterday at her glance he had knelt at her feet and buried his sorrow with his aching head in the scented palm of the dearly loved hand  today the look of love brought but a surfeit of misery an additional load of sorrow the eyes in response remained tearless and hard and circled with the dark rings of utter hopelessness  ill grant you that if louisa harris had been an extraordinary woman a woman endowed with a wonderfully complex wonderfully passionate or wonderfully emotional natureif in fact she had been the true product of this centurys morbid modernityshe would whilst admitting lukes guilt have burned with a passion of selfsacrifice pining to stand beside him pilloried in the dock and looking forward to a veritable world of idealistic realism in the form of a picturesque suicide after seeing the black flag hoisted over newgate prison  but louisa though a modern product of an ultramodern world was an absolutely ordinary womanjust a commonplace sensible creature who thought and felt in a straight and essentially wholesome manner though she had read tolstoi and dostoyefsky and every scandinavian and russian crackbrain who has ever tried to make wrong seem right black appear white and animalism masquerade as love yet she had never been led away from her own clean outlook on life  she loved luke and would have givendid in fact giveher whole life to him but she loved him without analysis or thought of self it never entered her mind at this moment to wonder if he were guilty or not guilty if he was capable or not of committing a crime to gain his own ends all that troubled her was his misery which she would have given her very soul to alleviate and the hopelessness in him which she had given the world to console  the mystery troubled her not the sin the marblelike rigidity of his face not the possibility of the crime  for the moment however she was brought back quickly enough to present realities the coronersatisfied with frederick powers answerswas giving him a moments breathing space the grating of fountain pens against paper was heard from that corner of the room where sat the journalists the crowd waited silent and expectant forunversed though most people there present were in proceedings of this kindyet instinctively every one felt that one great crucial moment was just about to come one great leading question was just about to be put  the coroner had fingered the papers before him for the space of a few seconds then he looked up once more at the witness his elbow resting on the table his fleshy chin buried in his hand in an attitude which obviously was habitual to him  this visitor he said speaking loudly and clearly who called the night before last at the veterans club and had an interview with the deceased you saw him well of course  yes sir was the prompt reply  you would know him again  certainly sir  looking round this room now should you say that he was present  the man looked across the room straight at luke and said pointing to him  yes sir the gentleman sitting there sir  as every one had expected the reply no one seemed astonished the many pairs of eyes that turned on luke now expressed a certain measure of horrified compassion such as might be bestowed on some dangerous animal brought to earth by a wellaimed gun shot  the coroner made no comment he turned to the jury glancing along either row of solemn faces on both sides of the long table then he said  would any of you gentlemen like to ask this witness a question  receiving no reply he added  next witness please     chapter xxvii  and people went out to luncheon   and now it was luke de mountfords turn at last a wave of excitement swept over the crowd every neck was craned forward every eye fixed on this next witness as he rose from his seat and with courteous words of apology to those whom he disturbed in passing made his way to the centre table  an absolute embodiment of modern london society luke stood there facing the crowd the coroner and jury as he would have faced friends and acquaintances in the grand stand at ascot or in the stalls of a west end theatre there are hundreds and thousands of young englishmen who look exactly as luke de mountford looked that morning dress is almost a uniform in cut style and degree of tone hair and even features are essentially typical luke de mountford wellborn wellbred behaved just as eton and oxford had taught him to behave concealing every emotion raising neither voice nor gesture an englishman of that type has alternately been dubbed hypocritical and unemotional he is neither he is only conventional luke himself facing the most abnormal condition of life that could assail any man of his class was so absolutely drilled into this semblance of placidity that it cost him no effort to restrain himself and none to face the forest of inquisitive eyes levelled at him from every side and since there was no effort the outward calm appeared perfectly natural an actor who has played one part two hundred times and more does so night after night until the role itself becomes reality and he in ordinary everyday life seems even to himself strange and unnatural  now luke was given the bible to kiss and told to take the oath from where he stood he could see louisa and a number of faces turned toward him in undisguised curiosity mocking eyes and contemptuous eyes eyes of indifference and of horror met his own as with quick glance they swept right over the crowd  i dont think that he really saw any one except louisa no living person existed for him at this moment except louisa hypocritical or unemotional naturewhich none could say none would take the trouble to probe all that the crowd saw was a man to all intents and purposes accused of a horrible murder confronted at every turn with undeniable proofs of his guilt and yet standing there just as if he were witnessing the first act of some rather dull play  hypocrisy or effrontery were the two alternatives which the idle and the curious weighed whilst anticipating the joy of seeing the mask torn from this wooden image before them  the coroner was asking the witness his name and luke de mountfords voice was quite steady as he gave reply  you were continued the coroner until quite recently and are again now heirpresumptive to the earl of radclyffe  it was supposed at one time replied luke that besides myself there was no other heir to my uncles title  deceased i understand arrived in england about six months ago  so i understand  he made claim to be the only son of lord radclyffes brother  that is so  and to all appearances was able to substantiate this claim in the eyes of lord radclyffe  apparently  so much so that lord radclyffe immediately accorded him that position in his household which you had previously occupied  lord radclyffe accorded to the deceased the position which he thought fitting that he should occupy  you know that the servants in lord radclyffes household have informed the police that in consequence of mr philip de mountfords advent in the house you and your brother and sister had to leave it  my brother sister and i now live at fairfax mansions exhibition road said luke evasively  and the relations between yourself and the deceased have remained of a very strained nature i understand  of an indifferent nature corrected luke  there was a pause so far these twothe coroner and the witnesshad seemed almost like two antagonists going through the first passes of a duel with foils steel had struck against steel curt answers had followed brief questions now the combatants paused to draw breath one of them was fighting the preliminary skirmish for his life against odds that were bound to overwhelm him in the end the other was just a paid official indifferent to the victim interested only in the issue the man standing at the foot of the table was certainly interesting the coroner had made up his mind that he was the guilty partya gentleman and yet a cowardly assassin he amused himself during this brief pause with a quick analysis of the highbred impassive facequite saxon in character fair and somewhat heavy of lidin no way remarkable save for the present total lack of expression there was neither indifference nor bravado neither fear remorse nor defianceonly a mask made of wood hiding every line of the mouth and not allowing even the eyes to show any signs of vitality  beyond that the whole appearance was essentially english the fair hair neatly groomed with just a suspicion of curl here and there and a glint of gold in the high lights the stiff neck encased in its immaculate collar the perfectly tailored clothes the hands large but wellformed and carefully tended which lightly interlaced hung in marblelike stillness before him  when a man happens to be out in midwinter with a stout stick in his hand and he comes across a layer of ice on the top of a pool or a trough of water he alwaysor nearly alwaysis at once a prey to the silly desire to break that layer of ice the desire is irresistible and the point of the stick at once goes to work on the smooth surface chipping it if not actually succeeding in breaking it  the same desire exists in a far stronger degree when the ice is a moral oneone that covers the real nature of another man the cold impassiveness that hides the secret orchard to which no one but the owner has access then there is an irresistible longing to break that cold barrier to look within and to probe that hidden soul if not within its innermost depths at any rate below the icebound surface to chip it to mark it and break its invincible crust  some such feeling undoubtedly stirred at the back of the coroners mind the hidebound redtaperidden official was more moved than he would have cared to admit by a sense of irritation at the placidity of this witness who was even now almost on his trial therefore he had paused in his questionings afraid lest that sense of irritation should carry him beyond the proper limits of his own powers  and now he resumed more quietly with his voice less trenchant and his own manner outwardly more indifferent  when he asked did you last see the deceased  in the lobby of the veterans club replied luke the night before last  you had called there to see him  yes  for what purpose  to discuss certain family matters  you preferred to discuss these family matters at a club rather than in your cousins own home  yes  why  for private reasons of my own  it would help this inquiry if you would state these private reasons  they have no bearing upon the present issue  you refuse to state them insisted the coroner  i do  the coroner was silent for a moment it almost seemed as if he meant to press the point at first then thought differently for after that brief while he merely said  very well  then he resumed  now mr de mountford on the night in question you say you went to see the deceased at the veterans club you were i understand shown into the smoking room  yes was the simple answer  your cousin was in the room  yes  alone  alone  and how long did your interview with him last  about an hour or less perhaps  was it of an amicable character  this question was identical to the one already put to luke on the actual night of the crime by the detective charged to elucidate its mysteries and lukes reply was identical to his former one  of an indifferent character he replied  there was no quarrel between you and the deceased gentleman  our interview was of a private nature rejoined luke with unalterable calm  but other witnesses retorted the coroner sharply heard angry voices issuing from the smoking room  that no doubt is for those other witnesses to say  you deny then that you quarrelled with the deceased on the night when he was murdered  i deny nothing i am not on my trial i presume  again a pause the coroner closed his eyes and stroked his heavy chin he had not yet succeeded in chipping the smooth surface of the ice  at what precise hour then did you last see the deceased alive he asked allowing his voice once more to appear harsh and his manner more peremptory  at nine oclock or thereabouts the night before last  where was that  he was in the lobby of the veterans club and i just outside  he made certain remarks to the hall porter at that moment which offended you very deeply i understand  mr philip de mountford was not always guarded in his speech when he spoke to servants  and his remarks offended you  my opinion on this point is of no consequence i imagine  you then left the door step of the veterans club and a moment later the deceased joined you in the street  i finally left the club soon after nine but i did not again see mr philip de mountford alive  the deceased suggested that you should come with him then and there to see lord radclyffe at grosvenor square he hailed a taxicab and you entered it with him insisted the coroner with sudden slow emphasis  i last saw mr philip de mountford alive in the lobby of the veterans club reiterated luke calmly soon after nine oclock  he overtook you in the street outside the club  it is not true  and hailed a cab  he may have done so but not in my company  you entered the cab with him and he told the driver to follow along piccadilly  he may have done so once more reiterated luke in the same calm and even voice but not in my company  you parted from him in the lobby of the club  i have told you so  and you never saw him again after that  never  you were not with him when he came out of the club  no  when he hailed a taxicab  no  you were not with him when he entered the cab and put his head out of the window telling the driver to go along piccadilly until he was stopped  no  the answers had come clear sharp and distinct quick ripostes of the foils against the violent attack now the adversary drew breath the pause was dramatic in its effect farreaching in its significance the coroner with eyes steadily fixed on the witness made a quick movement with his hand he drew away the long narrow strip of green baize in front of him revealing a snakewood stick with ferrule stained and tarnished  is this your stick he asked curtly  it is my stick replied luke  he had not flinched yet there were many scores of pairs of eyes fixed upon him when that green baize covering was removed but not one of those who gazed so steadily upon him could boast that he or she had seen the slightest tremor of the lids or the merest quiver of the mouth the voice sounded perfectly clear the cheeks though pale had assumed no grayish hue  very well that will do said the coroner quietly  what more was there to say the daggerstick stained and rusty told the most graphic tale there was to tell yet luke de mountford stepped quietly away from the table looking neither selfconscious nor dazed he went back to his seat beside mr dobson and leaning toward him answered some whispered questions which the solicitor was putting to him he folded his arms before him and after awhile allowed his head to fall forward a little closing his eyes as he did so he seemed a little tired but otherwise unperturbed even though the hall porter now was recalled and was busy identifying the stick which lay across the coroners table with the one which he himself had handed to mr de mountfords visitor at nine oclock the night before last  and the police too added its share to this work that was going on of enmeshing a criminal there was the constable who had found the stick inside the railings of green park and had taken it straight away to his chiefs at scotland yard before the stains on it had been further disturbed and there was finally doctor blair the district medical officer also recalled who examined the dagger which fitted into that snakewood stick  he had been shown it yesterday it seems and found how accurately it fitted the wound in the murdered mans throat to this he swore now in open court for the coup de théâtre the production of the daggerstick had been kept back until now in order that it should work its fullest and most dramatic effect  colonel harris sitting near his daughter would have given worlds to know what she thought he himself did not know what to think his simple unsophisticated mind was in a maze the question of lukes possible guilt had suddenly loomed up before him dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship and loyalty mr dobson too looked puzzled the old family solicitor who had seen luke and his brothers and sister grow up who a few hours nay minutes ago would have sworn to his clients innocence before the entire world he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt  not one other person in the room either believe me who was not convinced of lukes guilt louisa knew that well enough as her aching eyes wandered over the sea of faces meeting hollow compassion morbid curiosity at best a certain sympathetic horror in the glances round she knew that every one here the officials the jury the police the public believed that luke struck his cousin in the dark she knew that mr dobson had begun to doubt and that her father had begun to fear  and she with all the fervour of unconquered love prayed in her heart that she might understand she prayed to love to open the eyes of her mind for it was her reason which did not understand which yearned to understand  her heart cared nothing cared for nothing except for the man she loved and the bitter bitter sorrow which he endured alone shut away from all even from her  there was general stir in the court room the coroner had risen also the jury the journalists were holding agitated parlance with the boy messengers louisalike one who had received a sharp blow on the headwondered what all this stir meant  was it all over had luke irretrievably lost himself in that secret orchard of his into which he was obviously determined that even she should not enter  then she found out that the stir only meant the luncheon hour all these people were going to eat and to chatter heavens above how they would chatter  her father said something about getting a cab and trying to find a decent hotel in which to have luncheon but she scarcely heard she had just seen luke disappearing through the crowd in company with mr dobson and he had not even glanced back to look at her  every one whispered round her lady ducies nodding feathers worried her almost to distraction she allowed her father to lead her away and to make way for her through the crowd  presently she found herself sitting near him in a cab he was silent and would not look at her he had begun to think that luke had killed his cousin once she heard him repeating the word damnable twice under his breath thus she knew that his loyalty was on the point of giving way  it seems that they had luncheon somewhere together she did not take the trouble to inquire where she was an oldfashioned hotel somewhere in kensington with tablecloths that looked as if they had been used for several previous luncheons and foreign waiters who wore weirdlooking shoes and trousers frayed at the edges  to please her father she ate a little though she thought that eating must choke her but it was wearisome to argue and hepoor dearlooked so miserable  time was precious and luncheon interminably slow it was past two oclock when louisa saw luke again in the court room     chapter xxviii  which tells of an unexpected turn of events   it seems that coroner and jury had not spent quite so much time over luncheon as the more or less interested spectators when the crowd began to file back again into the seats the coroner had already examined and dismissed one witness and was questioning another  the past and present servants of the grosvenor square household would all have to pass before the coroner during the course of this long afternoon it was only two oclock and already the gas had to be lightedtwo incandescent burners just above the coroners tablehard uncompromising lights that threw a sickly green tinge on every face and cast deep black shadows under every eye  it was this light no doubt that made lukes face seem positively ghastly to louisa it looked almost like a deathmask so deep and cavernous did the eyes appear and so hollow the cheeks he was sitting in his usual attitude with arms folded between mr dobson and one of the women in seedy black whose presence here had puzzled every one  old parker exbutler to lord radclyffe was giving evidence he had a tale to tell how mr de mountford went on awful when hethe innocent welldrilled servanthad thought it his duty to introduce mr philip into his lordships presence  just think of it your honour he exclaimed his lordships rightful heir  then he added with calm effrontery  mr luke e give me the sack then and there he was that wild  just a paltry silly meaningless revenge the deathmask on lukes face relaxed for a moment when he looked on the fat creature standing before the jury vainly trying to look pompous and selfrighteous and only succeeding in being a liar  the evidence would have been of little worth but for the corroboration from other servants of the grosvenor square household the present twoman and wifewastrels and drunkards counted for nothing they had only entered lord radclyffes service recently when all visitors had ceased from calling at the inhospitable house and they had seen little or nothing of luke but the othersthose whom philips arbitrary temper had driven out of the housethey had many a tale to tell of the dead mans arrogance his contemptuous treatment of his younger kinsman and the bitter words that often flew between the cousins when doors closed and eavesdroppers were behind the keyholes  these witnessesan exhousekeeper a footman a maidwere trying their best poor things to do the right thing by mr luke little guessing how ill they succeeded they had been dragged into this much against their will as a class they hated the police and its doings even though the cook might occasionally show a preference for the local guardian of peace and order as for the detective in plain clothes the man who wore a peaked cap instead of the familiar helmet him they hated and feared especially since he seemed to mean mischief for mr luke  they gave their evidence unwillingly every admission had to be dragged out of them once they realized that the revelations of past quarrels between the gentlemen would not be to the detriment of the dead only perhaps to the undoing of the living  the hours wore on wearily the atmosphere now surcharged with the heat from the gas brackets had become intolerably oppressive opoponax and white heliotrope waxed faint to the nostrils through the badly fitting window frame something of the outward fog had penetrated into the room it hung about in the air round the gas that burned yellow and dim through it and obscured the far corners of the place throwing a veil over the twelve mutes in uniform overcoats with threadbare velvet collars over the eager and perspiring journalists whose fountain pens had scraped the paper incessantly for so long  hot tired and oppressed humanity made its warm breath felt in the close illventilated room smellingsalts would not dispel the unpleasantly mingling odours of damp clothes and muddy boots which rose from the plebeian crowd in the rear  but nobody stirred no one would have thought of leaving before the last act of this interesting play the chief actor was not on the stage for the moment but his presence was felt it was magnetic in its appeal to excitement every question put by the coroner every reply given by the witnesses had as it were luke de mountford for its aim every word tended toward him his undoing the enmeshing of his denials in the close web of circumstantial evidence  then a diversion occurred  the man in the shabby clothes who looked like a beetle and who had marshalled his companions into the court room early in the day was called upon by the usher to come forward his strange poorlyclad figure detached itself from the groups immediately round him his long loose limbs seeming to swing themselves forward  his four companionsthe three women and the other manwere seized apparently with great agitation and whispered eagerly among themselves no one in the crowd could guess why these people had been called they seemed so completely out of the picture which had its invisible frame in grosvenor square  go on jim whispered one of the young women they cant do nothing to ye  and the beetlelike creature shambled forward with arms gangling beside him a humble apologetic look on his careworn face he might have been any age from thirty to sixty time and a perpetual struggle for existence had wiped way all traces of actual age the cheeks were hollow and eyes mouth and moustache had a droop which added to the settled melancholy of the face  he was obviously very nervous and looked across at his own friends who strove to encourage him by signs and whispers  he nearly dropped the bible when it was handed to him and no one could really hear the oath which he repeated mechanically at the ushers bidding  at last he mustered up a sufficient amount of courage to state his name and address  james baker he said in answer to the coroners question bricklayer by trade  and where do you live  at 147 clapham junction road sir replied the man scarcely above a whisper  speak up please admonished the coroner the jury cant hear you you came here i understand prepared to make a statement  yes sir  of what nature  the man shifted his position from one leg to the other heavy beads of perspiration stood out on his pallid forehead  go on jim dont be afeeard came from the body of the court  silence there commanded the usher  i wished to say sir resumed the man trying to steady his voice that the deceased whom i saw lying in the coffin yonder is my own son paul baker sir  your son  my son sir asserted the man somewhat more steadily my son and is mothers as is sitting over there my son paul baker as left ome two year ago come next christmas we all come ere sir today me and is mother and sister an smith an janewe all come ere to swear to im  your son  the exclamation once more came from the coroner but had any one else dared that exclamation would have been echoed and reëchoed by every mouth in the court room coupled with emphatic ejaculations of incredulity  it was as if in a new castle of some grim sleeping monster a magic wand had touched every somnolent spirit smelling salts and scented handkerchiefs were forgotten the jurymen leaned forward half across the table oblivious of their own dignity in their endeavour to obtain a fuller view of this wielder of the magic wand the beetlelike creature with the sad eyes and pale hollow cheeks even the reportersaccustomed to sensational eventsgave up scribbling in order to stare openmouthed at the shabby figure standing by the table  at first of course the predominant sensation was one of sweeping incredulity coroner and jury had met here today in this stuffy room in order to conduct an inquiry on the death of philip de mountford heir presumptive to the earldom of radclyffe the crowd of fashionable and idle gapers had pushed and jostled in order to hear the ugly story of how wealth and position are fought for and intrigued for even at the cost of crime  and now to think that the man who lay dead was just a bricklayers son it was absolutely incredible not till a few moments later did the spectators realize that if the seedy man at the table spoke truly then they were witnessing a drama even more poignant than that of the original murder a drama of deception and of fraud and a mystery far deeper than that which had originally confronted the sensation mongers  strangely enough incredulity died down and died down very quickly a subtle wave filled the murky atmosphere compelling every mind to belief long before the mans assertions were proved to be correct the most indifferent became conscious of an overwhelming conviction that the witness was speaking the truth  this conviction was absolutely paramount in the minds of the chief actors in the play to them all to colonel harris and to louisa to mr dobson and the solicitors the truth of the statement was never in question an unerring instinct forced them to believe and such beliefs are as unconquerable as they are overwhelming truth that is an absolute unquestionable truth finds its way to the mind when the latter is attuned to subtle or psychic impressions  and as the truth was borne in upon these people so did they realize the fulness of its meaning the deep significance of its portent  to some of them it seemed as if in a brilliantly illuminated world all the lights had suddenly been extinguished to others as if in a dark and intricate cavern full of black impenetrable shadows dazzling lights had been suddenly switched on  louisa looking across at luke saw that to him it meant the latter and that some of the new dazzling light had illumined the darkness of his soul  something of the tense rigidity of his attitude had gone from him not the sorrow perhaps but the blank hopelessness of a misery that flounders in a sea of the unknown     chapter xxix  the world is so large   as for the man who had made the extraordinary assertion he seemed quite unconscious of the effect which it had produced as if the fact that the supposed heir to an earldom being actually the son of a clapham bricklayer was one that found its natural place in everyday life  he had his cap in his handa shabby gray tweed capand he was twirling it between his fingers round and round with an irritatingly nervous gesture his eyes now and again were furtively raised at the coroner as if he were wondering anxiously what punishment would be meted out to him for having created so much commotion and then with equal furtiveness he dropped them again his shoulders were bowed and his knees parted company from each other thus giving him more than ever the appearance of a beetle  of course the coroner had to recover his official manner as quickly as possible but even to him the statement had come as a surprise he had only known very vaguely that a witness had come forward at the eleventh hour having only just had time to communicate with the police before the opening of the inquest  in view of the importance of the evidence the witness was called as soon as possible what he had to say would materially affect the whole trend of the inquiry he had it seems brought others with himmembers of his own family among themin order that they might corroborate the truth of what he said  quite a minute or so had elapsed in the meanwhile then at last was the coroner able to resume with at least a semblance of official indifference  now he said let the jury understand a little more clearly what you said just now  what i said rejoined the man vaguely  yes what you said let us understand it clearly you went to the mortuary this morning and saw the body of the deceased  yes sir  and you state here on oath that in the deceased you recognized your own son  ill swear to im replied the witness simply ask is mother there  and with a long thin finger generously edged with grime he pointed to the woman in seedy black hat and shabby tweed jacket who sat quite close to luke de mountford  never mind about his mother just now admonished the coroner we want your statement first you realize that you are on oath  yes sir ive sworn my bible oath  and you understand the importance of an oath  yes sir  and you swear that the body of the murdered man whom you saw in the mortuary chamber this morning is that of your son  i swear to that sir  i believe that had coroner and jury and practically every man there present dared to put their thoughts into words at that moment the ejaculation well i am blowed or im dd as the case might bewould have been generally heard throughout the room the women on the other hand were far too excited even to think  now resumed the coroner tell the jury please when you first identified the deceased as your son  this morning sir  in the mortuary chamber  yes sir  you had not seen the body before  no sir  did you know that other witnesses have sworn that the body is that of a gentleman called philip de mountford  yes sir i knew that  then do you mean to assert that those other witnesses have sworn false oaths  oh no sir rejoined james baker with an apologetic smile of selfdeprecation i wouldnt say such a thing sir  well then  they was mistaken sir thats all paul was that clever sir ask is mother there  and once more the lean and grimy finger pointed to the seedylooking matron who nodded a melancholy head half in pride half in regret  clever did you say asked the coroner more briskly now at last he held a thread in this extraordinary tangled skein then do you mean to assert that your sonpaul bakerwent about the world calling himself philip de mountford  that must ave been it sir i think  deceiving people  aye e was ever a bit o no good  you think he imposed upon his lordship the earl of radclyffe  e must ave done sir mustnt e now seein as ow is lordship must ave been took in  you helped him in the deception i suppose  me sir lor bless ye no me an is mother aint clever enough for such things we knew nothin of pauls doins and e allus went is own way sir  but at least you knew that this fraud was going on  not exactly sir  how do you mean not exactly retorted the coroner sharply you seem to be unconscious of the fact that this story which you are telling the jury is a very serious matter indeed if it is true you are not only making a grave accusation against your dead son but with this accusation you may be involving yourself or some other member of your family in an exceedingly serious charge of fraud the penalty for which if proved would be very severe indeed on the other hand if the story you tell is nothing but a cockandbull tale which further evidence would presently demolish then you lay yourself open to a charge of perjury and of conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice i have thought best to give you this word of warningthe last which you will get from mebecause really you do not seem to be fully conscious of the extreme gravity of your position  the bricklayer from clapham had listened to this admonition delivered with solemn emphasis and no small measure of severity with a kind of stolid indifference he retained his humble apologetic attitude but clearly the coroners threats did not affect his simple equanimity  i thank you sir kindly he said when the coroner had ceased speaking but i cant elp it paul would go on is own way ask is mother there e never would be spoken to wouldnt paul and me and is mother allus said ed come to mischief some day  did you know anything at all of this fraud  no sir we knew nothin of it really you see paul left ome nearly two year ago come christmas e didnt tell us nothing  then you last saw your son alive two years ago  yes sir thats the last me and is mother seed of im christmas day sir twas two year ago nearly paul e said then ed ad enough of knockin about in london e was goin abroad e was thats what e said and e left ome sir the next day bank oliday twere and thats the last me and is mother seed of im  he had told this with all the simple fatalism peculiar to his class the son went abroad and abroad to a clapham labourer is a very vague term indeed it means so many things geographically it means any place beyond a twelvemile radius from home the antipodes are abroad but so is yorkshire domestically it means that the traveller passes out of the existence of those that are left behind as surely as if he had stepped into the grave financially it means a mouth less to feed seeing that the intending traveller is nearly always a wastrel at home in any event the proposed journey abroad is taken with quiet philosophy by family and friends the traveller starts for abroad as easily as simply as he would for the nearest public house he has no impedimenta nothing to burden him or to cause him regret strangely enough no one ever has any idea where the money comes from that pays for the journey abroad the traveller being a wastrel never has any himself and the family is invariably too poor to provide it but the wastrel goes nevertheless  and life within the narrowed precincts of the family circle goes on just as it had done before sometimes news comes from the travellera picture postcard from abroad usually a request for pecuniary assistance seldom does good news arrive still more seldom does the traveller come back home  but it is all very simple nothing to make a fuss about  then said the coroner he didnt tell you where he meant to go  no sir replied jim baker he just was going abroad  do you know where he went  no sir  did you ever try to find out  no sir where ad been the use  where indeed the world is so large and the baker family so insignificant  he didnt write to you  no sir  nor communicate with you in any way  no sir  you had no idea what had become of him  not until last summer sir  what happened then  his sister sir our emily she was out walkin with harry smithyoung smith from next door to us sirand she was down in the west end o london with im one day and oo should they meet sir but paul  did they speak to him  yes sir they says ello paul we didnt know as ow you was ome and e seemed upset like at first and pretended e didnt know em and that theyd made a mistake but they chaffed im and went on talkin so i suppose paul e thought it best to make a clean breast of it all  do you mean to say that he told his sister and his friend that he was carrying on a criminal fraud against the earl of radclyffe  oh no sir not all that e only told em that e was in for a good thing a gentlemans gentleman e told em e was and doin well for hisself e said e would come and see the famlye meant me and is mother sirsome day soon but e never come  did he say where he was living  yes sir e gave is address to emily up ampstead way it were a long way sir me and is mother never seemed to ave the time to go and look im up but emily she went with young smith one sunday but they never found the street not where paul said e was livin there werent no such street in ampstead sir  and you never thought of making further inquiries  no sir this again with that quiet philosophy the stolid fatalism peculiar to those who live from day to day from hand to mouth who have neither leisure nor desire to peer outside the very circumscribed limits of their own hearths  you never made any effort to know more about what your son was doing or how he was living suggested the coroner who though accustomed to this same quiet philosophy in men and women of that class was nevertheless strangely moved in this instance by the expression of a fatalism that carried in its train such extraordinary consequences  but jim baker mildly astonished at the coroners insistence over so obvious a matter explained meekly  we knew that paul was doin well you see sir e was that splendidly dressed when emily and young smith seed im they was quite respectful like to im so we knew e was all right  and you never troubled any further about your son  we didnt want to interfere with im sir gentlemen dont allus like their servants to be aving visitors or to obnob with poor people like us  more calm philosophy not unmixed with a delicate sense of pride this time and a sublime if unconscious vein of selflessness  well rejoined the coroner not unkindly this timethe man who looked so like a beetle who was so humble and apologetic compelled quite a certain amount of regardwell leave that matter for the moment mr baker now will you tell the jury what made you come to this court today what led you to think that the man who had been murdered in a cab the night before last and of whom all the newspapers spoke as mr philip de mountfordwhat made you think that he was your son  jim baker by way of a reply plunged one of his thin hands in the pocket of his shabby coat and drew out a portion of very grimy newspaper carefully folded up quite small he undid the folds until his eyes lighted on that which they sought then he held the paper out toward the coroner and pointed to a picture sandwiched in among the letterpress  i saw this he said in the daily graphic yesterday its the picture of paul i says to myself  the coroner took the paper from the witness and laid it down on the table glancing at it casually there had been innumerable portraits of the murdered man published both in the morning and the evening papers of yesterday  its paul to the life insisted jim baker i was at my work you understand when i seed the paper in one o the other chaps ands i couldnt give up my work then i ad to wait till evenin to speak to my missus then we talked it all over and young smith e took a day off and me too and mrs baker and emily and jane smith they all come along  and you looked on the face of the dead man and you swear that it is your son  i take my oath sir ask is mother there she knows er own son shell tell you just what vaccination marks e ad on is arm and about the scar on is leg and all the ladies sir they are that sharp  jim bakerfeeling no doubt that his ordeal was nearly overwas losing his nervousness or perhaps it took a new form that of jocularity the coroner thought it best to check his efforts at humour in the bud  that will do he said curtly  and the clapham bricklayer at once retired within his shell of humble selfdeprecation he answered a few more questions that the coroner put to him but clearly his own circle of vision was so circumscribed that willing as he undoubtedly was he could throw no light whatever on the unknown events which led up to the extraordinary fraud practised on the earl of radclyffe and which culminated in the mysterious murder in the taxicab  the father of the strangely enigmatic personality who indeed had taken many a secret with him to the grave was far too indifferent too fatalistic to put forth any theory as to his sons motives or the inducements and temptations which had first given birth to the astoundingly clever deception  wearied and impatient at last the coroner gave up his questionings he turned to the jury with the accustomed formula  would any of you gentlemen like to ask this witness any questions  the foreman of the jury wanted to know if the witnesss son had any birthmarks on him or other palpable means of identification  yes sir replied jim baker but is motherll tell you bettern meshe knows bestabout the vaccination marks and all  the foreman then asked the coroner whether the jury would be allowed to identify the marks on being assured by the coroner that after adjournment this very day every means would be taken to corroborate jim bakers statement the jury seemed satisfied  and the corner called the next witness     chapter xxx  and then every one went home   though the hour was getting late no one among the crowd thought of leaving the court even the desire for tea so peculiarly insistent at a certain hour of the day in the whole of the british race was smothered beneath the wave of intense excitement which swept right over every one  although the next witnesseswho each in their turn came forward to the foot of the tableswore to tell the truth and faced the coroner with more or less assurance they could but repeat the assertions of the head of the family nevertheless the public seemed ready to listen with untiring patience to the story which went to prove that the man whom everybody believed to be the heir of one of the oldest titles and richest rentrolls in england was the son of a clapham bricklayer a master of audacity and of fraud  the mothera worthy and simple soulwas the first to explain that paul her only son had always been something of a gentleman he had done very well at school and never done a stroke of work like is father when he was fifteen he was quite stagestruck always playacting as the mother put it and could recite poetry beautiful  mrs baker seemed distinctly proud of her sons deeply rooted horror of work she thought that all the instincts of a gentleman were really in him when he was a grown lad he went as footman in a gentlemans family somewhere in the midlands the mother loftily supposed that it was there that paul learned his good manners  he was a perfect gentleman sir she reiterated complacently  it appeared too that the wastrel had had a period in his career when the call of the stage proved quite irresistible for he seemed to have left the gentlemans family in the midlands somewhat abruptly and walked on as super for a time in the various melodramas produced at the grand theatre nottingham whenever a crowd was required on the stage there seems also to have existed a legend in the heart of the fond mother and of the doting sister that paul had once really played a big part in a serious play but this statement was distinctly wanting in corroboration  what was obviously an established fact was that the man had a certain spirit of adventure in him and that he had been a regular rolling stone a regular idle goodfornothing wastrel possessing a certain charm of manner which delighted his family and which was readily mistaken by the simple folk for that of a gentleman  they were all called in turn the sister and young smith from next door and the latters sister not one of them swerved for a moment from the original story told by jim baker emily and young smith told of the meeting which occurred on a fine summers afternoon between themselves and paul by the strange caprice of wanton coincidence the meeting occurred inside green park paul seemed a little worried thinking that the passersby would see him talking to poor people like us as emily baker had it although she added proudly i ad me new at on with the pink roses otherwise he was quite pleasant and not at all offand  the account of this interview was fully corroborated by young smith from next door jane smith who at one time had considered herself engaged to paul baker had a few tender reminiscences to recount she had seen the prodigal once on the boards of the queens theatre lewisham and she declared that he looked a perfect gentleman  the day wore on or rather the commencement of evening the evilsmelling fog from outside had made its home inside the dismal room people there only saw one another through a misty veil the corners of the room were wrapped in gloom exciting as was the story which had been unfolded this afternoon one or two among the audience had given way to sleep lady ducies feathers nodded ominously and the old dame who had munched sandwiches was inclined to give forth an occasional snore  louisas eyes were aching constant watching had tired them they even ceased to see clearly her brain too had become somnolent she was tired of hearing these people talk from the moment that jim baker had stated that the murdered man was his own son louisa had known that he had spoken the truth instinct was guiding her toward the truth showing her the truth wherever possible she listened at firstdeeply interestedto the scrappy evidence which told of paul bakers early life but the family from clapham junction road had marvellously little to relate they no more understood their adventurousspirited son than they would have been capable of aiding and abetting the fraud which he concocted  they themselves were far too simple and too stupid to be dangerously criminal and so the evidence quickly lost its interest for louisa she herself with the fragmentary statements which she heard could more easily surmise the life history of paul baker than could the doting mother who retailed complacently every mark on the skin and on the body of her son and knew nothing whateverless than nothingof his thoughts his schemes of the evil that was in him and the ambition which led to his end  and now the last of the baker contingent was dismissed jane smith the sweetheart of the murdered man was the last to leave the coroners table she did so in a flood of tears in which the others promptly and incontinently joined  the coroner somewhat impatient with them all for their vague notions on the most important bearings of the case had severely tried him adjourned the inquiry until the morrow  he ordered the jury to be present at a quarter before ten and gave the signal for general withdrawal  after which every one went home     chapter xxxi  and there are people who do not care   for the first time in the whole course of her life louisa harris felt that convention must be flouted and social duties could not be fulfilled  when the coroner rising from his seat gave the signal for general exodus she had felt her fathers firm hand grasping her arm and leading her out of the fogridden stuffy room into the cold gray passages outside  the herd of cackling geese were crowding round her heavens above how they cackled and gossiped it seemed as if the very floodgates of a noisy bubbling stream had been torn asunder and a whirlpool of chattering women been let loose upon the earth  convention grim and untractable tried to pull the string to make all puppets dance but for once louisa harris rebelled she closed her ears to insinuating calls from her friends responding with a mere curt nod to the most gushing oh miss harris how are you which greeted her from every side  she turned her back resolutely on convention the slave for once rebelled against the taskmaster the puppet refused to dance to the everwearying monotonous tune  she had lost sight of luke the moment the court rose she supposed that his solicitor mr dobson knowing the ropes had got him away from the reach of cackling geese by leading him through some other more private way but she was far too dazed too numb either to wonder or to be disappointed at this she felt as if she had pitched head foremost down a long flight of stairs and had only just had sufficient strength to pick herself up and not to let other people see quite how severely she had been bruised  mentally morally even physically she felt bruised from head to foot  colonel harris contrived to steer her through the crowd at the gate outside even the smokeladen atmosphere seemed pure and invigorating in comparison with that stuffy pen wherein the herd of cackling geese had found its happy hunting ground louisa drew in a long breath filling her lungs with fog but feeling a little freer less choked in spite of the grime which she inhaled  i think said colonel harris now that youd better go straight back to the langham and get some tea youll feel better when youve had your tea  i feel all right dear she said trying to smile  so much the better he retorted with an equal effort at cheerfulness ill come along as soon as i can  where are you off to dear she asked  ill just go and have a talk to tom he replied  ill come with you i can wait in the cab i dont suppose that youll be long  he tried to protest but obviously she had made up her mind perhaps she did not like the idea of going back to the hotel alone so he hailed a passing cab and told the man to drive to scotland yard  he had deliberatelyand despite former prejudicesselected a taxicab he wanted to see tom as soon as was possible  louisa leaned back in the corner of the vehicle silent and motionless father and daughter did not exchange a single word whilst the cab rattled through the crowded streets of london hansoms omnibuses innumerable other taxis rattled along the selfsame way just as they had always done before this just as they would go on doing to the end of time people walked along busy and indifferent many went past the shrieking news vendors without even stopping to buy a paper  luke stood accused almost selfconvicted of a horrible crime and there were thousands nay millions of people who didnt even care  the taxicab flew past the railings of the green park there where another taxicab had drawn up a couple of evenings ago and where a snakewood stick marked with telltale stains had been found clumsily buried in the mud louisa peered out of the window of the cab people walked past that spot indifferent and busy two girls were standing close to the railings chatting and giggling  and luke tomorrow or perhaps tonight would be under arrestcharged with murderhorrible cruel brutal murdera vulgar cowardly crime the snakewood stick had told a tale which he had not attempted to refute  presently the cab drew up and colonel harris jumped down  i wont be longer than i can help he said will you be all right  yes father dear she replied ill be all right dont hurry  she saw her father disappearing through the wide open door above which a globe of light shone yellow through the fog she remained huddled up in her furs for she felt very cold her feet were like ice and the fog seemed to have penetrated to her very marrow few people were to be seen in the narrow roadway and only an occasional cab rattled past  from the embankment close by came the cry of news vendors rushing along with late editions of the evening papers  a church clock not far away slowly struck six but she held no count of time a kind of drowsiness was upon her and the foggy atmosphere coupled with intense damp cold acted as a kind of soporific  she may have waited years or only a few minutes she did not know but presently her father came back his presence there under the lintel of the door seemed to have roused her from her torpor as if with a swift telepathic current as he stood for a moment beneath the electric light adjusting the collar of his coat she saw his face quite distinctly its expression told her everything lukes arrest was imminent it was but a question of a few hours moments perhaps  i am going to exhibition road at once he said speaking quickly like a man deeply troubled  and without waiting for her assent which was a foregone conclusion he gave the chauffeur the address fairfax mansions exhibition road and added drive as fast as you can  then he jumped in beside louisa the taxicab moaned and groaned whilst it manœuvred for turning then it rattled off once more at prohibited speed  it is she said simply only a question of time i suppose  the warrant is out he replied curtly any moment now the police may be at his door  uncle ryder is convinced of lukes guilt  absolutely  beyond that what does he say  that unless luke chooses to make a bolt of it he had better plead guilty and intense provocation but he thinks luke would be wise to catch the night boat for calais  theyd get him back on extradition  tom says they wont try very hard and if luke keeps his wits about him and has a sufficiency of money hell be able to get right through to spain and from thence to tangiers with money and influence much can be done and tom says that if luke will only get away tonight he himself is prepared to take all the blame and all the responsibility of having allowed a criminal to escape its very decent of tom added the colonel thoughtfully for he risks his entire future  but the sorely troubled father did not tell his daughter all that sir thomas had told him in the course of the brief interview  in effect the chief of the criminal investigation department had given a brief alternative by way of advice  a ticket to anywhere via calais at onceor a revolver  and he had added dryly  i see nothing else for it the man has practically confessed  but this colonel harris would not admit and so the two men parted louisas father thinking a great deal of his friend but still more of his daughter wanted above all things to have a final talk with luke  louisa in the meanwhile sat silent in the corner of the cab  she was trying to visualize this new picture lukea fugitive from justice  the taxicab was making a slight detour as whitehall and the mall were closed for road repairs the chauffeur was driving round by st martins lane at one of the theatres there a popular play was filling the house night after night with enthusiastic crowds it was only half past six now and in a long queue extending over two hundred yards away from the pit and gallery doors of the lucky playhouse patient crowds waited for the evenings pleasure  people were going to theatres they laughed at farces and wept at tragedies was there ever such a tragedy enacted inside a theatre as now took place in the life of a commonplace man and woman  lukea fugitive from justice money and influence could do much they could enable a wealthy criminal to escape the consequences of his own crime they could enable him to catch express trains unmolested to fly across land and sea under cover of the night to become cainlike a wanderer on the face of the earth without rest and without peace  could they prevent him from seeing ever present at his elbow the grim angel of remorse holding in one hand the glass wherein relentlessly flowed the sands of time and in the other the invisible sword of a retarded but none the less sure vengeance could they prevent his hearing the one word nemesis  lukea fugitive from justice accused of a crime which he did not commit selfconvicted almost selfaccused and fleeing from its consequences as he would from remorse  and people went to theatres and laughed and cried people ate and danced and sang news vendors shrieked their wares the latest sensational news the gentleman criminal who had money and influence and with their help evaded the grip of justice     chapter xxxii  a man must act as he thinks best   louisa knew the flat in exhibition road very well she had helped edie to furnish it and to make it pretty and cosey for edies passion was for dogs and for golf drawingroom chairs and saucepans were not much in her line so louisa had chosen practically everythingthe piano as well as the coalscuttles and every stick of furniture in lukes room  tonight she went up the wellknown stairs very slowly she ached so in every limb that she could scarcely walk she seemed to have aged twenty years in two days  edie was sitting alone in the pretty drawing room buried in a capacious armchair her hands folded before her the room was in darkness save for the glow of the firelight she jumped up when colonel harris and louisa were announced and the neat servant in black dress and smart cap and apron switched on the electric light  oh said poor little edie impetuously i am so thankful youve come  she ran up to louisa and put her arms round her kissing her  do come and sit with me she continued loath to relinquish colonel harriss hand after she had shaken it i feel that in this solitude i shall go dotty  whilst she spoke she detached with nervous febrile movements louisas fur from round her neck and dragged the older woman nearer to herself and to the fire then she threw herself down on the hearth rug squatting there in front of the fire with nervy fingers picking at the fringe of the rug her cheeks were red and blotchy with traces of recent tears her hair towzled and damp clung to her moist temples suddenly she burst into a torrent of weeping  oh lou what does it all mean she exclaimed between heavy sobs what does it all mean they say luke has murdered that odious philip and i have been cooped up here for two days now not daring to go out ashamed to face any one and lukelukeoh  the outburst was almost hysterical the young girl was obviously fearfully overwrought and had endured a severe nervestrain by not having the means of giving vent to her feelings colonel harris with all an englishmans horror of feminine scenes was clearing his throat looking supremely uncomfortable all the time  shsh admonished louisa impatiently be quiet edie you mustnt go on like that be quiet now she added more severely seeing that the girl made no effort to control herself what will your servants think  do you suppose retorted edie that i care what they think they cant think more can they when they all talk of luke as if he were a murderer  do for gods sake be silent edie this is too awful  and louisa almost roughly dragged herself away from the girls hysterical embrace she had tried so hard for two days and two nights to keep herself together and her nerves in check all day today had been one long continuous battle against the danger of breaking down that bugbear of the conventional woman of the world  now this danger backed up by this poor childs grief loomed greater than ever nownowthat breaking down would become a positive sin the most abject form of cowardice but edies bewilderment her loneliness were intensely pathetic louisa had tried to be severe and insisted on checking the access of hysteria but her heart went out to the child and to her puzzlement in face of this awful ununderstandable riddle  look here edie she said gently putting her own kind arms round the quaking shoulders of the younger girl you are just going to show father and me how brave you can be you are lukes nearest and dearest one on earth you must not add to his troubles by this exaggerated show of grief well all have to be braveall of usbut luke will have to be the bravest of us all and so we must all do our best to keep up our courage and help his own  she was not accustomed to making such long speeches nor yet to preach and to admonish life before now had never placed her in the necessity of admonishing others everybody round herthe people with whom she came in contact always behaved very much as they shouldin the proper conventional worldly manner people she had hitherto to do with did not give way to hysterical tears nor had they occasion to display fortitude in the face of an overwhelming moral shock  therefore louisa was not sure if her words would carry weight or if they would produce the effect she desired she gazed anxiously at edie whilst she spoke looking with hopeful yet fearful eyes in the poor girls face wondering if she had succeeded in calming the hysterical outburst  edie hung her head wilfully veiling her eyes beneath the drooping lids she twirled her gossamer handkerchief into a tight wet ball and toyed with it nervously  its not much good she said at last in very low tones so that louisa had some difficulty in hearing what she said my trying to be bravewhen luke is such a coward  be quiet edie retorted louisa all her kindness and sympathy gone and pushing the girl roughly away from her you have no right to talk like that  well colonel harris rejoined edie turning to the man in her distress i ask you if it isnt just cowardice to run away now and leave me and jim to face the whole thing alone  to run away what do you mean demanded louisa placing her hand on the girls shoulder forcing her to turn round and to face her  whos running away queried colonel harris with a frown  luke said edie hotly is running away he came home just now and calmly told me that he was going off abroad tonight and since then he has been shut up in his room packing his things i have been all alone here all day jim wont be home till late tonight poor old jim what a fearful homecoming it will be for him  but to this renewal of edies lamentations louisa had not listened only to the words luke said that he was going abroad tonight  lukefugitive from justice the monstrous unbelievable picture which she had tried to visualize just now had become a mirror reflecting awful hideous reality  wheres luke asked the colonel id better see him  no father interposed louisa quickly id sooner speak to luke can i go to him edie  yes i think so replied the other i dont suppose that he has locked his door  louisa said her father gently i dont think youll be doing any good dear a man must act as he thinks best  im not she replied going to interfere with lukes plans i only want to speak to him dont bother edie i know my way     chapter xxxiii  if you would only let yourself go   luke was sitting at a desk writing when louisa entered his room only one lamp shaded with yellow silk hung above the desk throwing golden light on paper and blotting pad and on the hand which held the pen  when luke turned at the sound of the opening door his face remained in deep shadow he could not of course see her distinctly as her figure was silhouetted against the light in the passage behind her that was no doubt the reason why he did not rise to greet her when she entered but remained seated at his desk  may i come in luke she asked  certainly he replied i was just writing to you  then give me your unfinished letter and tell me what else you were going to write  oh i had only got as far as your name he said pointing to the empty page before him  was it so difficult then she asked to tell me everything  she had come forward into the room and stood beside his desk one hand resting upon it her face looking down at the letter which he had not yet begun to write he still made no attempt to rise for now her face was in full golden light and he could see its every feature  it is so difficult he said not to write drivel when one is saying goodbye  you are going away she asked  yes  tonight  in half an hour  you are going abroad  certainly  why  this last question came abruptly in harsh trenchant tones altogether different to those of her smooth contralto voice he turned his eyes away from her face and looked down at his own hands which were clasped in front of him  because he replied without the slightest hesitation i cannot face what lies before me if i remain  why not  for many reasons theres uncle rad to consider first and foremost then edie and jim and frank  what have they to do with it  everything after the evidence at the inquest today a warrant will be out for my arrest within the next few hours  what of it  the evidence against me is overwhelming i should be tried perhaps hanged for murder at best sent to penal servitude for life i cannot chance that i must think of uncle rad of edie of jim and of frank  you have yourself to think of first and foremost  well he retorted simply i have thought of myself and i do not see how with my own daggerstick brought up in evidence against me and my illfeeling towardtoward the dead man so wellknown i can possibly escape condemnation  he spoke in such even and perfectly natural tones that just for a momentit was a mere flashlouisa wondered if he were absolutely sane it seemed impossible that any man could preserve such calm in face of the most appalling fate that ever threatened human being she too like the indifferent hidebound official this afternoon was seized with an irrepressible desire to break through that surface of ice the outer covering must be very thin she thought her presence must have melted all the coldness that lay immediately below the surface without saying another word quietly and simply she came down on her knees her skirts had not swished as she did so not a sound from her revealed the movement when he looked up again her face was on a level with his and her eyesthose great luminous eyes that shed no tears at moments such as thislooked straight into his own  for pitys sake lou he said dont make a drivelling coward of me now  and he rose pushing his chair aside leaving her there kneeling beside the desk humbled and helpless and he retreated within the shadow of the room  luke she said imploring him you are going to tell me all that troubles you  nothing he replied curtly troubles me you are wasting your sympathy you know and i have a train to catch  you are not going luke  indeed i am  you condemn yourself for a crime which you have not committed  i am already as good as condemned but i do not choose to hang for the murder of the clapham bricklayers son  he laughed it almost sounded like a natural laughwould have done so no doubt to all ears except hers then he added dryly  such a purposeless crime too fancy being hanged for killing paul baker  luke she said simply you dont seem to realize how you are hurting me  one ejaculation my god escaped him then he stood quite still in the shadow and presently his hand wandered with the old familiar gesture down the smooth back of his head she remained on her knees and after awhile he came back to her and sat down on the chair beside the desk his eyes on a level with hers  look here lou he said quietly i have got to go and thats all about it i have got to do you understand the consequences of this crime cannot be facednot by any onenot by me theres uncle rad to think of first he is broken and ill he has more than one foot in the grave the trial and the scandal couldnt be kept from him it would be bound to leak out sooner or later it would be too big a scandal and it would kill him outright then you see lou it would never do i should be earl of radclyffe and a felonit wouldnt do now would it who has ever heard of a peer undergoing a life sentenceor being hanged it wouldnt doyou know it wouldnt do  he reiterated this several times with quaint insistence as if he were discussing with her the possibility or impossibility of attending a race meeting or a ball in lent she proving obstinate  she did not reply leaving him to ramble on in his somewhat wild speech hoping that if she let him talk on uninterruptedly he would sooner or later betray something of that enigma which lay hidden behind the wooden mask which he still so persistently wore  besides he continued still arguing theres frank to think ofthe next heir to the title i believe that people in penal servitude live an unconscionable timeespecially if they are wanted to die think of poor old frank waiting to come into his owninto an old title held by a felon it is all much too much of a muddle lou it is simpler that i should go  but she said really trying now to speak as simply as calmly as he did himself all these arguments which you are using now luke will equally apply if you make yourself a fugitive from justice  oh i shouldnt be that for very long he said lightly  you are thinking of suicide  no he replied simply i am not only of the chances of a wandering life  you seem to look at every chance luke except one  which one is that  that though you might be arrested though you might be accused and even tried for the murder ofof that mantruth might come out and your innocence proved  that would be impossible lou he said quietly  whyin heavens name luke she exclaimed passionately why  my daggerstick was found inside the railings of the parkand the stains on it are irrefutable proofs  thats only circumstantial evidence she argued you can demolish it if you choose  i cannot he replied i should plead guiltymr dobson says that if i plead guilty counsel can plead extenuating circumstancesintense provocation and so forthand i might get a more lenient sentence  luke she said looking him straight in the face compelling his eyes to meet hers for in their clear depths she meant to read the truth to compel the truth at last he had never lied in his life if he lied now she would know it she would read it in his face luke you are shielding some one by taking the crime on your own shoulders  but his eyes remained perfectly clear and steady as they gazed straight into hers there was not a shadow in them not a quiver as he replied quietly  no lou i am shielding no one  it was you who killed that manphilip de mountfordor paul bakerwhoever he may be  and he answered her firmly looking steadily into her face  it was i  she said nothing more then but rose to her feet and went quite close up to him with a gesture that had no thought of passion in it only sublime motherly love she took lukes head in both her hands and pressed it to her heart  my poor old luke she murmured  she smoothed his hair as a mother does to an afflicted child the motherly instinct was up in arms now even fighting the womanly the passionate instinct of a less selfless love she bent down and kissed his forehead  luke she said gently it would do you such a lot of good if you would only let yourself go  he had contrived to get hold of her hands those hands which he loved so dearly with their soft rosetinted palms and the scent of sweet peas which clung to them his own hot fingers closed on those small hands she stood before him tall elegantnot beautiful louisa harris had never been beautiful nor yet a fairy princess of romanceonly a commonplace woman a woman of the world over whose graceful form her personality even convention invariably threw her mantlebut a woman for all thatwith a passion burning beneath the crust of worldly sangfroidwith heart attuned to feel every quiver every sensation of joy and of pain a woman who loved with every fibre in herwho had the supreme gift of merging self in loveof giving all her soul her heart her mind and every thoughta woman who roused every chord of passion in a mans heartthe woman whom men adore  and now as luke de mountford held her hands and she stood close beside him her breath coming and going in quick gasps with the suppressed excitement of latent selfsacrifice her eyes glowing and tearless he half slid from the chair on which he was sitting and one knee was on the ground and his face turned up to hers  he almost smiled as she repeated with a little sigh  if you would only let yourself go  if i would let myself dwindle down to the level of drivelling fools he said god knows lou it would be easy enough now when i hold those lovely little hands of yours and the scent of sweet peas which comes from your dear self reminds me of summer of oldfashioned gardens of enduring peace lou i dare not even kiss your hands and yet my whole body aches with the longing to press my lips on them you see how easily i drift into being a drivelling fool would to god i could lie on the ground here before you and feel the soles of your feet on my neck how lucky slaves were in olden days werent they they could kneel before their mistress and she would place her naked foot upon their necks i am a drivelling fool you seei talk and talk and let the moments slip byi am going lou and this is the vision which i am taking with me the last impression which will dwell in my memory when memory itself will seem only a dream you lou standing just here so close to me that your sweet breath fans my cheek your dear hands in mine the scent of sweet peas in my nostrils the light of this lamp throws a golden radiance over you your lips are quiveringoh ever so slightly and your eyes reveal to me the exquisiteness of your soul lou i am a lucky mortal to have such a vision on which to let my memory dwell  she listened in silence enjoying the delight of hearing him unburdening his soul at last his love for her never had it seemed so great and so pure now that he spoke of parting and there was a quaint joy in hearing him thus rambling onhe the reserved man of the world convention had so often sealed his lips and restrained his passion when he was still wandering happily with her on the smooth paths of love now fate had hurled stone upon stone down that path the way was rugged and difficult parting too was close at hand all the restraint of past months tore at the barrier of convention luke about to lose the mortal presence of his love allowed his lips to say that which he had hidden in his heart for so long the man of the world lost himself in the man who loved  when he had ceased speaking she said quietly  you talk luke as if we were going to part  tonight lou i must catch the night boat to calais  my luggage can be sent on she rejoined simply i am quite ready to start  to start he repeated vaguely  why yes luke she replied with a smile if you go tonight or at any time i go with you  you cannot lou he stammered almost stupidly feeling quite bewildered for he had been forcibly dragged back from a happy dreamlike state to one of impossible reality  why not  you have said it yourself lou i shall be a fugitive from justice    a man with whom no decent woman would care to link her fate  let us admit then she said almost gaily that i am not a decent woman for my fate is irretrievably linked with yours  this is preposterous    he began  but already she had interrupted him speaking quietly in that even contralto voice of hers which he loved to hear  luke she said you must try and understand you must because i have so fully made up my mind that nothing that you could say would make me change it unless you told me that you no longer loved me and this she added with the ghost of a smile you cannot now pretend luke after all that you said just now it is not that my mind wanted making up my mind has very little to do with it all it knows just as my heart does that i could not now live without you im not talking nonsense luke and i seem to be too old for mere sentimental twaddle therefore when i say that i could not now live parted from you i say it from the innermost conviction of my heart shshdear she whispered seeing that he wished to interrupt her dont try and say anything just yetnot just yetuntil i have told you everything i want you to remember luke that i am no longer very young and that ever since i can remember anything i have loved you i must have loved you even though i did not know it but if you had never spoken of love to me if you had never written that letter which i received in brussels i probably would have been satisfied to go on with my humdrum life to the end of time who knows i might have found contentment if not happiness by and by with some other man we women are meant to marry men are fond of telling us that our only mission on earth is to marry but all this possible quiet content one letter has dissipated i could never be happy now never save in continuing to love you life to me would be unspeakably hideous without you and your love therefore i say luke that you have no longer any right to keep me at arms length you have no right having once come into my life having once given substance and vitality to my love to withdraw yourself away from me love dear is a bond a mutual bond as sacred as binding as any that are contracted on this earth youwhen you wrote that letter when first you spoke to me of loveentered into a bond with me you have no right to force me to break it  the mellow tones of her contralto voice died down in the heavy atmosphere of the room they echoed and reechoed in the heart of the man who was now kneeling before louisa as he would before the madonna dumb with the intensity of emotion which her simple words the sublime selflessness of her sacrifice had brought to an almost maddening pitch she stood there near him so devoted so noble and so pure do you wonder or will you smile when you see him with fair young head bowed to the ground pressing his lips on the point of her shoe  luke dont she cried in passionate sympathy  she understood him so well you see  kiss your feet dear he asked i would lie down in the dust for your dear feet to walk over me i only wonder why god should love me so that he gave you for this one beautiful moment to me lou my dearest saint i cannot accept your sacrifice dear heart dear dear heart do try and believe me when i say that i cannot accept it as for imagining that i dont understand it and appreciate it why as soon think that tomorrows sun will never rise i worship you my saint and i worship your lovethe purest most tender sentiment that ever glorified this ugly world but its sacrifice i cannot accept i cannot i would sooner do that most cowardly of all deeds end my life here and now than be tempted for one single instant into the cowardice of accepting it but the memory of it dear that i will take with me do not think of me in future as being unhappy no man can be unhappy whose heart is fed on such a memory  he had her two hands imprisoned in his the scent of sweet peas floating gently to his nostrils as he buried his lips in their fragrant soft palms he was entirely happy the world had floated away from him he was in a land of magic with her in a land where the air was filled with the fragrance of sweet peas a land of phantasmagoria the land of fata morgana which none can enter save those who love time sped on and both had forgotten the world the fire crackled in the hearth the clock alone recorded the passing of time the noise of the great cityso cruel to those who suffercame but as faint echo through the closely drawn curtains  there was a discreet knock at the door and as no reply came from within it was repeated more insistently  luke jumped to his feet and louisa retreated into the shadow  come in said luke  the door was opened quite softly from outside and the welldrilled servant said  two gentlemen to see you sir  where are they mary he asked  in the hall sir  did they give their names  no sir  wheres miss edie mary  in the drawing room sir with colonel harris  very well then show the two gentlemen into the diningroom ill come in a moment  very good sir  and the discreet little maid retired closing the door after her     chapter xxxiv  which speaks only of farewells   the door had scarcely closed and already she was near him  luke she whispered and her voice was hoarse now and choked the police  thats about it he said i thought that they meant to let me get away  so father understood from sir thomas ryder what will you do luke  i cant do anything i am afraid i wanted to get away  and i have kept youand now it is too late  a very little while ago she had hated the idea of his going lukea fugitive from justicewas a picture on which it was intolerable to look but now the womanly instinct rose up in revolt at the very thought that he should be arrested tried and condemned what mattered if he were a fugitive if he were ostracized and despised what mattered anything so long as he lived and she could be near him a very little while ago she would have done anything to keep him from going she almost longed for his arrest and the publicity of the trial she was so sure that truth would surely come out that his innocence would of necessity be proved  but now womanlike she only longed for his safety and forgetting all the tradition of her past life all the old lessons of selfrestraint forgetting everything except his immediate danger she clung to him with all the true passion in her which she no longer tried to keep in check  no luke she murmured in quick jerky tones it is not too latenot at all too late you stay in here quietly and ill ask father to go and speak to them hell tell them that you havent come home yet and that he is waiting here for you himself father is well known they wont suspect him of shielding you and in the meanwhile you can slip out easily well send your luggage on you can write and let us know where you areit is quite easyand not too late  whilst she spoke she was gradually edging toward the door her voice had sunk to a hoarse whisper for maddening terror almost deprived her of speech with insistent strength she would not allow him to detain her and he whilst trying to hold her back was afraid of hurting her but at the last when she had almost reached the door he contrived to forestall her and before she could guess his purpose he had pressed a finger on the button of the electric bell  she heard the distant tinkle of the bell and this made her pause  what is it luke she asked why did you ring  for your father dear he replied simply  then you will do what i want you to she rejoined eagerly you will go away  he gave no immediate answer for already the maids footstep was heard along the passage the next moment she was knocking at the door luke went up to it gently forcing louisa back into the shadow behind him  mary he said with his hand on the latch of the door holding it slightly ajar just ask colonel harris to come here will you  yes sir  the girl was heard turning away and walking back briskly along the passage then luke faced louisa once again  he went up to her and without a word took her in his arms it was a supreme farewell and she knew it she felt it in the quiver of agony which went right through him as he pressed her so closeso close that her breath nearly left her body and her heart seemed to stand still she felt it in the sweet sad pain of the burning kisses with which he covered her face her eyes her hair her mouth it was the final passionate embrace the irrevocable linking of soul and heart and mind the parting of earthly bodies the union of immortal souls it was the end of all things earthly the beginning of things eternal  she understood and her resistance vanished all that had been dark to her became suddenly transfigured and illumined with the merging of earthly passion into that love which is gods breath shethe pure and selfless woman gods most perfect work on earthbecame as god and knew what was good and what had been evil  neither of them spoke the word farewell was not uttered between them his final kiss was upon her eyes and she closed them after that the better to imprint on her memory the vision of his face lit up with the divine fire of an unconquerable passion  the entrance of colonel harris brought them both back to present reality he poor man looked severely troubled and distinctly older than he usually did  did you want me luke he asked  yes sir replied the latter the police are here and i thought that perhaps you and louisa would be so kind as to take edie along with you jim is going to sleep in barracks tonight and edie ought not to stay here alone  yes well take edie said the colonel curtly shell be all right with us are you ready lou  yes dear she replied  and she passed out of the door without another word or another look  the supreme farewell had been spoken further wordseven another kisswould have almost desecrated its undying memory  the two men remained alone and colonel harris without any hesitation held out his hand to luke de mountford  the police are here sir said luke without taking the hand that was offered him  i know they are muttered the other thats no reason why you should refuse an old friends hand  then as lukehesitating no longerplaced his burning hand in that of his friend colonel harris said quietly almost entreatingly  its only a temporary trouble eh my boy you can easily refute this abominable charge and prove your innocence  i think not sir replied luke i cannot refute the charge and my innocence will be difficult to prove  but you are mad man retorted the older man hotly you are mad and are breaking a womans heart  heaven forgive me for that sir it is the greatest crime  colonel harris smothered a powerful oath lukes attitude puzzled him more and more and his loyalty had received such a succession of shocks today that it would have been small wonder if it had begun to totter at last  he turned away without another word but at the door he paused once morein obvious hesitation  theres nothing else i can do for you he asked  nothing sir thank you  youyou were not thinkingof  of what sir asked luke  then as he saw the other mans eyes wandering to the drawer of the desk he said simply  of suicide you mean sir  colonel harris nodded  oh no rejoined luke and he added after a slight pause not at present  what do you mean by that  i mean that i shouldnt exactly hang for the murder of the clapham bricklayer i shouldnt let it come to that i am sorry i did not manage to get away tonight i thought they meant to let me  i think they did mean to some blunder i suppose on the part of the subordinates  i suppose so  well luke said colonel harris with a deep sigh i have known you ever since you were a child but by gd man i confess that i dont understand you  thats very kindly put sir rejoined luke with the semblance of a smile you have every right to call me a confounded blackguard  i shall only do that after your trial my boy said the other when i have heard you confess with your own lips that you killed that dd scoundrel in a moment of intense provocation  i had better not keep the police waiting any longer sir had i  no no thats all right ill take my poor lou away at once and well see after edie and jimwell look after themand frank too when he comes home  thank you sir  slong my boy  and colonel harrispuzzled worried and miserablefinally went out of the room on the threshold he turned moved by the simple and primitive instinct of wishing to take a last look at a friend  he saw luke standing there in the full light of the electric lamp calm quite serene correct to the last in attitude and bearing the face was just a maskmarblelike and impassivejealously guarding the secrets of the soul within just a goodlooking wellbred young englishman in fact who looked in his elegant attire ready to start off for some social function  not a single trace either on his person or in his neat orderly surroundings of the appalling tragedy which would have broken the spirit of any human creature less wellschooled in selfrestraint  convention was triumphant to the end  the man of the worldthe english gentleman hypocritical or unemotional whichwas here ready to face abject humiliation and hopeless disgrace as impassively as he would have received the welcome of an hostess at a dinnerparty     chapter xxxv  which tells of pictures in the fire   it did not take poor little edie very long to get her things on and to make ready to go away with colonel harris and with louisa something of the truth had to be told to her and we must do her the justice to state that when she understood the full strength of the calamity which had befallen her and luke something of her brothers calm dignity showed itself in her own demeanour  she pulled herself together with remarkable vigour and before mary the maid she contrived to behave just as if nothing of great importance had occurred  i am going to dine out tonight mary she said quite calmly and i maynt be home until sometime tomorrow so dont sit up for me  no miss replied mary demurely who kept her own counsel like the welldrilled goodclass servant that she was  and tell cook that mr de mountford wont be in either nor mr jim ill see her tomorrow and let her know when we all come back  very good miss  louisa gave ungrudging admiration and whispered praise to the young girl she was proud of edies behaviour and grateful to her too this atmosphere of reserve did her good she could not have endured a scene of weeping and keep her own nerves in check all the while  it was close upon eight oclock when at last they reached the langham hotel colonel harris ordered the dinner to be served in the private sitting room of course none of them could eat anything their inward thoughts were following luke de mountford along that weary calvary which he had set himself to mount  soon after dinner edie elected to go to bed the poor child had a vague desire to be alone and also a vague unhappy feeling that she was in the way she was quite woman enough now to understand how much more acutely louisa harris must be suffering than she was herself and since shethe sisterlonged for solitude how much keener must be that longing in the heart of the woman who loved and had lost luke  so she went quietly off to bed louisa kissed her with real affection edie seemed like something of luke like a tender bequest made by a dying man  after that she herself said good night to her father colonel harris was obviously in such acute distress that louisa felt that above all things he must have the companionship of those of his own sex the atmosphere of womans sorrow was essentially bad for him he was not a young man and the last two days had tried him very severely louisa hoped that if she pretended to go to bed early he would perhaps be induced to go to his club for an hour  if he only sat there for an hour reading the papers and nodding to his many friends it would take him out of himself  i am very tired dear she said after she had seen edie safely tucked up amongst the blankets i think ill follow edies good example its no use sitting here staring into the fire is it dear  not a bit of use lou and i suppose you would like to be alone  i shant go to bed dear unless you go to the club  very well lou it seems the right thing to do doesnt it you go to bed and ill go to the club for an hour as you say its no use sitting staring into the fire  her room gave on one side of the sitting room and her fathers on the other she waited until colonel harris went away having helped him on with his overcoat after he left she felt a little twinge of remorse the night was cold and raw and he really had not wanted to go out he would have been quite willing to sit in front of the fire smoking and reading he had only gone because his own innate kindliness and tact had suggested to him that louisa wished to remain alone  he too like edie felt a little in the way his daughters grief was of a nature that a fathers love cannot soothe the greatest solace for it now would be solitude so in spite of the fog in spite of the unpleasantness that met colonel harris on every page of every newspaper he sallied out of the hotel and got into a hansom with the avowed intention of spending a couple of hours at his club  louisa left alone in the sitting room in front of the cheery fire sat down for a moment on the sofa and rested her head against the cushions there was memory even in that for when she closed her eyes she could imagine that luke was sitting at the foot of the sofa she could see him almost with his eyes turned ever toward her and that quaint gesture of his when he passed his hand over the back of his neatly groomed head  the memory was intolerable now she roserestless and feverishand stood by the fire one hand on the high mantelshelf her forehead resting against that hand one foot on the fender and her aching eyes gazing into the red hot glow  it was one of those big red fires partly made up of coke and partly of coal wherein only here and there tiny blue flames flit waywardly and in the building up of which hotel servants are usually past masters the glowing coal heaped up high in the oldfashioned grate presented a wonderful picture of mysterious architecture streets and lanes of crimson incandescence palaces and towers of molten heat and the little blue flames dancing and peeping out from the fiery depths mocking and wayward twirling and twisting as with the joy of life  louisa gazed into this city of brilliant crimson and gold the streets the palaces and the towers and as she gazedwith eyes almost searedthese same streets of fire assumed different shapes they became stately and wide with rows of trees forming an avenue along the middle and tall houses on either side one or two people were walking along the pavement but quickly as if they had business to transact and did not care to loiter one figure that of a woman in neat ulster and serviceable hatwas walking briskly between the row of trees  the blue flames danced and disclosed a few vehicles hurrying past swiftly in the night huge tramways lumbering along and one or two flying motor cabs and far aheadright in the heart of the glowthe distant lights of a more busy thoroughfare now the wide street was more dark and lonely than before only the solitary female figure appeared in the fiery picture walking among the trees the last of the lumbering tramways had been merged in the distant lights only from afar came flying on the blue flames a taxicab at lightning speed  it came along its headlights burning more and more brightly it rattled past the solitary female pedestrian then it stopped in the dark angle made by a huge piece of coal the blue flames gave a hiss and from every corner of the grate crowds of people came rushing to the spot where the taxicab had halted the solitary female pedestrian also hurried to the spot she stopped on the outskirts of the crowd and yet she saw everything that went on in and round the motor the horrorstricken driver the bustling gendarmes the huddled up mass in the darkest corner of the vehicle  then the coal consumed by its own power fell together in a formless heap and the picture vanished louisa closed her eyes for the heat in them was intolerable but only for a moment for now her mind was made up  ever since she had parted from luke one thought had been dominant in her mind one memory had obtruded itself beyond all others taking definite shape in the visions conjured up by the glowing embers of the firethat night in brusselsthe great unforgettable night on which her whole lifes history seemed to find its birthtime  one great resolve too had now taken definite shape  louisa rang for her maid and asked for hat and cloak the maidsomewhat horrified that her mistress should think of going out alone at so late an hourwas too well drilled to offer advice or make comment she brought a warm wrap and a closely fitting simple hat and respectfully wished to know when she should expect her mistress home  in about an hours time said louisa come down into the hall with me and tell the porter to call me a cab  then she went down accompanied by her maid a cab was called and she directed the driver to 56 chester terrace  the address was that of lady ryders town house the maidfeeling more satisfiedwent up stairs again     chapter xxxvi  people dont do that sort of thing   lady ryder was out of town she was staying at a country house in the midlands chaperoning her nieceslouisas twinsistersbut sir thomas ryder was at home  it was for him that louisa had asked when the butler opened the door in answer to her ring  sir thomas is in the library miss said the man will you come into the drawing room and ill tell sir thomas you are here miss  no she said dont announce me ill go to the library  sir thomas put down the paper which he had been reading when his niece entered he did not seem at all astonished to see her no doubt the exercise of his profession had taught him never to be surprised at anything in life he rose when he recognized who it was and carefully folded his eyeglasses and slipped them into their case and into his waistcoat pocket then he said  my dear louisa this is quite unexpected is your father with you  no she replied i came alone may i sit down  certainly my dear child he said genially and himself wheeled a capacious armchair round to the fire  i am not disturbing you uncle ryder  no no take off your cloak wont you i was only at the evening paper preparatory to turning in early  she glanced at the paper on the table that page was uppermost that bore the startling headline in unusually large type the murder in the taxicab sensational developments the chief of the criminal investigation department studied the accounts in the newspapers the opinion of pressmen and reporters everything interested him he weighed everything in his mind no silly advice no empty tittletattle was ever dismissed by him without its due meed of consideration  uncle and niece now sat opposite each other facing the hearth he looked straight into the fire knowing that she would not wish him to see the misery in her face  will you have something lou he asked kindly a cup of tea or something  no thank you uncle we had dinner and father has gone to the club i came to see you about luke  yes he said  all along she continued ever since father saw you yesterday i wanted to speak to you silly conventionality kept me back  it certainly is not usual he began  no she broke in quickly i know it is not but this is an unusual case far too serious for silly ideas of tact or convention to creep in the man whom i love best in all the world is falsely accused of a most abominable crime he was arrestedby your orders i supposeabout an hour ago  he put up his hand in gentle deprecation  stop a moment my dear he said quite kindly but very decisively if you have any idea at the back of your head that i personally have any influence at my command with regard to luke de mountfords fate then the sooner you get that idea out of your head the better if you came here tonight with the notion that by pleading with me you could save luke from the consequences of his crime then get that notion out of your head my dear and save us both from a very painful interview luke de mountford was not arrested by my orders i am only an automaton of the law which takes its own course without any personal interference on my part officially ias an automatondid just as duty and the law of this country directs personally i sent through your father some sound advice to luke de mountford  she listened impassive and silent to his reproof and then said simply  i beg your pardon uncle ryder i must have expressed myself badly i knew quite well that you personally bear no animosity against luke why indeed should you i had no intention whatever in coming to see you tonight of making a scene of lamentation and supplication on the contrary i knew quite well thatacting from the best of motivesyou advised luke to fly from justice since in your opinion his condemnation is a foregone conclusion father hadnt the chance of passing your advice on to luke because when we got to fairfax mansions edie told us that he was packing up his things meaning to catch the night boat to calais  then why the dickens did he miss his train exclaimed sir thomas gruffly  it was not altogether his fault she replied our arrival delayed him a little but he would have had plenty of time even then only the police came you see and it was too late  i know it was silly officious blundering on the part of one of my subs i meant de mountford to have plenty of time to get away and i could have managed it somehow to leave him unmolested if he kept some distance away from england the whole thing has been most unfortunate  i dont think so uncle she said quietly i am glad very glad that luke has been arrested  are you he retorted dryly the outlook for him is not pleasant  i know that but at any rate now there is a chance that he can prove his innocence  sir thomas ryder gave a quick sigh of impatience  my dear child he said gently do try and be reasonable about that you only lay up for yourself further stores of misery and of disappointment de mountford is guilty i tell you he practically confessed at the inquest and he practically confessed to our fellows after his arrest  practically she said with strong emphasis but not really luke has never confessed that he committed a murder  well he admits that the stick with which the murder was done was his stick that he had it in his hand the night that the murder was committed that he went out with it in his hand five minutes before the other man was murdered  i know all that she rejoined but let me tell you this uncle ryder luke has admitted all that as you say but he has never admitted that he killed philip de mountfordor paul bakerwhoever he may be luke uncle ryder is allowing the awful accusation to rest upon him because he wishes to shield the real perpetrator of the crime  nonsense broke in sir thomas curtly  why nonsense  because my dear lou he said slowly and firmly people dont do that sort of thing the consequences of having taken another persons lifeotherwise a murderare so terrible that no one will bear them for the sake of any one else on earth  yet i tell you uncle she reiterated with firmness at least equal to his own that luke never killed that man and that he pleads guilty to the crime in order to shield some one else  whom he retorted  that i do not knowas yet but that is the reason why i came here tonight uncle because you must help me to find out  sir thomas abruptly rose from his chair and took his stand on the hearth rug with legs apart and slender hands buried in the pockets of his trousers in the attitude dear to every englishman  his eyes in their framework of innumerable wrinkles looked down not unkindly at the pale serious face of the girl before him  he who was accustomed to give every scrap of advice every senseless piece of titletattle its just meed of attention was not likely to leave unheeded the calm assertions of a woman for whom he had great regard and who was the daughter of a brother officer and one of his best friends of course the girl was in love with de mountford so her judgment on him was not likely to be wholly unbiassed at the same time sir thomaslike all men who have knocked about the world a great deal and seen much of its seamy sidehad a great belief in womans instinct as apart from her judgment and he was the last man in the world to hold the sex in contempt  look here my dear he said after a little while during which he had tried to read the lines in the interesting face turned up toward him i honour you for your sense of loyalty to de mountford just the same as i honour your father for the like reason and in order to prove to you that i individually would be only too happy to see the mans innocence established beyond a doubt i am going to argue that soberly and sensibly with you you hold the theory that luke de mountford is shielding some one from the consequences of an awful crime by taking the burden on himself now my dear as i told you before people dont do that sort of thing nowadays in olden times the consequences of a crimeespecially where the aristocracy was concernedwere quite picturesque the tower the block and all that sort of thing but today the paraphernalia of vengeful justice is very sordid very mean and anything but glorious it means the lengthy inquiry before a police magistrate then the trial the past dragged up to the light the most private secrets thrown to the morbid curiosity of the million in order to face that sort of thing my dear a man must be either guiltythen he cannot help it or wrongfully accusedthen he hopes for the establishment of his innocence but a man does not prepare himself to face all that out of quixotic motives alone knowing himself to be innocent and because he desires that another should be spared those awful humiliations and the chance of a disgusting and shameful death  what do you mean by all that uncle ryder she asked  i mean that if we are going to admit this quixotic motive in de mountfords attitude now there can only be one mainspring for it  what is that  it is perhaps a little difficult he said somewhat hesitatingly  you mean she interposed quietly that if luke is taking this awful crime upon himself for the sake of another that other can only be a woman whom he loves  well retorted sir thomas it is not you my dear i presume who killed this bricklayer from clapham  she did not reply immediately but her lips almost framed themselves into a smile luke and another woman to sir thomas ryder that seemed indeed a very simple explanation men have been known to do strange things to endure much and to sacrifice everything for the sake of woman but then sir thomas knew nothing of luke nothing more than what the latter chose to show of his inward self to the world the memory of those few moments in the room in fairfax mansions laughed the other mans suggestion to scorn louisa shook her head and said simply  no uncle ryder i did not kill the clapham bricklayer in the cab  and you wont admit that luke may be shielding another woman said sir thomas with just the faintest semblance of a sneer  i wont say that she replied gravely you see i dont really know i would take a dying oath at this momentif i were on the point of deaththat luke never committed that abominable crime i wont even say that he is incapable of it ill only swear that he did not do it and yet he is silent when he is accused then to me the only possible the only logical conclusion is that he is shielding some one else  have you questioned him  yes  put the question directly to him i mean  yes  and what did he say  that his own stick condemns him and that he would plead guilty at his trial  he never told you directly or indirectly that he killed the man  for the space of one second only did louisa hesitate she had asked luke the direct question was it you who killed that man and he had replied it was i she had asked it then determined to know the truth convinced that she would know the truth when he gave reply and she did learn the truth then and there not as luke hoped that she would interpret it but as it really was he had never really lied to her for she had never been deceived now she did not wish to hide anything from sir thomas ryder the only man in the whole world who could help her to prove lukes innocence in spite of himself therefore when her uncle reiterated his question somewhat sharply she replied quite frankly looking straight up at him  he told me directly that it was he who had killed the man  and even then you did not believe him  i knew that he tried to lie  you firmly believe that de mountford knows who killed that paul bakeror whoever he was  i do  and that he means to go through his trial and to plead guilty to a charge of murder so that the real criminal should escape  yes  and that he is prepared to hangto hang mind you reiterated sir thomas with almost cruel bluntness if he is condemned in order to allow the real criminal to escape  yes  and you yourself have no notion as to who this person maybe  no  is there anybody do you think who is likely to know more about luke de mountfords past and present life than you do yourself  yes she said lord radclyffe  old radclyffe he ejaculated  why yes lord radclyffe adored luke before this awful man came between them he had him with him ever since luke was a tiny boy theres no one in the world for whom he cared as he cared for luke and the affection was fully reciprocated my belief is that lord radclyffe knows more about luke than any one else in the world  but old rad is very ill just now unfortunately  it would kill him she retorted if anything happened to luke whilst he was being coddled up as an invalid almost as a prisoner and no news allowed to reach him  sir thomas was silent for a moment obviously buried in thought that he was still incredulous was certainly apparent to louisas supersensitive perceptions but that he meant to be of help to her in spite of this incredulity was equally certain therefore she waited patiently until he had collected his thoughts  well my dear he said at last ill tell you what i will do tomorrow morning ill go and see if i can have a talk with old rad  tomorrow morning she broke in gravely luke will be dragged before the magistratethe first stage of that awful series of humiliations which you yourself say uncle ryder that no man who is innocent can possibly endure  i know my dear he said almost apologetically but i dont see now how that can be avoided  we could see lord radclyffe tonight  tonight he exclaimed why its nearly ten oclock  in matters of this sort time does not count  but old rad is an invalid  he may be a dead man tomorrow if he hears that lukeluke who was the apple of his eye who is the heir to his name and title is being dragged in open court before a policemagistrate charged with an abominable crime  but the doctor i understand has forbidden him to see any one  i think that the matter has passed the bounds of a doctors orders i would go and force my way into his presence without the slightest scruple i know that any news that he may glean about luke within the next few days will be far more fatal to him than the few questions which i want to ask him tonight  that may be my dear rejoined sir thomas dryly but this does not apply to me old rad is a very old friend of mine but if i went with you on this errand tonight i should be going not as a friend but in an official capacity and as such i cannot do it without the doctors permission  very well then she said quietly well ask doctor newingtons permission  for a little while yet sir thomas ryder seemed to hesitate clearly the girls arguments her simple conviction and her latent energy had made a marked impression upon him he was no longer the sceptical hidebound official the man the gentleman was tearing away at the fetters of red tape all the old instincts of chivalry which at times might be dormant in the heart of an english gentlemanbut which are always there nevertheless hidden away by the mantle of conventionhad been aroused by louisas attitude toward the man she loved and also by the remembrance of lukes bearing throughout this miserable business  after all what the girl asked was not so very difficult of execution there are undoubtedly cases where the usual conventional formulas of etiquette must give way to serious exigencies and there was unanswerable logic in louisas arguments at any time in the near future that old radeither through his own obstinacy or the stupidity or illwill of a servantgot hold of a newspaper the suddenness of the blow which he would receive by learning the terrible news without due preparation would inevitably prove fatal to him sir thomas ryder prided himself on being a diplomatist of the first water he did believe that he could so put the necessary questions to lord radclyffe with regard to luke that the old man would not suspect the truth for a moment the latter had of course known of the murder before he had been stricken with illness he had at the time answered the questions put to him by the police officer without seeming to be greatly shocked at the awful occurrence and it was not likely that he would be greatly upset at a professional visit from an old friend who at the same time had the unravelling of the murder mystery at heart  all these thoughts mirrored themselves on sir thomass wrinkled face he was taking no trouble to conceal them from louisa soon she saw that she had won her first victory for her uncle now said with sudden determination  well my dear you have certainly got on the right side of me your aunt always said you had a very persuasive way with you ill tell you what we will do it is now a quarter to tenlate enough by jingo well get into one of those confounded taxis and drive to doctor newingtons ill see him you shall stay in the cab and if i can get his permission well go and have a talk with old rador rather ill talk first and you shall pretend that our joint visit is only a coincidence as a matter of fact he knew all about the murder before he got ill and he wont think it at all unnatural that i have obtained special medical permission to question him myself on the subject then you must work in your questions about luke as best you can afterward is that agreed now  indeed it is uncle ryder said louisa as she rose from her chair with a deep sigh of infinite contentment thank you she added gently and placed her neatly gloved hand upon his arm  with a kind fatherly gesture he gave that little hand an encouraging pat then he rang the bell  a taxiquickly he said to his man my fur coat and my hat i am going out  louisa had gained her first victory she had put forward neither violence nor passion in support of her arguments yet she had conquered because she believed  a few moments later she and sir thomas ryder were on their way to doctor newingtons in hertford street     chapter xxxvii  it is one human life against the other   once more louisa was sitting in the dark corner of a cab seeing london by night as the motor flew past lighted thoroughfares dark narrow streets stately mansions and mean houses the same endless monotony of bricks and mortar of pillars and railings the same endless monotony of everyday life whilst some hearts were breaking and others suffered misery to which cruel elusive death refused its supreme solace  she waited in the cab whilst sir thomas ryder went in to see the doctor fortunately the latter was at home and able to see sir thomas  at first he was obdurate nothing that the high officer of police could say would move his medical dictum lord radclyffe was too ill to see any one he was hardly conscious his brain was working very feebly he had not spoken for two days for speech was difficult  if said doctor newington in his habitual pompous manner he had the least inkling now that that favourite nephew of his was guilty of this awful murder why my dear sir i wouldnt answer for the consequences i believe the feeble bit of life in him would go out like a candle thats been blown upon  who talks retorted sir thomas somewhat impatiently and assuming a manner at least as pompous as that of the fashionable physician of letting lord radclyffe know anything about his nephews position i dont i have no such intention but de mountfords plight is a very serious one there are one or two points about his former life that lord radclyffe could elucidate if he will i want your permission to ask him two or three questions hang it all man de mountfords life is in danger i dont think you have the right to oppose me in this you take a most awful responsibility upon your shoulders  a medical man said doctor newington vaguely has to take upon himself certain grave responsibilities sometimes  yes but not such a grave one as this you must at least give me the chance of interrogating lord radclyffe supposing he knows something that may throw light on this awful affair something that may go to prove de mountfords innocence or guilteither wayand suppose that owing to your prohibitions all knowledge of his nephews fate is kept from him until it is too late until de mountford is hangedfor he risks hanging doctor let me tell you thatsuppose that you have stood in the way when some simple explanation from your patient might have saved him what then  but the patient is too ill i tell you he wouldnt understand you probably i am sure he couldnt answer your questions  the doctors original pompous manner had left him somewhat he was now more like an obstinate man arguing than like a medical man whose pronouncements must be final sir thomas ryderone of the keenest men to note such subtle changes in anothersaw that he had gained an advantage he was quick enough to press it home  let me try at all events he said the whole matter is of such enormous importance after all doctor it is a question of one human life against the other with regard to de mountford let me tell you that unless we can get some very definite proof as to his innocence it is bound to go hard with him say that a few weeks hence lord radclyffe recovering from this severe illness is confronted with the news that his nephew is being tried for murder or that he has been condemnedi wont even mention the final awful possibilitydo you think that you or any one will save the old mans life then or his reason perhaps  doctor newington was silent for awhile clearly he was ready to give way like most men who outwardly are very pompous and dictatorial his blustering was only veneer the strong will power of a more determined intellect very soon reduced him to compliance and all that sir thomas ryder said was logical it carried a great deal of conviction  very well said the doctor at last ill give you permission to interview my patient but on two conditions  what are they  that the interview takes place in my presence and that at the first word from me you cease questioning my patient and leave his room  very well assented sir thomas without any hesitation content that he had gained his point and quite satisfied that the two conditions were perfectly reasonable and such that the doctor was really compelled to impose i must tell you that i came to see you tonight at the instance of my niece louisa harris who was fiancée to de mountford before this unfortunate business it was she who adduced certain arguments which she placed before me and which led to my strong desire to question lord radclyffe tonight before de mountford is brought up before the magistrate tomorrow she is down below in the cab waiting for me  i cannot allow her to see my patient also protested the doctor quickly  no no she shall not see him unless you give permission  why dont you send her home right away then  because retorted sir thomas tartly you might give that permission you see  the argument between the two men had lasted close on half an hour it was long past ten oclock when at last louisa saw them emerging through the lighted doorway the next moment they were seated in the cab with her sir thomas having given the chauffeur the address of lord radclyffes house in grosvenor square  the doctor tried to be bland and polite but he was not over successful in this he did not like being opposed nor hearing his pronouncements combated in this case he had been forced to give way somewhat against his better judgment and all the way in the cab he was comforting himself with the thought that at any rate he would keep women away from his patient and that he would in any case cut the interview very short and demand its abrupt cessation very peremptorily he would then be backed up by two nurses and we must do him the justice to say that he was honestly anxious about his patient  louisa took no notice of the fashionable doctors efforts at conversation she preferred to remain quite silent for those few minutes which elapsed between the departure from hertford street and the arrival at the east side of grosvenor square when she saw her uncle coming down the steps of the doctors house in company with the doctor himself she knew that the second victory had been won tonight that sir thomas ryder would be allowed to interview lord radclyffe she had of course no suspicion of doctor newingtons conditions to the interview but the victory gained was an important one and for the moment she was content     chapter xxxviii  the hand of death was on him too   a respectable looking butler opened the door in answer to doctor newingtons pull at the bell  luke had had timeon the day preceding the inquestto put some semblance of order in his uncles household the doctor had sent in the nurses and he had seen to a nice capable housekeeper being installed in the house she took the further management at once in her own hands she dismissed the drunken couple summarily and engaged a couple of decent servantsa butler and a cook  the house though no less gloomy looked certainly less lonely and neglected  mr warren who had been lord radclyffes secretary for years but who had been speedily given his congé when the imposter took up his permanent abode in the house was installed once more in the library replying to the innumerable letters and telegrams of inquiry which poured in with every post  louisa and sir thomas were shown into the room where the young man was sitting he rose at once offering chairs and pushing his own work aside in the meanwhile the doctor had gone up stairs  several minutes elapsed no one spoke mr warren who had always been deeply attached to luke de mountford was longing to ask questions which however he was too shy to formulate at last there was a knock at the door and one of the nurses came in to say that lord radclyffe would be pleased to see sir thomas ryder up stairs  louisa rose at the same time as her uncle but the latter detained her with a gesture full of kind sympathy  not just yet my dear he said ill call you as soon as possible  but she asked anxiously i shall be allowed to see him shant i  i think so he replied evasively but even if you do not see him you can trust to me oh yes you can he added insistently seeing the deeply troubled look that had crept into her face at his words i am going to do tonight what i often have to do in the course of my work i am going to borrow your soul and your mind and allow them to speak through my lips when i go up stairs i shall only outwardly be the police officer searching for proofs of a crime inwardly i shall be a noblehearted woman trying to discover proofs of her fiancées innocence that will be right dear wont it  she nodded acquiescence trying to appear content then she pleaded once again dryeyed and brokenvoiced you will try and get permission for me to see lord radclyffe wont you  i give you my word he said solemnly  then he went up stairs  mr warren quiet and sympathetic persuaded louisa to sit down again by the hearth he took her muff and fur stole from her and threw a log on the fire the flames spurted off giving a cheerful crackle but louisa saw no pictures in this fire her mind was up stairs in lord radclyffes room wondering what was happening  mr warren spoke of the murdered man he had not been present at the inquest and the news that the tyrant who had ruled over lord radclyffe for so long was nothing but an impostor came as a fearful shock to him  there was the pitifulness of the whole thing the utter purposelessness of a hideous crime so many lives wrecked such awful calamity such appalling humiliation such ignominy and all just for nothing a very little trouble almost superficial inquiry would have revealed the imposture and saved all that sorrow all the dire humiliation and prevented the crime for which the law of men decrees that there shall be no pardon  the man who lay ill up stairsand he who was lying in the public mortuary surrounded by all the pomp and luxury which he had filched by his liesalone could tell the secret of the extraordinary success of the imposture lord radclyffe had accepted the bricklayers son almost as his own with that same obstinate reserve with which he had at first flouted the very thought of the mans pretensions who could tell what persuasion was used what arguments what threats  and the man was an impostor after all and he had been murdered when one word perhaps would have effaced him from the world as completely and less majestically than had been done by death  mr warren talked of it all and louisa listened with half an ear even whilst every sense of hearing in her was concentrated on the floor above in a vain endeavour to get a faint inkling of what went on in lord radclyffes room she had heard her uncles step on the landing the few hurried sentences exchanged with the doctor before entering the sick chamber the opening and shutting of a door then again the lighter footsteps of the nurses who had evidently been sent out of the room when sir thomas went in louisa heard the faint hum of their voices as they descended the stairs even a suppressed giggle now and then they were happy no doubt at the few moments of respite from constant watching which had apparently been accorded them  they ran quickly down the last flight of stairs and across the hall toward the servants quarters their chattering was heard faintly echoing through the baize doors then nothing more  less than a quarter of an hour went by and again she heard the opening and shutting of a door and mens footsteps on the landing  louisa could not believe either her eyes which were gazing on the clock or her ears which heard now quite distinctly the voice of sir thomas descending the stairs and doctor newingtons more pompous tones in reply  the interview remarked mr warren did not last very long  but already she had risen from her chair desperately anxious wondering what the meaning could be of the shortness of the interview she was not kept long in suspense for a moment or two later sir thomas ryder came in followed by doctor newington one glance at her uncles face told her the whole disappointing truth even before he spoke  it was useless my dear he said and doctor newington was quite right lord radclyffe i am sorry to say is hardly conscious he is evidently unable to understand what is said and certainly quite incapable of making any effort to reply  i was afraid so added doctor newington in his usual conventional tones the patient you see is hardly conscious his mind is dormant he just knows me and his nurses but he did not recognize sir thomas  louisa said nothing the blank hopeless disappointment following on the excitement of the past two hours was exceedingly difficult to bear the ruling passionstrong even in the midst of despairthe pride that was in her alone kept her from an utter breakdown she was grateful to her uncle who very tactfully interposed his tall figure between her and the indifferent eyes of the doctor mr warren looked more sympathetic than ever and that was just as trying to bear as the pompousness of doctor newington  as a matter of fact louisa had absolutely ceased to think the whole future from this moment appeared as an absolute blank she had not begun to envisage the possibility of going back to the hotel having utterly failed in accomplishing that which she had set mind and heart to do the throwing of the first feeble ray of light on the impenetrable darkness of lukes supposed guilt she certainly had not envisaged the going to bed tonight the getting up tomorrow the beginning of another day with its thousand and one trivial tasks and incidents all the while that she had failed in doing that which alone could prevent the awful catastrophe of tomorrow  luke standing in the dock like a common criminal  ill just see about getting a cab dear said her uncle kindly  the first of those thousand and one trivialities which would go on and on from now onward in endless monotony whilst luke prepared for his trial for his condemnation perhaps for death  it was indeed unthinkable no wonder that her mind rebelled at the task refusing all thoughts remaining like a gray blank slate from which every impression of past and future has been wiped out  sir thomas ryder went out of the room and mr warren went with him they left the door ajar so she could hear them talking in the hall mr warren said  dont go out sir thomas its a horrid night fletcher will get you a cab  and sir thomas replied thank you  wont you said the younger man wait in the library  he had apparently rung a bell for the man servant came into the hall and was duly told off to whistle for a cab  id rather go into another room for a moment mr warren if i may said sir thomas there are just one or two little questions i would like to put to you  certainly sir thomas replied mr warren with alacrity  the two men went together into the diningroom louisa by shutting her eyes could almost see them sitting there in the stately and gloomy room which she knew so well she could call to mind the last occasion on which she had lunched there with lord radclyffe and luke and edie and jim it was the day on which the impostor first forced his way into the house louisa had a clear vision of him even now just as she had seen him standing that day in the hall before his interview with lord radclyffe parker was helping him with his coat and louisa had seen his face the bricklayers son who had come forward with his marvellous array of lies and who had been so implicitly believed that he himself had to pay for his lies with a most horrible death  for that death nowand because of the impenetrable mystery which the impostor had taken with him to his humble graveluke stood in danger of being punished with death that was even more horrible than that caused by a stab in the neck under cover of darkness and of fog  the one chance that there had been of finding a clue to the mystery had been dissipated by the silence of the sick man up stairs the hand of death was upon him too he also would take the secret of the bricklayers son silently with him to the grave  louisas eyes vacant and tearless wandered aimlessly round the room doctor newington was sitting at the desk writing either a letter or a prescription which apparently required a considerable amount of thought he seemed deeply absorbed in what he wrote and from time to time referred to a small notebook which he took out of his pocket  the scratching of his stylo against the paper was the only sound that struck louisas ear the rest of the house seemed lonely and still only from far away came the shrill screeching of the cabwhistle  louisa rose and went to the door peeping out into the hall it was deserted and the diningroom door was shut she slipped out into the hall doctor newington apparently did not trouble himself about her very softly she closed the library door behind her  then she ran swiftly up stairs     chapter xxxix  a mere woman fighting for the thing she loved   louisa reached the landing slightly out of breath she knew her way about the old house very well two doors now were opposite to her one of these had been left ajarintentionally no doubt it was the one that gave on a smaller morning room where in the olden days lord radclyffe used to have his breakfast and write his private letters the library being given over to mr warren and to official correspondence  from this side of the house and right through the silence that hung over it louisa could hear very faintly rising from the servants quarters below the sound of womens voices chattering and giggling the nurses then had not returned to their post with the indifference born of long usage they were enjoying every minute of the brief respite accorded them content to wait for the doctors call if the patient had immediate need of them  through the chink of the door the red glow of a shaded lamp came as a sharp crimson streak cutting the surrounding gloom  louisa pushed open the door that was ajar and tiptoed softly in  the little room had been transformed for present emergencies the desk had been pushed aside and a small iron bedstead fitted up for the night nurse a womans paraphernalia was scattered about on the massive early victorian furniture a comb and brush a cap and apron neatly folded a couple of long pins littered the table which used to look so severe with its heavy inkstand and firm blottingpad the piano had been relegated into a corner and the portrait of luke which always hung over the mantlepiece had been removed  the door into the bedroom was wide open and without any hesitation louisa went in the bed was immediately in front of her and between it and the hanging lamp beyond a screen had been placed so that the upper part of the sick mans figure was invisible at first in the gloom and the light lay like a red patch right across the quilt at the foot  louisa advanced noiselessly and then halted beside the bed the room was pleasantly warm and the smell of disinfectants of medicines and of lavender water hung in the airthe air of a sick room oppressive and enervating  gradually louisas eyes became accustomed to the semidarkness she fixed them on the sick man who lay quite still against the pillows his face no less white than the linen against which it rested louisa had no idea that any man could alter so in such brief while it almost seemed difficult to recognize in the white emaciated figure that lay there with the stillness of death the vigorous man of a few months ago  the face had the appearance of wax deep lines from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth accentuating its hollow appearance the hair was almost snowwhite now and clung matted and damp to the forehead and sunken temples  lord radclyffe seemed unconscious of louisas presence in the room but his eyes were wide open and fixed on a spot high upon the wall immediately opposite to the bed louisa looked to see on what those eyes were gazing so intently and turning she saw the splendid portrait of luke de mountford painted by the greatest living master of portraiture which we all admired in the rooms of the royal academy a few years ago it had been taken away from the boudoir and brought in here so that the sick man might have the semblance now that he was parted from the reality  only a feeble breath escaped lord radclyffes parted lips there was no distortion in the face and the hands lay still waxenwhite against the quilt louisa looked down on the sick man without at first attempting to speak she looked down on this the last cord of hopes broken lute the frail thread on which hung lukes one chance of safety this feeble life almost ended this weak breath which alone could convey words of hope for the moment louisas heart almost misgave her when she thought of what she meant to do to bring namely this wandering spirit back to earth in order to make it conscious of such misery as no heart of man could endure and not break it seemed like purposeless inhuman cruelty  even if she could call that enfeebled mind back to the hideous realities of today what chance was there that the few words which this dying man could utter would be those that could save luke from the gallows  was it not better to let the broken heart sink to rest in peace the weakened mind go back to the land of shadows unconscious of further sorrow  uncertain now and vaguely fearful she looked up at the portrait of luke the eyes in the magnificently painted portrait seemed endowed with amazing vitality to the loving heartbroken woman it seemed as if they made a direct appeal to her yet what appeal did they make  to let the old manuncle raddie in peace ignorant of the awful fate which must inevitably befall the man whom he loved with such strange such enduring affection  or did those eyes ask for help there where no other human being could lend assistance now  lord radclyffe  the words escaped her suddenly almost frightening her though all along she knew that she had meant to speak  do you know me lord radclyffe she said again it is louisa harris  no reply the great eyes with the shadow of death over them were gazing on the face on which they had always loved to dwell  lord radclyffe she reiterated and the deep notes of her contralto voice quivered with the poignancy of her emotion luke is in very great danger the gravest possible danger that can befall any man do you understand me  again no reply but the great eyessunken and glassyslowly fell from the picture to her face  luke she repeated dwelling on the word i must speak to you about luke  and the lips stiff and cold opened slightly and from between them escaped the word feebly like the breath of a dying man  luke  he is in grave danger lord radclyffe she said slowly in danger of death  and this time the faded lips framed the word distinctly  lukein danger of death  the hands which had lain on the quilt up to now still and waxen as those of a lifeless image began to tremble visibly and the eyesthose great hollow eyeshad a searching anxious expression in them now  philip de mountford has been murdered said louisa you knew that did you not  the sick man nodded life and consciousness were slowly returning and with them understanding and the capacity for suffering  and luke is accused of having murdered him  the trembling of the hands ceased with a quick jerky movement they were drawn back against the figure then used as a leverage with a sudden accession of strength the sick man slowly but steadily drew himself up away from the pillows until he was almost sitting up in bed there was understanding in the eyes now understanding and an awful look of horror  it is not true he murmured  it is true she said luke was known to have quarrelled with philip de mountford and the daggerstick with which the crime was committed was found in the parkstained with bloodthe daggerstick which belonged to luke  luke didnt do it murmured the sick man  i know that he didnt she replied firmly but he pleads guilty he owns that the stick was his and will give no denial no explanation he is taking upon himself the crime of another  it is not true once more murmured the sick man  then he fell back exhausted against the pillows  there he lay once more with that awful stillness of death the hands rested on the quilt as if modelled in wax the eyes were closed and from between the pale parted lips not the faintest breath seemed to escape helpless and anxious louisa looked round her on a table close by stood an array of bottles she went up to it trying to read the labels wondering if there was anything there that was a powerful restorative she found a small bottle labelled brandy and took it up in her hand but as she looked up again she saw doctor newington standing in the doorway of the boudoir one of the nurses was with him and he was armed with his most pompous and most professional manner  what are you doing here he asked sternly  i think she replied trying to master her excitement that lord radclyffe has fainted i did not know what to do  i should think not indeed he said and why did you not ring for the nurse and why are you here  i wished to see lord radclyffe myself she replied  without my permission  you would have refused it  certainly i should and i must request you to leave the sick room at once  baffled and miserable she stood for a moment hesitating vaguely wondering if she could rebel indeed she had no option but to obey the doctor was well within his rights she utterly in the wrong  she turned toward the door ready to go but in order to reach it from where she stood she had to go past the foot of the bed  the nurse was busy administering restoratives and doctor newington had taken up the attitude dear to every englishman his stand upon the hearth rug and his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers he was treating louisa like a disobedient child and she had no one to appeal to in this moment of complete helplessness  one moment only did she debate with herself the nurse just then had gone to a side table to fetch some brandy the patient so louisa heard her tell the doctor had not actually fainted he was merely in a state of exhaustion  swift and furtive like some small animal in danger of its life louisa slipped in between the screen and the bed and before the doctor or nurse could prevent her she had bent right over the sick man and whispered close to his ear  lord radclyffe unless you make an effort now tomorrow luke will be standing in the dockbranded as a felon make an effort for lukes sake  and the spirit which had gone wandering in the land of shadows came back to earth at sound of that one name  luke he whispered luke my boy i am strong i can help you  miss harris interposed the doctor sternly  but the sick mans words had put new strength into her she was ready to fight the doctor now the conventional woman of the world was transformed into just a mere woman fighting for the thing she lovedchild lover or husband it is all the same when that womanly instinct of combat is aroused  doctor newington would have had to take louisa harris by the shoulders now if he meant to eject her for until the patient spoke here she meant to remain  doctor she quietly you have another duty to perform than that of watching over your patient an innocent man is accused of a terrible crime lord radclyffe though very weak is fully conscious if he can save his nephew by a word that word must be spoken tonight  send for tom ryder murmured the sick man hell understand  the words came in gasps but otherwise fairly distinctly doctor newington in all his professional experience had never been placed in such an extraordinary dilemma he was not quite so obstinate about the whole thing as he had originally been and a kind of hopeless bewilderment showed itself upon his face  will you send for sir thomas doctor asked louisa you see that lord radclyffe wishes it  the doctor shrugged his shoulders the responsibility was getting all too heavy for him besides being a fashionable physician he was also a man and as such not altogether inhuman he had seen much acute suffering both mental and physical throughout the length of his career but never had he been brought face to face with such an acute psychological problem andfranklyhe did not know how to deal with it  so he sent the nurse to ask sir thomas ryder once more to step up stairs whilst he himself went up to his patient and with the mechanical movement born of lifelong habit he placed his white podgy fingers on the feebly fluttering pulse  god only knows what will be the issue he said almost inaudibly i dont  the sick man on the other hand seemed to be husbanding his strength he had most obediently taken the brandy which had been given him and now he lay back quietly among the pillows with eyes closed and lips slightly parted the hands wandered somewhat restlessly along the smooth surface of the quilt otherwise lord radclyffe lay perfectly still it even seemedto louisas supersensitive gazeas if an expression of content had settled over the pale face once the sick man opened his eyes and looked up at the portrait the lips murmured the one word  luke and slowly very slowly two tears formed in the sunken eyes and trickled down the wan cheeks  you had better said the doctor curtly leave the patient to me and to sir thomas  certainly she replied ill wait in the next room  sir thomas will call you no doubt if your presence is desirable  she was ready enough to obey now her uncles footstep was heard on the landing outside quietly she relinquished her place beside the bed and as she did so she bent down and kissed the poor old hand that wandered so restlessly along the folds of the quilt  as sir thomas entered the room she was just leaving it they met under the lintel of the door  he seems stronger she whispered pointing to the sick man i think that he will make an effortfor lukes sake  she waited a moment in the doorway until she saw sir thomas ryder installed on one side of the bed and the doctor on the other side with his finger on the patients pulse then she retreated into the morning room and moved by some unaccountable impulses she went to the piano and opening it she sat down and with exquisite softness began to play the opening bars of one of her favourite songs  she sang hardly above a whisper the velvety tones of her voice sounded like the murmur of ghosts through the heavy tapestries of the room whenever her voice died away in the intervals of the song she could hear the hum of mens voices her uncles low and clear now and then a word from the doctor and through it all the voice of the sick man feeble and distinct speaking the words that would mean life to luke     chapter xl  and thus her hour had come   half an hour had gone by the fountain pen dropped from sir thomass cramped fingers  he had been writing slowly but incessantly ever since he sat down beside the sick man and put his first question to him lord radclyffe with the tenacity peculiar to a strong nature had clung to his own strength and will power and had spoken clearly so that sir thomas could not only understand but could write down what he heard word for wordnot omitting a phraseaccurately and succinctly  once or twice doctor newington had to interfere the patient was in danger of exhaustion and brandy had again to be administered lord radclyffe took it eagerly what will power he had left was concentrated on the desire to keep up his strength  from the boudoir came the gentle murmur of a tender song whispered by louisas appealing contralto voice the sick man seemed to enjoy it it seemed to soothe him too for every now and again he lay quite still and listened attentively and when he did so his eyes always sought the portrait of luke  when all was finished and the last word written sir thomas rose and grasped his old friends emaciated hand  youll feel better tomorrow he whispered cheerily when you have your nephew with you the doctor here must allow you to see him if you see no one else  lord radclyffe must have rest now said the doctor impatiently  certainly my dear sir rejoined sir thomas i need not trouble you any more i can but hope that your patient will be none the worse for the effort  the doctor did not reply the patient after the great effort was in a dangerous state of collapse and required every attention  sir thomas ryder took his leave and going through the smaller room he beckoned to louisa to follow him  a moment later the doctor was heard ringing for the nurses sir thomas in the hall was struggling with his coat whilst louisa stood by quite still and patient she knew that her hour would come and she was grateful to her uncle for taking her away from here so quickly  she had not asked a single question and sir thomas had not volunteered any information but she was content to wait until the time when he told her everything  the cab which had been called all that long while ago was still waiting at the door it was now past eleven oclock silently sir thomas and louisa harris stepped into the cab mr warren sympathetic and attentive to the last giving the address to the chauffeur on their behalf  less than five minutes later they had arrived at the langham hotel but they had not exchanged a single word during that time  colonel harris was in the sitting room waiting for his daughters return the maid had told him that her mistress had gone to sir thomas ryders and had promised to be home again in about an hour so he was not really anxious only very worried about her personally he saw no issue to the terrible tangle and his heart ached for her as much as it did for luke  he found himself quite unable to sit at the club luke de mountfords name was in every mans mouth the obsession was unendurable the countless arguments adduced by indifferent lips was positively nerveracking colonel harris after half an hour had enough of it and went back to the langham  he did not greet his brotherinlaw very warmly he did not feel very well disposed toward him as he had a vague idea that sir thomas ryder was in a measure responsible for lukes terrible fate  lou dear its very late he said with gentle reproach when she came in  youll have to forgive her will interposed sir thomas she came over to have a talk with me and we went on to try and see old rad who is dying i am afraid poor chap  now my dear he added turning to louisa whilst he dived into his breastpocket from which he extracted a notebook go to your own room and read this through very quietly while i talk to your father  he gave her the book which she took without a word  it wont he added take you very long to read when you have finished bring me the notes back i want them tonight  she kissed her father before she went out of the room he and she had both guessedby that unexplainable subtle intuition born of sympathywhat the pages of that notebook contained     chapter xli  which tells of the contents of the note book   louisa sat beside the fire and read the notes were written in sir thomass clear caligraphy in short jerky sentences just as the sick man had spoken them usually in reply to questions put to him  as louisa read on she could almost hear lord radclyffes whispered words whilst she herself sang tostis melancholy song goodbye  i was not altogether ignorant of my brother arthurs marriage over in martinique but he had always given me to understand that the marriage was not a strictly legal one and that his son philip had no right whatever to claim any possible succession to our family title and estates even on his deathbed arthur assured me of this and said to me most emphatically luke is your heir my son philip has no legal claim  i never made the slightest effort to communicate with arthurs widow or with his child for arthur had assured me that they were well provided for and quite happy amongst their own kindred after the catastrophe of st pierre i completely lost sight of them  then came a letter addressed to me from st vincent the first inkling which i had that not only did arthurs son know of his fathers position in life but that he had full and justifiable reasons for believing that he himself was heir presumptive to the family title and estates which would have been his fathers had the latter outlived the present holder  this letter was followed by several others about which neither luke nor mr warren knew anything for i told them nothing at last there came one from brussels by this time i had searched carefully through some letters which my brother arthur had desired that i should destroy after his death but which i had always kept by me meaning one day to comply with his wish  i had more than a suspicion then that my brothers marriage was a perfectly legal one and that his son was the only true heirpresumptive to the title and estates which i had always fondly thought could only devolve upon luke i went over to brussels determined to see this philip before he set foot in england the thought that he would supersede luke was more than i could bear  i arrived in brussels early one morning having crossed over in the night at once i drove to the mean hotel where he was lodging he was sharing a room with a man with whom he had picked up a casual acquaintanceship on the sea voyage between the west indies and antwerp the two men had come over together in the belgian boat they looked a pair of young blackguards but it did not take me very long to be convinced that for some reason best known to himself my brother arthur had deceived me and that his son philip was indeed the legitimate and rightful heir to the title which i hold the papers were authentic and undisputable this much i knew and that luke whom i loved best in all the world more than any father has ever loved his son would never be earl of radclyffe so long as philip de mountford lived  men will say that i am an abandoned criminal and indeed it may be so may god forgive me hereafter for i killed my brothers son i pretended to rejoice at his homecoming and in half an hour had gained his confidence in the afternoon we went out together and after a short walk we picked up a taxicab philip gave the driver the address of a restaurant at which i had asked him to dine with me i kept carefully in the shadow so that the man shouldnt see me then on the way in the cab i killed him when his head was turned away from me i plunged an old italian stiletto which i had carried about with me ever since i had had letters from philip straight into his neck  he died instantly without a groan and i was sick to death but i managed to sit quietly beside him until the cab pulled up then i jumped out and told the chauffeur to drive my friend on to some remote place on the boulevards  i watched the cab until it was out of sight then i hailed another and drove straight to the gard du nord and crossed back to england that night i threw the stiletto overboard into the sea i had spent twelve hours in brussels and i had killed philip de mountford and made sure that luke would be earl of radclyffe after me  it was not likely that in their search for the missing criminal who had stabbed an unknown stranger in a cab the belgian police would suspect an english peer the mystery of that crime has remained impenetrable because nothing was ever known of the stranger who was murdered at the mean hotel where he lodged no one knew anything about him only one person knew and he was silent for purposes of his own  before the police searched the unknown strangers room the room which he shared with the chance friend whom he had picked up on the belgian boat the latter already had found and concealed the papers which would have revealed the identity of the murdered man if not that of his murderer  i at home in england wondered how it was that the belgian police had never discovered that the murdered man was named philip de mountford and that he claimed to be the heir to the earldom of radclyffe i expected paragraphs in the paper some unpleasantness even but none came  i could not understand it for i had forgotten the existence of the chance friend  and then one day last april i understood once more i had letters from abroad from a man who claimed to be my brothers son at first i thought the whole thing a silly imposture until the day when a man confronted me in my own house armed with every proof that i had killed philip de mountford in brussels he had the latters passports his birth and marriage certificates his letters of identification all all the papers that he had filched from among the dead mans things and which he now flaunted before me daring me to prove him an impostor if i am not philip de mountford he said to me then where is philip de mountford and from that hour i was as wax in his hands he held me and he knew it i might have proved him an impostor and he could prove me a murderer  heaven alone knows how i did not lose my reason then i floundered in a sea of wild conjectures wild projects wild hopes of escape but my tyrant held me and i dared not rebel  and once more i was obsessed with the awful certitude that luke would never be earl of radclyffe after me while this man lived  he had so taken upon himself the personality of philip the evidences which went to prove his identity with the late arthur de mountfords son were so strangely circumstantial that short of my proclaiming loudly that i had killed my brothers son with my own hand nothing could prevent the impostor from succeeding in filching lukes inheritance  and even if i had confessed then it seemed to me that this man would still succeed in proving that i had murdered an unknown strangera chance friend who was an english bricklayers sonand that he and he only was philip de mountford the late arthurs son  when did i first dream of killing him as i killed the other i could not tell you that but it was some time ago and i watched my opportunity with patience and perseverance then at last the opportunity came following on terrible provocation that dark foggy november night that you all remember so well i was to meet my tyrant at the veterans club at nine oclock i drove up there and as i stepped out of the cab i came face to face with luke something in the boys manner told me what had happened he didnt tell me but i guessed the two men had quarrelled and luke had had to endure the others arrogance  the news upset me i felt faint and choked with the fog luke didnt like to leave me and seeing how i tottered he gave me his stick to lean upon we walked together for a little while up and down and i felt stronger and better i begged luke to leave me presently as the impostor came out at the club door luke obeyed at last and said good night to me  paul bakeri knew that that was his namewanted me to drive straight back to grosvenor square but asked me to drop him first near the railings of green park he often walked about there in the evenings it was a curious fad which he had we called a cab and he told the driver where to pull up when i was sitting next to him i realized that i had a stick in my hand i really had forgotten that it was lukes whilst i toyed with it i noticed that the top came out and that a sharp dagger was concealed inside the body of the stick  paul baker was looking out of the window at the fog and inside the cab it was very dark so he did not know what i was doing i killed him just as i had killed arthurs son with a dagger thrust through the neck this time i did not feel sick because i hated this man so when the driver pulled up near green park i jumped out quite coolly and told the man to take my friend to some distant address in kensington  i threw the stick away behind the railings in the park i had forgotten that the stick was lukes i knew that it was not mine and that therefore they could not trace it to me  i did not imagine for a moment that luke could be accused of a crime which he had not committed i did not think that justice could be so blind  all i wanted was to be rid of my tyrant and that lukes inheritance should not be filched from him     chapter xlii  which tells once more of commonplace incidents   the notebook fell out of louisas hands on to her lap how simple the tragedy seemed now that she knew how understandable was the mystery of lukes silence he knew that uncle rad was guilty there lay the awful difficulty  uncle rad has been father mother brother sister to us all bless him that was lukes feeling with regard to uncle rad  the ununderstandable was so simple after all  louisa went back to the sittingroom the two men were sitting smoking in silence colonel harris too understood the mystery at last his loyalty was crowned with the halo of justification                                       the public never knew i think that luke de mountford had actually been arrested for the murder of the clapham road bricklayer the police the next day applied for a remand and then luke was brought quietly before the magistrate and equally quietly dismissed  he was free to go and see uncle rad  louisa did not see him the whole of that day for he sat by the bedside of the sick man whose strange and perturbed spirit was slowly sinking to rest uncle rad was at peace for he held the hand and looked into the face of the man on whom he had lavished the storehouse of an affection that had known no bounds  the two men understood each other perfectly he who had committed a crime and he who was ready to bear its burden both had done their share for the others sake  it was only after the magnificent obsequies of the earl of radclyffe that the truth about the murder of the bricklayers son was made known to the public at large  it had to be done for lukes sake colonel harris insisted upon it with all the weight of his fatherly authority sir thomas ryder did likewise  for louisas sake too it had to be but twentyfour hours before the publication of the confession in the newspapers luke and louisa had been quietly married by special license and had gone abroad  once more we must think of them as the commonplace conventional man and woman of the world who outwardly behaved just like thousands of english men and women of their class behave  when they came back from their honeymoonwhich lasted one year abroad and all the rest of their lives after thatthere was not a trace in them in their appearance their manner their mode of life of the terrible tragedy which had threatened to annihilate honour life and love  ah those english murmured the foreign excellencies who graced the english court they have no heart no sentiment lord and lady radclyffe they behave just as if he had never been accused of murder as if his uncle had never been the awful criminal that he was they are hypocrites these english and they have no heart  convention was once more the master its giant hands held the strings which made the puppets dance  but at times his grip would relax when luke and louisa were all alone no prying eyes to watch no indifferent gaze to see the unburdening of their hearts then luke would lie at louisas feet for his love was worship and his passion uncontrolled his arms would encircle the perfect form that he loved with such intensity that at times the happiness of loving had in it an exquisite sense of pain the tragedy of the past was never quite absent from them then the ghost of a great crime and the shadow of a still greater renunciation threw a mystic halo over their love for each other and at those timeslike paolo and francescathey read no more  but these english they have no heart you know
