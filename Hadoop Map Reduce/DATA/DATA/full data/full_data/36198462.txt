interest the reader happened to be standing in one of the saloons of the sculpturegallery in the capitol at rome it was that room the first after ascending the staircase in the centre of which reclines the noble and most pathetic figure of the dying gladiator just sinking into his deathswoon around the walls stand the antinous the amazon the lycian apollo the juno all famous productions of antique sculpture and still shining in the undiminished majesty and beauty of their ideal life although the marble that embodies them is yellow with time and perhaps corroded by the damp earth in which they lay buried for centuries here likewise is seen a symbol as apt at this moment as it was two thousand years ago of the human soul with its choice of innocence or evil close at hand in the pretty figure of a child clasping a dove to her bosom but assaulted by a snake  from one of the windows of this saloon we may see a flight of broad stone steps descending alongside the antique and massive foundation of the capitol towards the battered triumphal arch of septimius severus right below farther on the eye skirts along the edge of the desolate forum where roman washerwomen hang out their linen to the sun passing over a shapeless confusion of modern edifices piled rudely up with ancient brick and stone and over the domes of christian churches built on the old pavements of heathen temples and supported by the very pillars that once upheld them at a distance beyondyet but a little way considering how much history is heaped into the intervening spacerises the great sweep of the coliseum with the blue sky brightening through its upper tier of arches far off the view is shut in by the alban mountains looking just the same amid all this decay and change as when romulus gazed thitherward over his half finished wall  we glance hastily at these thingsat this bright sky and those blue distant mountains and at the ruins etruscan roman christian venerable with a threefold antiquity and at the company of worldfamous statues in the saloonin the hope of putting the reader into that state of feeling which is experienced oftenest at rome it is a vague sense of ponderous remembrances a perception of such weight and density in a bygone life of which this spot was the centre that the present moment is pressed down or crowded out and our individual affairs and interests are but half as real here as elsewhere viewed through this medium our narrativeinto which are woven some airy and unsubstantial threads intermixed with others twisted out of the commonest stuff of human existencemay seem not widely different from the texture of all our lives  side by side with the massiveness of the roman past all matters that we handle or dream of nowadays look evanescent and visionary alike  it might be that the four persons whom we are seeking to introduce were conscious of this dreamy character of the present as compared with the square blocks of granite wherewith the romans built their lives perhaps it even contributed to the fanciful merriment which was just now their mood when we find ourselves fading into shadows and unrealities it seems hardly worth while to be sad but rather to laugh as gayly as we may and ask little reason wherefore  of these four friends of ours three were artists or connected with art and at this moment they had been simultaneously struck by a resemblance between one of the antique statues a wellknown masterpiece of grecian sculpture and a young italian the fourth member of their party  you must needs confess kenyon said a darkeyed young woman whom her friends called miriam that you never chiselled out of marble nor wrought in clay a more vivid likeness than this cunning a bustmaker as you think yourself the portraiture is perfect in character sentiment and feature if it were a picture the resemblance might be half illusive and imaginary but here in this pentelic marble it is a substantial fact and may be tested by absolute touch and measurement our friend donatello is the very faun of praxiteles is it not true hilda  not quitealmostyes i really think so replied hilda a slender brownhaired new england girl whose perceptions of form and expression were wonderfully clear and delicate if there is any difference between the two faces the reason may be i suppose that the faun dwelt in woods and fields and consorted with his like whereas donatello has known cities a little and such people as ourselves but the resemblance is very close and very strange  not so strange whispered miriam mischievously for no faun in arcadia was ever a greater simpleton than donatello he has hardly a mans share of wit small as that may be it is a pity there are no longer any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for our friend to consort with  hush naughty one returned hilda you are very ungrateful for you well know he has wit enough to worship you at all events  then the greater fool he said miriam so bitterly that hildas quiet eyes were somewhat startled  donatello my dear friend said kenyon in italian pray gratify us all by taking the exact attitude of this statue  the young man laughed and threw himself into the position in which the statue has been standing for two or three thousand years in truth allowing for the difference of costume and if a lions skin could have been substituted for his modern talma and a rustic pipe for his stick donatello might have figured perfectly as the marble faun miraculously softened into flesh and blood  yes the resemblance is wonderful observed kenyon after examining the marble and the man with the accuracy of a sculptors eye there is one point however or rather two points in respect to which our friend donatellos abundant curls will not permit us to say whether the likeness is carried into minute detail  and the sculptor directed the attention of the party to the ears of the beautiful statue which they were contemplating  but we must do more than merely refer to this exquisite work of art it must be described however inadequate may be the effort to express its magic peculiarity in words  the faun is the marble image of a young man leaning his right arm on the trunk or stump of a tree one hand hangs carelessly by his side in the other he holds the fragment of a pipe or some such sylvan instrument of music his only garmenta lions skin with the claws upon his shoulderfalls halfway down his back leaving the limbs and entire front of the figure nude the form thus displayed is marvellously graceful but has a fuller and more rounded outline more flesh and less of heroic muscle than the old sculptors were wont to assign to their types of masculine beauty the character of the face corresponds with the figure it is most agreeable in outline and feature but rounded and somewhat voluptuously developed especially about the throat and chin the nose is almost straight but very slightly curves inward thereby acquiring an indescribable charm of geniality and humor the mouth with its full yet delicate lips seems so nearly to smile outright that it calls forth a responsive smile the whole statueunlike anything else that ever was wrought in that severe material of marbleconveys the idea of an amiable and sensual creature easy mirthful apt for jollity yet not incapable of being touched by pathos it is impossible to gaze long at this stone image without conceiving a kindly sentiment towards it as if its substance were warm to the touch and imbued with actual life it comes very close to some of our pleasantest sympathies  perhaps it is the very lack of moral severity of any high and heroic ingredient in the character of the faun that makes it so delightful an object to the human eye and to the frailty of the human heart the being here represented is endowed with no principle of virtue and would be incapable of comprehending such but he would be true and honest by dint of his simplicity we should expect from him no sacrifice or effort for an abstract cause there is not an atom of martyrs stuff in all that softened marble but he has a capacity for strong and warm attachment and might act devotedly through its impulse and even die for it at need it is possible too that the faun might be educated through the medium of his emotions so that the coarser animal portion of his nature might eventually be thrown into the background though never utterly expelled  the animal nature indeed is a most essential part of the fauns composition for the characteristics of the brute creation meet and combine with those of humanity in this strange yet true and natural conception of antique poetry and art praxiteles has subtly diffused throughout his work that mute mystery which so hopelessly perplexes us whenever we attempt to gain an intellectual or sympathetic knowledge of the lower orders of creation the riddle is indicated however only by two definite signs these are the two ears of the faun which are leaf shaped terminating in little peaks like those of some species of animals though not so seen in the marble they are probably to be considered as clothed in fine downy fur in the coarser representations of this class of mythological creatures there is another token of brute kindreda certain caudal appendage which if the faun of praxiteles must be supposed to possess it at all is hidden by the lions skin that forms his garment the pointed and furry ears therefore are the sole indications of his wild forest nature  only a sculptor of the finest imagination the most delicate taste the sweetest feeling and the rarest artistic skillin a word a sculptor and a poet toocould have first dreamed of a faun in this guise and then have succeeded in imprisoning the sportive and frisky thing in marble neither man nor animal and yet no monster but a being in whom both races meet on friendly ground the idea grows coarse as we handle it and hardens in our grasp but if the spectator broods long over the statue he will be conscious of its spell all the pleasantness of sylvan life all the genial and happy characteristics of creatures that dwell in woods and fields will seem to be mingled and kneaded into one substance along with the kindred qualities in the human soul trees grass flowers woodland streamlets cattle deer and unsophisticated man the essence of all these was compressed long ago and still exists within that discolored marble surface of the faun of praxiteles  and after all the idea may have been no dream but rather a poets reminiscence of a period when mans affinity with nature was more strict and his fellowship with every living thing more intimate and dear     chapter ii   the faun   donatello playfully cried miriam do not leave us in this perplexity shake aside those brown curls my friend and let us see whether this marvellous resemblance extends to the very tips of the ears if so we shall like you all the better  no no dearest signorina answered donatello laughing but with a certain earnestness i entreat you to take the tips of my ears for granted as he spoke the young italian made a skip and jump light enough for a veritable faun so as to place himself quite beyond the reach of the fair hand that was outstretched as if to settle the matter by actual examination i shall be like a wolf of the apennines he continued taking his stand on the other side of the dying gladiator if you touch my ears ever so softly none of my race could endure it it has always been a tender point with my forefathers and me  he spoke in italian with the tuscan rusticity of accent and an unshaped sort of utterance betokening that he must heretofore have been chiefly conversant with rural people  well well said miriam your tender pointyour two tender points if you have themshall be safe so far as i am concerned but how strange this likeness is after all and how delightful if it really includes the pointed ears o it is impossible of course she continued in english with a real and commonplace young man like donatello but you see how this peculiarity defines the position of the faun and while putting him where he cannot exactly assert his brotherhood still disposes us kindly towards the kindred creature he is not supernatural but just on the verge of nature and yet within it what is the nameless charm of this idea hilda you can feel it more delicately than i  it perplexes me said hilda thoughtfully and shrinking a little neither do i quite like to think about it  but surely said kenyon you agree with miriam and me that there is something very touching and impressive in this statue of the faun in some longpast age he must really have existed nature needed and still needs this beautiful creature standing betwixt man and animal sympathizing with each comprehending the speech of either race and interpreting the whole existence of one to the other what a pity that he has forever vanished from the hard and dusty paths of lifeunless added the sculptor in a sportive whisper donatello be actually he  you cannot conceive how this fantasy takes hold of me responded miriam between jest and earnest imagine now a real being similar to this mythic faun how happy how genial how satisfactory would be his life enjoying the warm sensuous earthy side of nature revelling in the merriment of woods and streams living as our fourfooted kindred doas mankind did in its innocent childhood before sin sorrow or morality itself had ever been thought of ah kenyon if hilda and you and iif i at leasthad pointed ears for i suppose the faun had no conscience no remorse no burden on the heart no troublesome recollections of any sort no dark future either  what a tragic tone was that last miriam said the sculptor and looking into her face he was startled to behold it pale and tearstained how suddenly this mood has come over you  let it go as it came said miriam like a thundershower in this roman sky all is sunshine again you see  donatellos refractoriness as regarded his ears had evidently cost him something and he now came close to miriams side gazing at her with an appealing air as if to solicit forgiveness his mute helpless gesture of entreaty had something pathetic in it and yet might well enough excite a laugh so like it was to what you may see in the aspect of a hound when he thinks himself in fault or disgrace it was difficult to make out the character of this young man so full of animal life as he was so joyous in his deportment so handsome so physically welldeveloped he made no impression of incompleteness of maimed or stinted nature and yet in social intercourse these familiar friends of his habitually and instinctively allowed for him as for a child or some other lawless thing exacting no strict obedience to conventional rules and hardly noticing his eccentricities enough to pardon them there was an indefinable characteristic about donatello that set him outside of rules  he caught miriams hand kissed it and gazed into her eyes without saying a word she smiled and bestowed on him a little careless caress singularly like what one would give to a pet dog when he puts himself in the way to receive it not that it was so decided a caress either but only the merest touch somewhere between a pat and a tap of the finger it might be a mark of fondness or perhaps a playful pretence of punishment at all events it appeared to afford donatello exquisite pleasure insomuch that he danced quite round the wooden railing that fences in the dying gladiator  it is the very step of the dancing faun said miriam apart to hilda what a child or what a simpleton he is i continually find myself treating donatello as if he were the merest unfledged chicken and yet he can claim no such privileges in the right of his tender age for he is at leasthow old should you think him hilda  twenty years perhaps replied hilda glancing at donatello but indeed i cannot tell hardly so old on second thoughts or possibly older he has nothing to do with time but has a look of eternal youth in his face  all underwitted people have that look said miriam scornfully  donatello has certainly the gift of eternal youth as hilda suggests observed kenyon laughing for judging by the date of this statue which i am more and more convinced praxiteles carved on purpose for him he must be at least twentyfive centuries old and he still looks as young as ever  what age have you donatello asked miriam  signorina i do not know he answered no great age however for i have only lived since i met you  now what old man of society could have turned a silly compliment more smartly than that exclaimed miriam nature and art are just at one sometimes but what a happy ignorance is this of our friend donatello not to know his own age it is equivalent to being immortal on earth if i could only forget mine  it is too soon to wish that observed the sculptor you are scarcely older than donatello looks  i shall be content then rejoined miriam if i could only forget one day of all my life then she seemed to repent of this allusion and hastily added a womans days are so tedious that it is a boon to leave even one of them out of the account  the foregoing conversation had been carried on in a mood in which all imaginative people whether artists or poets love to indulge in this frame of mind they sometimes find their profoundest truths side by side with the idlest jest and utter one or the other apparently without distinguishing which is the most valuable or assigning any considerable value to either the resemblance between the marble faun and their living companion had made a deep halfserious halfmirthful impression on these three friends and had taken them into a certain airy region lifting up as it is so pleasant to feel them lifted their heavy earthly feet from the actual soil of life the world had been set afloat as it were for a moment and relieved them for just so long of all customary responsibility for what they thought and said  it might be under this influenceor perhaps because sculptors always abuse one anothers worksthat kenyon threw in a criticism upon the dying gladiator  i used to admire this statue exceedingly he remarked but latterly i find myself getting weary and annoyed that the man should be such a length of time leaning on his arm in the very act of death if he is so terribly hurt why does he not sink down and die without further ado flitting moments imminent emergencies imperceptible intervals between two breaths ought not to be incrusted with the eternal repose of marble in any sculptural subject there should be a moral standstill since there must of necessity be a physical one otherwise it is like flinging a block of marble up into the air and by some trick of enchantment causing it to stick there you feel that it ought to come down and are dissatisfied that it does not obey the natural law  i see said miriam mischievously you think that sculpture should be a sort of fossilizing process but in truth your frozen art has nothing like the scope and freedom of hildas and mine in painting there is no similar objection to the representation of brief snatches of timeperhaps because a story can be so much more fully told in picture and buttressed about with circumstances that give it an epoch for instance a painter never would have sent down yonder faun out of his far antiquity lonely and desolate with no companion to keep his simple heart warm  ah the faun cried hilda with a little gesture of impatience i have been looking at him too long and now instead of a beautiful statue immortally young i see only a corroded and discolored stone this change is very apt to occur in statues  and a similar one in pictures surely retorted the sculptor it is the spectators mood that transfigures the transfiguration itself i defy any painter to move and elevate me without my own consent and assistance  then you are deficient of a sense said miriam  the party now strayed onward from hall to hall of that rich gallery pausing here and there to look at the multitude of noble and lovely shapes which have been dug up out of the deep grave in which old rome lies buried and still the realization of the antique faun in the person of donatello gave a more vivid character to all these marble ghosts why should not each statue grow warm with life antinous might lift his brow and tell us why he is forever sad the lycian apollo might strike his lyre and at the first vibration that other faun in red marble who keeps up a motionless dance should frisk gayly forth leading yonder satyrs with shaggy goatshanks to clatter their little hoofs upon the floor and all join hands with donatello bacchus too a rosy flush diffusing itself over his timestained surface could come down from his pedestal and offer a cluster of purple grapes to donatellos lips because the god recognizes him as the woodland elf who so often shared his revels and here in this sarcophagus the exquisitely carved figures might assume life and chase one another round its verge with that wild merriment which is so strangely represented on those old burial coffers though still with some subtile allusion to death carefully veiled but forever peeping forth amid emblems of mirth and riot  as the four friends descended the stairs however their play of fancy subsided into a much more sombre mood a result apt to follow upon such exhilaration as that which had so recently taken possession of them  do you know said miriam confidentially to hilda i doubt the reality of this likeness of donatello to the faun which we have been talking so much about to say the truth it never struck me so forcibly as it did kenyon and yourself though i gave in to whatever you were pleased to fancy for the sake of a moments mirth and wonder i was certainly in earnest and you seemed equally so replied hilda glancing back at donatello as if to reassure herself of the resemblance but faces change so much from hour to hour that the same set of features has often no keeping with itself to an eye at least which looks at expression more than outline how sad and sombre he has grown all of a sudden angry too methinks nay it is anger much more than sadness said miriam i have seen donatello in this mood once or twice before if you consider him well you will observe an odd mixture of the bulldog or some other equally fierce brute in our friends composition a trait of savageness hardly to be expected in such a gentle creature as he usually is donatello is a very strange young man i wish he would not haunt my footsteps so continually  you have bewitched the poor lad said the sculptor laughing you have a faculty of bewitching people and it is providing you with a singular train of followers i see another of them behind yonder pillar and it is his presence that has aroused donatellos wrath  they had now emerged from the gateway of the palace and partly concealed by one of the pillars of the portico stood a figure such as may often be encountered in the streets and piazzas of rome and nowhere else he looked as if he might just have stepped out of a picture and in truth was likely enough to find his way into a dozen pictures being no other than one of those living models dark bushy bearded wild of aspect and attire whom artists convert into saints or assassins according as their pictorial purposes demand  miriam whispered hilda a little startled it is your model     chapter iii   subterranean reminiscences   miriams model has so important a connection with our story that it is essential to describe the singular mode of his first appearance and how he subsequently became a selfappointed follower of the young female artist in the first place however we must devote a page or two to certain peculiarities in the position of miriam herself  there was an ambiguity about this young lady which though it did not necessarily imply anything wrong would have operated unfavorably as regarded her reception in society anywhere but in rome the truth was that nobody knew anything about miriam either for good or evil she had made her appearance without introduction had taken a studio put her card upon the door and showed very considerable talent as a painter in oils her fellow professors of the brush it is true showered abundant criticisms upon her pictures allowing them to be well enough for the idle halfefforts of an amateur but lacking both the trained skill and the practice that distinguish the works of a true artist  nevertheless be their faults what they might miriams pictures met with good acceptance among the patrons of modern art whatever technical merit they lacked its absence was more than supplied by a warmth and passionateness which she had the faculty of putting into her productions and which all the world could feel her nature had a great deal of color and in accordance with it so likewise had her pictures  miriam had great apparent freedom of intercourse her manners were so far from evincing shyness that it seemed easy to become acquainted with her and not difficult to develop a casual acquaintance into intimacy such at least was the impression which she made upon brief contact but not such the ultimate conclusion of those who really sought to know her so airy free and affable was miriams deportment towards all who came within her sphere that possibly they might never be conscious of the fact but so it was that they did not get on and were seldom any further advanced into her good graces today than yesterday by some subtile quality she kept people at a distance without so much as letting them know that they were excluded from her inner circle she resembled one of those images of light which conjurers evoke and cause to shine before us in apparent tangibility only an arms length beyond our grasp we make a step in advance expecting to seize the illusion but find it still precisely so far out of our reach finally society began to recognize the impossibility of getting nearer to miriam and gruffly acquiesced  there were two persons however whom she appeared to acknowledge as friends in the closer and truer sense of the word and both of these more favored individuals did credit to miriams selection one was a young american sculptor of high promise and rapidly increasing celebrity the other a girl of the same country a painter like miriam herself but in a widely different sphere of art her heart flowed out towards these two she requited herself by their society and friendship and especially by hildas for all the loneliness with which as regarded the rest of the world she chose to be surrounded her two friends were conscious of the strong yearning grasp which miriam laid upon them and gave her their affection in full measure hilda indeed responding with the fervency of a girls first friendship and kenyon with a manly regard in which there was nothing akin to what is distinctively called love  a sort of intimacy subsequently grew up between these three friends and a fourth individual it was a young italian who casually visiting rome had been attracted by the beauty which miriam possessed in a remarkable degree he had sought her followed her and insisted with simple perseverance upon being admitted at least to her acquaintance a boon which had been granted when a more artful character seeking it by a more subtle mode of pursuit would probably have failed to obtain it this young man though anything but intellectually brilliant had many agreeable characteristics which won him the kindly and halfcontemptuous regard of miriam and her two friends it was he whom they called donatello and whose wonderful resemblance to the faun of praxiteles forms the keynote of our narrative  such was the position in which we find miriam some few months after her establishment at rome it must be added however that the world did not permit her to hide her antecedents without making her the subject of a good deal of conjecture as was natural enough considering the abundance of her personal charms and the degree of notice that she attracted as an artist there were many stories about miriams origin and previous life some of which had a very probable air while others were evidently wild and romantic fables we cite a few leaving the reader to designate them either under the probable or the romantic head  it was said for example that miriam was the daughter and heiress of a great jewish banker an idea perhaps suggested by a certain rich oriental character in her face and had fled from her paternal home to escape a union with a cousin the heir of another of that golden brotherhood the object being to retain their vast accumulation of wealth within the family another story hinted that she was a german princess whom for reasons of state it was proposed to give in marriage either to a decrepit sovereign or a prince still in his cradle according to a third statement she was the offspring of a southern american planter who had given her an elaborate education and endowed her with his wealth but the one burning drop of african blood in her veins so affected her with a sense of ignominy that she relinquished all and fled her country by still another account she was the lady of an english nobleman and out of mere love and honor of art had thrown aside the splendor of her rank and come to seek a subsistence by her pencil in a roman studio  in all the above cases the fable seemed to be instigated by the large and bounteous impression which miriam invariably made as if necessity and she could have nothing to do with one another whatever deprivations she underwent must needs be voluntary but there were other surmises taking such a commonplace view as that miriam was the daughter of a merchant or financier who had been ruined in a great commercial crisis and possessing a taste for art she had attempted to support herself by the pencil in preference to the alternative of going out as governess  be these things how they might miriam fair as she looked was plucked up out of a mystery and had its roots still clinging to her she was a beautiful and attractive woman but based as it were upon a cloud and all surrounded with misty substance so that the result was to render her spritelike in her most ordinary manifestations this was the case even in respect to kenyon and hilda her especial friends but such was the effect of miriams natural language her generosity kindliness and native truth of character that these two received her as a dear friend into their hearts taking her good qualities as evident and genuine and never imagining that what was hidden must be therefore evil  we now proceed with our narrative  the same party of friends whom we have seen at the sculpturegallery of the capitol chanced to have gone together some months before to the catacomb of st calixtus they went joyously down into that vast tomb and wandered by torchlight through a sort of dream in which reminiscences of church aisles and grimy cellarsand chiefly the latterseemed to be broken into fragments and hopelessly intermingled the intricate passages along which they followed their guide had been hewn in some forgotten age out of a darkred crumbly stone on either side were horizontal niches where if they held their torches closely the shape of a human body was discernible in white ashes into which the entire mortality of a man or woman had resolved itself among all this extinct dust there might perchance be a thighbone which crumbled at a touch or possibly a skull grinning at its own wretched plight as is the ugly and empty habit of the thing  sometimes their gloomy pathway tended upward so that through a crevice a little daylight glimmered down upon them or even a streak of sunshine peeped into a burial niche then again they went downward by gradual descent or by abrupt rudely hewn steps into deeper and deeper recesses of the earth here and there the narrow and tortuous passages widened somewhat developing themselves into small chapelswhich once no doubt had been adorned with marblework and lighted with everburning lamps and tapers all such illumination and ornament however had long since been extinguished and stript away except indeed that the low roofs of a few of these ancient sites of worship were covered with dingy stucco and frescoed with scriptural scenes and subjects in the dreariest stage of ruin  in one such chapel the guide showed them a low arch beneath which the body of st cecilia had been buried after her martyrdom and where it lay till a sculptor saw it and rendered it forever beautiful in marble  in a similar spot they found two sarcophagi one containing a skeleton and the other a shrivelled body which still wore the garments of its former lifetime  how dismal all this is said hilda shuddering i do not know why we came here nor why we should stay a moment longer  i hate it all cried donatello with peculiar energy dear friends let us hasten back into the blessed daylight  from the first donatello had shown little fancy for the expedition for like most italians and in especial accordance with the law of his own simple and physically happy nature this young man had an infinite repugnance to graves and skulls and to all that ghastliness which the gothic mind loves to associate with the idea of death he shuddered and looked fearfully round drawing nearer to miriam whose attractive influence alone had enticed him into that gloomy region  what a child you are poor donatello she observed with the freedom which she always used towards him you are afraid of ghosts  yes signorina terribly afraid said the truthful donatello  i also believe in ghosts answered miriam and could tremble at them in a suitable place but these sepulchres are so old and these skulls and white ashes so very dry that methinks they have ceased to be haunted the most awful idea connected with the catacombs is their interminable extent and the possibility of going astray into this labyrinth of darkness which broods around the little glimmer of our tapers  has any one ever been lost here asked kenyon of the guide  surely signor one no longer ago than my fathers time said the guide and he added with the air of a man who believed what he was telling but the first that went astray here was a pagan of old rome who hid himself in order to spy out and betray the blessed saints who then dwelt and worshipped in these dismal places you have heard the story signor a miracle was wrought upon the accursed one and ever since for fifteen centuries at least he has been groping in the darkness seeking his way out of the catacomb  has he ever been seen asked hilda who had great and tremulous faith in marvels of this kind  these eyes of mine never beheld him signorina the saints forbid answered the guide but it is well known that he watches near parties that come into the catacomb especially if they be heretics hoping to lead some straggler astray what this lost wretch pines for almost as much as for the blessed sunshine is a companion to be miserable with him  such an intense desire for sympathy indicates something amiable in the poor fellow at all events observed kenyon  they had now reached a larger chapel than those heretofore seen it was of a circular shape and though hewn out of the solid mass of red sandstone had pillars and a carved roof and other tokens of a regular architectural design nevertheless considered as a church it was exceedingly minute being scarcely twice a mans stature in height and only two or three paces from wall to wall and while their collected torches illuminated this one small consecrated spot the great darkness spread all round it like that immenser mystery which envelops our little life and into which friends vanish from us one by one why where is miriam cried hilda the party gazed hurriedly from face to face and became aware that one of their party had vanished into the great darkness even while they were shuddering at the remote possibility of such a misfortune     chapter iv   the spectre of the catacomb   surely she cannot be lost exclaimed kenyon it is but a moment since she was speaking  no no said hilda in great alarm she was behind us all and it is a long while since we have heard her voice  torches torches cried donatello desperately i will seek her be the darkness ever so dismal  but the guide held him back and assured them all that there was no possibility of assisting their lost companion unless by shouting at the very top of their voices as the sound would go very far along these close and narrow passages there was a fair probability that miriam might hear the call and be able to retrace her steps  accordingly they allkenyon with his bass voice donatello with his tenor the guide with that high and hard italian cry which makes the streets of rome so resonant and hilda with her slender scream piercing farther than the united uproar of the restbegan to shriek halloo and bellow with the utmost force of their lungs and not to prolong the readers suspense for we do not particularly seek to interest him in this scene telling it only on account of the trouble and strange entanglement which followed they soon heard a responsive call in a female voice  it was the signorina cried donatello joyfully  yes it was certainly dear miriams voice said hilda and here she comes thank heaven thank heaven  the figure of their friend was now discernible by her own torchlight approaching out of one of the cavernous passages miriam came forward but not with the eagerness and tremulous joy of a fearful girl just rescued from a labyrinth of gloomy mystery she made no immediate response to their inquiries and tumultuous congratulations and as they afterwards remembered there was something absorbed thoughtful and selfconcentrated in her deportment she looked pale as well she might and held her torch with a nervous grasp the tremor of which was seen in the irregular twinkling of the flame this last was the chief perceptible sign of any recent agitation or alarm  dearest dearest miriam exclaimed hilda throwing her arms about her friend where have you been straying from us blessed be providence which has rescued you out of that miserable darkness  hush dear hilda whispered miriam with a strange little laugh are you quite sure that it was heavens guidance which brought me back if so it was by an odd messenger as you will confess see there he stands  startled at miriams words and manner hilda gazed into the duskiness whither she pointed and there beheld a figure standing just on the doubtful limit of obscurity at the threshold of the small illuminated chapel kenyon discerned him at the same instant and drew nearer with his torch although the guide attempted to dissuade him averring that once beyond the consecrated precincts of the chapel the apparition would have power to tear him limb from limb it struck the sculptor however when he afterwards recurred to these circumstances that the guide manifested no such apprehension on his own account as he professed on behalf of others for he kept pace with kenyon as the latter approached the figure though still endeavoring to restrain him  in fine they both drew near enough to get as good a view of the spectre as the smoky light of their torches struggling with the massive gloom could supply  the stranger was of exceedingly picturesque and even melodramatic aspect he was clad in a voluminous cloak that seemed to be made of a buffalos hide and a pair of those goatskin breeches with the hair outward which are still commonly worn by the peasants of the roman campagna in this garb they look like antique satyrs and in truth the spectre of the catacomb might have represented the last survivor of that vanished race hiding himself in sepulchral gloom and mourning over his lost life of woods and streams  furthermore he had on a broadbrimmed conical hat beneath the shadow of which a wild visage was indistinctly seen floating away as it were into a dusky wilderness of mustache and beard his eyes winked and turned uneasily from the torches like a creature to whom midnight would be more congenial than noonday  on the whole the spectre might have made a considerable impression on the sculptors nerves only that he was in the habit of observing similar figures almost every day reclining on the spanish steps and waiting for some artist to invite them within the magic realm of picture nor even thus familiarized with the strangers peculiarities of appearance could kenyon help wondering to see such a personage shaping himself so suddenly out of the void darkness of the catacomb  what are you said the sculptor advancing his torch nearer and how long have you been wandering here  a thousand and five hundred years muttered the guide loud enough to be heard by all the party it is the old pagan phantom that i told you of who sought to betray the blessed saints  yes it is a phantom cried donatello with a shudder ah dearest signorina what a fearful thing has beset you in those dark corridors  nonsense donatello said the sculptor the man is no more a phantom than yourself the only marvel is how he comes to be hiding himself in the catacomb possibly our guide might solve the riddle  the spectre himself here settled the point of his tangibility at all events and physical substance by approaching a step nearer and laying his hand on kenyons arm  inquire not what i am nor wherefore i abide in the darkness said he in a hoarse harsh voice as if a great deal of damp were clustering in his throat henceforth i am nothing but a shadow behind her footsteps she came to me when i sought her not she has called me forth and must abide the consequences of my reappearance in the world  holy virgin i wish the signorina joy of her prize said the guide half to himself and in any case the catacomb is well rid of him  we need follow the scene no further so much is essential to the subsequent narrative that during the short period while astray in those tortuous passages miriam had encountered an unknown man and led him forth with her or was guided back by him first into the torchlight thence into the sunshine  it was the further singularity of this affair that the connection thus briefly and casually formed did not terminate with the incident that gave it birth as if her service to him or his service to her whichever it might be had given him an indefeasible claim on miriams regard and protection the spectre of the catacomb never long allowed her to lose sight of him from that day forward he haunted her footsteps with more than the customary persistency of italian mendicants when once they have recognized a benefactor for days together it is true he occasionally vanished but always reappeared gliding after her through the narrow streets or climbing the hundred steps of her staircase and sitting at her threshold  being often admitted to her studio he left his features or some shadow or reminiscence of them in many of her sketches and pictures the moral atmosphere of these productions was thereby so influenced that rival painters pronounced it a case of hopeless mannerism which would destroy all miriams prospects of true excellence in art  the story of this adventure spread abroad and made its way beyond the usual gossip of the forestieri even into italian circles where enhanced by a still potent spirit of superstition it grew far more wonderful than as above recounted thence it came back among the anglosaxons and was communicated to the german artists who so richly supplied it with romantic ornaments and excrescences after their fashion that it became a fantasy worthy of tieck or hoffmann for nobody has any conscience about adding to the improbabilities of a marvellous tale  the most reasonable version of the incident that could anywise be rendered acceptable to the auditors was substantially the one suggested by the guide of the catacomb in his allusion to the legend of memmius this man or demon or mandemon was a spy during the persecutions of the early christians probably under the emperor diocletian and penetrated into the catacomb of st calixtus with the malignant purpose of tracing out the hidingplaces of the refugees but while he stole craftily through those dark corridors he chanced to come upon a little chapel where tapers were burning before an altar and a crucifix and a priest was in the performance of his sacred office by divine indulgence there was a single moments grace allowed to memmius during which had he been capable of christian faith and love he might have knelt before the cross and received the holy light into his soul and so have been blest forever but he resisted the sacred impulse as soon therefore as that one moment had glided by the light of the consecrated tapers which represent all truth bewildered the wretched man with everlasting error and the blessed cross itself was stamped as a seal upon his heart so that it should never open to receive conviction  thenceforth this heathen memmius has haunted the wide and dreary precincts of the catacomb seeking as some say to beguile new victims into his own misery but according to other statements endeavoring to prevail on any unwary visitor to take him by the hand and guide him out into the daylight should his wiles and entreaties take effect however the mandemon would remain only a little while above ground he would gratify his fiendish malignity by perpetrating signal mischief on his benefactor and perhaps bringing some old pestilence or other forgotten and longburied evil on society or possibly teaching the modern world some decayed and dusty kind of crime which the antique romans knewand then would hasten back to the catacomb which after so long haunting it has grown his most congenial home  miriam herself with her chosen friends the sculptor and the gentle hilda often laughed at the monstrous fictions that had gone abroad in reference to her adventure her two confidants for such they were on all ordinary subjects had not failed to ask an explanation of the mystery since undeniably a mystery there was and one sufficiently perplexing in itself without any help from the imaginative faculty and sometimes responding to their inquiries with a melancholy sort of playfulness miriam let her fancy run off into wilder fables than any which german ingenuity or italian superstition had contrived  for example with a strange air of seriousness over all her face only belied by a laughing gleam in her dark eyes she would aver that the spectre who had been an artist in his mortal lifetime had promised to teach her a longlost but invaluable secret of old roman fresco painting the knowledge of this process would place miriam at the head of modern art the sole condition being agreed upon that she should return with him into his sightless gloom after enriching a certain extent of stuccoed wall with the most brilliant and lovely designs and what true votary of art would not purchase unrivalled excellence even at so vast a sacrifice  or if her friends still solicited a soberer account miriam replied that meeting the old infidel in one of the dismal passages of the catacomb she had entered into controversy with him hoping to achieve the glory and satisfaction of converting him to the christian faith for the sake of so excellent a result she had even staked her own salvation against his binding herself to accompany him back into his penal gloom if within a twelvemonths space she should not have convinced him of the errors through which he had so long groped and stumbled but alas up to the present time the controversy had gone direfully in favor of the mandemon and miriam as she whispered in hildas ear had awful forebodings that in a few more months she must take an eternal farewell of the sun  it was somewhat remarkable that all her romantic fantasies arrived at this selfsame dreary terminationit appeared impossible for her even to imagine any other than a disastrous result from her connection with her illomened attendant  this singularity might have meant nothing however had it not suggested a despondent state of mind which was likewise indicated by many other tokens miriams friends had no difficulty in perceiving that in one way or another her happiness was very seriously compromised her spirits were often depressed into deep melancholy if ever she was gay it was seldom with a healthy cheerfulness she grew moody moreover and subject to fits of passionate ill temper which usually wreaked itself on the heads of those who loved her best not that miriams indifferent acquaintances were safe from similar outbreaks of her displeasure especially if they ventured upon any allusion to the model in such cases they were left with little disposition to renew the subject but inclined on the other hand to interpret the whole matter as much to her discredit as the least favorable coloring of the facts would allow  it may occur to the reader that there was really no demand for so much rumor and speculation in regard to an incident which might well enough have been explained without going many steps beyond the limits of probability the spectre might have been merely a roman beggar whose fraternity often harbor in stranger shelters than the catacombs or one of those pilgrims who still journey from remote countries to kneel and worship at the holy sites among which these haunts of the early christians are esteemed especially sacred or as was perhaps a more plausible theory he might be a thief of the city a robber of the campagna a political offender or an assassin with blood upon his hand whom the negligence or connivance of the police allowed to take refuge in those subterranean fastnesses where such outlaws have been accustomed to hide themselves from a far antiquity downward or he might have been a lunatic fleeing instinctively from man and making it his dark pleasure to dwell among the tombs like him whose awful cry echoes afar to us from scripture times  and as for the strangers attaching himself so devotedly to miriam her personal magnetism might be allowed a certain weight in the explanation for what remains his pertinacity need not seem so very singular to those who consider how slight a link serves to connect these vagabonds of idle italy with any person that may have the illhap to bestow charity or be otherwise serviceable to them or betray the slightest interest in their fortunes  thus little would remain to be accounted for except the deportment of miriam herself her reserve her brooding melancholy her petulance and moody passion if generously interpreted even these morbid symptoms might have sufficient cause in the stimulating and exhaustive influences of imaginative art exercised by a delicate young woman in the nervous and unwholesome atmosphere of rome such at least was the view of the case which hilda and kenyon endeavored to impress on their own minds and impart to those whom their opinions might influence  one of miriams friends took the matter sadly to heart this was the young italian donatello as we have seen had been an eyewitness of the strangers first appearance and had ever since nourished a singular prejudice against the mysterious dusky deathscented apparition it resembled not so much a human dislike or hatred as one of those instinctive unreasoning antipathies which the lower animals sometimes display and which generally prove more trustworthy than the acutest insight into character the shadow of the model always flung into the light which miriam diffused around her caused no slight trouble to donatello yet he was of a nature so remarkably genial and joyous so simply happy that he might well afford to have something subtracted from his comfort and make tolerable shift to live upon what remained     chapter v   miriams studio   the courtyard and staircase of a palace built three hundred years ago are a peculiar feature of modern rome and interest the stranger more than many things of which he has heard loftier descriptions you pass through the grand breadth and height of a squalid entranceway and perhaps see a range of dusky pillars forming a sort of cloister round the court and in the intervals from pillar to pillar are strewn fragments of antique statues headless and legless torsos and busts that have invariably lost what it might be well if living men could lay aside in that unfragrant atmospherethe nose basreliefs the spoil of some far older palace are set in the surrounding walls every stone of which has been ravished from the coliseum or any other imperial ruin which earlier barbarism had not already levelled with the earth between two of the pillars moreover stands an old sarcophagus without its lid and with all its more prominently projecting sculptures broken off perhaps it once held famous dust and the bony framework of some historic man although now only a receptacle for the rubbish of the courtyard and a halfworn broom  in the centre of the court under the blue italian sky and with the hundred windows of the vast palace gazing down upon it from four sides appears a fountain it brims over from one stone basin to another or gushes from a naiads urn or spurts its many little jets from the mouths of nameless monsters which were merely grotesque and artificial when bernini or whoever was their unnatural father first produced them but now the patches of moss the tufts of grass the trailing maidenhair and all sorts of verdant weeds that thrive in the cracks and crevices of moist marble tell us that nature takes the fountain back into her great heart and cherishes it as kindly as if it were a woodland spring and hark the pleasant murmur the gurgle the plash you might hear just those tinkling sounds from any tiny waterfall in the forest though here they gain a delicious pathos from the stately echoes that reverberate their natural language so the fountain is not altogether glad after all its three centuries at play  in one of the angles of the courtyard a pillared doorway gives access to the staircase with its spacious breadth of low marble steps up which in former times have gone the princes and cardinals of the great roman family who built this palace or they have come down with still grander and loftier mien on their way to the vatican or the quirinal there to put off their scarlet hats in exchange for the triple crown but in fine all these illustrious personages have gone down their hereditary staircase for the last time leaving it to be the thoroughfare of ambassadors english noblemen american millionnaires artists tradesmen washerwomen and people of every degreeall of whom find such gilded and marblepanelled saloons as their pomp and luxury demand or such homely garrets as their necessity can pay for within this one multifarious abode only in not a single nook of the palace built for splendor and the accommodation of a vast retinue but with no vision of a happy fireside or any mode of domestic enjoyment does the humblest or the haughtiest occupant find comfort  up such a staircase on the morning after the scene at the sculpture gallery sprang the light foot of donatello he ascended from story to story passing lofty doorways set within rich frames of sculptured marble and climbing unweariedly upward until the glories of the first piano and the elegance of the middle height were exchanged for a sort of alpine region cold and naked in its aspect steps of rough stone rude wooden balustrades a brick pavement in the passages a dingy whitewash on the walls these were here the palatial features finally he paused before an oaken door on which was pinned a card bearing the name of miriam schaefer artist in oils here donatello knocked and the door immediately fell somewhat ajar its latch having been pulled up by means of a string on the inside passing through a little anteroom he found himself in miriams presence  come in wild faun she said and tell me the latest news from arcady  the artist was not just then at her easel but was busied with the feminine task of mending a pair of gloves  there is something extremely pleasant and even touchingat least of very sweet soft and winning effectin this peculiarity of needlework distinguishing women from men our own sex is incapable of any such byplay aside from the main business of life but womenbe they of what earthly rank they may however gifted with intellect or genius or endowed with awful beautyhave always some little handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant moment a needle is familiar to the fingers of them all a queen no doubt plies it on occasion the woman poet can use it as adroitly as her pen the womans eye that has discovered a new star turns from its glory to send the polished little instrument gleaming along the hem of her kerchief or to darn a casual fray in her dress and they have greatly the advantage of us in this respect the slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with the small familiar gentle interests of life the continually operating influences of which do so much for the health of the character and carry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility a vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric line stretching from the throne to the wicker chair of the humblest seamstress and keeping high and low in a species of communion with their kindred beings methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle characteristics when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied  and when the work falls in a womans lap of its own accord and the needle involuntarily ceases to fly it is a sign of trouble quite as trustworthy as the throb of the heart itself this was what happened to miriam even while donatello stood gazing at her she seemed to have forgotten his presence allowing him to drop out of her thoughts and the torn glove to fall from her idle fingers simple as he was the young man knew by his sympathies that something was amiss  dear lady you are sad said he drawing close to her  it is nothing donatello she replied resuming her work yes a little sad perhaps but that is not strange for us people of the ordinary world especially for women you are of a cheerfuller race my friend and know nothing of this disease of sadness but why do you come into this shadowy room of mine  why do you make it so shadowy asked he  we artists purposely exclude sunshine and all but a partial light said miriam because we think it necessary to put ourselves at odds with nature before trying to imitate her that strikes you very strangely does it not but we make very pretty pictures sometimes with our artfully arranged lights and shadows amuse yourself with some of mine donatello and by and by i shall be in the mood to begin the portrait we were talking about  the room had the customary aspect of a painters studio one of those delightful spots that hardly seem to belong to the actual world but rather to be the outward type of a poets haunted imagination where there are glimpses sketches and halfdeveloped hints of beings and objects grander and more beautiful than we can anywhere find in reality the windows were closed with shutters or deeply curtained except one which was partly open to a sunless portion of the sky admitting only from high upward that partial light which with its strongly marked contrast of shadow is the first requisite towards seeing objects pictorially pencildrawings were pinned against the wall or scattered on the tables unframed canvases turned their backs on the spectator presenting only a blank to the eye and churlishly concealing whatever riches of scenery or human beauty miriams skill had depicted on the other side  in the obscurest part of the room donatello was half startled at perceiving duskily a woman with long dark hair who threw up her arms with a wild gesture of tragic despair and appeared to beckon him into the darkness along with her  do not be afraid donatello said miriam smiling to see him peering doubtfully into the mysterious dusk she means you no mischief nor could perpetrate any if she wished it ever so much it is a lady of exceedingly pliable disposition now a heroine of romance and now a rustic maid yet all for show being created indeed on purpose to wear rich shawls and other garments in a becoming fashion this is the true end of her being although she pretends to assume the most varied duties and perform many parts in life while really the poor puppet has nothing on earth to do upon my word i am satirical unawares and seem to be describing nine women out of ten in the person of my layfigure for most purposes she has the advantage of the sisterhood would i were like her  how it changes her aspect exclaimed donatello to know that she is but a jointed figure when my eyes first fell upon her i thought her arms moved as if beckoning me to help her in some direful peril  are you often troubled with such sinister freaks of fancy asked miriam i should not have supposed it  to tell you the truth dearest signorina answered the young italian i am apt to be fearful in old gloomy houses and in the dark i love no dark or dusky corners except it be in a grotto or among the thick green leaves of an arbor or in some nook of the woods such as i know many in the neighborhood of my home even there if a stray sunbeam steal in the shadow is all the better for its cheerful glimmer  yes you are a faun you know said the fair artist laughing at the remembrance of the scene of the day before but the world is sadly changed nowadays grievously changed poor donatello since those happy times when your race used to dwell in the arcadian woods playing hide and seek with the nymphs in grottoes and nooks of shrubbery you have reappeared on earth some centuries too late  i do not understand you now answered donatello looking perplexed only signorina i am glad to have my lifetime while you live and where you are be it in cities or fields i would fain be there too  i wonder whether i ought to allow you to speak in this way said miriam looking thoughtfully at him many young women would think it behooved them to be offended hilda would never let you speak so i dare say but he is a mere boy she added aside a simple boy putting his boyish heart to the proof on the first woman whom he chances to meet if yonder layfigure had had the luck to meet him first she would have smitten him as deeply as i  are you angry with me asked donatello dolorously  not in the least answered miriam frankly giving him her hand pray look over some of these sketches till i have leisure to chat with you a little i hardly think i am in spirits enough to begin your portrait today  donatello was as gentle and docile as a pet spaniel as playful too in his general disposition or saddening with his mistresss variable mood like that or any other kindly animal which has the faculty of bestowing its sympathies more completely than men or women can ever do accordingly as miriam bade him he tried to turn his attention to a great pile and confusion of pen and ink sketches and pencil drawings which lay tossed together on a table as it chanced however they gave the poor youth little delight  the first that he took up was a very impressive sketch in which the artist had jotted down her rough ideas for a picture of jael driving the nail through the temples of sisera it was dashed off with remarkable power and showed a touch or two that were actually lifelike and deathlike as if miriam had been standing by when jael gave the first stroke of her murderous hammer or as if she herself were jael and felt irresistibly impelled to make her bloody confession in this guise  her first conception of the stern jewess had evidently been that of perfect womanhood a lovely form and a high heroic face of lofty beauty but dissatisfied either with her own work or the terrible story itself miriam had added a certain wayward quirk of her pencil which at once converted the heroine into a vulgar murderess it was evident that a jael like this would be sure to search siseras pockets as soon as the breath was out of his body  in another sketch she had attempted the story of judith which we see represented by the old masters so often and in such various styles here too beginning with a passionate and fiery conception of the subject in all earnestness she had given the last touches in utter scorn as it were of the feelings which at first took such powerful possession of her hand the head of holofernes which by the bye had a pair of twisted mustaches like those of a certain potentate of the day being fairly cut off was screwing its eyes upward and twirling its features into a diabolical grin of triumphant malice which it flung right in judiths face on her part she had the startled aspect that might be conceived of a cook if a calfs head should sneer at her when about to be popped into the dinnerpot  over and over again there was the idea of woman acting the part of a revengeful mischief towards man it was indeed very singular to see how the artists imagination seemed to run on these stories of bloodshed in which womans hand was crimsoned by the stain and how tooin one form or another grotesque or sternly sadshe failed not to bring out the moral that woman must strike through her own heart to reach a human life whatever were the motive that impelled her  one of the sketches represented the daughter of herodias receiving the head of john the baptist in a charger the general conception appeared to be taken from bernardo luinis picture in the uffizzi gallery at florence but miriam had imparted to the saints face a look of gentle and heavenly reproach with sad and blessed eyes fixed upward at the maiden by the force of which miraculous glance her whole womanhood was at once awakened to love and endless remorse  these sketches had a most disagreeable effect on donatellos peculiar temperament he gave a shudder his face assumed a look of trouble fear and disgust he snatched up one sketch after another as if about to tear it in pieces finally shoving away the pile of drawings he shrank back from the table and clasped his hands over his eyes  what is the matter donatello asked miriam looking up from a letter which she was now writing ah i did not mean you to see those drawings they are ugly phantoms that stole out of my mind not things that i created but things that haunt me see here are some trifles that perhaps will please you better  she gave him a portfolio the sketches in which indicated a happier mood of mind and one it is to be hoped more truly characteristic of the artist supposing neither of these classes of subject to show anything of her own individuality miriam had evidently a great scope of fancy and a singular faculty of putting what looked like heart into her productions the latter sketches were domestic and common scenes so finely and subtilely idealized that they seemed such as we may see at any moment and eye where while still there was the indefinable something added or taken away which makes all the difference between sordid life and an earthly paradise the feeling and sympathy in all of them were deep and true there was the scene that comes once in every life of the lover winning the soft and pure avowal of bashful affection from the maiden whose slender form half leans towards his arm half shrinks from it we know not which there was wedded affection in its successive stages represented in a series of delicately conceived designs touched with a holy fire that burned from youth to age in those two hearts and gave one identical beauty to the faces throughout all the changes of feature  there was a drawing of an infants shoe half worn out with the airy print of the blessed foot within a thing that would make a mother smile or weep out of the very depths of her heart and yet an actual mother would not have been likely to appreciate the poetry of the little shoe until miriam revealed it to her it was wonderful the depth and force with which the above and other kindred subjects were depicted and the profound significance which they often acquired the artist still in her fresh youth could not probably have drawn any of these dear and rich experiences from her own life unless perchance that first sketch of all the avowal of maiden affection were a remembered incident and not a prophecy but it is more delightful to believe that from first to last they were the productions of a beautiful imagination dealing with the warm and pure suggestions of a womans heart and thus idealizing a truer and lovelier picture of the life that belongs to woman than an actual acquaintance with some of its hard and dusty facts could have inspired so considered the sketches intimated such a force and variety of imaginative sympathies as would enable miriam to fill her life richly with the bliss and suffering of womanhood however barren it might individually be  there was one observable point indeed betokening that the artist relinquished for her personal self the happiness which she could so profoundly appreciate for others in all those sketches of common life and the affections that spiritualize it a figure was portrayed apart now it peeped between the branches of a shrubbery amid which two lovers sat now it was looking through a frosted window from the outside while a young wedded pair sat at their new fireside within and once it leaned from a chariot which six horses were whirling onward in pomp and pride and gazed at a scene of humble enjoyment by a cottage door always it was the same figure and always depicted with an expression of deep sadness and in every instance slightly as they were brought out the face and form had the traits of miriams own  do you like these sketches better donatello asked miriam yes said donatello rather doubtfully not much i fear responded she laughing and what should a boy like youa faun tooknow about the joys and sorrows the intertwining light and shadow of human life i forgot that you were a faun you cannot suffer deeply therefore you can but half enjoy here now is a subject which you can better appreciate  the sketch represented merely a rustic dance but with such extravagance of fun as was delightful to behold and here there was no drawback except that strange sigh and sadness which always come when we are merriest  i am going to paint the picture in oils said the artist and i want you donatello for the wildest dancer of them all will you sit for me some dayor rather dance for me  o most gladly signorina exclaimed donatello see it shall be like this  and forthwith he began to dance and flit about the studio like an incarnate sprite of jollity pausing at last on the extremity of one toe as if that were the only portion of himself whereby his frisky nature could come in contact with the earth the effect in that shadowy chamber whence the artist had so carefully excluded the sunshine was as enlivening as if one bright ray had contrived to shimmer in and frolic around the walls and finally rest just in the centre of the floor  that was admirable said miriam with an approving smile if i can catch you on my canvas it will be a glorious picture only i am afraid you will dance out of it by the very truth of the representation just when i shall have given it the last touch we will try it one of these days and now to reward you for that jolly exhibition you shall see what has been shown to no one else  she went to her easel on which was placed a picture with its back turned towards the spectator reversing the position there appeared the portrait of a beautiful woman such as one sees only two or three if even so many times in all a lifetime so beautiful that she seemed to get into your consciousness and memory and could never afterwards be shut out but haunted your dreams for pleasure or for pain holding your inner realm as a conquered territory though without deigning to make herself at home there  she was very youthful and had what was usually thought to be a jewish aspect a complexion in which there was no roseate bloom yet neither was it pale dark eyes into which you might look as deeply as your glance would go and still be conscious of a depth that you had not sounded though it lay open to the day she had black abundant hair with none of the vulgar glossiness of other womens sable locks if she were really of jewish blood then this was jewish hair and a dark glory such as crowns no christian maidens head gazing at this portrait you saw what rachel might have been when jacob deemed her worth the wooing seven years and seven more or perchance she might ripen to be what judith was when she vanquished holofernes with her beauty and slew him for too much adoring it  miriam watched donatellos contemplation of the picture and seeing his simple rapture a smile of pleasure brightened on her face mixed with a little scorn at least her lips curled and her eyes gleamed as if she disdained either his admiration or her own enjoyment of it  then you like the picture donatello she asked  o beyond what i can tell he answered so beautifulso beautiful  and do you recognize the likeness  signorina exclaimed donatello turning from the picture to the artist in astonishment that she should ask the question the resemblance is as little to be mistaken as if you had bent over the smooth surface of a fountain and possessed the witchcraft to call forth the image that you made there it is yourself  donatello said the truth and we forebore to speak descriptively of miriams beauty earlier in our narrative because we foresaw this occasion to bring it perhaps more forcibly before the reader  we know not whether the portrait were a flattered likeness probably not regarding it merely as the delineation of a lovely face although miriam like all selfpainters may have endowed herself with certain graces which other eyes might not discern artists are fond of painting their own portraits and in florence there is a gallery of hundreds of them including the most illustrious in all of which there are autobiographical characteristics so to speaktraits expressions loftinesses and amenities which would have been invisible had they not been painted from within yet their reality and truth are none the less miriam in like manner had doubtless conveyed some of the intimate results of her heart knowledge into her own portrait and perhaps wished to try whether they would be perceptible to so simple and natural an observer as donatello  does the expression please you she asked  yes said donatello hesitatingly if it would only smile so like the sunshine as you sometimes do no it is sadder than i thought at first cannot you make yourself smile a little signorina  a forced smile is uglier than a frown said miriam a bright natural smile breaking out over her face even as she spoke  o catch it now cried donatello clapping his hands let it shine upon the picture there it has vanished already and you are sad again very sad and the picture gazes sadly forth at me as if some evil had befallen it in the little time since i looked last  how perplexed you seem my friend answered miriam i really half believe you are a faun there is such a mystery and terror for you in these dark moods which are just as natural as daylight to us people of ordinary mould i advise you at all events to look at other faces with those innocent and happy eyes and never more to gaze at mine  you speak in vain replied the young man with a deeper emphasis than she had ever before heard in his voice shroud yourself in what gloom you will i must needs follow you  well well well said miriam impatiently but leave me now for to speak plainly my good friend you grow a little wearisome i walk this afternoon in the borghese grounds meet me there if it suits your pleasure     chapter vi   the virgins shrine   after donatello had left the studio miriam herself came forth and taking her way through some of the intricacies of the city entered what might be called either a widening of a street or a small piazza the neighborhood comprised a bakers oven emitting the usual fragrance of sour bread a shoe shop a linendrapers shop a pipe and cigar shop a lottery office a station for french soldiers with a sentinel pacing in front and a fruitstand at which a roman matron was selling the dried kernels of chestnuts wretched little figs and some bouquets of yesterday a church of course was near at hand the facade of which ascended into lofty pinnacles whereon were perched two or three winged figures of stone either angelic or allegorical blowing stone trumpets in close vicinity to the upper windows of an old and shabby palace this palace was distinguished by a feature not very common in the architecture of roman edifices that is to say a mediaeval tower square massive lofty and battlemented and machicolated at the summit  at one of the angles of the battlements stood a shrine of the virgin such as we see everywhere at the street corners of rome but seldom or never except in this solitary instance at a height above the ordinary level of mens views and aspirations connected with this old tower and its lofty shrine there is a legend which we cannot here pause to tell but for centuries a lamp has been burning before the virgins image at noon at midnight and at all hours of the twentyfour and must be kept burning forever as long as the tower shall stand or else the tower itself the palace and whatever estate belongs to it shall pass from its hereditary possessor in accordance with an ancient vow and become the property of the church  as miriam approached she looked upward and sawnot indeed the flame of the neverdying lamp which was swallowed up in the broad sunlight that brightened the shrine but a flock of white doves skimming fluttering and wheeling about the topmost height of the tower their silver wings flashing in the pure transparency of the air several of them sat on the ledge of the upper window pushing one another off by their eager struggle for this favorite station and all tapping their beaks and flapping their wings tumultuously against the panes some had alighted in the street far below but flew hastily upward at the sound of the window being thrust ajar and opening in the middle on rusty hinges as roman windows do  a fair young girl dressed in white showed herself at the aperture for a single instant and threw forth as much as her two small hands could hold of some kind of food for the flock of eleemosynary doves it seemed greatly to the taste of the feathered people for they tried to snatch beakfuls of it from her grasp caught it in the air and rushed downward after it upon the pavement  what a pretty scene this is thought miriam with a kindly smile and how like a dove she is herself the fair pure creature the other doves know her for a sister i am sure  miriam passed beneath the deep portal of the palace and turning to the left began to mount flight after flight of a staircase which for the loftiness of its aspiration was worthy to be jacobs ladder or at all events the staircase of the tower of babel the city bustle which is heard even in rome the rumble of wheels over the uncomfortable pavingstones the hard harsh cries reechoing in the high and narrow streets grew faint and died away as the turmoil of the world will always die if we set our faces to climb heavenward higher and higher still and now glancing through the successive windows that threw in their narrow light upon the stairs her view stretched across the roofs of the city unimpeded even by the stateliest palaces only the domes of churches ascend into this airy region and hold up their golden crosses on a level with her eye except that out of the very heart of rome the column of antoninus thrusts itself upward with st paul upon its summit the sole human form that seems to have kept her company  finally the staircase came to an end save that on one side of the little entry where it terminated a flight of a dozen steps gave access to the roof of the tower and the legendary shrine on the other side was a door at which miriam knocked but rather as a friendly announcement of her presence than with any doubt of hospitable welcome for awaiting no response she lifted the latch and entered  what a hermitage you have found for yourself dear hilda she exclaimed you breathe sweet air above all the evil scents of rome and even so in your maiden elevation you dwell above our vanities and passions our moral dust and mud with the doves and the angels for your nearest neighbors i should not wonder if the catholics were to make a saint of you like your namesake of old especially as you have almost avowed yourself of their religion by undertaking to keep the lamp alight before the virgins shrine  no no miriam said hilda who had come joyfully forward to greet her friend you must not call me a catholic a christian girleven a daughter of the puritansmay surely pay honor to the idea of divine womanhood without giving up the faith of her forefathers but how kind you are to climb into my dovecote  it is no trifling proof of friendship indeed answered miriam i should think there were three hundred stairs at least  but it will do you good continued hilda a height of some fifty feet above the roofs of rome gives me all the advantages that i could get from fifty miles of distance the air so exhilarates my spirits that sometimes i feel half inclined to attempt a flight from the top of my tower in the faith that i should float upward  o pray dont try it said miriam laughing if it should turn out that you are less than an angel you would find the stones of the roman pavement very hard and if an angel indeed i am afraid you would never come down among us again  this young american girl was an example of the freedom of life which it is possible for a female artist to enjoy at rome she dwelt in her tower as free to descend into the corrupted atmosphere of the city beneath as one of her companion doves to fly downward into the streetall alone perfectly independent under her own sole guardianship unless watched over by the virgin whose shrine she tended doing what she liked without a suspicion or a shadow upon the snowy whiteness of her fame the customs of artist life bestow such liberty upon the sex which is elsewhere restricted within so much narrower limits and it is perhaps an indication that whenever we admit women to a wider scope of pursuits and professions we must also remove the shackles of our present conventional rules which would then become an insufferable restraint on either maid or wife the system seems to work unexceptionably in rome and in many other cases as in hildas purity of heart and life are allowed to assert themselves and to be their own proof and security to a degree unknown in the society of other cities  hilda in her native land had early shown what was pronounced by connoisseurs a decided genius for the pictorial art even in her schooldaysstill not so very distantshe had produced sketches that were seized upon by men of taste and hoarded as among the choicest treasures of their portfolios scenes delicately imagined lacking perhaps the reality which comes only from a close acquaintance with life but so softly touched with feeling and fancy that you seemed to be looking at humanity with angels eyes with years and experience she might be expected to attain a darker and more forcible touch which would impart to her designs the relief they needed had hilda remained in her own country it is not improbable that she might have produced original works worthy to hang in that gallery of native art which we hope is destined to extend its rich length through many future centuries an orphan however without near relatives and possessed of a little property she had found it within her possibilities to come to italy that central clime whither the eyes and the heart of every artist turn as if pictures could not be made to glow in any other atmosphere as if statues could not assume grace and expression save in that land of whitest marble  hildas gentle courage had brought her safely over land and sea her mild unflagging perseverance had made a place for her in the famous city even like a flower that finds a chink for itself and a little earth to grow in on whatever ancient wall its slender roots may fasten here she dwelt in her tower possessing a friend or two in rome but no home companion except the flock of doves whose cote was in a ruinous chamber contiguous to her own they soon became as familiar with the fairhaired saxon girl as if she were a born sister of their brood and her customary white robe bore such an analogy to their snowy plumage that the confraternity of artists called hilda the dove and recognized her aerial apartment as the dovecote and while the other doves flew far and wide in quest of what was good for them hilda likewise spread her wings and sought such ethereal and imaginative sustenance as god ordains for creatures of her kind  we know not whether the result of her italian studies so far as it could yet be seen will be accepted as a good or desirable one certain it is that since her arrival in the pictorial land hilda seemed to have entirely lost the impulse of original design which brought her thither no doubt the girls early dreams had been of sending forms and hues of beauty into the visible world out of her own mind of compelling scenes of poetry and history to live before mens eyes through conceptions and by methods individual to herself but more and more as she grew familiar with the miracles of art that enrich so many galleries in rome hilda had ceased to consider herself as an original artist no wonder that this change should have befallen her she was endowed with a deep and sensitive faculty of appreciation she had the gift of discerning and worshipping excellence in a most unusual measure no other person it is probable recognized so adequately and enjoyed with such deep delight the pictorial wonders that were here displayed she saw no not saw but felt through and through a picture she bestowed upon it all the warmth and richness of a womans sympathy not by any intellectual effort but by this strength of heart and this guiding light of sympathy she went straight to the central point in which the master had conceived his work thus she viewed it as it were with his own eyes and hence her comprehension of any picture that interested her was perfect  this power and depth of appreciation depended partly upon hildas physical organization which was at once healthful and exquisitely delicate and connected with this advantage she had a command of hand a nicety and force of touch which is an endowment separate from pictorial genius though indispensable to its exercise  it has probably happened in many other instances as it did in hildas case that she ceased to aim at original achievement in consequence of the very gifts which so exquisitely fitted her to profit by familiarity with the works of the mighty old masters reverencing these wonderful men so deeply she was too grateful for all they bestowed upon her too loyal too humble in their awful presence to think of enrolling herself in their society beholding the miracles of beauty which they had achieved the world seemed already rich enough in original designs and nothing more was so desirable as to diffuse those selfsame beauties more widely among mankind all the youthful hopes and ambitions the fanciful ideas which she had brought from home of great pictures to be conceived in her feminine mind were flung aside and so far as those most intimate with her could discern relinquished without a sigh all that she would henceforth attempt and that most reverently not to say religiously was to catch and reflect some of the glory which had been shed upon canvas from the immortal pencils of old  so hilda became a copyist in the pinacotheca of the vatican in the galleries of the pamfilidoria palace the borghese the corsini the sciarra her easel was set up before many a famous picture by guido domenichino raphael and the devout painters of earlier schools than these other artists and visitors from foreign lands beheld the slender girlish figure in front of some worldknown work absorbed unconscious of everything around her seeming to live only in what she sought to do they smiled no doubt at the audacity which led her to dream of copying those mighty achievements but if they paused to look over her shoulder and had sensibility enough to understand what was before their eyes they soon felt inclined to believe that the spirits of the old masters were hovering over hilda and guiding her delicate white hand in truth from whatever realm of bliss and many colored beauty those spirits might descend it would have been no unworthy errand to help so gentle and pure a worshipper of their genius in giving the last divine touch to her repetitions of their works  her copies were indeed marvellous accuracy was not the phrase for them a chinese copy is accurate hildas had that evanescent and ethereal lifethat flitting fragrance as it were of the originalswhich it is as difficult to catch and retain as it would be for a sculptor to get the very movement and varying color of a living man into his marble bust only by watching the efforts of the most skilful copyistsmen who spend a lifetime as some of them do in multiplying copies of a single pictureand observing how invariably they leave out just the indefinable charm that involves the last inestimable value can we understand the difficulties of the task which they undertake  it was not hildas general practice to attempt reproducing the whole of a great picture but to select some high noble and delicate portion of it in which the spirit and essence of the picture culminated the virgins celestial sorrow for example or a hovering angel imbued with immortal light or a saint with the glow of heaven in his dying faceand these would be rendered with her whole soul if a picture had darkened into an indistinct shadow through time and neglect or had been injured by cleaning or retouched by some profane hand she seemed to possess the faculty of seeing it in its pristine glory the copy would come from her hands with what the beholder felt must be the light which the old master had left upon the original in bestowing his final and most ethereal touch in some instances even at least so those believed who best appreciated hildas power and sensibility she had been enabled to execute what the great master had conceived in his imagination but had not so perfectly succeeded in putting upon canvas a result surely not impossible when such depth of sympathy as she possessed was assisted by the delicate skill and accuracy of her slender hand in such cases the girl was but a finer instrument a more exquisitely effective piece of mechanism by the help of which the spirit of some great departed painter now first achieved his ideal centuries after his own earthly hand that other tool had turned to dust  not to describe her as too much a wonder however hilda or the dove as her wellwishers half laughingly delighted to call her had been pronounced by good judges incomparably the best copyist in rome after minute examination of her works the most skilful artists declared that she had been led to her results by following precisely the same process step by step through which the original painter had trodden to the development of his idea other copyistsif such they are worthy to be calledattempt only a superficial imitation copies of the old masters in this sense are produced by thousands there are artists as we have said who spend their lives in painting the works or perhaps one single work of one illustrious painter over and over again thus they convert themselves into guido machines or raphaelic machines their performances it is true are often wonderfully deceptive to a careless eye but working entirely from the outside and seeking only to reproduce the surface these men are sure to leave out that indefinable nothing that inestimable something that constitutes the life and soul through which the picture gets its immortality hilda was no such machine as this she wrought religiously and therefore wrought a miracle  it strikes us that there is something far higher and nobler in all this in her thus sacrificing herself to the devout recognition of the highest excellence in art than there would have been in cultivating her not inconsiderable share of talent for the production of works from her own ideas she might have set up for herself and won no ignoble name she might have helped to fill the already crowded and cumbered world with pictures not destitute of merit but falling short if by ever so little of the best that has been done she might thus have gratified some tastes that were incapable of appreciating raphael but this could be done only by lowering the standard of art to the comprehension of the spectator she chose the better and loftier and more unselfish part laying her individual hopes her fame her prospects of enduring remembrance at the feet of those great departed ones whom she so loved and venerated and therefore the world was the richer for this feeble girl  since the beauty and glory of a great picture are confined within itself she won out that glory by patient faith and selfdevotion and multiplied it for mankind from the dark chill corner of a galleryfrom some curtained chapel in a church where the light came seldom and aslantfrom the princes carefully guarded cabinet where not one eye in thousands was permitted to behold it she brought the wondrous picture into daylight and gave all its magic splendor for the enjoyment of the world hildas faculty of genuine admiration is one of the rarest to be found in human nature and let us try to recompense her in kind by admiring her generous selfsurrender and her brave humble magnanimity in choosing to be the handmaid of those old magicians instead of a minor enchantress within a circle of her own  the handmaid of raphael whom she loved with a virgins love would it have been worth hildas while to relinquish this office for the sake of giving the world a picture or two which it would call original pretty fancies of snow and moonlight the counterpart in picture of so many feminine achievements in literature     chapter vii   beatrice   miriam was glad to find the dove in her turrethome for being endowed with an infinite activity and taking exquisite delight in the sweet labor of which her life was full it was hildas practice to flee abroad betimes and haunt the galleries till dusk happy were those but they were very few whom she ever chose to be the companions of her day they saw the art treasures of rome under her guidance as they had never seen them before not that hilda could dissertate or talk learnedly about pictures she would probably have been puzzled by the technical terms of her own art not that she had much to say about what she most profoundly admired but even her silent sympathy was so powerful that it drew your own along with it endowing you with a secondsight that enabled you to see excellences with almost the depth and delicacy of her own perceptions  all the anglosaxon denizens of rome by this time knew hilda by sight unconsciously the poor child had become one of the spectacles of the eternal city and was often pointed out to strangers sitting at her easel among the wildbearded young men the whitehaired old ones and the shabbily dressed painfully plain women who make up the throng of copyists the old custodes knew her well and watched over her as their own child sometimes a young artist instead of going on with a copy of the picture before which he had placed his easel would enrich his canvas with an original portrait of hilda at her work a lovelier subject could not have been selected nor one which required nicer skill and insight in doing it anything like justice she was pretty at all times in our native new england style with her lightbrown ringlets her delicately tinged but healthful cheek her sensitive intelligent yet most feminine and kindly face but every few moments this pretty and girlish face grew beautiful and striking as some inward thought and feeling brightened rose to the surface and then as it were passed out of sight again so that taking into view this constantly recurring change it really seemed as if hilda were only visible by the sunshine of her soul  in other respects she was a good subject for a portrait being distinguished by a gentle picturesqueness which was perhaps unconsciously bestowed by some minute peculiarity of dress such as artists seldom fail to assume the effect was to make her appear like an inhabitant of pictureland a partly ideal creature not to be handled nor even approached too closely in her feminine self hilda was natural and of pleasant deportment endowed with a mild cheerfulness of temper not overflowing with animal spirits but never long despondent there was a certain simplicity that made every one her friend but it was combined with a subtile attribute of reserve that insensibly kept those at a distance who were not suited to her sphere  miriam was the dearest friend whom she had ever known being a year or two the elder of longer acquaintance with italy and better fitted to deal with its crafty and selfish inhabitants she had helped hilda to arrange her way of life and had encouraged her through those first weeks when rome is so dreary to every newcomer  but how lucky that you are at home today said miriam continuing the conversation which was begun many pages back i hardly hoped to find you though i had a favor to aska commission to put into your charge but what picture is this  see said hilda taking her friends hand and leading her in front of the easel i wanted your opinion of it  if you have really succeeded observed miriam recognizing the picture at the first glance it will be the greatest miracle you have yet achieved  the picture represented simply a female head a very youthful girlish perfectly beautiful face enveloped in white drapery from beneath which strayed a lock or two of what seemed a rich though hidden luxuriance of auburn hair the eyes were large and brown and met those of the spectator but evidently with a strange ineffectual effort to escape there was a little redness about the eyes very slightly indicated so that you would question whether or no the girl had been weeping the whole face was quiet there was no distortion or disturbance of any single feature nor was it easy to see why the expression was not cheerful or why a single touch of the artists pencil should not brighten it into joyousness but in fact it was the very saddest picture ever painted or conceived it involved an unfathomable depth of sorrow the sense of which came to the observer by a sort of intuition it was a sorrow that removed this beautiful girl out of the sphere of humanity and set her in a faroff region the remoteness of whichwhile yet her face is so close before usmakes us shiver as at a spectre  yes hilda said her friend after closely examining the picture you have done nothing else so wonderful as this but by what unheardof solicitations or secret interest have you obtained leave to copy guidos beatrice cenci it is an unexampled favor and the impossibility of getting a genuine copy has filled the roman picture shops with beatrices gay grievous or coquettish but never a true one among them  there has been one exquisite copy i have heard said hilda by an artist capable of appreciating the spirit of the picture it was thompson who brought it away piecemeal being forbidden like the rest of us to set up his easel before it as for me i knew the prince barberini would be deaf to all entreaties so i had no resource but to sit down before the picture day after day and let it sink into my heart i do believe it is now photographed there it is a sad face to keep so close to ones heart only what is so very beautiful can never be quite a pain well after studying it in this way i know not how many times i came home and have done my best to transfer the image to canvas  here it is then said miriam contemplating hildas work with great interest and delight mixed with the painful sympathy that the picture excited everywhere we see oilpaintings crayon sketches cameos engravings lithographs pretending to be beatrice and representing the poor girl with blubbered eyes a leer of coquetry a merry look as if she were dancing a piteous look as if she were beaten and twenty other modes of fantastic mistake but here is guidos very beatrice she that slept in the dungeon and awoke betimes to ascend the scaffold and now that you have done it hilda can you interpret what the feeling is that gives this picture such a mysterious force for my part though deeply sensible of its influence i cannot seize it  nor can i in words replied her friend but while i was painting her i felt all the time as if she were trying to escape from my gaze she knows that her sorrow is so strange and so immense that she ought to be solitary forever both for the worlds sake and her own and this is the reason we feel such a distance between beatrice and ourselves even when our eyes meet hers it is infinitely heartbreaking to meet her glance and to feel that nothing can be done to help or comfort her neither does she ask help or comfort knowing the hopelessness of her case better than we do she is a fallen angelfallen and yet sinless and it is only this depth of sorrow with its weight and darkness that keeps her down upon earth and brings her within our view even while it sets her beyond our reach  you deem her sinless asked miriam that is not so plain to me if i can pretend to see at all into that dim region whence she gazes so strangely and sadly at us beatrices own conscience does not acquit her of something evil and never to be forgiven  sorrow so black as hers oppresses her very nearly as sin would said hilda  then inquired miriam do you think that there was no sin in the deed for which she suffered  ah replied hilda shuddering i really had quite forgotten beatrices history and was thinking of her only as the picture seems to reveal her character yes yes it was terrible guilt an inexpiable crime and she feels it to be so therefore it is that the forlorn creature so longs to elude our eyes and forever vanish away into nothingness her doom is just  o hilda your innocence is like a sharp steel sword exclaimed her friend your judgments are often terribly severe though you seem all made up of gentleness and mercy beatrices sin may not have been so great perhaps it was no sin at all but the best virtue possible in the circumstances if she viewed it as a sin it may have been because her nature was too feeble for the fate imposed upon her ah continued miriam passionately if i could only get within her consciousnessif i could but clasp beatrice cencis ghost and draw it into myself i would give my life to know whether she thought herself innocent or the one great criminal since time began  as miriam gave utterance to these words hilda looked from the picture into her face and was startled to observe that her friends expression had become almost exactly that of the portrait as if her passionate wish and struggle to penetrate poor beatrices mystery had been successful  o for heavens sake miriam do not look so she cried what an actress you are and i never guessed it before ah now you are yourself again she added kissing her leave beatrice to me in future  cover up your magical picture then replied her friend else i never can look away from it it is strange dear hilda how an innocent delicate white soul like yours has been able to seize the subtle mystery of this portrait as you surely must in order to reproduce it so perfectly well we will not talk of it any more do you know i have come to you this morning on a small matter of business will you undertake it for me  o certainly said hilda laughing if you choose to trust me with business  nay it is not a matter of any difficulty answered miriam merely to take charge of this packet and keep it for me awhile  but why not keep it yourself asked hilda  partly because it will be safer in your charge said her friend i am a careless sort of person in ordinary things while you for all you dwell so high above the world have certain little housewifely ways of accuracy and order the packet is of some slight importance and yet it may be i shall not ask you for it again in a week or two you know i am leaving rome you setting at defiance the malarial fever mean to stay here and haunt your beloved galleries through the summer now four months hence unless you hear more from me i would have you deliver the packet according to its address  hilda read the direction it was to signore luca barboni at the plazzo cenci third piano  i will deliver it with my own hand said she precisely four months from today unless you bid me to the contrary perhaps i shall meet the ghost of beatrice in that grim old palace of her forefathers  in that case rejoined miriam do not fail to speak to her and try to win her confidence poor thing she would be all the better for pouring her heart out freely and would be glad to do it if she were sure of sympathy it irks my brain and heart to think of her all shut up within herself she withdrew the cloth that hilda had drawn over the picture and took another long look at it poor sister beatrice for she was still a woman hilda still a sister be her sin or sorrow what they might how well you have done it hilda i knot not whether guido will thank you or be jealous of your rivalship  jealous indeed exclaimed hilda if guido had not wrought through me my pains would have been thrown away  after all resumed miriam if a woman had painted the original picture there might have been something in it which we miss now i have a great mind to undertake a copy myself and try to give it what it lacks well goodby but stay i am going for a little airing to the grounds of the villa borghese this afternoon you will think it very foolish but i always feel the safer in your company hilda slender little maiden as you are will you come  ah not today dearest miriam she replied i have set my heart on giving another touch or two to this picture and shall not stir abroad till nearly sunset  farewell then said her visitor i leave you in your dovecote what a sweet strange life you lead here conversing with the souls of the old masters feeding and fondling your sister doves and trimming the virgins lamp hilda do you ever pray to the virgin while you tend her shrine  sometimes i have been moved to do so replied the dove blushing and lowering her eyes she was a woman once do you think it would be wrong  nay that is for you to judge said miriam but when you pray next dear friend remember me  she went down the long descent of the lower staircase and just as she reached the street the flock of doves again took their hurried flight from the pavement to the topmost window she threw her eyes upward and beheld them hovering about hildas head for after her friends departure the girl had been more impressed than before by something very sad and troubled in her manner she was therefore leaning forth from her airy abode and flinging down a kind maidenly kiss and a gesture of farewell in the hope that these might alight upon miriams heart and comfort its unknown sorrow a little kenyon the sculptor who chanced to be passing the head of the street took note of that ethereal kiss and wished that he could have caught it in the air and got hildas leave to keep it     chapter viii   the suburban villa   donatello while it was still a doubtful question betwixt afternoon and morning set forth to keep the appointment which miriam had carelessly tendered him in the grounds of the villa borghese the entrance to these grounds as all my readers know for everybody nowadays has been in rome is just outside of the porta del popolo passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of michael angelos architecture a minutes walk will transport the visitor from the small uneasy lava stones of the roman pavement into broad gravelled carriagedrives whence a little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion a seclusion but seldom a solitude for priest noble and populace stranger and native all who breathe roman air find free admission and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the daydream that they call life  but donatellos enjoyment was of a livelier kind he soon began to draw long and delightful breaths among those shadowy walks judging by the pleasure which the sylvan character of the scene excited in him it might be no merely fanciful theory to set him down as the kinsman not far remote of that wild sweet playful rustic creature to whose marble image he bore so striking a resemblance how mirthful a discovery would it be and yet with a touch of pathos in it if the breeze which sported fondly with his clustering locks were to waft them suddenly aside and show a pair of leafshaped furry ears what an honest strain of wildness would it indicate and into what regions of rich mystery would it extend donatellos sympathies to be thus linked and by no monstrous chain with what we call the inferior trioes of being whose simplicity mingled with his human intelligence might partly restore what man has lost of the divine  the scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself in the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths and fancy a brighter sky a softer turf a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world the ilextrees so ancient and timehonored were they seemed to have lived for ages undisturbed and to feel no dread of profanation by the axe any more than overthrow by the thunderstroke it had already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they were grievously imperilled by the gauls last assault upon the walls of rome as if confident in the long peace of their lifetime they assumed attitudes of indolent repose they leaned over the green turf in ponderous grace throwing abroad their great branches without danger of interfering with other trees though other majestic trees grew near enough for dignified society but too distant for constraint never was there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their sheltering boughs never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening the gentle gloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the swelling and subsiding lawns  in other portions of the grounds the stonepines lifted their dense clump of branches upon a slender length of stem so high that they looked like green islands in the air flinging down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it again there were avenues of cypress resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of cheerful radiance the more open spots were all abloom even so early in the season with anemones of wondrous size both white and rosecolored and violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance even if their blue eyes failed to meet your own daisies too were abundant but larger than the modest little english flower and therefore of small account  these wooded and flowery lawns are more beautiful than the finest of english park scenery more touching more impressive through the neglect that leaves nature so much to her own ways and methods since man seldom interferes with her she sets to work in her quiet way and makes herself at home there is enough of human care it is true bestowed long ago and still bestowed to prevent wildness from growing into deformity and the result is an ideal landscape a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of the poets mind if the ancient faun were other than a mere creation of old poetry and could have reappeared anywhere it must have been in such a scene as this  in the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble basins the depths of which are shaggy with waterweeds or they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock sending their murmur afar to make the quiet and silence more appreciable scattered here and there with careless artifice stand old altars bearing roman inscriptions statues gray with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hide and half reveal themselves high on pedestals or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf terminal figures columns of marble or granite porticos arches are seen in the vistas of the woodpaths either veritable relics of antiquity or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on them that they are better than if really antique at all events grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples and clamber at large over their pediments as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there  what a strange ideawhat a needless laborto construct artificial ruins in rome the native soil of ruin but even these sportive imitations wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples and palaces are perhaps centuries old and beginning as illusions have grown to be venerable in sober earnest the result of all is a scene pensive lovely dreamlike enjoyable and sad such as is to be found nowhere save in these princely villaresidences in the neighborhood of rome a scene that must have required generations and ages during which growth decay and mans intelligence wrought kindly together to render it so gently wild as we behold it now  the final charm is bestowed by the malaria there is a piercing thrilling delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown away or only enjoyable at its halfdevelopment in winter and early spring and never to be dwelt amongst as the home scenery of any human being for if you come hither in summer and stray through these glades in the golden sunset fever walks arm in arm with you and death awaits you at the end of the dim vista thus the scene is like eden in its loveliness like eden too in the fatal spell that removes it beyond the scope of mans actual possessions but donatello felt nothing of this dreamlike melancholy that haunts the spot as he passed among the sunny shadows his spirit seemed to acquire new elasticity the flicker of the sunshine the sparkle of the fountains gush the dance of the leaf upon the bough the woodland fragrance the green freshness the old sylvan peace and freedom were all intermingled in those long breaths which he drew  the ancient dust the mouldiness of rome the dead atmosphere in which he had wasted so many months the hard pavements the smell of ruin and decaying generations the chill palaces the convent bells the heavy incense of altars the life that he had led in those dark narrow streets among priests soldiers nobles artists and womenall the sense of these things rose from the young mans consciousness like a cloud which had darkened over him without his knowing how densely  he drank in the natural influences of the scene and was intoxicated as by an exhilarating wine he ran races with himself along the gleam and shadow of the woodpaths he leapt up to catch the overhanging bough of an ilex and swinging himself by it alighted far onward as if he had flown thither through the air in a sudden rapture he embraced the trunk of a sturdy tree and seemed to imagine it a creature worthy of affection and capable of a tender response he clasped it closely in his arms as a faun might have clasped the warm feminine grace of the nymph whom antiquity supposed to dwell within that rough encircling rind then in order to bring himself closer to the genial earth with which his kindred instincts linked him so strongly he threw himself at full length on the turf and pressed down his lips kissing the violets and daisies which kissed him back again though shyly in their maiden fashion  while he lay there it was pleasant to see how the green and blue lizards who had beta basking on some rock or on a fallen pillar that absorbed the warmth of the sun scrupled not to scramble over him with their small feet and how the birds alighted on the nearest twigs and sang their little roundelays unbroken by any chirrup of alarm they recognized him it may be as something akin to themselves or else they fancied that he was rooted and grew there for these wild pets of nature dreaded him no more in his buoyant life than if a mound of soil and grass and flowers had long since covered his dead body converting it back to the sympathies from which human existence had estranged it  all of us after a long abode in cities have felt the blood gush more joyously through our veins with the first breath of rural air few could feel it so much as donatello a creature of simple elements bred in the sweet sylvan life of tuscany and for months back dwelling amid the mouldy gloom and dim splendor of old rome nature has been shut out for numberless centuries from those stonyhearted streets to which he had latterly grown accustomed there is no trace of her except for what blades of grass spring out of the pavements of the less trodden piazzas or what weeds cluster and tuft themselves on the cornices of ruins therefore his joy was like that of a child that had gone astray from home and finds him suddenly in his mothers arms again  at last deeming it full time for miriam to keep her tryst he climbed to the tiptop of the tallest tree and thence looked about him swaying to and fro in the gentle breeze which was like the respiration of that great leafy living thing donatello saw beneath him the whole circuit of the enchanted ground the statues and columns pointing upward from among the shrubbery the fountains flashing in the sunlight the paths winding hither and thither and continually finding out some nook of new and ancient pleasantness he saw the villa too with its marble front incrusted all over with basreliefs and statues in its many niches it was as beautiful as a fairy palace and seemed an abode in which the lord and lady of this fair domain might fitly dwell and come forth each morning to enjoy as sweet a life as their happiest dreams of the past night could have depicted all this he saw but his first glance had taken in too wide a sweep and it was not till his eyes fell almost directly beneath him that donatello beheld miriam just turning into the path that led across the roots of his very tree  he descended among the foliage waiting for her to come close to the trunk and then suddenly dropped from an impending bough and alighted at her side it was as if the swaying of the branches had let a ray of sunlight through the same ray likewise glimmered among the gloomy meditations that encompassed miriam and lit up the pale dark beauty of her face while it responded pleasantly to donatellos glance  i hardly know said she smiling whether you have sprouted out of the earth or fallen from the clouds in either case you are welcome  and they walked onward together     chapter ix   the faun and nymph   miriams sadder mood it might be had at first an effect on donatellos spirits it checked the joyous ebullition into which they would otherwise have effervesced when he found himself in her society not as heretofore in the old gloom of rome but under that bright soft sky and in those arcadian woods he was silent for a while it being indeed seldom donatellos impulse to express himself copiously in words his usual modes of demonstration were by the natural language of gesture the instinctive movement of his agile frame and the unconscious play of his features which within a limited range of thought and emotion would speak volumes in a moment  by and by his own mood seemed to brighten miriams and was reflected back upon himself he began inevitably as it were to dance along the woodpath flinging himself into attitudes of strange comic grace often too he ran a little way in advance of his companion and then stood to watch her as she approached along the shadowy and sunfleckered path with every step she took he expressed his joy at her nearer and nearer presence by what might be thought an extravagance of gesticulation but which doubtless was the language of the natural man though laid aside and forgotten by other men now that words have been feebly substituted in the place of signs and symbols he gave miriam the idea of a being not precisely man nor yet a child but in a high and beautiful sense an animal a creature in a state of development less than what mankind has attained yet the more perfect within itself for that very deficiency this idea filled her mobile imagination with agreeable fantasies which after smiling at them herself she tried to convey to the young man  what are you my friend she exclaimed always keeping in mind his singular resemblance to the faun of the capitol if you are in good truth that wild and pleasant creature whose face you wear pray make me known to your kindred they will be found hereabouts if anywhere knock at the rough rind of this ilextree and summon forth the dryad ask the waternymph to rise dripping from yonder fountain and exchange a moist pressure of the hand with me do not fear that i shall shrink even if one of your rough cousins a hairy satyr should come capering on his goatlegs out of the haunts of far antiquity and propose to dance with me among these lawns and will not bacchuswith whom you consorted so familiarly of old and who loved you so wellwill he not meet us here and squeeze rich grapes into his cup for you and me  donatello smiled he laughed heartily indeed in sympathy with the mirth that gleamed out of miriams deep dark eyes but he did not seem quite to understand her mirthful talk nor to be disposed to explain what kind of creature he was or to inquire with what divine or poetic kindred his companion feigned to link him he appeared only to know that miriam was beautiful and that she smiled graciously upon him that the present moment was very sweet and himself most happy with the sunshine the sylvan scenery and womans kindly charm which it enclosed within its small circumference it was delightful to see the trust which he reposed in miriam and his pure joy in her propinquity he asked nothing sought nothing save to be near the beloved object and brimmed over with ecstasy at that simple boon a creature of the happy tribes below us sometimes shows the capacity of this enjoyment a man seldom or never  donatello said miriam looking at him thoughtfully but amused yet not without a shade of sorrow you seem very happy what makes you so  because i love you answered donatello  he made this momentous confession as if it were the most natural thing in the world and on her partsuch was the contagion of his simplicitymiriam heard it without anger or disturbance though with no responding emotion it was as if they had strayed across the limits of arcadia and come under a civil polity where young men might avow their passion with as little restraint as a bird pipes its note to a similar purpose  why should you love me foolish boy said she we have no points of sympathy at all there are not two creatures more unlike in this wide world than you and i  you are yourself and i am donatello replied he therefore i love you there needs no other reason  certainly there was no better or more explicable reason it might have been imagined that donatellos unsophisticated heart would be more readily attracted to a feminine nature of clear simplicity like his own than to one already turbid with grief or wrong as miriams seemed to be perhaps on the other hand his character needed the dark element which it found in her the force and energy of will that sometimes flashed through her eyes may have taken him captive or not improbably the varying lights and shadows of her temper now so mirthful and anon so sad with mysterious gloom had bewitched the youth analyze the matter as we may the reason assigned by donatello himself was as satisfactory as we are likely to attain  miriam could not think seriously of the avowal that had passed he held out his love so freely in his open palm that she felt it could be nothing but a toy which she might play with for an instant and give back again and yet donatellos heart was so fresh a fountain that had miriam been more worldworn than she was she might have found it exquisite to slake her thirst with the feelings that welled up and brimmed over from it she was far very far from the dusty mediaeval epoch when some women have a taste for such refreshment even for her however there was an inexpressible charm in the simplicity that prompted donatellos words and deeds though unless she caught them in precisely the true light they seemed but folly the offspring of a maimed or imperfectly developed intellect alternately she almost admired or wholly scorned him and knew not which estimate resulted from the deeper appreciation but it could not she decided for herself be other than an innocent pastime if they twosure to be separated by their different paths in life tomorrowwere to gather up some of the little pleasures that chanced to grow about their feet like the violets and woodanemones today  yet an impulse of rectitude impelled miriam to give him what she still held to be a needless warning against an imaginary peril  if you were wiser donatello you would think me a dangerous person said she if you follow my footsteps they will lead you to no good you ought to be afraid of me  i would as soon think of fearing the air we breathe he replied  and well you may for it is full of malaria said miriam she went on hinting at an intangible confession such as persons with overburdened hearts often make to children or dumb animals or to holes in the earth where they think their secrets may be at once revealed and buried those who come too near me are in danger of great mischiefs i do assure you take warning therefore it is a sad fatality that has brought you from your home among the apenninessome rusty old castle i suppose with a village at its foot and an arcadian environment of vineyards figtrees and olive orchardsa sad mischance i say that has transported you to my side you have had a happy life hitherto have you not donatello  o yes answered the young man and though not of a retrospective turn he made the best effort he could to send his mind back into the past i remember thinking it happiness to dance with the contadinas at a village feast to taste the new sweet wine at vintagetime and the old ripened wine which our podere is famous for in the cold winter evenings and to devour great luscious figs and apricots peaches cherries and melons i was often happy in the woods too with hounds and horses and very happy in watching all sorts of creatures and birds that haunt the leafy solitudes but never half so happy as now  in these delightful groves she asked  here and with you answered donatello just as we are now  what a fulness of content in him how silly and how delightful said miriam to herself then addressing him again but donatello how long will this happiness last  how long he exclaimed for it perplexed him even more to think of the future than to remember the past why should it have any end how long forever forever forever  the child the simpleton said miriam with sudden laughter and checking it as suddenly but is he a simpleton indeed here in those few natural words he has expressed that deep sense that profound conviction of its own immortality which genuine love never fails to bring he perplexes meyes and bewitches mewild gentle beautiful creature that he is it is like playing with a young greyhound  her eyes filled with tears at the same time that a smile shone out of them then first she became sensible of a delight and grief at once in feeling this zephyr of a new affection with its untainted freshness blow over her weary stifled heart which had no right to be revived by it the very exquisiteness of the enjoyment made her know that it ought to be a forbidden one  donatello she hastily exclaimed for your own sake leave me it is not such a happy thing as you imagine it to wander in these woods with me a girl from another land burdened with a doom that she tells to none i might make you dread meperhaps hate meif i chose and i must choose if i find you loving me too well  i fear nothing said donatello looking into her unfathomable eyes with perfect trust i love always  i speak in vain thought miriam within herself  well then for this one hour let me be such as he imagines me tomorrow will be time enough to come back to my reality my reality what is it is the past so indestructible the future so immitigable is the dark dream in which i walk of such solid stony substance that there can be no escape out of its dungeon be it so there is at least that ethereal quality in my spirit that it can make me as gay as donatello himselffor this one hour  and immediately she brightened up as if an inward flame heretofore stifled were now permitted to fill her with its happy lustre glowing through her cheeks and dancing in her eyebeams  donatello brisk and cheerful as he seemed before showed a sensibility to miriams gladdened mood by breaking into still wilder and evervarying activity he frisked around her bubbling over with joy which clothed itself in words that had little individual meaning and in snatches of song that seemed as natural as bird notes then they both laughed together and heard their own laughter returning in the echoes and laughed again at the response so that the ancient and solemn grove became full of merriment for these two blithe spirits a bird happening to sing cheerily donatello gave a peculiar call and the little feathered creature came fluttering about his head as if it had known him through many summers  how close he stands to nature said miriam observing this pleasant familiarity between her companion and the bird he shall make me as natural as himself for this one hour  as they strayed through that sweet wilderness she felt more and more the influence of his elastic temperament miriam was an impressible and impulsive creature as unlike herself in different moods as if a melancholy maiden and a glad one were both bound within the girdle about her waist and kept in magic thraldom by the brooch that clasped it naturally it is true she was the more inclined to melancholy yet fully capable of that high frolic of the spirits which richly compensates for many gloomy hours if her soul was apt to lurk in the darkness of a cavern she could sport madly in the sunshine before the caverns mouth except the freshest mirth of animal spirits like donatellos there is no merriment no wild exhilaration comparable to that of melancholy people escaping from the dark region in which it is their custom to keep themselves imprisoned  so the shadowy miriam almost outdid donatello on his own ground they ran races with each other side by side with shouts and laughter they pelted one another with early flowers and gathering them up twined them with green leaves into garlands for both their heads they played together like children or creatures of immortal youth so much had they flung aside the sombre habitudes of daily life that they seemed born to be sportive forever and endowed with eternal mirthfulness instead of any deeper joy it was a glimpse far backward into arcadian life or further still into the golden age before mankind was burdened with sin and sorrow and before pleasure had been darkened with those shadows that bring it into high relief and make it happiness  hark cried donatello stopping short as he was about to bind miriams fair hands with flowers and lead her along in triumph there is music somewhere in the grove  it is your kinsman pan most likely said miriam playing on his pipe let us go seek him and make him puff out his rough cheeks and pipe his merriest air come the strain of music will guide us onward like a gayly colored thread of silk  or like a chain of flowers responded donatello drawing her along by that which he had twined this waycome     chapter x   the sylvan dance   as the music came fresher on their ears they danced to its cadence extemporizing new steps and attitudes each varying movement had a grace which might have been worth putting into marble for the long delight of days to come but vanished with the movement that gave it birth and was effaced from memory by another in miriams motion freely as she flung herself into the frolic of the hour there was still an artful beauty in donatellos there was a charm of indescribable grotesqueness hand in hand with grace sweet bewitching most provocative of laughter and yet akin to pathos so deeply did it touch the heart this was the ultimate peculiarity the final touch distinguishing between the sylvan creature and the beautiful companion at his side setting apart only this miriam resembled a nymph as much as donatello did a faun  there were flitting moments indeed when she played the sylvan character as perfectly as he catching glimpses of her then you would have fancied that an oak had sundered its rough bark to let her dance freely forth endowed with the same spirit in her human form as that which rustles in the leaves or that she had emerged through the pebbly bottom of a fountain a waternymph to play and sparkle in the sunshine flinging a quivering light around her and suddenly disappearing in a shower of rainbow drops  as the fountain sometimes subsides into its basin so in miriam there were symptoms that the frolic of her spirits would at last tire itself out  ah donatello cried she laughing as she stopped to take a breath you have an unfair advantage over me i am no true creature of the woods while you are a real faun i do believe when your curls shook just now methought i had a peep at the pointed ears  donatello snapped his fingers above his head as fauns and satyrs taught us first to do and seemed to radiate jollity out of his whole nimble person nevertheless there was a kind of dim apprehension in his face as if he dreaded that a moments pause might break the spell and snatch away the sportive companion whom he had waited for through so many dreary months  dance dance cried he joyously if we take breath we shall be as we were yesterday there now is the music just beyond this clump of trees dance miriam dance  they had now reached an open grassy glade of which there are many in that artfully constructed wilderness set round with stone seats on which the aged moss had kindly essayed to spread itself instead of cushions on one of the stone benches sat the musicians whose strains had enticed our wild couple thitherward they proved to be a vagrant band such as rome and all italy abounds with comprising a harp a flute and a violin which though greatly the worse for wear the performers had skill enough to provoke and modulate into tolerable harmony it chanced to be a feastday and instead of playing in the sunscorched piazzas of the city or beneath the windows of some unresponsive palace they had bethought themselves to try the echoes of these woods for on the festas of the church rome scatters its merrymakers all abroad ripe for the dance or any other pastime  as miriam and donatello emerged from among the trees the musicians scraped tinkled or blew each according to his various kind of instrument more inspiringly than ever a darkchecked little girl with bright black eyes stood by shaking a tambourine set round with tinkling bells and thumping it on its parchment head without interrupting his brisk though measured movement donatello snatched away this unmelodious contrivance and flourishing it above his head produced music of indescribable potency still dancing with frisky step and striking the tambourine and ringing its little bells all in one jovial act  it might be that there was magic in the sound or contagion at least in the spirit which had got possession of miriam and himself for very soon a number of festal people were drawn to the spot and struck into the dance singly or in pairs as if they were all gone mad with jollity among them were some of the plebeian damsels whom we meet bareheaded in the roman streets with silver stilettos thrust through their glossy hair the contadinas too from the campagna and the villages with their rich and picturesque costumes of scarlet and all bright hues such as fairer maidens might not venture to put on then came the modern roman from trastevere perchance with his old cloak drawn about him like a toga which anon as his active motion heated him he flung aside three french soldiers capered freely into the throng in wide scarlet trousers their short swords dangling at their sides and three german artists in gray flaccid hats and flaunting beards and one of the popes swiss guardsmen in the strange motley garb which michael angelo contrived for them two young english tourists one of them a lord took contadine partners and dashed in as did also a shaggy man in goatskin breeches who looked like rustic pan in person and footed it as merrily as he besides the above there was a herdsman or two from the campagna and a few peasants in skyblue jackets and smallclothes tied with ribbons at the knees haggard and sallow were these last poor serfs having little to eat and nothing but the malaria to breathe but still they plucked up a momentary spirit and joined hands in donatellos dance  here as it seemed had the golden age come back again within the precincts of this sunny glade thawing mankind out of their cold formalities releasing them from irksome restraint mingling them together in such childlike gayety that new flowers of which the old bosom of the earth is full sprang up beneath their footsteps the sole exception to the geniality of the moment as we have understood was seen in a countryman of our own who sneered at the spectacle and declined to compromise his dignity by making part of it  the harper thrummed with rapid fingers the violin player flashed his bow back and forth across the strings the flautist poured his breath in quick puffs of jollity while donatello shook the tambourine above his head and led the merry throng with unweariable steps as they followed one another in a wild ring of mirth it seemed the realization of one of those basreliefs where a dance of nymphs satyrs or bacchanals is twined around the circle of an antique vase or it was like the sculptured scene on the front and sides of a sarcophagus where as often as any other device a festive procession mocks the ashes and white bones that are treasured up within you might take it for a marriage pageant but after a while if you look at these merrymakers following them from end to end of the marble coffin you doubt whether their gay movement is leading them to a happy close a youth has suddenly fallen in the dance a chariot is overturned and broken flinging the charioteer headlong to the ground a maiden seems to have grown faint or weary and is drooping on the bosom of a friend always some tragic incident is shadowed forth or thrust sidelong into the spectacle and when once it has caught your eye you can look no more at the festal portions of the scene except with reference to this one slightly suggested doom and sorrow  as in its mirth so in the darker characteristic here alluded to there was an analogy between the sculptured scene on the sarcophagus and the wild dance which we have been describing in the midst of its madness and riot miriam found herself suddenly confronted by a strange figure that shook its fantastic garments in the air and pranced before her on its tiptoes almost vying with the agility of donatello himself it was the model  a moment afterwards donatello was aware that she had retired from the dance he hastened towards her and flung himself on the grass beside the stone bench on which miriam was sitting but a strange distance and unapproachableness had all at once enveloped her and though he saw her within reach of his arm yet the light of her eyes seemed as far off as that of a star nor was there any warmth in the melancholy smile with which she regarded him  come back cried he why should this happy hour end so soon  it must end here donatello said she in answer to his words and outstretched hand and such hours i believe do not often repeat themselves in a lifetime let me go my friend let me vanish from you quietly among the shadows of these trees see the companions of our pastime are vanishing already  whether it was that the harpstrings were broken the violin out of tune or the flautist out of breath so it chanced that the music had ceased and the dancers come abruptly to a pause all that motley throng of rioters was dissolved as suddenly as it had been drawn together in miriams remembrance the scene had a character of fantasy it was as if a company of satyrs fauns and nymphs with pan in the midst of them had been disporting themselves in these venerable woods only a moment ago and now in another moment because some profane eye had looked at them too closely or some intruder had cast a shadow on their mirth the sylvan pageant had utterly disappeared if a few of the merrymakers lingered among the trees they had hidden their racy peculiarities under the garb and aspect of ordinary people and sheltered themselves in the weary commonplace of daily life just an instant before it was arcadia and the golden age the spell being broken it was now only that old tract of pleasure ground close by the peoples gate of romea tract where the crimes and calamities of ages the many battles blood recklessly poured out and deaths of myriads have corrupted all the soil creating an influence that makes the air deadly to human lungs  you must leave me said miriam to donatello more imperatively than before have i not said it go and look not behind you  miriam whispered donatello grasping her hand forcibly who is it that stands in the shadow yonder beckoning you to follow him  hush leave me repeated miriam your hour is past his hour has come  donatello still gazed in the direction which he had indicated and the expression of his face was fearfully changed being so disordered perhaps with terrorat all events with anger and invincible repugnancethat miriam hardly knew him his lips were drawn apart so as to disclose his set teeth thus giving him a look of animal rage which we seldom see except in persons of the simplest and rudest natures a shudder seemed to pass through his very bones  i hate him muttered he  be satisfied i hate him too said miriam  she had no thought of making this avowal but was irresistibly drawn to it by the sympathy of the dark emotion in her own breast with that so strongly expressed by donatello two drops of water or of blood do not more naturally flow into each other than did her hatred into his  shall i clutch him by the throat whispered donatello with a savage scowl bid me do so and we are rid of him forever  in heavens name no violence exclaimed miriam affrighted out of the scornful control which she had hitherto held over her companion by the fierceness that he so suddenly developed o have pity on me donatello if for nothing else yet because in the midst of my wretchedness i let myself be your playmate for this one wild hour follow me no farther henceforth leave me to my doom dear friendkind simple loving friendmake me not more wretched by the remembrance of having thrown fierce hates or loves into the wellspring of your happy life  not follow you repeated donatello soothed from anger into sorrow less by the purport of what she said than by the melancholy sweetness of her voicenot follow you what other path have i  we will talk of it once again said miriam still soothingly soontomorrow when you will only leave me now     chapter xi   fragmentary sentences   in the borghese grove so recently uproarious with merriment and music there remained only miriam and her strange follower  a solitude had suddenly spread itself around them it perhaps symbolized a peculiar character in the relation of these two insulating them and building up an insuperable barrier between their lifestreams and other currents which might seem to flow in close vicinity for it is one of the chief earthly incommodities of some species of misfortune or of a great crime that it makes the actor in the one or the sufferer of the other an alien in the world by interposing a wholly unsympathetic medium betwixt himself and those whom he yearns to meet  owing it may be to this moral estrangementthis chill remoteness of their positionthere have come to us but a few vague whisperings of what passed in miriams interview that afternoon with the sinister personage who had dogged her footsteps ever since the visit to the catacomb in weaving these mystic utterances into a continuous scene we undertake a task resembling in its perplexity that of gathering up and piecing together the fragments ora letter which has been torn and scattered to the winds many words of deep significance many entire sentences and those possibly the most important ones have flown too far on the winged breeze to be recovered if we insert our own conjectural amendments we perhaps give a purport utterly at variance with the true one yet unless we attempt something in this way there must remain an unsightly gap and a lack of continuousness and dependence in our narrative so that it would arrive at certain inevitable catastrophes without due warning of their imminence  of so much we are sure that there seemed to be a sadly mysterious fascination in the influence of this illomened person over miriam it was such as beasts and reptiles of subtle and evil nature sometimes exercise upon their victims marvellous it was to see the hopelessness with which being naturally of so courageous a spirit she resigned herself to the thraldom in which he held her that iron chain of which some of the massive links were round her feminine waist and the others in his ruthless handor which perhaps bound the pair together by a bond equally torturing to eachmust have been forged in some such unhallowed furnace as is only kindled by evil passions and fed by evil deeds  yet let us trust there may have been no crime in miriam but only one of those fatalities which are among the most insoluble riddles propounded to mortal comprehension the fatal decree by which every crime is made to be the agony of many innocent persons as well as of the single guilty one  it was at any rate but a feeble and despairing kind of remonstrance which she had now the energy to oppose against his persecution  you follow me too closely she said in low faltering accents you allow me too scanty room to draw my breath do you know what will be the end of this i know well what must be the end he replied  tell me then said miriam that i may compare your foreboding with my own mine is a very dark one  there can be but one result and that soon answered the model you must throw off your present mask and assume another you must vanish out of the scene quit rome with me and leave no trace whereby to follow you it is in my power as you well know to compel your acquiescence in my bidding you are aware of the penalty of a refusal  not that penalty with which you would terrify me said miriam another there may be but not so grievous what is that other he inquired death simply death she answered death said her persecutor is not so simple and opportune a thing as you imagine you are strong and warm with life sensitive and irritable as your spirit is these many months of trouble this latter thraldom in which i hold you have scarcely made your cheek paler than i saw it in your girlhood miriamfor i forbear to speak another name at which these leaves would shiver above our headsmiriam you cannot die  might not a dagger find my heart said she for the first time meeting his eyes would not poison make an end of me will not the tiber drown me  it might he answered for i allow that you are mortal but miriam believe me it is not your fate to die while there remains so much to be sinned and suffered in the world we have a destiny which we must needs fulfil together i too have struggled to escape it i was as anxious as yourself to break the tie between usto bury the past in a fathomless graveto make it impossible that we should ever meet until you confront me at the bar of judgment you little can imagine what steps i took to render all this secure and what was the result our strange interview in the bowels of the earth convinced me of the futility of my design  ah fatal chance cried miriam covering her face with her hands  yes your heart trembled with horror when you recognized me rejoined he but you did not guess that there was an equal horror in my own  why would not the weight of earth above our heads have crumbled down upon us both forcing us apart but burying us equally cried miriam in a burst of vehement passion o that we could have wandered in those dismal passages till we both perished taking opposite paths in the darkness so that when we lay down to die our last breaths might not mingle  it were vain to wish it said the model in all that labyrinth of midnight paths we should have found one another out to live or die together our fates cross and are entangled the threads are twisted into a strong cord which is dragging us to an evil doom could the knots be severed we might escape but neither can your slender fingers untie these knots nor my masculine force break them we must submit  pray for rescue as i have exclaimed miriam pray for deliverance from me since i am your evil genius as you mine dark as your life has been i have known you to pray in times past  at these words of miriam a tremor and horror appeared to seize upon her persecutor insomuch that he shook and grew ashy pale before her eyes in this mans memory there was something that made it awful for him to think of prayer nor would any torture be more intolerable than to be reminded of such divine comfort and succor as await pious souls merely for the asking this torment was perhaps the token of a native temperament deeply susceptible of religious impressions but which had been wronged violated and debased until at length it was capable only of terror from the sources that were intended for our purest and loftiest consolation he looked so fearfully at her and with such intense pain struggling in his eyes that miriam felt pity  and now all at once it struck her that he might be mad it was an idea that had never before seriously occurred to her mind although as soon as suggested it fitted marvellously into many circumstances that lay within her knowledge but alas such was her evil fortune that whether mad or no his power over her remained the same and was likely to be used only the more tyrannously if exercised by a lunatic  i would not give you pain she said soothingly your faith allows you the consolations of penance and absolution try what help there may be in these and leave me to myself  do not think it miriam said he we are bound together and can never part again why should it seem so impossible she rejoined think how i had escaped from all the past i had made for myself a new sphere and found new friends new occupations new hopes and enjoyments my heart methinks was almost as unburdened as if there had been no miserable life behind me the human spirit does not perish of a single wound nor exhaust itself in a single trial of life let us but keep asunder and all may go well for both we fancied ourselves forever sundered he replied yet we met once in the bowels of the earth and were we to part now our fates would fling us together again in a desert on a mountaintop or in whatever spot seemed safest you speak in vain therefore  you mistake your own will for an iron necessity said miriam otherwise you might have suffered me to glide past you like a ghost when we met among those ghosts of ancient days even now you might bid me pass as freely  never said he with unmitigable will your reappearance has destroyed the work of years you know the power that i have over you obey my bidding or within a short time it shall be exercised nor will i cease to haunt you till the moment comes  then said miriam more calmly i foresee the end and have already warned you of it it will be death  your own death miriamor mine he asked looking fixedly at her  do you imagine me a murderess said she shuddering you at least have no right to think me so  yet rejoined he with a glance of dark meaning men have said that this white hand had once a crimson stain he took her hand as he spoke and held it in his own in spite of the repugnance amounting to nothing short of agony with which she struggled to regain it holding it up to the fading light for there was already dimness among the trees he appeared to examine it closely as if to discover the imaginary bloodstain with which he taunted her he smiled as he let it go it looks very white said he but i have known hands as white which all the water in the ocean would not have washed clean  it had no stain retorted miriam bitterly until you grasped it in your own  the wind has blown away whatever else they may have spoken  they went together towards the town and on their way continued to make reference no doubt to some strange and dreadful history of their former life belonging equally to this dark man and to the fair and youthful woman whom he persecuted in their words or in the breath that uttered them there seemed to be an odor of guilt and a scent of blood yet how can we imagine that a stain of ensanguined crime should attach to miriam or how on the other hand should spotless innocence be subjected to a thraldom like that which she endured from the spectre whom she herself had evoked out of the darkness be this as it might miriam we have reason to believe still continued to beseech him humbly passionately wildly only to go his way and leave her free to follow her own sad path  thus they strayed onward through the green wilderness of the borghese grounds and soon came near the city wall where had miriam raised her eyes she might have seen hilda and the sculptor leaning on the parapet but she walked in a mist of trouble and could distinguish little beyond its limits as they came within public observation her persecutor fell behind throwing off the imperious manner which he had assumed during their solitary interview the porta del popolo swarmed with life the merrymakers who had spent the feastday outside the walls were now thronging in a party of horsemen were entering beneath the arch a travelling carriage had been drawn up just within the verge and was passing through the villainous ordeal of the papal customhouse in the broad piazza too there was a motley crowd  but the stream of miriams trouble kept its way through this flood of human life and neither mingled with it nor was turned aside with a sad kind of feminine ingenuity she found a way to kneel before her tyrant undetected though in full sight of all the people still beseeching him for freedom and in vain     chapter xii   a stroll on the pincian   hilda after giving the last touches to the picture of beatrice cenci had flown down from her dovecote late in the afternoon and gone to the pincian hill in the hope of hearing a strain or two of exhilarating music there as it happened she met the sculptor for to say the truth kenyon had well noted the fair artists ordinary way of life and was accustomed to shape his own movements so as to bring him often within her sphere  the pincian hill is the favorite promenade of the roman aristocracy at the present day however like most other roman possessions it belongs less to the native inhabitants than to the barbarians from gaul great britain anti beyond the sea who have established a peaceful usurpation over whatever is enjoyable or memorable in the eternal city these foreign guests are indeed ungrateful if they do not breathe a prayer for pope clement or whatever holy father it may have been who levelled the summit of the mount so skilfully and bounded it with the parapet of the city wall who laid out those broad walks and drives and overhung them with the deepening shade of many kinds of tree who scattered the flowers of all seasons and of every clime abundantly over those green central lawns who scooped out hollows in fit places and setting great basins of marble in them caused evergushing fountains to fill them to the brim who reared up the immemorial obelisk out of the soil that had long hidden it who placed pedestals along the borders of the avenues and crowned them with busts of that multitude of worthiesstatesmen heroes artists men of letters and of songwhom the whole world claims as its chief ornaments though italy produced them all in a word the pincian garden is one of the things that reconcile the stranger since he fully appreciates the enjoyment and feels nothing of the cost to the rule of an irresponsible dynasty of holy fathers who seem to have aimed at making life as agreeable an affair as it can well be  in this pleasant spot the redtrousered french soldiers are always to be seen bearded and grizzled veterans perhaps with medals of algiers or the crimea on their breasts to them is assigned the peaceful duty of seeing that children do not trample on the flower beds nor any youthful lover rifle them of their fragrant blossoms to stick in the beloved ones hair here sits drooping upon some marble bench in the treacherous sunshine the consumptive girl whose friends have brought her for cure to a climate that instils poison into its very purest breath here all day come nurserymaids burdened with rosy english babies or guiding the footsteps of little travellers from the far western world here in the sunny afternoons roll and rumble all kinds of equipages from the cardinals oldfashioned and gorgeous purple carriage to the gay barouche of modern date here horsemen gallop on thoroughbred steeds here in short all the transitory population of rome the worlds great wateringplace rides drives or promenades here are beautiful sunsets and here whichever way you turn your eyes are scenes as well worth gazing at both in themselves and for their historic interest as any that the sun ever rose and set upon here too on certain afternoons of the week a french military band flings out rich music over the poor old city floating her with strains as loud as those of her own echoless triumphs  hilda and the sculptor by the contrivance of the latter who loved best to be alone with his young countrywoman had wandered beyond the throng of promenaders whom they left in a dense cluster around the music they strayed indeed to the farthest point of the pincian hill and leaned over the parapet looking down upon the muro torto a massive fragment of the oldest roman wall which juts over as if ready to tumble down by its own weight yet seems still the most indestructible piece of work that mens hands ever piled together in the blue distance rose soracte and other heights which have gleamed afar to our imaginations but look scarcely real to our bodily eyes because being dreamed about so much they have taken the aerial tints which belong only to a dream these nevertheless are the solid framework of hills that shut in rome and its wide surrounding campagnano land of dreams but the broadest page of history crowded so full with memorable events that one obliterates another as if time had crossed and recrossed his own records till they grew illegible  but not to meddle with historywith which our narrative is no otherwise concerned than that the very dust of rome is historic and inevitably settles on our page and mingles with our inkwe will return to our two friends who were still leaning over the wall beneath them lay the broad sweep of the borghese grounds covered with trees amid which appeared the white gleam of pillars and statues and the flash of an upspringing fountain all to be overshadowed at a later period of the year by the thicker growth of foliage  the advance of vegetation in this softer climate is less abrupt than the inhabitant of the cold north is accustomed to observe beginning earliereven in februaryspring is not compelled to burst into summer with such headlong haste there is time to dwell upon each opening beauty and to enjoy the budding leaf the tender green the sweet youth and freshness of the year it gives us its maiden charm before settling into the married summer which again does not so soon sober itself into matronly autumn in our own country the virgin spring hastens to its bridal too abruptly but here after a month or two of kindly growth the leaves of the young trees which cover that portion of the borghese grounds nearest the city wall were still in their tender halfdevelopment  in the remoter depths among the old groves of ilextrees hilda and kenyon heard the faint sound of music laughter and mingling voices it was probably the uproarspreading even so far as the walls of rome and growing faded and melancholy in its passageof that wild sylvan merriment which we have already attempted to describe by and by it ceasedalthough the two listeners still tried to distinguish it between the bursts of nearer music from the military band but there was no renewal of that distant mirth soon afterwards they saw a solitary figure advancing along one of the paths that lead from the obscurer part of the ground towards the gateway  look is it not donatello said hilda  he it is beyond a doubt replied the sculptor but how gravely he walks and with what long looks behind him he seems either very weary or very sad i should not hesitate to call it sadness if donatello were a creature capable of the sin and folly of low spirits in all these hundred paces while we have been watching him he has not made one of those little caprioles in the air which are characteristic of his natural gait i begin to doubt whether he is a veritable faun  then said hilda with perfect simplicity you have thought himand do think himone of that strange wild happy race of creatures that used to laugh and sport in the woods in the old old times so do i indeed but i never quite believed till now that fauns existed anywhere but in poetry  the sculptor at first merely smiled then as the idea took further possession of his mind he laughed outright and wished from the bottom of his heart being in love with hilda though he had never told her so that he could have rewarded or punished her for its pretty absurdity with a kiss  o hilda what a treasure of sweet faith and pure imagination you hide under that little straw hat cried he at length a faun a faun great pan is not dead then after all the whole tribe of mythical creatures yet live in the moonlit seclusion of a young girls fancy and find it a lovelier abode and playplace i doubt not than their arcadian haunts of yore what bliss if a man of marble like myself could stray thither too  why do you laugh so asked hilda reddening for she was a little disturbed at kenyons ridicule however kindly expressed what can i have said that you think so very foolish  well not foolish then rejoined the sculptor but wiser it may be than i can fathom really however the idea does strike one as delightfully fresh when we consider donatellos position and external environment why my dear hilda he is a tuscan born of an old noble race in that part of italy and he has a mossgrown tower among the apennines where he and his forefathers have dwelt under their own vines and figtrees from an unknown antiquity his boyish passion for miriam has introduced him familiarly to our little circle and our republican and artistic simplicity of intercourse has included this young italian on the same terms as one of ourselves but if we paid due respect to rank and title we should bend reverentially to donatello and salute him as his excellency the count di monte beni  that is a droll idea much droller than his being a faun said hilda laughing in her turn this does not quite satisfy me however especially as you yourself recognized and acknowledged his wonderful resemblance to the statue  except as regards the pointed ears said kenyon adding aside and one other little peculiarity generally observable in the statues of fauns  as for his excellency the count di monte benis ears replied hilda smiling again at the dignity with which this title invested their playful friend you know we could never see their shape on account of his clustering curls nay i remember he once started back as shyly as a wild deer when miriam made a pretence of examining them how do you explain that  o i certainly shall not contend against such a weight of evidence the fact of his faunship being otherwise so probable answered the sculptor still hardly retaining his gravity faun or not donatello or the count di monte beniis a singularly wild creature and as i have remarked on other occasions though very gentle does not love to be touched speaking in no harsh sense there is a great deal of animal nature in him as if he had been born in the woods and had run wild all his childhood and were as yet but imperfectly domesticated life even in our day is very simple and unsophisticated in some of the shaggy nooks of the apennines  it annoys me very much said hilda this inclination which most people have to explain away the wonder and the mystery out of everything why could not you allow meand yourself toothe satisfaction of thinking him a faun  pray keep your belief dear hilda if it makes you any happier said the sculptor and i shall do my best to become a convert donatello has asked me to spend the summer with him in his ancestral tower where i purpose investigating the pedigree of these sylvan counts his forefathers and if their shadows beckon me into dreamland i shall willingly follow by the bye speaking of donatello there is a point on which i should like to be enlightened  can i help you then said hilda in answer to his look  is there the slightest chance of his winning miriams affections suggested kenyon  miriam she so accomplished and gifted exclaimed hilda and he a rude uncultivated boy no no no  it would seem impossible said the sculptor but on the other hand a gifted woman flings away her affections so unaccountably sometimes miriam of late has been very morbid and miserable as we both know young as she is the morning light seems already to have faded out of her life and now comes donatello with natural sunshine enough for himself and her and offers her the opportunity of making her heart and life all new and cheery again people of high intellectual endowments do not require similar ones in those they love they are just the persons to appreciate the wholesome gush of natural feeling the honest affection the simple joy the fulness of contentment with what he loves which miriam sees in donatello true she may call him a simpleton it is a necessity of the case for a man loses the capacity for this kind of affection in proportion as he cultivates and refines himself  dear me said hilda drawing imperceptibly away from her companion is this the penalty of refinement pardon me i do not believe it it is because you are a sculptor that you think nothing can be finely wrought except it be cold and hard like the marble in which your ideas take shape i am a painter and know that the most delicate beauty may be softened and warmed throughout  i said a foolish thing indeed answered the sculptor it surprises me for i might have drawn a wiser knowledge out of my own experience it is the surest test of genuine love that it brings back our early simplicity to the worldliest of us  thus talking they loitered slowly along beside the parapet which borders the level summit of the pincian with its irregular sweep at intervals they looked through the latticework of their thoughts at the varied prospects that lay before and beneath them  from the terrace where they now stood there is an abrupt descent towards the piazza del popolo and looking down into its broad space they beheld the tall palatial edifices the church domes and the ornamented gateway which grew and were consolidated out of the thought of michael angelo they saw too the red granite obelisk oldest of things even in rome which rises in the centre of the piazza with a fourfold fountain at its base all roman works and ruins whether of the empire the faroff republic or the still more distant kings assume a transient visionary and impalpable character when we think that this indestructible monument supplied one of the recollections which moses and the israelites bore from egypt into the desert perchance on beholding the cloudy pillar and the fiery column they whispered awestricken to one another in its shape it is like that old obelisk which we and our fathers have so often seen on the borders of the nile and now that very obelisk with hardly a trace of decay upon it is the first thing that the modern traveller sees after entering the flaminian gate  lifting their eyes hilda and her companion gazed westward and saw beyond the invisible tiber the castle of st angelo that immense tomb of a pagan emperor with the archangel at its summit  still farther off appeared a mighty pile of buildings surmounted by the vast dome which all of us have shaped and swelled outward like a huge bubble to the utmost scope of our imaginations long before we see it floating over the worship of the city it may be most worthily seen from precisely the point where our two friends were now standing at any nearer view the grandeur of st peters hides itself behind the immensity of its separate partsso that we see only the front only the sides only the pillared length and loftiness of the portico and not the mighty whole but at this distance the entire outline of the worlds cathedral as well as that of the palace of the worlds chief priest is taken in at once in such remoteness moreover the imagination is not debarred from lending its assistance even while we have the reality before our eyes and helping the weakness of human sense to do justice to so grand an object it requires both faith and fancy to enable us to feel what is nevertheless so true that yonder in front of the purple outline of hills is the grandest edifice ever built by man painted against gods loveliest sky  after contemplating a little while a scene which their long residence in rome had made familiar to them kenyon and hilda again let their glances fall into the piazza at their feet they there beheld miriam who had just entered the porta del popolo and was standing by the obelisk and fountain with a gesture that impressed kenyon as at once suppliant and imperious she seemed to intimate to a figure which had attended her thus far that it was now her desire to be left alone the pertinacious model however remained immovable  and the sculptor here noted a circumstance which according to the interpretation he might put upon it was either too trivial to be mentioned or else so mysteriously significant that he found it difficult to believe his eyes miriam knelt down on the steps of the fountain so far there could be no question of the fact to other observers if any there were she probably appeared to take this attitude merely for the convenience of dipping her fingers into the gush of water from the mouth of one of the stone lions but as she clasped her hands together after thus bathing them and glanced upward at the model an idea took strong possession of kenyons mind that miriam was kneeling to this dark follower there in the worlds face  do you see it he said to hilda  see what asked she surprised at the emotion of his tone i see miriam who has just bathed her hands in that delightfully cool water i often dip my fingers into a roman fountain and think of the brook that used to be one of my playmates in my new england village  i fancied i saw something else said kenyon but it was doubtless a mistake  but allowing that he had caught a true glimpse into the hidden significance of miriams gesture what a terrible thraldom did it suggest free as she seemed to bebeggar as he lookedthe nameless vagrant must then be dragging the beautiful miriam through the streets of rome fettered and shackled more cruelly than any captive queen of yore following in an emperors triumph and was it conceivable that she would have been thus enthralled unless some great errorhow great kenyon dared not thinkor some fatal weakness had given this dark adversary a vantage ground  hilda said he abruptly who and what is miriam pardon me but are you sure of her  sure of her repeated hilda with an angry blush for her friends sake i am sure that she is kind good and generous a true and faithful friend whom i love dearly and who loves me as well what more than this need i be sure of  and your delicate instincts say all this in her favornothing against her continued the sculptor without heeding the irritation of hildas tone these are my own impressions too but she is such a mystery we do not even know whether she is a countrywoman of ours or an englishwoman or a german there is anglosaxon blood in her veins one would say and a right english accent on her tongue but much that is not english breeding nor american nowhere else but in rome and as an artist could she hold a place in society without giving some clew to her past life  i love her dearly said hilda still with displeasure in her tone and trust her most entirely  my heart trusts her at least whatever my head may do replied kenyon and rome is not like one of our new england villages where we need the permission of each individual neighbor for every act that we do every word that we utter and every friend that we make or keep in these particulars the papal despotism allows us freer breath than our native air and if we like to take generous views of our associates we can do so to a reasonable extent without ruining ourselves  the music has ceased said hilda i am going now  there are three streets that beginning close beside each other diverge from the piazza del popolo towards the heart of rome on the left the via del babuino on the right the via della ripetta and between these two that worldfamous avenue the corso it appeared that miriam and her strange companion were passing up the first mentioned of these three and were soon hidden from hilda and the sculptor  the two latter left the pincian by the broad and stately walk that skirts along its brow beneath them from the base of the abrupt descent the city spread wide away in a close contiguity of redearthen roofs above which rose eminent the domes of a hundred churches beside here and there a tower and the upper windows of some taller or higher situated palace looking down on a multitude of palatial abodes at a distance ascending out of the central mass of edifices they could see the top of the antonine column and near it the circular roof of the pantheon looking heavenward with its everopen eye  except these two objects almost everything that they beheld was mediaeval though built indeed of the massive old stones and indestructible bricks of imperial rome for the ruins of the coliseum the golden house and innumerable temples of roman gods and mansions of caesars and senators had supplied the material for all those gigantic hovels and their walls were cemented with mortar of inestimable cost being made of precious antique statues burnt long ago for this petty purpose  rome as it now exists has grown up under the popes and seems like nothing but a heap of broken rubbish thrown into the great chasm between our own days and the empire merely to fill it up and for the better part of two thousand years its annals of obscure policies and wars and continually recurring misfortunes seem also but broken rubbish as compared with its classic history  if we consider the present city as at all connected with the famous one of old it is only because we find it built over its grave a depth of thirty feet of soil has covered up the rome of ancient days so that it lies like the dead corpse of a giant decaying for centuries with no survivor mighty enough even to bury it until the dust of all those years has gathered slowly over its recumbent form and made a casual sepulchre  we know not how to characterize in any accordant and compatible terms the rome that lies before us its sunless alleys and streets of palaces its churches lined with the gorgeous marbles that were originally polished for the adornment of pagan temples its thousands of evil smells mixed up with fragrance of rich incense diffused from as many censers its little life deriving feeble nutriment from what has long been dead everywhere some fragment of ruin suggesting the magnificence of a former epoch everywhere moreover a crossand nastiness at the foot of it as the sum of all there are recollections that kindle the soul and a gloom and languor that depress it beyond any depth of melancholic sentiment that can be elsewhere known  yet how is it possible to say an unkind or irreverential word of rome the city of all time and of all the world the spot for which mans great life and deeds have done so much and for which decay has done whatever glory and dominion could not do at this moment the evening sunshine is flinging its golden mantle over it making all that we thought mean magnificent the bells of all the churches suddenly ring out as if it were a peal of triumph because rome is still imperial  i sometimes fancy said hilda on whose susceptibility the scene always made a strong impression that romemere romewill crowd everything else out of my heart  heaven forbid ejaculated the sculptor they had now reached the grand stairs that ascend from the piazza di spagna to the hither brow of the pincian hill old beppo the millionnaire of his ragged fraternity it is a wonder that no artist paints him as the cripple whom st peter heals at the beautiful gate of the templewas just mounting his donkey to depart laden with the rich spoil of the days beggary  up the stairs drawing his tattered cloak about his face came the model at whom beppo looked askance jealous of an encroacher on his rightful domain the figure passed away however up the via sistina in the piazza below near the foot of the magnificent steps stood miriam with her eyes bent on the ground as if she were counting those little square uncomfortable pavingstones that make it a penitential pilgrimage to walk in rome she kept this attitude for several minutes and when at last the importunities of a beggar disturbed her from it she seemed bewildered and pressed her hand upon her brow  she has been in some sad dream or other poor thing said kenyon sympathizingly and even now she is imprisoned there in a kind of cage the iron bars of which are made of her own thoughts  i fear she is not well said hilda i am going down the stairs and will join miriam  farewell then said the sculptor dear hilda this is a perplexed and troubled world it soothes me inexpressibly to think of you in your tower with white doves and white thoughts for your companions so high above us all and with the virgin for your household friend you know not how far it throws its light that lamp which you keep burning at her shrine i passed beneath the tower last night and the ray cheered me because you lighted it  it has for me a religious significance replied hilda quietly and yet i am no catholic  they parted and kenyon made haste along the via sistina in the hope of overtaking the model whose haunts and character he was anxious to investigate for miriams sake he fancied that he saw him a long way in advance but before he reached the fountain of the triton the dusky figure had vanished     chapter xiii   a sculptors studio   about this period miriam seems to have been goaded by a weary restlessness that drove her abroad on any errand or none she went one morning to visit kenyon in his studio whither he had invited her to see a new statue on which he had staked many hopes and which was now almost completed in the clay next to hilda the person for whom miriam felt most affection and confidence was kenyon and in all the difficulties that beset her life it was her impulse to draw near hilda for feminine sympathy and the sculptor for brotherly counsel  yet it was to little purpose that she approached the edge of the voiceless gulf between herself and them standing on the utmost verge of that dark chasm she might stretch out her hand and never clasp a hand of theirs she might strive to call out help friends help but as with dreamers when they shout her voice would perish inaudibly in the remoteness that seemed such a little way this perception of an infinite shivering solitude amid which we cannot come close enough to human beings to be warmed by them and where they turn to cold chilly shapes of mist is one of the most forlorn results of any accident misfortune crime or peculiarity of character that puts an individual ajar with the world very often as in miriams case there is an insatiable instinct that demands friendship love and intimate communion but is forced to pine in empty forms a hunger of the heart which finds only shadows to feed upon  kenyons studio was in a crossstreet or rather an ugly and dirty little lane between the corso and the via della ripetta and though chill narrow gloomy and bordered with tall and shabby structures the lane was not a whit more disagreeable than nine tenths of the roman streets over the door of one of the houses was a marble tablet bearing an inscription to the purport that the sculpturerooms within had formerly been occupied by the illustrious artist canova in these precincts which canovas genius was not quite of a character to render sacred though it certainly made them interesting the young american sculptor had now established himself  the studio of a sculptor is generally but a rough and drearylooking place with a good deal the aspect indeed of a stonemasons workshop bare floors of brick or plank and plastered wallsan old chair or two or perhaps only a block of marble containing however the possibility of ideal grace within it to sit down upon some hastily scrawled sketches of nude figures on the whitewash of the wall these last are probably the sculptors earliest glimpses of ideas that may hereafter be solidified into imperishable stone or perhaps may remain as impalpable as a dream next there are a few very roughly modelled little figures in clay or plaster exhibiting the second stage of the idea as it advances towards a marble immortality and then is seen the exquisitely designed shape of clay more interesting than even the final marble as being the intimate production of the sculptor himself moulded throughout with his loving hands and nearest to his imagination and heart in the plastercast from this clay model the beauty of the statue strangely disappears to shine forth again with pure white radiance in the precious marble of carrara works in all these stages of advancement and some with the final touch upon them might be found in kenyons studio  here might be witnessed the process of actually chiselling the marble with which as it is not quite satisfactory to think a sculptor in these days has very little to do in italy there is a class of men whose merely mechanical skill is perhaps more exquisite than was possessed by the ancient artificers who wrought out the designs of praxiteles or very possibly by praxiteles himself whatever of illusive representation can be effected in marble they are capable of achieving if the object be before their eyes the sculptor has but to present these men with a plastercast of his design and a sufficient block of marble and tell them that the figure is imbedded in the stone and must be freed from its encumbering superfluities and in due time without the necessity of his touching the work with his own finger he will see before him the statue that is to make him renowned his creative power has wrought it with a word  in no other art surely does genius find such effective instruments and so happily relieve itself of the drudgery of actual performance doing wonderfully nice things by the hands of other people when it may be suspected they could not always be done by the sculptors own and how much of the admiration which our artists get for their buttons and buttonholes their shoeties their neckclothsand these at our present epoch of taste make a large share of the renownwould be abated if we were generally aware that the sculptor can claim no credit for such pretty performances as immortalized in marble they are not his work but that of some nameless machine in human shape  miriam stopped an instant in an antechamber to look at a halffinished bust the features of which seemed to be struggling out of the stone and as it were scattering and dissolving its hard substance by the glow of feeling and intelligence as the skilful workman gave stroke after stroke of the chisel with apparent carelessness but sure effect it was impossible not to think that the outer marble was merely an extraneous environment the human countenance within its embrace must have existed there since the limestone ledges of carrara were first made another bust was nearly completed though still one of kenyons most trustworthy assistants was at work giving delicate touches shaving off an impalpable something and leaving little heaps of marble dust to attest it  as these busts in the block of marble thought miriam so does our individual fate exist in the limestone of time we fancy that we carve it out but its ultimate shape is prior to all our action  kenyon was in the inner room but hearing a step in the antechamber he threw a veil over what he was at work upon and came out to receive his visitor he was dressed in a gray blouse with a little cap on the top of his head a costume which became him better than the formal garments which he wore whenever he passed out of his own domains the sculptor had a face which when time had done a little more for it would offer a worthy subject for as good an artist as himself features finely cut as if already marble an ideal forehead deeply set eyes and a mouth much hidden in a lightbrown beard but apparently sensitive and delicate  i will not offer you my hand said he it is grimy with cleopatras clay  no i will not touch clay it is earthy and human answered miriam i have come to try whether there is any calm and coolness among your marbles my own art is too nervous too passionate too full of agitation for me to work at it whole days together without intervals of repose so what have you to show me  pray look at everything here said kenyon i love to have painters see my work their judgment is unprejudiced and more valuable than that of the world generally from the light which their own art throws on mine more valuable too than that of my brother sculptors who never judge me fairlynor i them perhaps  to gratify him miriam looked round at the specimens in marble or plaster of which there were several in the room comprising originals or casts of most of the designs that kenyon had thus far produced he was still too young to have accumulated a large gallery of such things what he had to show were chiefly the attempts and experiments in various directions of a beginner in art acting as a stern tutor to himself and profiting more by his failures than by any successes of which he was yet capable some of them however had great merit and in the pure fine glow of the new marble it may be they dazzled the judgment into awarding them higher praise than they deserved miriam admired the statue of a beautiful youth a pearlfisher who had got entangled in the weeds at the bottom of the sea and lay dead among the pearloysters the rich shells and the seaweeds all of like value to him now  the poor young man has perished among the prizes that he sought remarked she but what a strange efficacy there is in death if we cannot all win pearls it causes an empty shell to satisfy us just as well i like this statue though it is too cold and stern in its moral lesson and physically the form has not settled itself into sufficient repose  in another style there was a grand calm head of milton not copied from any one bust or picture yet more authentic than any of them because all known representations of the poet had been profoundly studied and solved in the artists mind the bust over the tomb in grey friars church the original miniatures and pictures wherever to be found had mingled each its special truth in this one work wherein likewise by long perusal and deep love of the paradise lost the comus the lycidas and lallegro the sculptor had succeeded even better than he knew in spiritualizing his marble with the poets mighty genius and this was a great thing to have achieved such a length of time after the dry bones and dust of milton were like those of any other dead man  there were also several portraitbusts comprising those of two or three of the illustrious men of our own country whom kenyon before he left america had asked permission to model he had done so because he sincerely believed that whether he wrought the busts in marble or bronze the one would corrode and the other crumble in the long lapse of time beneath these great mens immortality possibly however the young artist may have underestimated the durability of his material other faces there were too of men who if the brevity of their remembrance after death can be augured from their little value in life should have been represented in snow rather than marble posterity will be puzzled what to do with busts like these the concretions and petrifactions of a vain selfestimate but will find no doubt that they serve to build into stone walls or burn into quicklime as well as if the marble had never been blocked into the guise of human heads  but it is an awful thing indeed this endless endurance this almost indestructibility of a marble bust whether in our own case or that of other men it bids us sadly measure the little little time during which our lineaments are likely to be of interest to any human being it is especially singular that americans should care about perpetuating themselves in this mode the brief duration of our families as a hereditary household renders it next to a certainty that the greatgrandchildren will not know their fathers grandfather and that half a century hence at furthest the hammer of the auctioneer will thump its knockdown blow against his blockhead sold at so much for the pound of stone and it ought to make us shiver the idea of leaving our features to be a dustywhite ghost among strangers of another generation who will take our nose between their thumb and fingers as we have seen men do by caesars and infallibly break it off if they can do so without detection  yes said miriam who had been revolving some such thoughts as the above it is a good state of mind for mortal man when he is content to leave no more definite memorial than the grass which will sprout kindly and speedily over his grave if we do not make the spot barren with marble methinks too it will be a fresher and better world when it flings off this great burden of stony memories which the ages have deemed it a piety to heap upon its back  what you say remarked kenyon goes against my whole art sculpture and the delight which men naturally take in it appear to me a proof that it is good to work with all time before our view  well well answered miriam i must not quarrel with you for flinging your heavy stones at poor posterity and to say the truth i think you are as likely to hit the mark as anybody these busts now much as i seem to scorn them make me feel as if you were a magician you turn feverish men into cool quiet marble what a blessed change for them would you could do as much for me  o gladly cried kenyon who had long wished to model that beautiful and most expressive face when will you begin to sit  poh that was not what i meant said miriam come show me something else  do you recognize this asked the sculptor  he took out of his desk a little oldfashioned ivory coffer yellow with age it was richly carved with antique figures and foliage and had kenyon thought fit to say that benvenuto cellini wrought this precious box the skill and elaborate fancy of the work would by no means have discredited his word nor the old artists fame at least it was evidently a production of benvenutos school and century and might once have been the jewelcase of some grand lady at the court of the de medici  lifting the lid however no blaze of diamonds was disclosed but only lapped in fleecy cotton a small beautifully shaped hand most delicately sculptured in marble such loving care and nicest art had been lavished here that the palm really seemed to have a tenderness in its very substance touching those lovely fingershad the jealous sculptor allowed you to touchyou could hardly believe that a virgin warmth would not steal from them into your heart  ah this is very beautiful exclaimed miriam with a genial smile it is as good in its way as loulies hand with its babydimples which powers showed me at florence evidently valuing it as much as if he had wrought it out of a piece of his great heart as good as harriet hosmers clasped hands of browning and his wife symbolizing the individuality and heroic union of two high poetic lives nay i do not question that it is better than either of those because you must have wrought it passionately in spite of its maiden palm and dainty fingertips  then you do recognize it asked kenyon  there is but one right hand on earth that could have supplied the model answered miriam so small and slender so perfectly symmetrical and yet with a character of delicate energy i have watched it a hundred times at its work but i did not dream that you had won hilda so far how have you persuaded that shy maiden to let you take her hand in marble  never she never knew it hastily replied kenyon anxious to vindicate his mistresss maidenly reserve i stole it from her the hand is a reminiscence after gazing at it so often and even holding it once for an instant when hilda was not thinking of me i should be a bungler indeed if i could not now reproduce it to something like the life  may you win the original one day said miriam kindly  i have little ground to hope it answered the sculptor despondingly hilda does not dwell in our mortal atmosphere and gentle and soft as she appears it will be as difficult to win her heart as to entice down a white bird from its sunny freedom in the sky it is strange with all her delicacy and fragility the impression she makes of being utterly sufficient to herself no i shall never win her she is abundantly capable of sympathy and delights to receive it but she has no need of love  i partly agree with you said miriam it is a mistaken idea which men generally entertain that nature has made women especially prone to throw their whole being into what is technically called love we have to say the least no more necessity for it than yourselves only we have nothing else to do with our hearts when women have other objects in life they are not apt to fall in love i can think of many women distinguished in art literature and scienceand multitudes whose hearts and minds find good employment in less ostentatious wayswho lead high lonely lives and are conscious of no sacrifice so far as your sex is concerned  and hilda will be one of these said kenyon sadly the thought makes me shiver for myself and and for her too  well said miriam smiling perhaps she may sprain the delicate wrist which you have sculptured to such perfection in that case you may hope these old masters to whom she has vowed herself and whom her slender hand and womans heart serve so faithfully are your only rivals  the sculptor sighed as he put away the treasure of hildas marble hand into the ivory coffer and thought how slight was the possibility that he should ever feel responsive to his own the tender clasp of the original he dared not even kiss the image that he himself had made it had assumed its share of hildas remote and shy divinity  and now said miriam show me the new statue which you asked me hither to see     chapter xiv   cleopatra   my new statue said kenyon who had positively forgotten it in the thought of hilda here it is under this veil not a nude figure i hope observed miriam every young sculptor seems to think that he must give the world some specimen of indecorous womanhood and call it eve venus a nymph or any name that may apologize for a lack of decent clothing i am weary even more than i am ashamed of seeing such things nowadays people are as good as born in their clothes and there is practically not a nude human being in existence an artist therefore as you must candidly confess cannot sculpture nudity with a pure heart if only because he is compelled to steal guilty glimpses at hired models the marble inevitably loses its chastity under such circumstances an old greek sculptor no doubt found his models in the open sunshine and among pure and princely maidens and thus the nude statues of antiquity are as modest as violets and sufficiently draped in their own beauty but as for mr gibsons colored venuses stained i believe with tobacco juice and all other nudities of today i really do not understand what they have to say to this generation and would be glad to see as many heaps of quicklime in their stead  you are severe upon the professors of my art said kenyon half smiling half seriously not that you are wholly wrong either we are bound to accept drapery of some kind and make the best of it but what are we to do must we adopt the costume of today and carve for example a venus in a hooppetticoat  that would be a boulder indeed rejoined miriam laughing but the difficulty goes to confirm me in my belief that except for portraitbusts sculpture has no longer a right to claim any place among living arts it has wrought itself out and come fairly to an end there is never a new group nowadays never even so much as a new attitude greenough i take my examples among men of merit imagined nothing new nor crawford either except in the tailoring line there are not as you will own more than half a dozen positively original statues or groups in the world and these few are of immemorial antiquity a person familiar with the vatican the uffizzi gallery the naples gallery and the louvre will at once refer any modern production to its antique prototype which moreover had begun to get out of fashion even in old roman days  pray stop miriam cried kenyon or i shall fling away the chisel forever  fairly own to me then my friend rejoined miriam whose disturbed mind found a certain relief in this declamation that you sculptors are of necessity the greatest plagiarists in the world  i do not own it said kenyon yet cannot utterly contradict you as regards the actual state of the art but as long as the carrara quarries still yield pure blocks and while my own country has marble mountains probably as fine in quality i shall steadfastly believe that future sculptors will revive this noblest of the beautiful arts and people the world with new shapes of delicate grace and massive grandeur perhaps he added smiling mankind will consent to wear a more manageable costume or at worst we sculptors shall get the skill to make broadcloth transparent and render a majestic human character visible through the coats and trousers of the present day  be it so said miriam you are past my counsel show me the veiled figure which i am afraid i have criticised beforehand to make amends i am in the mood to praise it now  but as kenyon was about to take the cloth off the clay model she laid her hand on his arm  tell me first what is the subject said she for i have sometimes incurred great displeasure from members of your brotherhood by being too obtuse to puzzle out the purport of their productions it is so difficult you know to compress and define a character or story and make it patent at a glance within the narrow scope attainable by sculpture indeed i fancy it is still the ordinary habit with sculptors first to finish their group of statuaryin such development as the particular block of marble will allowand then to choose the subject as john of bologna did with his rape of the sabines have you followed that good example  no my statue is intended for cleopatra replied kenyon a little disturbed by miriams raillery the special epoch of her history you must make out for yourself  he drew away the cloth that had served to keep the moisture of the clay model from being exhaled the sitting figure of a woman was seen she was draped from head to foot in a costume minutely and scrupulously studied from that of ancient egypt as revealed by the strange sculpture of that country its coins drawings painted mummycases and whatever other tokens have been dug out of its pyramids graves and catacombs even the stiff egyptian headdress was adhered to but had been softened into a rich feminine adornment without losing a particle of its truth difficulties that might well have seemed insurmountable had been courageously encountered and made flexible to purposes of grace and dignity so that cleopatra sat attired in a garb proper to her historic and queenly state as a daughter of the ptolemies and yet such as the beautiful woman would have put on as best adapted to heighten the magnificence of her charms and kindle a tropic fire in the cold eyes of octavius  a marvellous reposethat rare merit in statuary except it be the lumpish repose native to the block of stonewas diffused throughout the figure the spectator felt that cleopatra had sunk down out of the fever and turmoil of her life and for one instantas it were between two pulse throbshad relinquished all activity and was resting throughout every vein and muscle it was the repose of despair indeed for octavius had seen her and remained insensible to her enchantments but still there was a great smouldering furnace deep down in the womans heart the repose no doubt was as complete as if she were never to stir hand or foot again and yet such was the creatures latent energy and fierceness she might spring upon you like a tigress and stop the very breath that you were now drawing midway in your throat  the face was a miraculous success the sculptor had not shunned to give the full nubian lips and other characteristics of the egyptian physiognomy his courage and integrity had been abundantly rewarded for cleopatras beauty shone out richer warmer more triumphantly beyond comparison than if shrinking timidly from the truth he had chosen the tame grecian type the expression was of profound gloomy heavily revolving thought a glance into her past life and present emergencies while her spirit gathered itself up for some new struggle or was getting sternly reconciled to impending doom in one view there was a certain softness and tendernesshow breathed into the statue among so many strong and passionate elements it is impossible to say catching another glimpse you beheld her as implacable as a stone and cruel as fire  in a word all cleopatrafierce voluptuous passionate tender wicked terrible and full of poisonous and rapturous enchantmentwas kneaded into what only a week or two before had been a lump of wet clay from the tiber soon apotheosized in an indestructible material she would be one of the images that men keep forever finding a heat in them which does not cool down throughout the centuries  what a woman is this exclaimed miriam after a long pause tell me did she ever try even while you were creating her to overcome you with her fury or her love were you not afraid to touch her as she grew more and more towards hot life beneath your hand my dear friend it is a great work how have you learned to do it  it is the concretion of a good deal of thought emotion and toil of brain and hand said kenyon not without a perception that his work was good but i know not how it came about at last i kindled a great fire within my mind and threw in the materialas aaron threw the gold of the israelites into the furnaceand in the midmost heat uprose cleopatra as you see her  what i most marvel at said miriam is the womanhood that you have so thoroughly mixed up with all those seemingly discordant elements where did you get that secret you never found it in your gentle hilda yet i recognize its truth  no surely it was not in hilda said kenyon her womanhood is of the ethereal type and incompatible with any shadow of darkness or evil  you are right rejoined miriam there are women of that ethereal type as you term it and hilda is one of them she would die of her first wrongdoingsupposing for a moment that she could be capable of doing wrong of sorrow slender as she seems hilda might bear a great burden of sin not a feathers weight methinks now were it my doom i could bear either or both at once but my conscience is still as white as hildas do you question it  heaven forbid miriam exclaimed the sculptor  he was startled at the strange turn which she had so suddenly given to the conversation her voice tooso much emotion was stifled rather than expressed in it sounded unnatural  o my friend cried she with sudden passion will you be my friend indeed i am lonely lonely lonely there is a secret in my heart that burns methat tortures me sometimes i fear to go mad of it sometimes i hope to die of it but neither of the two happens ah if i could but whisper it to only one human soul and youyou see far into womanhood you receive it widely into your large view perhapsperhaps but heaven only knows you might understand me o let me speak  miriam dear friend replied the sculptor if i can help you speak freely as to a brother  help me no said miriam  kenyons response had been perfectly frank and kind and yet the subtlety of miriams emotion detected a certain reserve and alarm in his warmly expressed readiness to hear her story in his secret soul to say the truth the sculptor doubted whether it were well for this poor suffering girl to speak what she so yearned to say or for him to listen if there were any active duty of friendship to be performed then indeed he would joyfully have come forward to do his best but if it were only a pentup heart that sought an outlet in that case it was by no means so certain that a confession would do good the more her secret struggled and fought to be told the more certain would it be to change all former relations that had subsisted between herself and the friend to whom she might reveal it unless he could give her all the sympathy and just the kind of sympathy that the occasion required miriam would hate him by and by and herself still more if he let her speak  this was what kenyon said to himself but his reluctance after all and whether he were conscious of it or no resulted from a suspicion that had crept into his heart and lay there in a dark corner obscure as it was when miriam looked into his eyes she detected it at once  ah i shall hate you cried she echoing the thought which he had not spoken she was half choked with the gush of passion that was thus turned back upon her you are as cold and pitiless as your own marble  no but full of sympathy god knows replied he  in truth his suspicions however warranted by the mystery in which miriam was enveloped had vanished in the earnestness of his kindly and sorrowful emotion he was now ready to receive her trust  keep your sympathy then for sorrows that admit of such solace said she making a strong effort to compose herself as for my griefs i know how to manage them it was all a mistake you can do nothing for me unless you petrify me into a marble companion for your cleopatra there and i am not of her sisterhood i do assure you forget this foolish scene my friend and never let me see a reference to it in your eyes when they meet mine hereafter  since you desire it all shall be forgotten answered the sculptor pressing her hand as she departed or if ever i can serve you let my readiness to do so be remembered meanwhile dear miriam let us meet in the same clear friendly light as heretofore  you are less sincere than i thought you said miriam if you try to make me think that there will be no change  as he attended her through the antechamber she pointed to the statue of the pearldiver  my secret is not a pearl said she yet a man might drown himself in plunging after it  after kenyon had closed the door she went wearily down the staircase but paused midway as if debating with herself whether to return  the mischief was done thought she and i might as well have had the solace that ought to come with it i have lostby staggering a little way beyond the mark in the blindness of my distress i have lost as we shall hereafter find the genuine friendship of this clearminded honorable truehearted young man and all for nothing what if i should go back this moment and compel him to listen  she ascended two or three of the stairs but again paused murmured to herself and shook her head  no no no she thought and i wonder how i ever came to dream of it unless i had his heart for my ownand that is hildas nor would i steal it from herit should never be the treasure place of my secret it is no precious pearl as i just now told him but my darkred carbunclered as bloodis too rich a gem to put into a strangers casket  she went down the stairs and found her shadow waiting for her in the street     chapter xv   an aesthetic company   on the evening after miriams visit to kenyons studio there was an assemblage composed almost entirely of anglosaxons and chiefly of american artists with a sprinkling of their english brethren and some few of the tourists who still lingered in rome now that holy week was past miriam hilda and the sculptor were all three present and with them donatello whose life was so far turned from fits natural bent that like a pet spaniel he followed his beloved mistress wherever he could gain admittance  the place of meeting was in the palatial but somewhat faded and gloomy apartment of an eminent member of the aesthetic body it was no more formal an occasion than one of those weekly receptions common among the foreign residents of rome at which pleasant peopleor disagreeable ones as the case may beencounter one another with little ceremony  if anywise interested in art a man must be difficult to please who cannot find fit companionship among a crowd of persons whose ideas and pursuits all tend towards the general purpose of enlarging the worlds stock of beautiful productions  one of the chief causes that make rome the favorite residence of artiststheir ideal home which they sigh for in advance and are so loath to migrate from after once breathing its enchanted airis doubtless that they there find themselves in force and are numerous enough to create a congenial atmosphere in every other clime they are isolated strangers in this land of art they are free citizens  not that individually or in the mass there appears to be any large stock of mutual affection among the brethren of the chisel and the pencil on the contrary it will impress the shrewd observer that the jealousies and petty animosities which the poets of our day have flung aside still irritate and gnaw into the hearts of this kindred class of imaginative men it is not difficult to suggest reasons why this should be the fact the public in whose good graces lie the sculptors or the painters prospects of success is infinitely smaller than the public to which literary men make their appeal it is composed of a very limited body of wealthy patrons and these as the artist well knows are but blind judges in matters that require the utmost delicacy of perception thus success in art is apt to become partly an affair of intrigue and it is almost inevitable that even a gifted artist should look askance at his gifted brothers fame and be chary of the good word that might help him to sell still another statue or picture you seldom hear a painter heap generous praise on anything in his special line of art a sculptor never has a favorable eye for any marble but his own  nevertheless in spite of all these professional grudges artists are conscious of a social warmth from each others presence and contiguity they shiver at the remembrance of their lonely studios in the unsympathizing cities of their native land for the sake of such brotherhood as they can find more than for any good that they get from galleries they linger year after year in italy while their originality dies out of them or is polished away as a barbarism  the company this evening included several men and women whom the world has heard of and many others beyond all question whom it ought to know it would be a pleasure to introduce them upon our humble pages name by name and had we confidence enough in our own tasteto crown each welldeserving brow according to its deserts the opportunity is tempting but not easily manageable and far too perilous both in respect to those individuals whom we might bring forward and the far greater number that must needs be left in the shade ink moreover is apt to have a corrosive quality and might chance to raise a blister instead of any more agreeable titillation on skins so sensitive as those of artists we must therefore forego the delight of illuminating this chapter with personal allusions to men whose renown glows richly on canvas or gleams in the white moonlight of marble  otherwise we might point to an artist who has studied nature with such tender love that she takes him to her intimacy enabling him to reproduce her in landscapes that seem the reality of a better earth and yet are but the truth of the very scenes around us observed by the painters insight and interpreted for us by his skill by his magic the moon throws her light far out of the picture and the crimson of the summer night absolutely glimmers on the beholders face or we might indicate a poetpainter whose song has the vividness of picture and whose canvas is peopled with angels fairies and water sprites done to the ethereal life because he saw them face to face in his poetic mood or we might bow before an artist who has wrought too sincerely too religiously with too earnest a feeling and too delicate a touch for the world at once to recognize how much toil and thought are compressed into the stately brow of prospero and mirandas maiden loveliness or from what a depth within this painters heart the angel is leading forth st peter  thus it would be easy to go on perpetrating a score of little epigrammatical allusions like the above all kindly meant but none of them quite hitting the mark and often striking where they were not aimed it may be allowable to say however that american art is much better represented at rome in the pictorial than in the sculpturesque department yet the men of marble appear to have more weight with the public than the men of canvas perhaps on account of the greater density and solid substance of the material in which they work and the sort of physical advantage which their labors thus acquire over the illusive unreality of color to be a sculptor seems a distinction in itself whereas a painter is nothing unless individually eminent  one sculptor there was an englishman endowed with a beautiful fancy and possessing at his fingers ends the capability of doing beautiful things he was a quiet simple elderly personage with eyes brown and bright under a slightly impending brow and a grecian profile such as he might have cut with his own chisel he had spent his life for forty years in making venuses cupids bacchuses and a vast deal of other marble progeny of dreamwork or rather frostwork it was all a vapory exhalation out of the grecian mythology crystallizing on the dull windowpanes of today gifted with a more delicate power than any other man alive he had foregone to be a christian reality and perverted himself into a pagan idealist whose business or efficacy in our present world it would be exceedingly difficult to define and loving and reverencing the pure material in which he wrought as surely this admirable sculptor did he had nevertheless robbed the marble of its chastity by giving it an artificial warmth of hue thus it became a sin and shame to look at his nude goddesses they had revealed themselves to his imagination no doubt with all their deity about them but bedaubed with buff color they stood forth to the eyes of the profane in the guise of naked women but whatever criticism may be ventured on his style it was good to meet a man so modest and yet imbued with such thorough and simple conviction of his own right principles and practice and so quietly satisfied that his kind of antique achievement was all that sculpture could effect for modern life   this eminent persons weight and authority among his artistic brethren were very evident for beginning unobtrusively to utter himself on a topic of art he was soon the centre of a little crowd of younger sculptors they drank in his wisdom as if it would serve all the purposes of original inspiration he meanwhile discoursing with gentle calmness as if there could possibly be no other side and often ratifying as it were his own conclusions by a mildly emphatic yes  the veteran sculptors unsought audience was composed mostly of our own countrymen it is fair to say that they were a body of very dexterous and capable artists each of whom had probably given the delighted public a nude statue or had won credit for even higher skill by the nice carving of buttonholes shoeties coatseams shirtbosoms and other such graceful peculiarities of modern costume smart practical men they doubtless were and some of them far more than this but still not precisely what an uninitiated person looks for in a sculptor a sculptor indeed to meet the demands which our preconceptions make upon him should be even more indispensably a poet than those who deal in measured verse and rhyme his material or instrument which serves him in the stead of shifting and transitory language is a pure white undecaying substance it insures immortality to whatever is wrought in it and therefore makes it a religious obligation to commit no idea to its mighty guardianship save such as may repay the marble for its faithful care its incorruptible fidelity by warming it with an ethereal life under this aspect marble assumes a sacred character and no man should dare to touch it unless he feels within himself a certain consecration and a priesthood the only evidence of which for the public eye will be the high treatment of heroic subjects or the delicate evolution of spiritual through material beauty  no ideas such as the foregoingno misgivings suggested by them probably troubled the selfcomplacency of most of these clever sculptors marble in their view had no such sanctity as we impute to it it was merely a sort of white limestone from carrara cut into convenient blocks and worth in that state about two or three dollars per pound and it was susceptible of being wrought into certain shapes by their own mechanical ingenuity or that of artisans in their employment which would enable them to sell it again at a much higher figure such men on the strength of some small knack in handling clay which might have been fitly employed in making waxwork are bold to call themselves sculptors how terrible should be the thought that the nude woman whom the modern artist patches together bit by bit from a dozen heterogeneous models meaning nothing by her shall last as long as the venus of the capitolthat his group ofno matter what since it has no moral or intellectual existence will not physically crumble any sooner than the immortal agony of the laocoon  yet we love the artists in every kind even these whose merits we are not quite able to appreciate sculptors painters crayon sketchers or whatever branch of aesthetics they adopted were certainly pleasanter people as we saw them that evening than the average whom we meet in ordinary society they were not wholly confined within the sordid compass of practical life they had a pursuit which if followed faithfully out would lead them to the beautiful and always had a tendency thitherward even if they lingered to gather up golden dross by the wayside their actual business though they talked about it very much as other men talk of cotton politics flour barrels and sugar necessarily illuminated their conversation with something akin to the ideal so when the guests collected themselves in little groups here and there in the wide saloon a cheerful and airy gossip began to be heard the atmosphere ceased to be precisely that of common life a hint mellow tinge such as we see in pictures mingled itself with the lamplight  this good effect was assisted by many curious little treasures of art which the host had taken care to strew upon his tables they were principally such bits of antiquity as the soil of rome and its neighborhood are still rich in seals gems small figures of bronze mediaeval carvings in ivory things which had been obtained at little cost yet might have borne no inconsiderable value in the museum of a virtuoso  as interesting as any of these relics was a large portfolio of old drawings some of which in the opinion of their possessor bore evidence on their faces of the touch of masterhands very ragged and ill conditioned they mostly were yellow with time and tattered with rough usage and in their best estate the designs had been scratched rudely with pen and ink on coarse paper or if drawn with charcoal or a pencil were now half rubbed out you would not anywhere see rougher and homelier things than these but this hasty rudeness made the sketches only the more valuable because the artist seemed to have bestirred himself at the pinch of the moment snatching up whatever material was nearest so as to seize the first glimpse of an idea that might vanish in the twinkling of an eye thus by the spell of a creased soiled and discolored scrap of paper you were enabled to steal close to an old master and watch him in the very effervescence of his genius  according to the judgment of several connoisseurs raphaels own hand had communicated its magnetism to one of these sketches and if genuine it was evidently his first conception of a favorite madonna now hanging in the private apartment of the grand duke at florence another drawing was attributed to leonardo da vinci and appeared to be a somewhat varied design for his picture of modesty and vanity in the sciarra palace there were at least half a dozen others to which the owner assigned as high an origin it was delightful to believe in their authenticity at all events for these things make the spectator more vividly sensible of a great painters power than the final glow and perfected art of the most consummate picture that may have been elaborated from them there is an effluence of divinity in the first sketch and there if anywhere you find the pure light of inspiration which the subsequent toil of the artist serves to bring out in stronger lustre indeed but likewise adulterates it with what belongs to an inferior mood the aroma and fragrance of new thoughts were perceptible in these designs after three centuries of wear and tear the charm lay partly in their very imperfection for this is suggestive and sets the imagination at work whereas the finished picture if a good one leaves the spectator nothing to do and if bad confuses stupefies disenchants and disheartens him  hilda was greatly interested in this rich portfolio she lingered so long over one particular sketch that miriam asked her what discovery she had made  look at it carefully replied hilda putting the sketch into her hands if you take pains to disentangle the design from those pencilmarks that seem to have been scrawled over it i think you will see something very curious  it is a hopeless affair i am afraid said miriam i have neither your faith dear hilda nor your perceptive faculty fie what a blurred scrawl it is indeed  the drawing had originally been very slight and had suffered more from time and hard usage than almost any other in the collection it appeared too that there had been an attempt perhaps by the very hand that drew it to obliterate the design by hildas help however miriam pretty distinctly made out a winged figure with a drawn sword and a dragon or a demon prostrate at his feet  i am convinced said hilda in a low reverential tone that guidos own touches are on that ancient scrap of paper if so it must be his original sketch for the picture of the archangel michael setting his foot upon the demon in the church of the cappuccini the composition and general arrangement of the sketch are the same with those of the picture the only difference being that the demon has a more upturned face and scowls vindictively at the archangel who turns away his eyes in painful disgust  no wonder responded miriam the expression suits the daintiness of michaels character as guido represents him he never could have looked the demon in the face  miriam exclaimed her friend reproachfully you grieve me and you know it by pretending to speak contemptuously of the most beautiful and the divinest figure that mortal painter ever drew  forgive me hilda said miriam you take these matters more religiously than i can for my life guidos archangel is a fine picture of course but it never impressed me as it does you  well we will not talk of that answered hilda what i wanted you to notice in this sketch is the face of the demon it is entirely unlike the demon of the finished picture guido you know always affirmed that the resemblance to cardinal pamfili was either casual or imaginary now here is the face as he first conceived it  and a more energetic demon altogether than that of the finished picture said kenyon taking the sketch into his hand what a spirit is conveyed into the ugliness of this strong writhing squirming dragon under the archangels foot neither is the face an impossible one upon my word i have seen it somewhere and on the shoulders of a living man  and so have i said hilda it was what struck me from the first  donatello look at this face cried kenyon  the young italian as may be supposed took little interest in matters of art and seldom or never ventured an opinion respecting them after holding the sketch a single instant in his hand he flung it from him with a shudder of disgust and repugnance and a frown that had all the bitterness of hatred  i know the face well whispered he it is miriams model  it was acknowledged both by kenyon and hilda that they had detected or fancied the resemblance which donatello so strongly affirmed and it added not a little to the grotesque and weird character which half playfully half seriously they assigned to miriams attendant to think of him as personating the demons part in a picture of more than two centuries ago had guido in his effort to imagine the utmost of sin and misery which his pencil could represent hit ideally upon just this face or was it an actual portrait of somebody that haunted the old master as miriam was haunted now did the ominous shadow follow him through all the sunshine of his earlier career and into the gloom that gathered about its close and when guido died did the spectre betake himself to those ancient sepulchres there awaiting a new victim till it was miriams illhap to encounter him  i do not acknowledge the resemblance at all said miriam looking narrowly at the sketch and as i have drawn the face twenty times i think you will own that i am the best judge  a discussion here arose in reference to guidos archangel and it was agreed that these four friends should visit the church of the cappuccini the next morning and critically examine the picture in question the similarity between it and the sketch being at all events a very curious circumstance  it was now a little past ten oclock when some of the company who had been standing in a balcony declared the moonlight to be resplendent they proposed a ramble through the streets taking in their way some of those scenes of ruin which produced their best effects under the splendor of the italian moon     chapter xvi   a moonlight ramble   the proposal for a moonlight ramble was received with acclamation by all the younger portion of the company they immediately set forth and descended from story to story dimly lighting their way by waxen tapers which are a necessary equipment to those whose thoroughfare in the nighttime lies up and down a roman staircase emerging from the courtyard of the edifice they looked upward and saw the sky full of light which seemed to have a delicate purple or crimson lustre or at least some richer tinge than the cold white moonshine of other skies it gleamed over the front of the opposite palace showing the architectural ornaments of its cornice and pillared portal as well as the ironbarred basement windows that gave such a prisonlike aspect to the structure and the shabbiness and squalor that lay along its base a cobbler was just shutting up his little shop in the basement of the palace a cigar venders lantern flared in the blast that came through the archway a french sentinel paced to and fro before the portal a homeless dog that haunted thereabouts barked as obstreperously at the party as if he were the domestic guardian of the precincts  the air was quietly full of the noise of falling water the cause of which was nowhere visible though apparently near at hand this pleasant natural sound not unlike that of a distant cascade in the forest may be heard in many of the roman streets and piazzas when the tumult of the city is hushed for consuls emperors and popes the great men of every age have found no better way of immortalizing their memories than by the shifting indestructible ever new yet unchanging upgush and downfall of water they have written their names in that unstable element and proved it a more durable record than brass or marble  donatello you had better take one of those gay boyish artists for your companion said miriam when she found the italian youth at her side i am not now in a merry mood as when we set all the world adancing the other afternoon in the borghese grounds  i never wish to dance any more answered donatello  what a melancholy was in that tone exclaimed miriam you are getting spoilt in this dreary rome and will be as wise and as wretched as all the rest of mankind unless you go back soon to your tuscan vineyards well give me your arm then but take care that no friskiness comes over you we must walk evenly and heavily tonight  the party arranged itself according to its natural affinities or casual likings a sculptor generally choosing a painter and a painter a sculptor for his companion in preference to brethren of their own art kenyon would gladly have taken hilda to himself and have drawn her a little aside from the throng of merry wayfarers but she kept near miriam and seemed in her gentle and quiet way to decline a separate alliance either with him or any other of her acquaintances  so they set forth and had gone but a little way when the narrow street emerged into a piazza on one side of which glistening and dimpling in the moonlight was the most famous fountain in rome its murmurnot to say its uproarhad been in the ears of the company ever since they came into the open air it was the fountain of trevi which draws its precious water from a source far beyond the walls whence it flows hitherward through old subterranean aqueducts and sparkles forth as pure as the virgin who first led agrippa to its wellspring by her fathers door  i shall sip as much of this water as the hollow of my hand will hold said miriam  i am leaving rome in a few days and the tradition goes that a parting draught at the fountain of trevi insures the travellers return whatever obstacles and improbabilities may seem to beset him will you drink donatello  signorina what you drink i drink said the youth  they and the rest of the party descended some steps to the waters brim and after a sip or two stood gazing at the absurd design of the fountain where some sculptor of berninis school had gone absolutely mad in marble it was a great palace front with niches and many basreliefs out of which looked agrippas legendary virgin and several of the allegoric sisterhood while at the base appeared neptune with his floundering steeds and tritons blowing their horns about him and twenty other artificial fantasies which the calm moonlight soothed into better taste than was native to them  and after all it was as magnificent a piece of work as ever human skill contrived at the foot of the palatial facade was strewn with careful art and ordered irregularity a broad and broken heap of massive rock looking is if it might have lain there since the deluge over a central precipice fell the water in a semicircular cascade and from a hundred crevices on all sides snowy jets gushed up and streams spouted out of the mouths and nostrils of stone monsters and fell in glistening drops while other rivulets that had run wild came leaping from one rude step to another over stones that were mossy slimy and green with sedge because in a century of their wild play nature had adopted the fountain of trevi with all its elaborate devices for her own finally the water tumbling sparkling and dashing with joyous haste and neverceasing murmur poured itself into a great marblebrimmed reservoir and filled it with a quivering tide on which was seen continually a snowy semicircle of momentary foam from the principal cascade as well as a multitude of snow points from smaller jets the basin occupied the whole breadth of the piazza whence flights of steps descended to its border a boat might float and make voyages from one shore to another in this mimic lake   in the daytime there is hardly a livelier scene in rome than the neighborhood of the fountain of trevi for the piazza is then filled with the stalls of vegetable and fruit dealers chestnut roasters cigar venders and other people whose petty and wandering traffic is transacted in the open air it is likewise thronged with idlers lounging over the iron railing and with forestieri who came hither to see the famous fountain here also are seen men with buckets urchins with cans and maidens a picture as old as the patriarchal times bearing their pitchers upon their heads for the water of trevi is in request far and wide as the most refreshing draught for feverish lips the pleasantest to mingle with wine and the wholesomest to drink in its native purity that can anywhere be found but now at early midnight the piazza was a solitude and it was a delight to behold this untamable water sporting by itself in the moonshine and compelling all the elaborate trivialities of art to assume a natural aspect in accordance with its own powerful simplicity  what would be done with this water power suggested an artist if we had it in one of our american cities would they employ it to turn the machinery of a cotton mill i wonder  the good people would pull down those rampant marble deities said kenyon and possibly they would give me a commission to carve the oneandthirty is that the number sister states each pouring a silver stream from a separate can into one vast basin which should represent the grand reservoir of national prosperity  or if they wanted a bit of satire remarked an english artist you could set those same oneandthirty states to cleansing the national flag of any stains that it may have incurred the roman washerwomen at the lavatory yonder plying their labor in the open air would serve admirably as models  i have often intended to visit this fountain by moonlight said miriam because it was here that the interview took place between corinne and lord neville after their separation and temporary estrangement pray come behind me one of you and let me try whether the face can be recognized in the water  leaning over the stone brim of the basin she heard footsteps stealing behind her and knew that somebody was looking over her shoulder the moonshine fell directly behind miriam illuminating the palace front and the whole scene of statues and rocks and filling the basin as it were with tremulous and palpable light corinne it will be remembered knew lord neville by the reflection of his face in the water in miriams case however owing to the agitation of the water its transparency and the angle at which she was compelled to lean over no reflected image appeared nor from the same causes would it have been possible for the recognition between corinne and her lover to take place the moon indeed flung miriams shadow at the bottom of the basin as well as two more shadows of persons who had followed her on either side  three shadows exclaimed miriamthree separate shadows all so black and heavy that they sink in the water there they lie on the bottom as if all three were drowned together this shadow on my right is donatello i know him by his curls and the turn of his head my lefthand companion puzzles me a shapeless mass as indistinct as the premonition of calamity which of you can it be ah  she had turned round while speaking and saw beside her the strange creature whose attendance on her was already familiar as a marvel and a jest to the whole company of artists a general burst of laughter followed the recognition while the model leaned towards miriam as she shrank from him and muttered something that was inaudible to those who witnessed the scene by his gestures however they concluded that he was inviting her to bathe her hands  he cannot be an italian at least not a roman observed an artist i never knew one of them to care about ablution see him now it is as if he were trying to wash off the timestains and earthly soil of a thousand years  dipping his hands into the capacious washbowl before him the model rubbed them together with the utmost vehemence ever and anon too he peeped into the water as if expecting to see the whole fountain of trevi turbid with the results of his ablution miriam looked at him some little time with an aspect of real terror and even imitated him by leaning over to peep into the basin recovering herself she took up some of the water in the hollow of her hand and practised an old form of exorcism by flinging it in her persecutors face  in the name of all the saints cried she vanish demon and let me be free of you now and forever  it will not suffice said some of the mirthful party unless the fountain of trevi gushes with holy water  in fact the exorcism was quite ineffectual upon the pertinacious demon or whatever the apparition might be still he washed his brown bony talons still he peered into the vast basin as if all the water of that great drinkingcup of rome must needs be stained black or sanguine and still he gesticulated to miriam to follow his example the spectators laughed loudly but yet with a kind of constraint for the creatures aspect was strangely repulsive and hideous  miriam felt her arm seized violently by donatello she looked at him and beheld a tigerlike fury gleaming from his wild eyes  bid me drown him whispered he shuddering between rage and horrible disgust you shall hear his death gurgle in another instant  peace peace donatello said miriam soothingly for this naturally gentle and sportive being seemed all aflame with animal rage do him no mischief he is mad and we are as mad as he if we suffer ourselves to be disquieted by his antics let us leave him to bathe his hands till the fountain run dry if he find solace and pastime in it what is it to you or me donatello there there be quiet foolish boy  her tone and gesture were such as she might have used in taming down the wrath of a faithful hound that had taken upon himself to avenge some supposed affront to his mistress she smoothed the young mans curls for his fierce and sudden fury seemed to bristle among his hair and touched his cheek with her soft palm till his angry mood was a little assuaged  signorina do i look as when you first knew me asked he with a heavy tremulous sigh as they went onward somewhat apart from their companions methinks there has been a change upon me these many months and more and more these last few days the joy is gone out of my life all gone all gone feel my hand is it not very hot ah and my heart burns hotter still  my poor donatello you are ill said miriam with deep sympathy and pity this melancholy and sickly rome is stealing away the rich joyous life that belongs to you go back my dear friend to your home among the hills where as i gather from what you have told me your days were filled with simple and blameless delights have you found aught in the world that is worth what you there enjoyed tell me truly donatello  yes replied the young man  and what in heavens name asked she  this burning pain in my heart said donatello for you are in the midst of it  by this time they had left the fountain of trevi considerably behind them little further allusion was made to the scene at its margin for the party regarded miriams persecutor as diseased in his wits and were hardly to be surprised by any eccentricity in his deportment  threading several narrow streets they passed through the piazza of the holy apostles and soon came to trajans forum all over the surface of what once was rome it seems to be the effort of time to bury up the ancient city as if it were a corpse and he the sexton so that in eighteen centuries the soil over its grave has grown very deep by the slow scattering of dust and the accumulation of more modern decay upon older ruin  this was the fate also of trajans forum until some papal antiquary a few hundred years ago began to hollow it out again and disclosed the full height of the gigantic column wreathed round with basreliefs of the old emperors warlike deeds in the area before it stands a grove of stone consisting of the broken and unequal shafts of a vanished temple still keeping a majestic order and apparently incapable of further demolition the modern edifices of the piazza wholly built no doubt out of the spoil of its old magnificence look down into the hollow space whence these pillars rise  one of the immense gray granite shafts lay in the piazza on the verge of the area it was a great solid fact of the past making old rome actually sensible to the touch and eye and no study of history nor force of thought nor magic of song could so vitally assure us that rome once existed as this sturdy specimen of what its rulers and people wrought  and see said kenyon laying his hand upon it there is still a polish remaining on the hard substance of the pillar and even now late as it is i can feel very sensibly the warmth of the noonday sun which did its best to heat it through this shaft will endure forever the polish of eighteen centuries ago as yet but half rubbed off and the heat of todays sunshine lingering into the night seem almost equally ephemeral in relation to it  there is comfort to be found in the pillar remarked miriam hard and heavy as it is lying here forever as it will it makes all human trouble appear but a momentary annoyance  and human happiness as evanescent too observed hilda sighing and beautiful art hardly less so i do not love to think that this dull stone merely by its massiveness will last infinitely longer than any picture in spite of the spiritual life that ought to give it immortality  my poor little hilda said miriam kissing her compassionately would you sacrifice this greatest mortal consolation which we derive from the transitoriness of all things from the right of saying in every conjecture this too will pass away would you give up this unspeakable boon for the sake of making a picture eternal  their moralizing strain was interrupted by a demonstration from the rest of the party who after talking and laughing together suddenly joined their voices and shouted at full pitch  trajan trajan  why do you deafen us with such an uproar inquired miriam  in truth the whole piazza had been filled with their idle vociferation the echoes from the surrounding houses reverberating the cry of trajan on all sides as if there was a great search for that imperial personage and not so much as a handful of his ashes to be found  why it was a good opportunity to air our voices in this resounding piazza replied one of the artists besides we had really some hopes of summoning trajan to look at his column which you know he never saw in his lifetime here is your model who they say lived and sinned before trajans death still wandering about rome and why not the emperor trajan  dead emperors have very little delight in their columns i am afraid observed kenyon all that rich sculpture of trajans bloody warfare twining from the base of the pillar to its capital may be but an ugly spectacle for his ghostly eyes if he considers that this huge storied shaft must be laid before the judgmentseat as a piece of the evidence of what he did in the flesh if ever i am employed to sculpture a heros monument i shall think of this as i put in the basreliefs of the pedestal  there are sermons in stones said hilda thoughtfully smiling at kenyons morality and especially in the stones of rome  the party moved on but deviated a little from the straight way in order to glance at the ponderous remains of the temple of mars ultot within which a convent of nuns is now establisheda dovecote in the wargods mansion at only a little distance they passed the portico of a temple of minerva most rich and beautiful in architecture but woefully gnawed by time and shattered by violence besides being buried midway in the accumulation of soil that rises over dead rome like a flood tide within this edifice of antique sanctity a bakers shop was now established with an entrance on one side for everywhere the remnants of old grandeur and divinity have been made available for the meanest necessities of today  the baker is just drawing his loaves out of the oven remarked kenyon do you smell how sour they are i should fancy that minerva in revenge for the desecration of her temple had slyly poured vinegar into the batch if i did not know that the modern romans prefer their bread in the acetous fermentation  they turned into the via alessandria and thus gained the rear of the temple of peace and passing beneath its great arches pursued their way along a hedgebordered lane in all probability a stately roman street lay buried beneath that rusticlooking pathway for they had now emerged from the close and narrow avenues of the modern city and were treading on a soil where the seeds of antique grandeur had not yet produced the squalid crop that elsewhere sprouts from them grassy as the lane was it skirted along heaps of shapeless ruin and the bare site of the vast temple that hadrian planned and built it terminated on the edge of a somewhat abrupt descent at the foot of which with a muddy ditch between rose in the bright moonlight the great curving wall and multitudinous arches of the coliseum     chapter xvii   miriams trouble   as usual of a moonlight evening several carriages stood at the entrance of this famous ruin and the precincts and interior were anything but a solitude the french sentinel on duty beneath the principal archway eyed our party curiously but offered no obstacle to their admission within the moonlight filled and flooded the great empty space it glowed upon tier above tier of ruined grassgrown arches and made them even too distinctly visible the splendor of the revelation took away that inestimable effect of dimness and mystery by which the imagination might be assisted to build a grander structure than the coliseum and to shatter it with a more picturesque decay byrons celebrated description is better than the reality he beheld the scene in his minds eye through the witchery of many intervening years and faintly illuminated it as if with starlight instead of this broad glow of moonshine  the party of our friends sat down three or four of them on a prostrate column another on a shapeless lump of marble once a roman altar others on the steps of one of the christian shrines goths and barbarians though they were they chatted as gayly together as if they belonged to the gentle and pleasant race of people who now inhabit italy there was much pastime and gayety just then in the area of the coliseum where so many gladiators and wild beasts had fought and died and where so much blood of christian martyrs had been lapped up by that fiercest of wild beasts the roman populace of yore some youths and maidens were running merry races across the open space and playing at hide and seek a little way within the duskiness of the ground tier of arches whence now and then you could hear the halfshriek halflaugh of a frolicsome girl whom the shadow had betrayed into a young mans arms elder groups were seated on the fragments of pillars and blocks of marble that lay round the verge of the arena talking in the quick short ripple of the italian tongue on the steps of the great black cross in the centre of the coliseum sat a party singing scraps of songs with much laughter and merriment between the stanzas  it was a strange place for song and mirth that black cross marks one of the special bloodspots of the earth where thousands of times over the dying gladiator fell and more of human agony has been endured for the mere pastime of the multitude than on the breadth of many battlefields from all this crime and suffering however the spot has derived a more than common sanctity an inscription promises seven years indulgence seven years of remission from the pains of purgatory and earlier enjoyment of heavenly bliss for each separate kiss imprinted on the black cross what better use could be made of life after middle age when the accumulated sins are many and the remaining temptations few than to spend it all in kissing the black cross of the coliseum  besides its central consecration the whole area has been made sacred by a range of shrines which are erected round the circle each commemorating some scene or circumstance of the saviours passion and suffering in accordance with an ordinary custom a pilgrim was making his progress from shrine to shrine upon his knees and saying a penitential prayer at each lightfooted girls ran across the path along which he crept or sported with their friends close by the shrines where he was kneeling the pilgrim took no heed and the girls meant no irreverence for in italy religion jostles along side by side with business and sport after a fashion of its own and people are accustomed to kneel down and pray or see others praying between two fits of merriment or between two sins  to make an end of our description a red twinkle of light was visible amid the breadth of shadow that fell across the upper part of the coliseum now it glimmered through a line of arches or threw a broader gleam as it rose out of some profound abyss of ruin now it was muffled by a heap of shrubbery which had adventurously clambered to that dizzy height and so the red light kept ascending to loftier and loftier ranges of the structure until it stood like a star where the blue sky rested against the coliseums topmost wall it indicated a party of english or americans paying the inevitable visit by moonlight and exalting themselves with raptures that were byrons not their own  our company of artists sat on the fallen column the pagan altar and the steps of the christian shrine enjoying the moonlight and shadow the present gayety and the gloomy reminiscences of the scene in almost equal share artists indeed are lifted by the ideality of their pursuits a little way off the earth and are therefore able to catch the evanescent fragrance that floats in the atmosphere of life above the heads of the ordinary crowd even if they seem endowed with little imagination individually yet there is a property a gift a talisman common to their class entitling them to partake somewhat more bountifully than other people in the thin delights of moonshine and romance  how delightful this is said hilda and she sighed for very pleasure  yes said kenyon who sat on the column at her side the coliseum is far more delightful as we enjoy it now than when eighty thousand persons sat squeezed together row above row to see their fellow creatures torn by lions and tigers limb from limb what a strange thought that the coliseum was really built for us and has not come to its best uses till almost two thousand years after it was finished  the emperor vespasian scarcely had us in his mind said hilda smiling but i thank him none the less for building it  he gets small thanks i fear from the people whose bloody instincts he pampered rejoined kenyon fancy a nightly assemblage of eighty thousand melancholy and remorseful ghosts looking down from those tiers of broken arches striving to repent of the savage pleasures which they once enjoyed but still longing to enjoy them over again  you bring a gothic horror into this peaceful moonlight scene said hilda   nay i have good authority for peopling the coliseum with phantoms replied the sculptor do you remember that veritable scene in benvenuto cellinis autobiography in which a necromancer of his acquaintance draws a magic circlejust where the black cross stands now i supposeand raises myriads of demons benvenuto saw them with his own eyesgiants pygmies and other creatures of frightful aspect capering and dancing on yonder walls those spectres must have been romans in their lifetime and frequenters of this bloody amphitheatre  i see a spectre now said hilda with a little thrill of uneasiness have you watched that pilgrim who is going round the whole circle of shrines on his knees and praying with such fervency at every one now that he has revolved so far in his orbit and has the moonshine on his face as he turns towards us methinks i recognize him  and so do i said kenyon poor miriam do you think she sees him  they looked round and perceived that miriam had risen from the steps of the shrine and disappeared she had shrunk back in fact into the deep obscurity of an arch that opened just behind them  donatello whose faithful watch was no more to be eluded than that of a hound had stolen after her and became the innocent witness of a spectacle that had its own kind of horror unaware of his presence and fancying herself wholly unseen the beautiful miriam began to gesticulate extravagantly gnashing her teeth flinging her arms wildly abroad stamping with her foot  it was as if she had stepped aside for an instant solely to snatch the relief of a brief fit of madness persons in acute trouble or laboring under strong excitement with a necessity for concealing it are prone to relieve their nerves in this wild way although when practicable they find a more effectual solace in shrieking aloud  thus as soon as she threw off her selfcontrol under the dusky arches of the coliseum we may consider miriam as a mad woman concentrating the elements of a long insanity into that instant  signorina signorina have pity on me cried donatello approaching her this is too terrible  how dare you look at me exclaimed miriam with a start then whispering below her breath men have been struck dead for a less offence  if you desire it or need it said donatello humbly i shall not be loath to die  donatello said miriam coming close to the young man and speaking low but still the almost insanity of the moment vibrating in her voice if you love yourself if you desire those earthly blessings such as you of all men were made for if you would come to a good old age among your olive orchards and your tuscan vines as your forefathers did if you would leave children to enjoy the same peaceful happy innocent life then flee from me look not behind you get you gone without another word he gazed sadly at her but did not stir i tell you miriam went on there is a great evil hanging over me i know it i see it in the sky i feel it in the air it will overwhelm me as utterly as if this arch should crumble down upon our heads it will crush you too if you stand at my side depart then and make the sign of the cross as your faith bids you when an evil spirit is nigh cast me off or you are lost forever  a higher sentiment brightened upon donatellos face than had hitherto seemed to belong to its simple expression and sensuous beauty  i will never quit you he said you cannot drive me from you  poor donatello said miriam in a changed tone and rather to herself than him is there no other that seeks me out follows meis obstinate to share my affliction and my doombut only you they call me beautiful and i used to fancy that at my need i could bring the whole world to my feet and lo here is my utmost need and my beauty and my gifts have brought me only this poor simple boy halfwitted they call him and surely fit for nothing but to be happy and i accept his aid tomorrow tomorrow i will tell him all ah what a sin to stain his joyous nature with the blackness of a woe like mine  she held out her hand to him and smiled sadly as donatello pressed it to his lips they were now about to emerge from the depth of the arch but just then the kneeling pilgrim in his revolution round the orbit of the shrines had reached the one on the steps of which miriam had been sitting there as at the other shrines he prayed or seemed to pray it struck kenyon howeverwho sat close by and saw his face distinctly that the suppliant was merely performing an enjoined penance and without the penitence that ought to have given it effectual life even as he knelt his eyes wandered and miriam soon felt that he had detected her half hidden as she was within the obscurity of the arch  he is evidently a good catholic however whispered one of the party after all i fear we cannot identify him with the ancient pagan who haunts the catacombs  the doctors of the propaganda may have converted him said another they have had fifteen hundred years to perform the task  the company now deemed it time to continue their ramble emerging from a side entrance of the coliseum they had on their left the arch of constantine and above it the shapeless ruins of the palace of the caesars portions of which have taken shape anew in mediaeval convents and modern villas they turned their faces cityward and treading over the broad flagstones of the old roman pavement passed through the arch of titus the moon shone brightly enough within it to show the sevenbranched jewish candlestick cut in the marble of the interior the original of that awful trophy lies buried at this moment in the yellow mud of the tiber and could its gold of ophir again be brought to light it would be the most precious relic of past ages in the estimation of both jew and gentile  standing amid so much ancient dust it is difficult to spare the reader the commonplaces of enthusiasm on which hundreds of tourists have already insisted over this halfworn pavement and beneath this arch of titus the roman armies had trodden in their outward march to fight battles a worlds width away returning victorious with royal captives and inestimable spoil a roman triumph that most gorgeous pageant of earthly pride had streamed and flaunted in hundredfold succession over these same flagstones and through this yet stalwart archway it is politic however to make few allusions to such a past nor if we would create an interest in the characters of our story is it wise to suggest how ciceros foot may have stepped on yonder stone or how horace was wont to stroll near by making his footsteps chime with the measure of the ode that was ringing in his mind the very ghosts of that massive and stately epoch have so much density that the actual people of today seem the thinner of the two and stand more ghostlike by the arches and columns letting the rich sculpture be discerned through their illcompacted substance  the party kept onward often meeting pairs and groups of midnight strollers like themselves on such a moonlight night as this rome keeps itself awake and stirring and is full of song and pastime the noise of which mingles with your dreams if you have gone betimes to bed but it is better to be abroad and take our own share of the enjoyable time for the languor that weighs so heavily in the roman atmosphere by day is lightened beneath the moon and stars  they had now reached the precincts of the forum     chapter xviii   on the edge of a precipice   let us settle it said kenyon stamping his foot firmly down that this is precisely the spot where the chasm opened into which curtius precipitated his good steed and himself imagine the great dusky gap impenetrably deep and with halfshaped monsters and hideous faces looming upward out of it to the vast affright of the good citizens who peeped over the brim there now is a subject hitherto unthought of for a grim and ghastly story and methinks with a moral as deep as the gulf itself within it beyond a question there were prophetic visionsintimations of all the future calamities of romeshades of goths and gauls and even of the french soldiers of today it was a pity to close it up so soon i would give much for a peep into such a chasm  i fancy remarked miriam that every person takes a peep into it in moments of gloom and despondency that is to say in his moments of deepest insight  where is it then asked hilda i never peeped into it  wait and it will open for you replied her friend the chasm was merely one of the orifices of that pit of blackness that lies beneath us everywhere the firmest substance of human happiness is but a thin crust spread over it with just reality enough to bear up the illusive stage scenery amid which we tread it needs no earthquake to open the chasm a footstep a little heavier than ordinary will serve and we must step very daintily not to break through the crust at any moment by and by we inevitably sink it was a foolish piece of heroism in curtius to precipitate himself there in advance for all rome you see has been swallowed up in that gulf in spite of him the palace of the caesars has gone down thither with a hollow rumbling sound of its fragments all the temples have tumbled into it and thousands of statues have been thrown after all the armies and the triumphs have marched into the great chasm with their martial music playing as they stepped over the brink all the heroes the statesmen and the poets all piled upon poor curtius who thought to have saved them all i am loath to smile at the selfconceit of that gallant horseman but cannot well avoid it  it grieves me to hear you speak thus miriam said hilda whose natural and cheerful piety was shocked by her friends gloomy view of human destinies it seems to me that there is no chasm nor any hideous emptiness under our feet except what the evil within us digs if there be such a chasm let us bridge it over with good thoughts and deeds and we shall tread safely to the other side it was the guilt of rome no doubt that caused this gulf to open and curtius filled it up with his heroic selfsacrifice and patriotism which was the best virtue that the old romans knew every wrong thing makes the gulf deeper every right one helps to fill it up as the evil of rome was far more than its good the whole commonwealth finally sank into it indeed but of no original necessity  well hilda it came to the same thing at last answered miriam despondingly  doubtless too resumed the sculptor for his imagination was greatly excited by the idea of this wondrous chasm all the blood that the romans shed whether on battlefields or in the coliseum or on the crossin whatever public or private murderran into this fatal gulf and formed a mighty subterranean lake of gore right beneath our feet the blood from the thirty wounds in caesars breast flowed hitherward and that pure little rivulet from virginias bosom too virginia beyond all question was stabbed by her father precisely where we are standing  then the spot is hallowed forever said hilda  is there such blessed potency in bloodshed asked miriam nay hilda do not protest i take your meaning rightly  they again moved forward and still from the forum and the via sacra from beneath the arches of the temple of peace on one side and the acclivity of the palace of the caesars on the other there arose singing voices of parties that were strolling through the moonlight thus the air was full of kindred melodies that encountered one another and twined themselves into a broad vague music out of which no single strain could be disentangled these good examples as well as the harmonious influences of the hour incited our artist friends to make proof of their own vocal powers with what skill and breath they had they set up a choral strainhail columbia we believe which those old roman echoes must have found it exceeding difficult to repeat aright even hilda poured the slender sweetness of her note into her countrys song miriam was at first silent being perhaps unfamiliar with the air and burden but suddenly she threw out such a swell and gush of sound that it seemed to pervade the whole choir of other voices and then to rise above them all and become audible in what would else have been thee silence of an upper region that volume of melodious voice was one of the tokens of a great trouble there had long been an impulse upon heramounting at last to a necessity to shriek aloud but she had struggled against it till the thunderous anthem gave her an opportunity to relieve her heart by a great cry  they passed the solitary column of phocas and looked down into the excavated space where a confusion of pillars arches pavements and shattered blocks and shaftsthe crumbs of various ruin dropped from the devouring maw of time stand or lie at the base of the capitoline hill that renowned hillock for it is little more now arose abruptly above them the ponderous masonry with which the hillside is built up is as old as rome itself and looks likely to endure while the world retains any substance or permanence it once sustained the capitol and now bears up the great pile which the mediaeval builders raised on the antique foundation and that still loftier tower which looks abroad upon a larger page of deeper historic interest than any other scene can show on the same pedestal of roman masonry other structures will doubtless rise and vanish like ephemeral things  to a spectator on the spot it is remarkable that the events of roman history and roman life itself appear not so distant as the gothic ages which succeeded them we stand in the forum or on the height of the capitol and seem to see the roman epoch close at hand we forget that a chasm extends between it and ourselves in which lie all those dark rude unlettered centuries around the birthtime of christianity as well as the age of chivalry and romance the feudal system and the infancy of a better civilization than that of rome or if we remember these mediaeval times they look further off than the augustan age the reason may be that the old roman literature survives and creates for us an intimacy with the classic ages which we have no means of forming with the subsequent ones  the italian climate moreover robs age of its reverence and makes it look newer than it is not the coliseum nor the tombs of the appian way nor the oldest pillar in the forum nor any other roman ruin be it as dilapidated as it may ever give the impression of venerable antiquity which we gather along with the ivy from the gray walls of an english abbey or castle and yet every brick or stone which we pick up among the former had fallen ages before the foundation of the latter was begun this is owing to the kindliness with which natures takes an english ruin to her heart covering it with ivy as tenderly as robin redbreast covered the dead babes with forest leaves she strives to make it a part of herself gradually obliterating the handiwork of man and supplanting it with her own mosses and trailing verdure till she has won the whole structure back but in italy whenever man has once hewn a stone nature forthwith relinquishes her right to it and never lays her finger on it again age after age finds it bare and naked in the barren sunshine and leaves it so besides this natural disadvantage too each succeeding century in rome has done its best to ruin the very ruins so far as their picturesque effect is concerned by stealing away the marble and hewn stone and leaving only yellow bricks which never can look venerable   the party ascended the winding way that leads from the forum to the piazza of the campidoglio on the summit of the capitoline hill they stood awhile to contemplate the bronze equestrian statue of marcus aurelius the moonlight glistened upon traces of the gilding which had once covered both rider and steed these were almost gone but the aspect of dignity was still perfect clothing the figure as it were with an imperial robe of light it is the most majestic representation of the kingly character that ever the world has seen a sight of the old heathen emperor is enough to create an evanescent sentiment of loyalty even in a democratic bosom so august does he look so fit to rule so worthy of mans profoundest homage and obedience so inevitably attractive of his love he stretches forth his hand with an air of grand beneficence and unlimited authority as if uttering a decree from which no appeal was permissible but in which the obedient subject would find his highest interests consulted a command that was in itself a benediction  the sculptor of this statue knew what a king should be observed kenyon and knew likewise the heart of mankind and how it craves a true ruler under whatever title as a child its father  o if there were but one such man as this exclaimed miriam one such man in an age and one in all the world then how speedily would the strife wickedness and sorrow of us poor creatures be relieved we would come to him with our griefs whatever they might beeven a poor frail woman burdened with her heavy heartand lay them at his feet and never need to take them up again the rightful king would see to all  what an idea of the regal office and duty said kenyon with a smile it is a womans idea of the whole matter to perfection it is hildas too no doubt  no answered the quiet hilda i should never look for such assistance from an earthly king  hilda my religious hilda whispered miriam suddenly drawing the girl close to her do you know how it is with me i would give all i have or hopemy life o how freelyfor one instant of your trust in god you little guess my need of it you really think then that he sees and cares for us  miriam you frighten me  hush hush do not let them hear yet whispered miriam i frighten you you say for heavens sake how am i strange is there anything wild in my behavior  only for that moment replied hilda because you seemed to doubt gods providence  we will talk of that another time said her friend just now it is very dark to me  on the left of the piazza of the campidoglio as you face cityward and at the head of the long and stately flight of steps descending from the capitoline hill to the level of lower rome there is a narrow lane or passage into this the party of our friends now turned the path ascended a little and ran along under the walls of a palace but soon passed through a gateway and terminated in a small paved courtyard it was bordered by a low parapet  the spot for some reason or other impressed them as exceedingly lonely on one side was the great height of the palace with the moonshine falling over it and showing all the windows barred and shuttered not a human eye could look down into the little courtyard even if the seemingly deserted palace had a tenant on all other sides of its narrow compass there was nothing but the parapet which as it now appeared was built right on the edge of a steep precipice gazing from its imminent brow the party beheld a crowded confusion of roofs spreading over the whole space between them and the line of hills that lay beyond the tiber a long misty wreath just dense enough to catch a little of the moonshine floated above the houses midway towards the hilly line and showed the course of the unseen river far away on the right the moon gleamed on the dome of st peters as well as on many lesser and nearer domes  what a beautiful view of the city exclaimed hilda and i never saw rome from this point before  it ought to afford a good prospect said the sculptor for it was from this pointat least we are at liberty to think so if we choosethat many a famous roman caught his last glimpse of his native city and of all other earthly things this is one of the sides of the tarpeian rock look over the parapet and see what a sheer tumble there might still be for a traitor in spite of the thirty feet of soil that have accumulated at the foot of the precipice  they all bent over and saw that the cliff fell perpendicularly downward to about the depth or rather more at which the tall palace rose in height above their heads not that it was still the natural shaggy front of the original precipice for it appeared to be cased in ancient stonework through which the primeval rock showed its face here and there grimly and doubtfully mosses grew on the slight projections and little shrubs sprouted out of the crevices but could not much soften the stern aspect of the cliff brightly as the italian moonlight fell adown the height it scarcely showed what portion of it was mans work and what was natures but left it all in very much the same kind of ambiguity and halfknowledge in which antiquarians generally leave the identity of roman remains  the roofs of some poorlooking houses which had been built against the base and sides of the cliff rose nearly midway to the top but from an angle of the parapet there was a precipitous plunge straight downward into a stonepaved court  i prefer this to any other site as having been veritably the traitors leap said kenyon because it was so convenient to the capitol it was an admirable idea of those stern old fellows to fling their political criminals down from the very summit on which stood the senate house and joves temple emblems of the institutions which they sought to violate it symbolizes how sudden was the fall in those days from the utmost height of ambition to its profoundest ruin  come come it is midnight cried another artist too late to be moralizing here we are literally dreaming on the edge of a precipice let us go home  it is time indeed said hilda  the sculptor was not without hopes that he might be favored with the sweet charge of escorting hilda to the foot of her tower accordingly when the party prepared to turn back he offered her his arm hilda at first accepted it but when they had partly threaded the passage between the little courtyard and the piazza del campidoglio she discovered that miriam had remained behind  i must go back said she withdrawing her arm from kenyons but pray do not come with me several times this evening i have had a fancy that miriam had something on her mind some sorrow or perplexity which perhaps it would relieve her to tell me about no no do not turn back donatello will be a sufficient guardian for miriam and me  the sculptor was a good deal mortified and perhaps a little angry but he knew hildas mood of gentle decision and independence too well not to obey her he therefore suffered the fearless maiden to return alone  meanwhile miriam had not noticed the departure of the rest of the company she remained on the edge of the precipice and donatello along with her  it would be a fatal fall still she said to herself looking over the parapet and shuddering as her eye measured the depth yes surely yes even without the weight of an overburdened heart a human body would fall heavily enough upon those stones to shake all its joints asunder how soon it would be over  donatello of whose presence she was possibly not aware now pressed closer to her side and he too like miriam bent over the low parapet and trembled violently yet he seemed to feel that perilous fascination which haunts the brow of precipices tempting the unwary one to fling himself over for the very horror of the thing for after drawing hastily back he again looked down thrusting himself out farther than before he then stood silent a brief space struggling perhaps to make himself conscious of the historic associations of the scene  what are you thinking of donatello asked miriam  who are they said he looking earnestly in her face who have been flung over here in days gone by  men that cumbered the world she replied men whose lives were the bane of their fellow creatures men who poisoned the air which is the common breath of all for their own selfish purposes there was short work with such men in old roman times just in the moment of their triumph a hand as of an avenging giant clutched them and dashed the wretches down this precipice  was it well done asked the young man  it was well done answered miriam innocent persons were saved by the destruction of a guilty one who deserved his doom  while this brief conversation passed donatello had once or twice glanced aside with a watchful air just as a hound may often be seen to take sidelong note of some suspicious object while he gives his more direct attention to something nearer at hand miriam seemed now first to become aware of the silence that had followed upon the cheerful talk and laughter of a few moments before  looking round she perceived that all her company of merry friends had retired and hilda too in whose soft and quiet presence she had always an indescribable feeling of security all gone and only herself and donatello left hanging over the brow of the ominous precipice  not so however not entirely alone in the basement wall of the palace shaded from the moon there was a deep empty niche that had probably once contained a statue not empty either for a figure now came forth from it and approached miriam she must have had cause to dread some unspeakable evil from this strange persecutor and to know that this was the very crisis of her calamity for as he drew near such a cold sick despair crept over her that it impeded her breath and benumbed her natural promptitude of thought miriam seemed dreamily to remember falling on her knees but in her whole recollection of that wild moment she beheld herself as in a dim show and could not well distinguish what was done and suffered no not even whether she were really an actor and sufferer in the scene  hilda meanwhile had separated herself from the sculptor and turned back to rejoin her friend at a distance she still heard the mirth of her late companions who were going down the cityward descent of the capitoline hill they had set up a new stave of melody in which her own soft voice as well as the powerful sweetness of miriams was sadly missed  the door of the little courtyard had swung upon its hinges and partly closed itself hilda whose native gentleness pervaded all her movements was quietly opening it when she was startled midway by the noise of a struggle within beginning and ending all in one breathless instant along with it or closely succeeding it was a loud fearful cry which quivered upward through the air and sank quivering downward to the earth then a silence poor hilda had looked into the courtyard and saw the whole quick passage of a deed which took but that little time to grave itself in the eternal adamant     chapter xix   the fauns transformation   the door of the courtyard swung slowly and closed itself of its own accord miriam and donatello were now alone there she clasped her hands and looked wildly at the young man whose form seemed to have dilated and whose eyes blazed with the fierce energy that had suddenly inspired him it had kindled him into a man it had developed within him an intelligence which was no native characteristic of the donatello whom we have heretofore known but that simple and joyous creature was gone forever  what have you done said miriam in a horrorstricken whisper  the glow of rage was still lurid on donatellos face and now flashed out again from his eyes  i did what ought to be done to a traitor he replied i did what your eyes bade me do when i asked them with mine as i held the wretch over the precipice  these last words struck miriam like a bullet could it be so had her eyes provoked or assented to this deed she had not known it but alas looking back into the frenzy and turmoil of the scene just acted she could not denyshe was not sure whether it might be so or nothat a wild joy had flamed up in her heart when she beheld her persecutor in his mortal peril was it horroror ecstasy or both in one be the emotion what it might it had blazed up more madly when donatello flung his victim off the cliff and more and more while his shriek went quivering downward with the dead thump upon the stones below had come an unutterable horror  and my eyes bade you do it repeated she  they both leaned over the parapet and gazed downward as earnestly as if some inestimable treasure had fallen over and were yet recoverable on the pavement below was a dark mass lying in a heap with little or nothing human in its appearance except that the hands were stretched out as if they might have clutched for a moment at the small square stones but there was no motion in them now miriam watched the heap of mortality while she could count a hundred which she took pains to do no stir not a finger moved  you have killed him donatello he is quite dead said she stone dead would i were so too  did you not mean that he should die sternly asked donatello still in the glow of that intelligence which passion had developed in him there was short time to weigh the matter but he had his trial in that breath or two while i held him over the cliff and his sentence in that one glance when your eyes responded to mine say that i have slain him against your willsay that he died without your whole consentand in another breath you shall see me lying beside him  o never cried miriam my one own friend never never never  she turned to himthe guilty bloodstained lonely womanshe turned to her fellow criminal the youth so lately innocent whom she had drawn into her doom she pressed him close close to her bosom with a clinging embrace that brought their two hearts together till the horror and agony of each was combined into one emotion and that a kind of rapture  yes donatello you speak the truth said she my heart consented to what you did we two slew yonder wretch the deed knots us together for time and eternity like the coil of a serpent  they threw one other glance at the heap of death below to assure themselves that it was there so like a dream was the whole thing then they turned from that fatal precipice and came out of the courtyard arm in arm heart in heart instinctively they were heedful not to sever themselves so much as a pace or two from one another for fear of the terror and deadly chill that would thenceforth wait for them in solitude their deedthe crime which donatello wrought and miriam accepted on the instanthad wreathed itself as she said like a serpent in inextricable links about both their souls and drew them into one by its terrible contractile power it was closer than a marriage bond so intimate in those first moments was the union that it seemed as if their new sympathy annihilated all other ties and that they were released from the chain of humanity a new sphere a special law had been created for them alone the world could not come near them they were safe  when they reached the flight of steps leading downward from the capitol there was a faroff noise of singing and laughter swift indeed had been the rush of the crisis that was come and gone this was still the merriment of the party that had so recently been their companions they recognized the voices which a little while ago had accorded and sung in cadence with their own but they were familiar voices no more they sounded strangely and as it were out of the depths of space so remote was all that pertained to the past life of these guilty ones in the moral seclusion that had suddenly extended itself around them but how close and ever closer did the breath of the immeasurable waste that lay between them and all brotherhood or sisterhood now press them one within the other  o friend cried miriam so putting her soul into the word that it took a heavy richness of meaning and seemed never to have been spoken before o friend are you conscious as i am of this companionship that knits our heartstrings together  i feel it miriam said donatello we draw one breath we live one life  only yesterday continued miriam nay only a short halfhour ago i shivered in an icy solitude no friendship no sisterhood could come near enough to keep the warmth within my heart in an instant all is changed there can be no more loneliness  none miriam said donatello  none my beautiful one responded miriam gazing in his face which had taken a higher almost an heroic aspect from the strength of passion none my innocent one surely it is no crime that we have committed one wretched and worthless life has been sacrificed to cement two other lives for evermore  for evermore miriam said donatello cemented with his blood  the young man started at the word which he had himself spoken it may be that it brought home to the simplicity of his imagination what he had not before dreamed ofthe everincreasing loathsomeness of a union that consists in guilt cemented with blood which would corrupt and grow more noisome forever and forever but bind them none the less strictly for that   forget it cast it all behind you said miriam detecting by her sympathy the pang that was in his heart the deed has done its office and has no existence any more  they flung the past behind them as she counselled or else distilled from it a fiery intoxication which sufficed to carry them triumphantly through those first moments of their doom for guilt has its moment of rapture too the foremost result of a broken law is ever an ecstatic sense of freedom and thus there exhaled upward out of their dark sympathy at the base of which lay a human corpse a bliss or an insanity which the unhappy pair imagined to be well worth the sleepy innocence that was forever lost to them  as their spirits rose to the solemn madness of the occasion they went onward not stealthily not fearfully but with a stately gait and aspect passion lent them as it does to meaner shapes its brief nobility of carriage they trod through the streets of rome as if they too were among the majestic and guilty shadows that from ages long gone by have haunted the bloodstained city and at miriams suggestion they turned aside for the sake of treading loftily past the old site of pompeys forum  for there was a great deed done here she saida deed of blood like ours who knows but we may meet the high and eversad fraternity of caesars murderers and exchange a salutation  are they our brethren now asked donatello  yes all of them said miriamand many another whom the world little dreams of has been made our brother or our sister by what we have done within this hour  and at the thought she shivered where then was the seclusion the remoteness the strange lonesome paradise into which she and her one companion had been transported by their crime was there indeed no such refuge but only a crowded thoroughfare and jostling throng of criminals and was it true that whatever hand had a bloodstain on itor had poured out poisonor strangled a babe at its birthor clutched a grandsires throat he sleeping and robbed him of his few last breathshad now the right to offer itself in fellowship with their two hands too certainly that right existed it is a terrible thought that an individual wrongdoing melts into the great mass of human crime and makes us who dreamed only of our own little separate sinmakes us guilty of the whole and thus miriam and her lover were not an insulated pair but members of an innumerable confraternity of guilty ones all shuddering at each other  but not now not yet she murmured to herself tonight at least there shall be no remorse  wandering without a purpose it so chanced that they turned into a street at one extremity of which stood hildas tower there was a light in her high chamber a light too at the virgins shrine and the glimmer of these two was the loftiest light beneath the stars miriam drew donatellos arm to make him stop and while they stood at some distance looking at hildas window they beheld her approach and throw it open she leaned far forth and extended her clasped hands towards the sky  the good pure child she is praying donatello said miriam with a kind of simple joy at witnessing the devoutness of her friend then her own sin rushed upon her and she shouted with the rich strength of her voice pray for us hilda we need it  whether hilda heard and recognized the voice we cannot tell the window was immediately closed and her form disappeared from behind the snowy curtain miriam felt this to be a token that the cry of her condemned spirit was shut out of heaven     chapter xx   the burial chant   the church of the capuchins where as the reader may remember some of our acquaintances had made an engagement to meet stands a little aside from the piazza barberini thither at the hour agreed upon on the morning after the scenes last described miriam and donatello directed their steps at no time are people so sedulously careful to keep their trifling appointments attend to their ordinary occupations and thus put a commonplace aspect on life as when conscious of some secret that if suspected would make them look monstrous in the general eye  yet how tame and wearisome is the impression of all ordinary things in the contrast with such a fact how sick and tremulous the next morning is the spirit that has dared so much only the night before how icy cold is the heart when the fervor the wild ecstasy of passion has faded away and sunk down among the dead ashes of the fire that blazed so fiercely and was fed by the very substance of its life how faintly does the criminal stagger onward lacking the impulse of that strong madness that hurried him into guilt and treacherously deserts him in the midst of it  when miriam and donatello drew near the church they found only kenyon awaiting them on the steps hilda had likewise promised to be of the party but had not yet appeared meeting the sculptor miriam put a force upon herself and succeeded in creating an artificial flow of spirits which to any but the nicest observation was quite as effective as a natural one she spoke sympathizingly to the sculptor on the subject of hildas absence and somewhat annoyed him by alluding in donatellos hearing to an attachment which had never been openly avowed though perhaps plainly enough betrayed he fancied that miriam did not quite recognize the limits of the strictest delicacy he even went so far as to generalize and conclude within himself that this deficiency is a more general failing in woman than in man the highest refinement being a masculine attribute  but the idea was unjust to the sex at large and especially so to this poor miriam who was hardly responsible for her frantic efforts to be gay possibly moreover the nice action of the mind is set ajar by any violent shock as of great misfortune or great crime so that the finer perceptions may be blurred thenceforth and the effect be traceable in all the minutest conduct of life  did you see anything of the dear child after you left us asked miriam still keeping hilda as her topic of conversation i missed her sadly on my way homeward for nothing insures me such delightful and innocent dreams i have experienced it twenty times as a talk late in the evening with hilda  so i should imagine said the sculptor gravely but it is an advantage that i have little or no opportunity of enjoying i know not what became of hilda after my parting from you she was not especially my companion in any part of our walk the last i saw of her she was hastening back to rejoin you in the courtyard of the palazzo caffarelli  impossible cried miriam starting  then did you not see her again inquired kenyon in some alarm  not there answered miriam quietly indeed i followed pretty closely on the heels of the rest of the party but do not be alarmed on hildas account the virgin is bound to watch over the good child for the sake of the piety with which she keeps the lamp alight at her shrine and besides i have always felt that hilda is just as safe in these evil streets of rome as her white doves when they fly downwards from the tower top and run to and fro among the horses feet there is certainly a providence on purpose for hilda if for no other human creature  i religiously believe it rejoined the sculptor and yet my mind would be the easier if i knew that she had returned safely to her tower  then make yourself quite easy answered miriam i saw her and it is the last sweet sight that i remember leaning from her window midway between earth and sky  kenyon now looked at donatello  you seem out of spirits my dear friend he observed this languid roman atmosphere is not the airy wine that you were accustomed to breathe at home i have not forgotten your hospitable invitation to meet you this summer at your castle among the apennines it is my fixed purpose to come i assure you we shall both be the better for some deep draughts of the mountain breezes  it may he said donatello with unwonted sombreness the old house seemed joyous when i was a child but as i remember it now it was a grim place too  the sculptor looked more attentively at the young man and was surprised and alarmed to observe how entirely the fine fresh glow of animal spirits had departed out of his face hitherto moreover even while he was standing perfectly still there had been a kind of possible gambol indicated in his aspect it was quite gone now all his youthful gayety and with it his simplicity of manner was eclipsed if not utterly extinct   you are surely ill my dear fellow exclaimed kenyon  am i perhaps so said donatello indifferently i never have been ill and know not what it may be  do not make the poor lad fancysink whispered miriam pulling the sculptors sleeve he is of a nature to lie down and die at once if he finds himself drawing such melancholy breaths as we ordinary people are enforced to burden our lungs withal but we must get him away from this old dreamy and dreary rome where nobody but himself ever thought of being gay its influences are too heavy to sustain the life of such a creature  the above conversation had passed chiefly on the steps of the cappuccini and having said so much miriam lifted the leathern curtain that hangs before all churchdoors in italy hilda has forgotten her appointment she observed or else her maiden slumbers are very sound this morning we will wait for her no longer  they entered the nave the interior of the church was of moderate compass but of good architecture with a vaulted roof over the nave and a row of dusky chapels on either side of it instead of the customary sideaisles each chapel had its saintly shrine hung round with offerings its picture above the altar although closely veiled if by any painter of renown and its hallowed tapers burning continually to set alight the devotion of the worshippers the pavement of the nave was chiefly of marble and looked old and broken and was shabbily patched here and there with tiles of brick it was inlaid moreover with tombstones of the mediaeval taste on which were quaintly sculptured borders figures and portraits in basrelief and latin epitaphs now grown illegible by the tread of footsteps over them the church appertains to a convent of capuchin monks and as usually happens when a reverend brotherhood have such an edifice in charge the floor seemed never to have been scrubbed or swept and had as little the aspect of sanctity as a kennel whereas in all churches of nunneries the maiden sisterhood invariably show the purity of their own hearts by the virgin cleanliness and visible consecration of the walls and pavement  as our friends entered the church their eyes rested at once on a remarkable object in the centre of the nave it was either the actual body or as might rather have been supposed at first glance the cunningly wrought waxen face and suitably draped figure of a dead monk this image of wax or claycold reality whichever it might be lay on a slightly elevated bier with three tall candles burning on each side another tall candle at the head and another at the foot there was music too in harmony with so funereal a spectacle from beneath the pavement of the church came the deep lugubrious strain of a de profundis which sounded like an utterance of the tomb itself so dismally did it rumble through the burial vaults and ooze up among the flat gravestones and sad epitaphs filling the church as with a gloomy mist  i must look more closely at that dead monk before we leave the church remarked the sculptor in the study of my art i have gained many a hint from the dead which the living could never have given me  i can well imagine it answered miriam one clay image is readily copied from another but let us first see guidos picture the light is favorable now  accordingly they turned into the first chapel on the right hand as you enter the nave and there they beheldnot the picture indeedbut a closely drawn curtain the churchmen of italy make no scruple of sacrificing the very purpose for which a work of sacred art has been created that of opening the way for religious sentiment through the quick medium of sight by bringing angels saints and martyrs down visibly upon earth of sacrificing this high purpose and for aught they know the welfare of many souls along with it to the hope of a paltry fee every work by an artist of celebrity is hidden behind a veil and seldom revealed except to protestants who scorn it as an object of devotion and value it only for its artistic merit  the sacristan was quickly found however and lost no time in disclosing the youthful archangel setting his divine foot on the head of his fallen adversary it was an image of that greatest of future events which we hope for so ardently at least while we are youngbut find so very long in coming the triumph of goodness over the evil principle  where can hilda be exclaimed kenyon it is not her custom ever to fail in an engagement and the present one was made entirely on her account except herself you know we were all agreed in our recollection of the picture  but we were wrong and hilda right as you perceive said miriam directing his attention to the point on which their dispute of the night before had arisen it is not easy to detect her astray as regards any picture on which those clear soft eyes of hers have ever rested  and she has studied and admired few pictures so much as this observed the sculptor no wonder for there is hardly another so beautiful in the world what an expression of heavenly severity in the archangels face there is a degree of pain trouble and disgust at being brought in contact with sin even for the purpose of quelling and punishing it and yet a celestial tranquillity pervades his whole being  i have never been able said miriam to admire this picture nearly so much as hilda does in its moral and intellectual aspect if it cost her more trouble to be good if her soul were less white and pure she would be a more competent critic of this picture and would estimate it not half so high i see its defects today more clearly than ever before  what are some of them asked kenyon  that archangel now miriam continued how fair he looks with his unruffled wings with his unhacked sword and clad in his bright armor and that exquisitely fitting skyblue tunic cut in the latest paradisiacal mode what a dainty air of the first celestial society with what halfscornful delicacy he sets his prettily sandalled foot on the head of his prostrate foe but is it thus that virtue looks the moment after its death struggle with evil no no i could have told guido better a full third of the archangels feathers should have been torn from his wings the rest all ruffled till they looked like satans own his sword should be streaming with blood and perhaps broken halfway to the hilt his armor crushed his robes rent his breast gory a bleeding gash on his brow cutting right across the stern scowl of battle he should press his foot hard down upon the old serpent as if his very soul depended upon it feeling him squirm mightily and doubting whether the fight were half over yet and how the victory might turn and with all this fierceness this grimness this unutterable horror there should still be something high tender and holy in michaels eyes and around his mouth but the battle never was such a childs play as guidos dapper archangel seems to have found it  for heavens sake miriam cried kenyon astonished at the wild energy of her talk paint the picture of mans struggle against sin according to your own idea i think it will be a masterpiece  the picture would have its share of truth i assure you she answered but i am sadly afraid the victory would fail on the wrong side just fancy a smokeblackened fieryeyed demon bestriding that nice young angel clutching his white throat with one of his hinder claws and giving a triumphant whisk of his scaly tail with a poisonous dart at the end of it that is what they risk poor souls who do battle with michaels enemy  it now perhaps struck miriam that her mental disquietude was impelling her to an undue vivacity for she paused and turned away from the picture without saying a word more about it all this while moreover donatello had been very ill at ease casting awestricken and inquiring glances at the dead monk as if he could look nowhere but at that ghastly object merely because it shocked him death has probably a peculiar horror and ugliness when forced upon the contemplation of a person so naturally joyous as donatello who lived with completeness in the present moment and was able to form but vague images of the future  what is the matter donatello whispered miriam soothingly you are quite in a tremble my poor friend what is it  this awful chant from beneath the church answered donatello it oppresses me the air is so heavy with it that i can scarcely draw my breath and yonder dead monk i feel as if he were lying right across my heart  take courage whispered she again come we will approach close to the dead monk the only way in such cases is to stare the ugly horror right in the face never a sidelong glance nor halflook for those are what show a frightfull thing in its frightfullest aspect lean on me dearest friend my heart is very strong for both of us be brave and all is well  donatello hung back for a moment but then pressed close to miriams side and suffered her to lead him up to the bier the sculptor followed a number of persons chiefly women with several children among them were standing about the corpse and as our three friends drew nigh a mother knelt down and caused her little boy to kneel both kissing the beads and crucifix that hung from the monks girdle possibly he had died in the odor of sanctity or at all events death and his brown frock and cowl made a sacred image of this reverend father     chapter xxi   the dead capuchin   the dead monk was clad as when alive in the brown woollen frock of the capuchins with the hood drawn over his head but so as to leave the features and a portion of the beard uncovered his rosary and cross hung at his side his hands were folded over his breast his feet he was of a barefooted order in his lifetime and continued so in death protruded from beneath his habit stiff and stark with a more waxen look than even his face they were tied together at the ankles with a black ribbon  the countenance as we have already said was fully displayed it had a purplish hue upon it unlike the paleness of an ordinary corpse but as little resembling the flush of natural life the eyelids were but partially drawn down and showed the eyeballs beneath as if the deceased friar were stealing a glimpse at the bystanders to watch whether they were duly impressed with the solemnity of his obsequies the shaggy eyebrows gave sternness to the look miriam passed between two of the lighted candles and stood close beside the bier  my god murmured she what is this  she grasped donatellos hand and at the same instant felt him give a convulsive shudder which she knew to have been caused by a sudden and terrible throb of the heart his hand by an instantaneous change became like ice within hers which likewise grew so icy that their insensible fingers might have rattled one against the other no wonder that their blood curdled no wonder that their hearts leaped and paused the dead face of the monk gazing at them beneath its halfclosed eyelids was the same visage that had glared upon their naked souls the past midnight as donatello flung him over the precipice  the sculptor was standing at the foot of the bier and had not yet seen the monks features  those naked feet said he i know not why but they affect me strangely they have walked to and fro over the hard pavements of rome and through a hundred other rough ways of this life where the monk went begging for his brotherhood along the cloisters and dreary corridors of his convent too from his youth upward it is a suggestive idea to track those worn feet backward through all the paths they have trodden ever since they were the tender and rosy little feet of a baby and cold as they now are were kept warm in his mothers hand  as his companions whom the sculptor supposed to be close by him made no response to his fanciful musing he looked up and saw them at the head of the bier he advanced thither himself  ha exclaimed he  he cast a horrorstricken and bewildered glance at miriam but withdrew it immediately not that he had any definite suspicion or it may be even a remote idea that she could be held responsible in the least degree for this mans sudden death in truth it seemed too wild a thought to connect in reality miriams persecutor of many past months and the vagabond of the preceding night with the dead capuchin of today it resembled one of those unaccountable changes and interminglings of identity which so often occur among the personages of a dream but kenyon as befitted the professor of an imaginative art was endowed with an exceedingly quick sensibility which was apt to give him intimations of the true state of matters that lay beyond his actual vision there was a whisper in his ear it said hush without asking himself wherefore he resolved to be silent as regarded the mysterious discovery which he had made and to leave any remark or exclamation to be voluntarily offered by miriam if she never spoke then let the riddle be unsolved  and now occurred a circumstance that would seem too fantastic to be told if it had not actually happened precisely as we set it down as the three friends stood by the bier they saw that a little stream of blood had begun to ooze from the dead monks nostrils it crept slowly towards the thicket of his beard where in the course of a moment or two it hid itself  how strange ejaculated kenyon the monk died of apoplexy i suppose or by some sudden accident and the blood has not yet congealed  do you consider that a sufficient explanation asked miriam with a smile from which the sculptor involuntarily turned away his eyes does it satisfy you  and why not he inquired  of course you know the old superstition about this phenomenon of blood flowing from a dead body she rejoined how can we tell but that the murderer of this monk or possibly it may be only that privileged murderer his physician may have just entered the church  i cannot jest about it said kenyon it is an ugly sight  true true horrible to see or dream of she replied with one of those long tremulous sighs which so often betray a sick heart by escaping unexpectedly we will not look at it any more come away donatello let us escape from this dismal church the sunshine will do you good  when had ever a woman such a trial to sustain as this by no possible supposition could miriam explain the identity of the dead capuchin quietly and decorously laid out in the nave of his convent church with that of her murdered persecutor flung heedlessly at the foot of the precipice the effect upon her imagination was as if a strange and unknown corpse had miraculously while she was gazing at it assumed the likeness of that face so terrible henceforth in her remembrance it was a symbol perhaps of the deadly iteration with which she was doomed to behold the image of her crime reflected back upon her in a thousand ways and converting the great calm face of nature in the whole and in its innumerable details into a manifold reminiscence of that one dead visage  no sooner had miriam turned away from the bier and gone a few steps than she fancied the likeness altogether an illusion which would vanish at a closer and colder view she must look at it again therefore and at once or else the grave would close over the face and leave the awful fantasy that had connected itself therewith fixed ineffaceably in her brain  wait for me one moment she said to her companions only a moment  so she went back and gazed once more at the corpse yes these were the features that miriam had known so well this was the visage that she remembered from a far longer date than the most intimate of her friends suspected this form of clay had held the evil spirit which blasted her sweet youth and compelled her as it were to stain her womanhood with crime but whether it were the majesty of death or something originally noble and lofty in the character of the dead which the soul had stamped upon the features as it left them so it was that miriam now quailed and shook not for the vulgar horror of the spectacle but for the severe reproachful glance that seemed to come from between those halfclosed lids true there had been nothing in his lifetime viler than this man she knew it there was no other fact within her consciousness that she felt to be so certain and yet because her persecutor found himself safe and irrefutable in death he frowned upon his victim and threw back the blame on her  is it thou indeed she murmured under her breath then thou hast no right to scowl upon me so but art thou real or a vision she bent down over the dead monk till one of her rich curls brushed against his forehead she touched one of his folded hands with her finger  it is he said miriam there is the scar that i know so well on his brow and it is no vision he is palpable to my touch i will question the fact no longer but deal with it as i best can  it was wonderful to see how the crisis developed in miriam its own proper strength and the faculty of sustaining the demands which it made upon her fortitude she ceased to tremble the beautiful woman gazed sternly at her dead enemy endeavoring to meet and quell the look of accusation that he threw from between his halfclosed eyelids  no thou shalt not scowl me down said she neither now nor when we stand together at the judgmentseat i fear not to meet thee there farewell till that next encounter  haughtily waving her hand miriam rejoined her friends who were awaiting her at the door of the church as they went out the sacristan stopped them and proposed to show the cemetery of the convent where the deceased members of the fraternity are laid to rest in sacred earth brought long ago from jerusalem  and will yonder monk be buried there she asked  brother antonio exclaimed the sacristan  surely our good brother will be put to bed there his grave is already dug and the last occupant has made room for him will you look at it signorina  i will said miriam  then excuse me observed kenyon for i shall leave you one dead monk has more than sufficed me and i am not bold enough to face the whole mortality of the convent  it was easy to see by donatellos looks that he as well as the sculptor would gladly have escaped a visit to the famous cemetery of the cappuccini but miriams nerves were strained to such a pitch that she anticipated a certain solace and absolute relief in passing from one ghastly spectacle to another of longaccumulated ugliness and there was besides a singular sense of duty which impelled her to look at the final restingplace of the being whose fate had been so disastrously involved with her own she therefore followed the sacristans guidance and drew her companion along with her whispering encouragement as they went  the cemetery is beneath the church but entirely above ground and lighted by a row of irongrated windows without glass a corridor runs along beside these windows and gives access to three or four vaulted recesses or chapels of considerable breadth and height the floor of which consists of the consecrated earth of jerusalem it is smoothed decorously over the deceased brethren of the convent and is kept quite free from grass or weeds such as would grow even in these gloomy recesses if pains were not bestowed to root them up but as the cemetery is small and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy ground the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed when one of their number dies to take the longest buried skeleton out of the oldest grave and lay the new slumberer there instead thus each of the good friars in his turn enjoys the luxury of a consecrated bed attended with the slight drawback of being forced to get up long before daybreak as it were and make room for another lodger  the arrangement of the unearthed skeletons is what makes the special interest of the cemetery the arched and vaulted walls of the burial recesses are supported by massive pillars and pilasters made of thighbones and skulls the whole material of the structure appears to be of a similar kind and the knobs and embossed ornaments of this strange architecture are represented by the joints of the spine and the more delicate tracery by the smaller bones of the human frame the summits of the arches are adorned with entire skeletons looking as if they were wrought most skilfully in basrelief there is no possibility of describing how ugly and grotesque is the effect combined with a certain artistic merit nor how much perverted ingenuity has been shown in this queer way nor what a multitude of dead monks through how many hundred years must have contributed their bony framework to build up these great arches of mortality on some of the skulls there are inscriptions purporting that such a monk who formerly made use of that particular headpiece died on such a day and year but vastly the greater number are piled up indistinguishably into the architectural design like the many deaths that make up the one glory of a victory  in the side walls of the vaults are niches where skeleton monks sit or stand clad in the brown habits that they wore in life and labelled with their names and the dates of their decease their skulls some quite bare and others still covered with yellow skin and hair that has known the earthdamps look out from beneath their hoods grinning hideously repulsive one reverend father has his mouth wide open as if he had died in the midst of a howl of terror and remorse which perhaps is even now screeching through eternity as a general thing however these frocked and hooded skeletons seem to take a more cheerful view of their position and try with ghastly smiles to turn it into a jest but the cemetery of the capuchins is no place to nourish celestial hopes the soul sinks forlorn and wretched under all this burden of dusty death the holy earth from jerusalem so imbued is it with mortality has grown as barren of the flowers of paradise as it is of earthly weeds and grass thank heaven for its blue sky it needs a long upward gaze to give us back our faith not here can we feel ourselves immortal where the very altars in these chapels of horrible consecration are heaps of human bones  yet let us give the cemetery the praise that it deserves there is no disagreeable scent such as might have been expected from the decay of so many holy persons in whatever odor of sanctity they may have taken their departure the same number of living monks would not smell half so unexceptionably  miriam went gloomily along the corridor from one vaulted golgotha to another until in the farthest recess she beheld an open grave  is that for him who lies yonder in the nave she asked  yes signorina this is to be the restingplace of brother antonio who came to his death last night answered the sacristan and in yonder niche you see sits a brother who was buried thirty years ago and has risen to give him place  it is not a satisfactory idea observed miriam that you poor friars cannot call even your graves permanently your own you must lie down in them methinks with a nervous anticipation of being disturbed like weary men who know that they shall be summoned out of bed at midnight is it not possible if money were to be paid for the privilege to leave brother antonioif that be his namein the occupancy of that narrow grave till the last trumpet sounds  by no means signorina neither is it needful or desirable answered the sacristan a quarter of a centurys sleep in the sweet earth of jerusalem is better than a thousand years in any other soil our brethren find good rest there no ghost was ever known to steal out of this blessed cemetery  that is well responded miriam may he whom you now lay to sleep prove no exception to the rule  as they left the cemetery she put money into the sacristans hand to an amount that made his eyes open wide and glisten and requested that it might be expended in masses for the repose of father antonios soul     chapter xxii   the medici gardens   donatello said miriam anxiously as they came through the piazza barberini what can i do for you my beloved friend you are shaking as with the cold fit of the roman fever yes said donatello my heart shivers as soon as she could collect her thoughts miriam led the young man to the gardens of the villa medici hoping that the quiet shade and sunshine of that delightful retreat would a little revive his spirits the grounds are there laid out in the old fashion of straight paths with borders of box which form hedges of great height and density and are shorn and trimmed to the evenness of a wall of stone at the top and sides there are green alleys with long vistas overshadowed by ilextrees and at each intersection of the paths the visitor finds seats of lichencovered stone to repose upon and marble statues that look forlornly at him regretful of their lost noses in the more open portions of the garden before the sculptured front of the villa you see fountains and flowerbeds and in their season a profusion of roses from which the genial sun of italy distils a fragrance to be scattered abroad by the no less genial breeze  but donatello drew no delight from these things he walked onward in silent apathy and looked at miriam with strangely halfawakened and bewildered eyes when she sought to bring his mind into sympathy with hers and so relieve his heart of the burden that lay lumpishly upon it  she made him sit down on a stone bench where two embowered alleys crossed each other so that they could discern the approach of any casual intruder a long way down the path  my sweet friend she said taking one of his passive hands in both of hers what can i say to comfort you  nothing replied donatello with sombre reserve nothing will ever comfort me  i accept my own misery continued miriam my own guilt if guilt it be and whether guilt or misery i shall know how to deal with it but you dearest friend that were the rarest creature in all this world and seemed a being to whom sorrow could not clingyou whom i half fancied to belong to a race that had vanished forever you only surviving to show mankind how genial and how joyous life used to be in some longgone agewhat had you to do with grief or crime  they came to me as to other men said donatello broodingly doubtless i was born to them  no no they came with me replied miriam mine is the responsibility alas wherefore was i born why did we ever meet why did i not drive you from me knowing for my heart foreboded itthat the cloud in which i walked would likewise envelop you  donatello stirred uneasily with the irritable impatience that is often combined with a mood of leaden despondency a brown lizard with two tailsa monster often engendered by the roman sunshineran across his foot and made him start then he sat silent awhile and so did miriam trying to dissolve her whole heart into sympathy and lavish it all upon him were it only for a moments cordial  the young man lifted his hand to his breast and unintentionally as miriams hand was within his he lifted that along with it i have a great weight here said he the fancy struck miriam but she drove it resolutely down that donatello almost imperceptibly shuddered while in pressing his own hand against his heart he pressed hers there too  rest your heart on me dearest one she resumed let me bear all its weight i am well able to bear it for i am a woman and i love you i love you donatello is there no comfort for you in this avowal look at me heretofore you have found me pleasant to your sight gaze into my eyes gaze into my soul search as deeply as you may you can never see half the tenderness and devotion that i henceforth cherish for you all that i ask is your acceptance of the utter selfsacrifice but it shall be no sacrifice to my great love with which i seek to remedy the evil you have incurred for my sake  all this fervor on miriams part on donatellos a heavy silence  o speak to me she exclaimed only promise me to be by and by a little happy  happy murmured donatello ah never again never again  never ah that is a terrible word to say to me answered miriam a terrible word to let fall upon a womans heart when she loves you and is conscious of having caused your misery if you love me donatello speak it not again and surely you did love me  i did replied donatello gloomily and absently  miriam released the young mans hand but suffered one of her own to lie close to his and waited a moment to see whether he would make any effort to retain it there was much depending upon that simple experiment  with a deep sighas when sometimes a slumberer turns over in a troubled dream donatello changed his position and clasped both his hands over his forehead the genial warmth of a roman april kindling into may was in the atmosphere around them but when miriam saw that involuntary movement and heard that sigh of relief for so she interpreted it a shiver ran through her frame as if the iciest wind of the apennines were blowing over her  he has done himself a greater wrong than i dreamed of thought she with unutterable compassion alas it was a sad mistake he might have had a kind of bliss in the consequences of this deed had he been impelled to it by a love vital enough to survive the frenzy of that terrible moment mighty enough to make its own law and justify itself against the natural remorse but to have perpetrated a dreadful murder and such was his crime unless love annihilating moral distinctions made it otherwise on no better warrant than a boys idle fantasy i pity him from the very depths of my soul as for myself i am past my own or others pity  she arose from the young mans side and stood before him with a sad commiserating aspect it was the look of a ruined soul bewailing in him a grief less than what her profounder sympathies imposed upon herself  donatello we must part she said with melancholy firmness yes leave me go back to your old tower which overlooks the green valley you have told me of among the apennines then all that has passed will be recognized as but an ugly dream for in dreams the conscience sleeps and we often stain ourselves with guilt of which we should be incapable in our waking moments the deed you seemed to do last night was no more than such a dream there was as little substance in what you fancied yourself doing go and forget it all  ah that terrible face said donatello pressing his hands over his eyes do you call that unreal  yes for you beheld it with dreaming eyes replied miriam it was unreal and that you may feel it so it is requisite that you see this face of mine no more once you may have thought it beautiful now it has lost its charm yet it would still retain a miserable potency to bring back the past illusion and in its train the remorse and anguish that would darken all your life leave me therefore and forget me  forget you miriam said donatello roused somewhat from his apathy of despair  if i could remember you and behold you apart from that frightful visage which stares at me over your shoulder that were a consolation at least if not a joy  but since that visage haunts you along with mine rejoined miriam glancing behind her we needs must part farewell then but if everin distress peril shame poverty or whatever anguish is most poignant whatever burden heaviestyou should require a life to be given wholly only to make your own a little easier then summon me as the case now stands between us you have bought me dear and find me of little worth fling me away therefore may you never need me more but if otherwise a wishalmost an unuttered wish will bring me to you  she stood a moment expecting a reply but donatellos eyes had again fallen on the ground and he had not in his bewildered mind and overburdened heart a word to respond  that hour i speak of may never come said miriam so farewellfarewell forever  farewell said donatello  his voice hardly made its way through the environment of unaccustomed thoughts and emotions which had settled over him like a dense and dark cloud not improbably he beheld miriam through so dim a medium that she looked visionary heard her speak only in a thin faint echo  she turned from the young man and much as her heart yearned towards him she would not profane that heavy parting by an embrace or even a pressure of the hand so soon after the semblance of such mighty love and after it had been the impulse to so terrible a deed they parted in all outward show as coldly as people part whose whole mutual intercourse has been encircled within a single hour  and donatello when miriam had departed stretched himself at full length on the stone bench and drew his hat over his eyes as the idle and lighthearted youths of dreamy italy are accustomed to do when they lie down in the first convenient shade and snatch a noonday slumber a stupor was upon him which he mistook for such drowsiness as he had known in his innocent past life but by and by he raised himself slowly and left the garden sometimes poor donatello started as if he heard a shriek sometimes he shrank back as if a face fearful to behold were thrust close to his own in this dismal mood bewildered with the novelty of sin and grief he had little left of that singular resemblance on account of which and for their sport his three friends had fantastically recognized him as the veritable faun of praxiteles     chapter xxiii   miriam and hilda   on leaving the medici gardens miriam felt herself astray in the world and having no special reason to seek one place more than another she suffered chance to direct her steps as it would thus it happened that involving herself in the crookedness of rome she saw hildas tower rising before her and was put in mind to climb to the young girls eyry and ask why she had broken her engagement at the church of the capuchins people often do the idlest acts of their lifetime in their heaviest and most anxious moments so that it would have been no wonder had miriam been impelled only by so slight a motive of curiosity as we have indicated but she remembered too and with a quaking heart what the sculptor had mentioned of hildas retracing her steps towards the courtyard of the palazzo caffarelli in quest of miriam herself had she been compelled to choose between infamy in the eyes of the whole world or in hildas eyes alone she would unhesitatingly have accepted the former on condition of remaining spotless in the estimation of her whitesouled friend this possibility therefore that hilda had witnessed the scene of the past night was unquestionably the cause that drew miriam to the tower and made her linger and falter as she approached it  as she drew near there were tokens to which her disturbed mind gave a sinister interpretation some of her friends airy family the doves with their heads imbedded disconsolately in their bosoms were huddled in a corner of the piazza others had alighted on the heads wings shoulders and trumpets of the marble angels which adorned the facade of the neighboring church two or three had betaken themselves to the virgins shrine and as many as could find room were sitting on hildas windowsill but all of them so miriam fancied had a look of weary expectation and disappointment no flights no flutterings no cooing murmur something that ought to have made their day glad and bright was evidently left out of this days history and furthermore hildas white windowcurtain was closely drawn with only that one little aperture at the side which miriam remembered noticing the night before  be quiet said miriam to her own heart pressing her hand hard upon it why shouldst thou throb now hast thou not endured more terrible things than this  whatever were her apprehensions she would not turn back it might beand the solace would be worth a worldthat hilda knowing nothing of the past nights calamity would greet her friend with a sunny smile and so restore a portion of the vital warmth for lack of which her soul was frozen but could miriam guilty as she was permit hilda to kiss her cheek to clasp her hand and thus be no longer so unspotted from the world as heretofore  i will never permit her sweet touch again said miriam toiling up the staircase if i can find strength of heart to forbid it but o it would be so soothing in this wintry feverfit of my heart there can be no harm to my white hilda in one parting kiss that shall be all  but on reaching the upper landingplace miriam paused and stirred not again till she had brought herself to an immovable resolve  my lips my hand shall never meet hildas more said she  meanwhile hilda sat listlessly in her paintingroom had you looked into the little adjoining chamber you might have seen the slight imprint of her figure on the bed but would also have detected at once that the white counterpane had not been turned down the pillow was more disturbed she had turned her face upon it the poor child and bedewed it with some of those tears among the most chill and forlorn that gush from human sorrow which the innocent heart pours forth at its first actual discovery that sin is in the world the young and pure are not apt to find out that miserable truth until it is brought home to them by the guiltiness of some trusted friend they may have heard much of the evil of the world and seem to know it but only as an impalpable theory in due time some mortal whom they reverence too highly is commissioned by providence to teach them this direful lesson he perpetrates a sin and adam falls anew and paradise heretofore in unfaded bloom is lost again and dosed forever with the fiery swords gleaming at its gates  the chair in which hilda sat was near the portrait of beatrice cenci which had not yet been taken from the easel it is a peculiarity of this picture that its profoundest expression eludes a straightforward glance and can only be caught by side glimpses or when the eye falls casually upon it even as if the painted face had a life and consciousness of its own and resolving not to betray its secret of grief or guilt permitted the true tokens to come forth only when it imagined itself unseen no other such magical effect has ever been wrought by pencil  now opposite the easel hung a lookingglass in which beatrices face and hildas were both reflected in one of her weary nerveless changes of position hilda happened to throw her eyes on the glass and took in both these images at one unpremeditated glance she fanciednor was it without horrorthat beatrices expression seen aside and vanishing in a moment had been depicted in her own face likewise and flitted from it as timorously  am i too stained with guilt thought the poor girl hiding her face in her hands  not so thank heaven but as regards beatrices picture the incident suggests a theory which may account for its unutterable grief and mysterious shadow of guilt without detracting from the purity which we love to attribute to that illfated girl who indeed can look at that mouthwith its lips half apart as innocent as a babes that has been crying and not pronounce beatrice sinless it was the intimate consciousness of her fathers sin that threw its shadow over her and frightened her into a remote and inaccessible region where no sympathy could come it was the knowledge of miriams guilt that lent the same expression to hildas face  but hilda nervously moved her chair so that the images in the glass should be no longer visible she now watched a speck of sunshine that came through a shuttered window and crept from object to object indicating each with a touch of its bright finger and then letting them all vanish successively in like manner her mind so like sunlight in its natural cheerfulness went from thought to thought but found nothing that it could dwell upon for comfort never before had this young energetic active spirit known what it is to be despondent it was the unreality of the world that made her so her dearest friend whose heart seemed the most solid and richest of hildas possessions had no existence for her any more and in that dreary void out of which miriam had disappeared the substance the truth the integrity of life the motives of effort the joy of success had departed along with her  it was long past noon when a step came up the staircase it had passed beyond the limits where there was communication with the lower regions of the palace and was mounting the successive flights which led only to hildas precincts faint as the tread was she heard and recognized it it startled her into sudden life her first impulse was to spring to the door of the studio and fasten it with lock and bolt but a second thought made her feel that this would be an unworthy cowardice on her own part and also that miriamonly yesterday her closest friend had a right to be told face to face that thenceforth they must be forever strangers  she heard miriam pause outside of the door we have already seen what was the latters resolve with respect to any kiss or pressure of the hand between hilda and herself we know not what became of the resolution as miriam was of a highly impulsive character it may have vanished at the first sight of hilda but at all events she appeared to have dressed herself up in a garb of sunshine and was disclosed as the door swung open in all the glow of her remarkable beauty the truth was her heart leaped conclusively towards the only refuge that it had or hoped she forgot just one instant all cause for holding herself aloof ordinarily there was a certain reserve in miriams demonstrations of affection in consonance with the delicacy of her friend today she opened her arms to take hilda in  dearest darling hilda she exclaimed it gives me new life to see you  hilda was standing in the middle of the room when her friend made a step or two from the door she put forth her hands with an involuntary repellent gesture so expressive that miriam at once felt a great chasm opening itself between them two they might gaze at one another from the opposite side but without the possibility of ever meeting more or at least since the chasm could never be bridged over they must tread the whole round of eternity to meet on the other side there was even a terror in the thought of their meeting again it was as if hilda or miriam were dead and could no longer hold intercourse without violating a spiritual law  yet in the wantonness of her despair miriam made one more step towards the friend whom she had lost do not come nearer miriam said hilda her look and tone were those of sorrowful entreaty and yet they expressed a kind of confidence as if the girl were conscious of a safeguard that could not be violated  what has happened between us hilda asked miriam are we not friends  no no said hilda shuddering  at least we have been friends continued miriam i loved you dearly i love you still you were to me as a younger sister yes dearer than sisters of the same blood for you and i were so lonely hilda that the whole world pressed us together by its solitude and strangeness then will you not touch my hand am i not the same as yesterday  alas no miriam said hilda  yes the same the same for you hilda rejoined her lost friend were you to touch my hand you would find it as warm to your grasp as ever if you were sick or suffering i would watch night and day for you it is in such simple offices that true affection shows itself and so i speak of them yet now hilda your very look seems to put me beyond the limits of human kind  it is not i miriam said hilda not i that have done this  you and you only hilda replied miriam stirred up to make her own cause good by the repellent force which her friend opposed to her i am a woman as i was yesterday endowed with the same truth of nature the same warmth of heart the same genuine and earnest love which you have always known in me in any regard that concerns yourself i am not changed and believe me hilda when a human being has chosen a friend out of all the world it is only some faithlessness between themselves rendering true intercourse impossible that can justify either friend in severing the bond have i deceived you then cast me off have i wronged you personally then forgive me if you can but have i sinned against god and man and deeply sinned then be more my friend than ever for i need you more  do not bewilder me thus miriam exclaimed hilda who had not forborne to express by look and gesture the anguish which this interview inflicted on her if i were one of gods angels with a nature incapable of stain and garments that never could be spotted i would keep ever at your side and try to lead you upward but i am a poor lonely girl whom god has set here in an evil world and given her only a white robe and bid her wear it back to him as white as when she put it on your powerful magnetism would be too much for me the pure white atmosphere in which i try to discern what things are good and true would be discolored and therefore miriam before it is too late i mean to put faith in this awful heartquake which warns me henceforth to avoid you  ah this is hard ah this is terrible murmured miriam dropping her forehead in her hands in a moment or two she looked up again as pale as death but with a composed countenance i always said hilda that you were merciless for i had a perception of it even while you loved me best you have no sin nor any conception of what it is and therefore you are so terribly severe as an angel you are not amiss but as a human creature and a woman among earthly men and women you need a sin to soften you  god forgive me said hilda if i have said a needlessly cruel word  let it pass answered miriam i whose heart it has smitten upon forgive you and tell me before we part forever what have you seen or known of me since we last met  a terrible thing miriam said hilda growing paler than before  do you see it written in my face or painted in my eyes inquired miriam her trouble seeking relief in a halffrenzied raillery i would fain know how it is that providence or fate brings eyewitnesses to watch us when we fancy ourselves acting in the remotest privacy did all rome see it then or at least our merry company of artists or is it some bloodstain on me or deathscent in my garments they say that monstrous deformities sprout out of fiends who once were lovely angels do you perceive such in me already tell me by our past friendship hilda all you know  thus adjured and frightened by the wild emotion which miriam could not suppress hilda strove to tell what she had witnessed  after the rest of the party had passed on i went back to speak to you she said for there seemed to be a trouble on your mind and i wished to share it with you if you could permit me the door of the little courtyard was partly shut but i pushed it open and saw you within and donatello and a third person whom i had before noticed in the shadow of a niche he approached you miriam you knelt to him i saw donatello spring upon him i would have shrieked but my throat was dry i would have rushed forward but my limbs seemed rooted to the earth it was like a flash of lightning a look passed from your eyes to donatellosa lookyes hilda yes exclaimed miriam with intense eagerness do not pause now that look  it revealed all your heart miriam continued hilda covering her eyes as if to shut out the recollection a look of hatred triumph vengeance and as it were joy at some unhopedfor relief  ah donatello was right then murmured miriam who shook throughout all her frame my eyes bade him do it go on hilda  it all passed so quickly all like a glare of lightning said hilda and yet it seemed to me that donatello had paused while one might draw a breath but that look ah miriam spare me need i tell more  no more there needs no more hilda replied miriam bowing her head as if listening to a sentence of condemnation from a supreme tribunal it is enough you have satisfied my mind on a point where it was greatly disturbed henceforward i shall be quiet thank you hilda  she was on the point of departing but turned back again from the threshold  this is a terrible secret to be kept in a young girls bosom she observed what will you do with it my poor child  heaven help and guide me answered hilda bursting into tears for the burden of it crushes me to the earth it seems a crime to know of such a thing and to keep it to myself it knocks within my heart continually threatening imploring insisting to be let out o my mothermy mother were she yet living i would travel over land and sea to tell her this dark secret as i told all the little troubles of my infancy but i am alonealone miriam you were my dearest only friend advise me what to do  this was a singular appeal no doubt from the stainless maiden to the guilty woman whom she had just banished from her heart forever but it bore striking testimony to the impression which miriams natural uprightness and impulsive generosity had made on the friend who knew her best and it deeply comforted the poor criminal by proving to her that the bond between hilda and herself was vital yet  as far as she was able miriam at once responded to the girls cry for help  if i deemed it good for your peace of mind she said to bear testimony against me for this deed in the face of all the world no consideration of myself should weigh with me an instant but i believe that you would find no relief in such a course what men call justice lies chiefly in outward formalities and has never the close application and fitness that would be satisfactory to a soul like yours i cannot be fairly tried and judged before an earthly tribunal and of this hilda you would perhaps become fatally conscious when it was too late roman justice above all things is a byword what have you to do with it leave all such thoughts aside yet hilda i would not have you keep my secret imprisoned in your heart if it tries to leap out and stings you like a wild venomous thing when you thrust it back again have you no other friend now that you have been forced to give me up  no other answered hilda sadly  yes kenyon rejoined miriam  he cannot be my friend said hilda becausebecausei have fancied that he sought to be something more  fear nothing replied miriam shaking her head with a strange smile this story will frighten his newborn love out of its little life if that be what you wish tell him the secret then and take his wise and honorable counsel as to what should next be done i know not what else to say  i never dreamed said hildahow could you think itof betraying you to justice but i see how it is miriam i must keep your secret and die of it unless god sends me some relief by methods which are now beyond my power to imagine it is very dreadful ah now i understand how the sins of generations past have created an atmosphere of sin for those that follow while there is a single guilty person in the universe each innocent one must feel his innocence tortured by that guilt your deed miriam has darkened the whole sky  poor hilda turned from her unhappy friend and sinking on her knees in a corner of the chamber could not be prevailed upon to utter another word and miriam with a long regard from the threshold bade farewell to this doves nest this one little nook of pure thoughts and innocent enthusiasms into which she had brought such trouble every crime destroys more edens than our own
