street where ive seen beards in the winder  you hook em on over your ears  get one o them each pull our caps over our eyes and turn our collars up and there you are  ginger made a lot of objections not because he didnt think it was a good idea but because he didnt like peter thinking of it instead of im but he gave way at last and arter he ad got the beard he stood for a long time in front o the glass thinking wot a difference it would ha made to his looks if he had ad black air instead o red  waiting for the evening made the day seem very long to em but it came at last and with the beards in their pockets they slipped out and went for a walk round  they ad arf a pint each at a publicouse at the top of the minories just to steady themselves and then they came out and hooked on their beards and wot with them and pulling their caps down and turning their coatcollars up there wasnt much of their faces to be seen by anybody  it was just five minutes to nine when they got to tower hill and they walked down the middle of the road keeping a bright lookout for old sam a little way down they saw a couple o chaps leaning up agin a closed gate in the dock wall lighting their pipes and peter and ginger both nudged each other with their elbows at the same time  they ad just got to the bottom of the hill when sam turned the corner  peter wouldnt believe at fust that the old man wasnt really the worse for liquor e was so lifelike  many a drunken man would ha been proud to ha done it arf so well and it made im pleased to think that sam was a pal of is  him and ginger turned and crept up behind the old man on tiptoe and then all of a sudden he tilted sams cap over is eyes and flung his arms round im while ginger felt in is coatpockets and took out a leather purse chock full o money  it was all done and over in a moment and then to gingers great surprise sam suddenly lifted is foot and gave im a fearful kick on the shin of is leg and at the same time let drive with all his might in is face  ginger went down as if he ad been shot and as peter went to elp him up he got a bang over the cad that put im alongside o ginger arter which sam turned and trotted off down the hill like a dancingbear  illustration let drive with all his might in is face   for arf a minute ginger didnt know where e was and afore he found out the two men theyd seen in the gateway came up and one of em put his knee in gingers back and eld him while the other caught hold of his and and dragged the purse out of it  arter which they both made off up the hill as ard as they could go while peter russet in a faint voice called police arter them  he got up presently and helped ginger up and they both stood there pitying themselves and elping each other to think of names to call sam  well the moneys gorn and its is own silly fault ses ginger  but wotever appens he mustnt know that we had a and in it mind that  he can starve for all i care ses peter feeling his ead  i wont lend im a hapennynot a single blessed hapenny  whod ha thought e could ha hit like that says ginger  thats wot gets over me  i never ad such a bang in my lifenever  im going to ave a little drop o brandymy ead is fair swimming  peter ad one too but though they went into the private bar it wasnt private enough for them and when the landlady asked ginger whod been kissing im he put is glass down with a bang and walked straight off ome  sam adnt turned up by the time they got there and pore ginger took advantage of it to put a little warm candlegrease on is bad leg  then he bathed is face very careful and elped peter bathe his ead  they ad just finished when they heard sam coming upstairs and ginger sat down on is bed and began to whistle while peter took up a bit o newspaper and stood by the candle reading it  lor lumme ginger ses sam staring at im  what ha you been adoing to your face  me ses ginger carelesslike  oh we ad a bit of a scrap down limehouse way with some scotchies  peter got a crack over the ead at the same time  ah ive ad a bit of a scrap too ses sam smiling all over but i didnt get marked  oh ses peter without looking up from is paper  was it a little boy then  ses ginger

ginger in a choking voice  knuckledusters ses sam and i turned up tonight at tower hill with one on each and just as the clock was striking nine  i see em the moment i turned the cornertwo enormous big chaps a yard acrost the shoulders coming down the middle of the roadyouve got a cold ginger  no i aint ses ginger  i pretended to be drunk same as the tec told me ses sam and then i felt em turn round and creep up behind me  one of em come up behind and put is knee in my back and caught me by the throat and the other gave me a punch in the chest and while i was gasping for breath took my purse away  then i started on em  lor ses ginger very nasty  i fought like a lion ses sam  twice they ad me down and twice i got up agin and hammered em  they both of em ad knives but my blood was up
