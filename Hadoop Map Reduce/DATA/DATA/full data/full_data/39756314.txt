39756314	phaethon loose thoughts for loose thinkers  1852    templeton and i were lounging by the clear limestone stream which crossed his park and wound away round wooded hills toward the distant severn  a lovelier fishing morning sportsman never saw  a soft gray underroof of cloud slid on before a soft west wind and here and there a stray gleam of sunlight shot into the vale across the purple mountaintops and awoke into busy life the denizens of the water already quickened by the mysterious electric influences of the last nights thundershower  the longwinged cinnamonflies spun and fluttered over the pools the sandbees hummed merrily round their burrows in the marly bank and delicate iridescent ephemerae rose by hundreds from the depths and dropping their shells floated away each a tiny venus anadyomene down the glassy ripples of the reaches  every moment a heavy splash beneath some overhanging tuft of milfoil or water hemlock proclaimed the death doom of a hapless beetle who had dropped into the stream beneath yet still we fished and fished and caught nothing and seemed utterly careless about catching anything till the old keeper who followed us sighing and shrugging his shoulders broke forth into open remonstrance  excuse my liberty gentlemen but what ever is the matter with you and master sir  i never did see you miss so many honest rises before  it is too true said templeton to me with a laugh  i must confess i have been dreaming instead of fishing the whole morning but what has happened to you who are not as apt as i am to do nothing by trying to do two things at once  my hand may well be somewhat unsteady for to tell the truth i sat up all last night writing  a hopeful preparation for a days fishing in limestone water  but what can have set you on writing all night after so busy and talkative an evening as the last ending too as it did somewhere about halfpast twelve  perhaps the said talkative evening itself and i suspect if you will confess the truth you will say that your mornings meditations are running very much in the same channel  lewis said he after a pause go up to the hall and bring some luncheon for us down to the lower waterfall  and a wheelbarrow to carry home the fish sir  if you wish to warm yourself certainly  and now my good fellow said he as the old keeper toddled away up the park i will open my hearta process for which i have but few opportunities hereto an old college friend  i am disturbed and saddened by last nights talk and by last nights guest  by the american professor  how in the name of english exclusiveness did such a rampantly heterodox spiritual guerilla invade the respectabilities and conservatisms of herefordshire  he was returning from a tour through wales and had introductions to me from some manchester friends of mine to avail himself of which i found he had gone some thirty miles out of his way  complimentary to you at least  to lady jane i suspect rather than to me for he told me broadly enough that all the flattering attentions which he had received in manchesterwhere you know all such prophets are received with open arms their only credentials being that whatsoever they believe they shall not believe the biblehad not given him the pleasure which he had received from that one introduction to what he called the inner hearthlife of the english landed aristocracy  but what did you think of him  do you really wish to know  i do  then honestly i never heard so much magniloquent unwisdom talked in the same space of time  it was the sense of shame for my race which kept me silent all the evening  i could not trust myself to argue with a grayhaired saxon man whose fifty years of life seemed to have left him a child in all but the childlike heart which alone can enter into the kingdom of heaven  you are severe said templeton smilingly though as if his estimate were not very different from mine  can one help being severe when one hears irreverence poured forth from reverend lips  i do not mean merely irreverence for the catholic creeds that to my mindgod forgive me if i misjudge him seemed to me only one fruit of a deep root of irreverence for all things as they are even for all things as they seem  did you not remark the audacious contempt for all ages but our glorious nineteenth century and the still deeper contempt for all in the said glorious time who dared to believe that there was any ascertained truth independent of the private fancy and opinion of for i am afraid it came to thathim professor windrush and his circle of elect souls  you may believe nothing if you like and welcome but if you do take to that unnecessary act you are a fool if you believe anything but what i believethough i do not choose to state what that is  is not that now a pretty fair formulisation of his doctrine  but my dear raver said templeton laughing the man believed at least in physical science  i am sure we heard enough about its triumphs  it may be so  but to me his very spiritualism seemed more materialistic than his physics  his notion seemed to be though heaven forbid that i should say that he ever put it formally before himself  or anything else said templeton sotto voce  that it is the spiritual world which is governed by physical laws and the physical by spiritual ones that while men and women are merely the puppets of cerebrations and mentations and attractions and repulsions it is the trees and stones and gases who have the wills and the energies and the faiths and the virtues and the personalities  you are caricaturing  how so  how can i judge otherwise when i hear a man talking as he did of god in terms which every one of them involved what we call the essential properties of matterspace time passibility motion setting forth phrenology and mesmerism as the great organs of education even of the regeneration of mankind apologising for the earlier ravings of the poughkeepsie seer and considering his later eclecticopantheist farragos as great utterances  while whenever he talked of nature he showed the most credulous craving after everything which we the countrymen of bacon have been taught to consider unscientifichomoeopathy electrobiology loves of the plants a la darwin vestiges of creation vegetarianisms teetotalismsnever mind what provided it was unaccredited or condemned by regularly educated men of science  but you dont mean to assert that there is nothing in any of these theories  of course not  i can no more prove a universal negative about them than i can about the existence of life on the moon  but i do say that this contempt for that which has been already discoveredthis carelessness about induction from the normal phenomena coupled with this hankering after theories built upon exceptional onesthis craving for signs and wonders which is the sure accompaniment of a dying faith in god and in nature as gods workare symptoms which make me tremble for the fate of physical as well as of spiritual science both in america and in the americanists here at home  as the professor talked on i could not help thinking of the neo platonists of alexandria and their exactly similar coursedownward from a spiritualism of notions and emotions which in every term confessed its own materialism to the fearful discovery that consciousness does not reveal god not even matter but only its own existence and then onward in desperate search after something external wherein to trust towards theurgic fetish worship and the secret virtues of gems and flowers and stars and last of all to the lowest depth of bowing statues and winking pictures  the sixth century saw that career templeton the nineteenth may see it re enacted with only these differences that the natureworship which seems coming will be all the more crushing and slavish because we know so much better how vast and glorious nature is and that the superstitions will be more clumsy and foolish in proportion as our saxon brain is less acute and discursive and our education less severely scientific than those of the old greeks  silence raver cried templeton throwing himself on the grass in fits of laughter  so the professors grandchildren will have either turned papists or be bowing down before rusty locomotives and broken electric telegraphs  but my good friend you surely do not take professor windrush for a fair sample of the great american people  god forbid that so unpractical a talker should be a sample of the most practical people upon earth  the americans have their engineers their geographers their astronomers their scientific chemists few indeed but such as bid fair to rival those of any nation upon earth  but these like other true workers hold their tongues and do their business  and they have a few indigenous authors too  you must have read the biglow papers and the fable for critics and last but not least uncle toms cabin  yes and i have had far less fear for americans since i read that book for it showed me that there was right healthy power artistic as well as intellectual among them even nowready when their present borrowed peacocks feathers have fallen off to come forth and prove that the yankee eagle is a right gallant bird if he will but trust to his own natural plumage  and they have a few statesmen also  but they are curt plainspoken practicalin everything antipodal to the knot of hapless men who unable from some defect or morbidity to help on the real movement of their nation are fain to get their bread with tongue and pen by retailing to silly women ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth secondhand german eclecticisms now exploded even in the country where they arose and the very froth and scum of the medeas caldron in which the disjecta membra of old calvinism are pitiably seething  ah  it has been always the plan you know in england as well as in america courteously to avoid taking up a german theory till the germans had quite done with it and thrown it away for something new  but what are we to say of those who are trying to introduce into england these very americanised germanisms as the only teaching which can suit the needs of the old world  we will if we are in a vulgar humour apply to them a certain old proverb about teaching ones grandmother a certain simple operation on the egg of the domestic fowl but we will no less take shame to ourselves as sons of alma mater that such nonsense can get even a days hearing either among the daughters of manchester manufacturers or among london working men  had we taught them what we were taught in the schools templeton  alas my friend we must ourselves have learnt it first  i have no right to throw stones at the poor professor for i could not answer him  do not suppose that i can either  all i say ismankind has not lived in vain  least of all has it lived in vain during the last eighteen hundred years  it has gained something of eternal truth in every age and that which it has gained is as fresh and young now as ever and i will not throw away the bird in the hand for any number of birds in the bush  especially when you suspect most of them to be only wooden pheasants set up to delude poachers  well you are far more of a philister and a conservative than i thought you  the new is coming i doubt not but it must grow organically out of the oldnot root the old up and stick itself fullgrown into the place thereof like a french tree of libertysure of much the same fate  other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid already in spiritual things or in physical as the professor and his school will surely find  you recollect to whom the bible applies that text  i do  and yet you say you cannot answer the professor  i do not care to do so  there are certain roottruths which i know because they have been discovered and settled for ages and instead of accepting the challenge of every iknownotwhom to re examine them and begin the worlds work all over again i will test his theories by them and if they fail to coincide i will hear no more speech about the details of the branches and flowers for i shall know the root is rotten  but he too acknowledged certain of those roottruths said templeton who seemed to have a lingering sympathy with my victim he insisted most strongly and spoke you will not deny eloquently and nobly on the unity of the deity  on the nontrinity of it rather for i will not degrade the word him by applying it here  but tell me honestlycest le timbre qui fait la musiquedid his unity of the deity sound in your english biblebred heart at all like that ancient human personal hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord  much more like the something our nothing is one something  may we not suspect then that his notion of the unity of the deity does not quite coincide with the foundation already laid whosesoever else may  you are assuming rather hastily  perhaps i may prove also some day or other  do you think moreover that the theory which he so boldly started when his nerves and his manners were relieved from the unwonted pressure by lady jane and the ladies going upstairs was part of the same old foundation  which then  that if a man does but believe a thing he has a right to speak it and act on it right or wrong  have you forgotten his vindication of your friend the radical voter and his spirit of truth  what the worthy who when i canvassed him as the liberal candidate for  and promised to support complete freedom of religious opinion tested me by breaking out into such blasphemous ribaldry as made me run out of the house and then went and voted against me as a bigot  i mean him of course  the professor really seemed to admire the man as a more brave and conscientious hero than himself  i am not squeamish as you know but i am afraid that i was quite rude to him when he went as far as that  whatwhen you told him that you thought that after all the old theory of the divine right of kings was as plausible as the new theory of the divine right of blasphemy  my dear fellow do not fret yourself on that point  he seemed to take it rather as a compliment to his own audacity and whispered to me that the divine right of blasphemy was an expression of which theodore parker himself need not have been ashamed  he was pleased to be complimentary  but tell me what was it in his oratory which has so vexed the soul of the country squire  that very argument of his among many things  i saw or rather felt that he was wrong and yet as i have said already i could not answer him and had he not been my guest should have got thoroughly cross with him as a pisaller  i saw it  but my friend used we not to read plato together and enjoy him together in old cambridge days  do you not think that socrates might at all events have driven the professor into a corner  he might  but i cannot  is that then what you were writing about all last night  it was  i could not help when i went out on the terrace to smoke my last cigar fancying to myself how socrates might have seemed to set you and the professor and that warmhearted rightheaded wrongtongued highchurch curate all together by the ears and made confusion worse confounded for the time being and yet have left for each of you some hint whereby you might see the darling truth for which you were barking all the more clearly in the light of the one which you were howling down  and so you sat up andi thought the corridor smelt somewhat of smoke  forgive and i will confess  i wrote a dialogueand here it is if you choose to hear it  if there are a few passages or even many which plato would not have written you will consider my age and inexperience and forgive  my dear fellow you forget that i like you have been ten years away from dear old almamater plato the boats and potton wood my authorities now are morton on soils and miles on the horses foot  read on fearless of my criticisms  here is the waterfall we will settle ourselves on janes favourite seat  you shall discourse and i till lewis brings the luncheon will smoke my cigar and if i seem to be looking at the mountain dont fancy that i am only counting how many young grouse those heathburning worthies will have left me by the twelfth  so we sat down and i began   phaethon   alcibiades and i walked into the pnyx early the other morning before the people assembled  there we saw socrates standing having his face turned toward the rising sun  approaching him we perceived that he was praying and that so ardently that we touched him on the shoulder before he became aware of our presence  you seem like a man filled with the god socrates said alcibiades  would that were true answered he both of me and of all who will counsel here this day  in fact i was praying for that very thing namely that they might have light to see the truth in whatsoever matter might be discussed here  and for me also said alcibiades but i have prepared my speech already  and for you also if you desire iteven though some of your periods should be spoiled thereby  but why are you both here so early before any business is stirring  we were discussing said i that very thing for which we found you prayingnamely truth and what it might be  perhaps you went a worse way toward discovering it than i did  but let us hear  whence did the discussion arise  from something said alcibiades which protagoras said in his lecture yesterdayhow truth was what each man troweth or believeth to be true  so that he said one thing is true to me if i believe it true and another opposite thing to you if you believe that opposite  for continued he there is an objective and a subjective truth the former doubtless one and absolute and contained in the nature of each thing but the other manifold and relative varying with the faculties of each perceiver thereof but as each mans faculties he said were different from his neighbours and all more or less imperfect it was impossible that the absolute objective truth of anything could be seen by any mortal but only some partial approximation and as it were sketch of it according as the object was represented with more or less refraction on the mirror of his subjectivity  and therefore as the true inquirer deals only with the possible and lets the impossible go it was the business of the wise man shunning the search after absolute truth as an impious attempt of the titans to scale olympus to busy himself humbly and practically with subjective truth and with those methodsrhetoric for instanceby which he can make the subjective opinions of others either similar to his own or leaving them as they arefor it may be very often unnecessary to change themuseful to his own ends  then socrates laughing  my fine fellow you will have made more than one oration in the pnyx today  and indeed i myself felt quite exalted and rapt aloft like bellerophon on pegasus upon the eloquence of protagoras and you  but yet forgive me this one thing for my mother bare me as you know a manmidwife after her own trade and not a sage  alcibiades  what then  socrates  this my astonishing friendfor really i am altogether astonished and struck dumb as i always am whensoever i hear a brilliant talker like you discourse concerning objectivities and subjectivities and such mysterious words at such moments i am like an old warhorse who though he will rush on levelled lances shudders and sweats with terror at a boy rattling pebbles in a bladder and i feel altogether dizzy and dread lest i should suffer some such transformation as scylla when i hear awful words like incantations pronounced over me of which i being no sage understand nothing  but tell me now alcibiades did the opinion of protagoras altogether please you  a  why not  is it not certain that two equally honest men may differ in their opinions on the same matter  s  undeniable  a  but if each is equally sincere in speaking what he believes is not each equally moved by the spirit of truth  s  you seem to have been lately initiated and that not at eleusis merely nor in the cabiria but rather in some persian or babylonian mysteries when you discourse thus of spirits  but you phaethon turning to me how did you like the periods of protagoras  do not ask me socrates said i for indeed we have fought a weary battle together ever since sundown last night and all that i had to say i learnt from you  s  from me good fellow  phaethon  yes indeed  i seemed to have heard from you that truth is simply facts as they are  but when i urged this on alcibiades his arguments seemed superior to mine  a  but i have been telling him drunk and sober that it is my opinion also as to what truth is  only i with protagoras distinguish between objective fact and subjective opinion  s  doing rightly too fair youth  but how comes it then that you and phaethon cannot agree  that said i you know better than either of us  you seem both of you said socrates to be as usual in the family way  shall i exercise my profession on you  no by zeus answered alcibiades laughing i fear thee thou juggler lest i suffer once again the same fate with the woman in the myth and after i have conceived a fair manchild and as i fancy brought it forth thou hold up to the people some dead puppy or log or what not and cry  look what alcibiades has produced  s  but beautiful youth before i can do that you will have spoken your oration on the bema and all the people will be ready and able to say absurd  nothing but what is fair can come from so fair a body  come let us consider the question together  i assented willingly and alcibiades mincing and pouting after his fashion still was loath to refuse  s  let us see then  alcibiades distinguishes he says between objective fact and subjective opinion  a  of course i do  s  but not i presume between objective truth and subjective truth whereof protagoras spoke  a  what trap are you laying now  i distinguish between them also of course  s  tell me then dear youth of your indulgence what they are for i am shamefully ignorant on the matter  a  why do they not call a thing objectively true when it is true absolutely in itself but subjectively true when it is true in the belief of a particular person  s  though not necessarily true objectively that is absolutely and in itself  a  no  s  but possibly true so  a  of course  s  now tell mea thing is objectively true is it not when it is a fact as it is  a  yes  s  and when it is a fact as it is not it is objectively false for such a fact would not be true absolutely and in itself would it  a  of course not  s  such a fact would be therefore no fact and nothing  a  why so  s  because if a thing exists it can only exist as it is not as it is not at least my opinion inclines that way  certainly not said i why do you haggle so alcibiades  s  fair and softly phaethon  how do you know that he is not fighting for wife and child and the altars of his gods  but if he will agree with you and me he will confess that a thing which is objectively false does not exist at all and is nothing  a  i suppose it is necessary to do so  but i know whither you are struggling  s  to this dear youth that therefore if a thing subjectively true be also objectively false it does not exist and is nothing  it is so said i  s  let us then let nothing go its own way while we go on ours with that which is only objectively true lest coming to a river over which it is subjectively true to us that there is a bridge and trying to walk over that work of our own mind but no ones hands the bridge prove to be objectively false and we walking over the bank into the water be set free from that which is subjectively on the farther bank of styx  then i laughing  this hardly coincides alcibiades with protagorass opinion that subjective truth was alone useful  but rather proves said socrates that undiluted draughts of it are of a hurtful and poisonous nature and require to be tempered with somewhat of objective truth before it is safe to use themat least in the case of bridges  did i not tell you interrupted alcibiades how the old deceiver would try to put me to bed of some dead puppy or log  or do you not see how in order after his custom to raise a laugh about the whole question by vulgar examples he is blinking what he knows as well as i  s  what then fair youth  a  that protagoras was not speaking about bridges or any other merely physical things on which no difference of opinion need occur because every one can satisfy himself by simply using his senses but concerning moral and intellectual matters which are not cognisable by the senses and therefore permit without blame a greater diversity of opinion  error on such points he told uson the subject of religion for examplewas both pardonable and harmless for no blame could be imputed to the man who acted faithfully up to his own belief whatsoever that might be  s  bravely spoken of him and worthily of a free state  but tell me alcibiades with what matters does religion deal  a  with the gods  s  then it is not hurtful to speak false things of the gods  a  not unless you know them to be false  s  but answer me this alcibiades  if you made a mistake concerning numbers as that twice two made five might it not be hurtful to you  a  certainly for i might pay away five obols instead of four  s  and so be punished not by any anger of two and two against you but by those very necessary laws of number which you had mistaken  a  yes  s  or if you made a mistake concerning music as that two consecutive notes could produce harmony that opinion also if you acted upon it would be hurtful to you  a  certainly for i should make a discord and pain my own ears and my hearers  s  and in this case also be punished not by any anger of the lyre against you but by those very necessary laws of music which you had mistaken  a  yes  s  or if you mistook concerning a brave man believing him to be a coward might not this also be hurtful to you  if for instance you attacked him carelessly expecting him to run away and he defended himself valiantly and conquered you or if you neglected to call for his help in need expecting him falsely as in the former case to run away would not such a mistake be hurtful to you and punish you not by any anger of the man against you but by your mistake itself  a  it is evident  s  we may assume then that such mistakes at least are hurtful and that they are liable to be punished by the very laws of that concerning which we mistake  a  we may so assume  s  suppose then we were to say  what argument is this of yours protagorasthat concerning lesser things both intellectual and moral such as concerning number music or the character of a man mistakes are hurtful and liable to bring punishment in proportion to our need of using those things  but concerning the gods the very authors and lawgivers of number music human character and all other things whatsoever mistakes are of no consequence nor in any way hurtful to man who stands in need of their help not only in stress of battle once or twice in his life as he might of the brave man but always and in all things both outward and inward  does it not seem strange to you for it does to me that to make mistakes concerning such beings should not bring an altogether infinite and daily punishment not by any resentment of theirs but as in the case of music or numbers by the very fact of our having mistaken the laws of their being on which the whole universe dependswhat do you suppose protagoras would be able to answer if he faced the question boldly  a  i cannot tell  s  nor i either  yet one thing more it may be worth our while to examine  if one should mistake concerning god will his error be one of excess or defect  a  how can i tell  s  let us see  is not zeus more perfect than all other beings  a  certainly if it be true that as they say the perfection of each kind of being is derived from him he must therefore be himself more perfect than any one of those perfections  s  well argued  therefore if he conceived of himself his conception of himself would be more perfect than that of any man concerning him  a  assuredly if he have that faculty he must needs have it in perfection  s  suppose then that he conceived of one of his own properties such as his justice how large would that perfect conception of his be  a  but how can i tell socrates  s  my good friend would it not be exactly commensurate with that justice of his  a  how then  s  wherein consists the perfection of any conception save in this that it be the exact copy of that whereof it is conceived and neither greater nor less  a  i see now  s  without the pythias help i should say  but tell mewe agree that zeuss conception of his own justice will be exactly commensurate with his justice  a  we do  s  but mans conception thereof it has been agreed would be certainly less perfect than zeuss  a  it would  s  man then it seems would always conceive god to be less just than god conceives himself to be  a  he would  s  and therefore to be less just according to the argument than he really is  a  true  s  and therefore his error concerning zeus would be in this case an error of defect  a  it would  s  and so on of each of his other properties  a  the same argument would likewise as far as i can see apply to them  s  so that on the whole man by the unassisted power of his own faculty will always conceive zeus to be less just wise good and beautiful than he is  a  it seems probable  s  but does not that seem to you hurtful  a  why so  s  as if for instance a man believing that zeus loves him less than he really does should become superstitious and self tormenting  or believing that zeus will guide him less than he really will he should go his own way through life without looking for that guidance  or if believing that zeus cares about his conquering his passions less than he really does he should become careless and despairing in the struggle  or if believing that zeus is less interested in the welfare of mankind than he really is he should himself neglect to assist them and so lose the glory of being called a benefactor of his country  would not all these mistakes be hurtful ones  certainly said i  but alcibiades was silent  s  and would not these mistakes by the hypothesis themselves punish him who made them without any resentment whatsoever or nemesis of the gods being required for his chastisement  it seems so said i  s  but can we say of such mistakes and of the harm which may accrue from them anything but that they must both be infinite seeing that they are mistakes concerning an infinite being and his infinite properties on every one of which and on all together our daily existence depends  p  it seems so  s  so that until such a mans error concerning zeus the source of all things is cleared up either in this life or in some future one we cannot but fear for him infinite confusion misery and harm in all matters which he may take in hand  then alcibiades angrily  what ugly mask is this you have put on socrates  you speak rather like a priest trying to frighten rustics into paying their firstfruits than a philosopher inquiring after that which is beautiful  but you shall never terrify me into believing that it is not a noble thing to speak out whatsoever a man believes and to go forward boldly in the spirit of truth  s  feeling first i hope with your staff as would be but reasonable in the case of the bridge whether your belief was objectively or only subjectively true lest you should fall through your subjective bridge into objective water  nevertheless leaving the bridge and the water let us examine a little what this said spirit of truth may be  how do you define it  a  i assert that whosoever says honestly what he believes does so by the spirit of truth  s  then if lyce patting those soft cheeks of yours were to say alcibiades thou art the fairest youth in athens she would speak by the spirit of truth  a  they say so  s  and they say rightly  but if lyce as is her custom wished by so saying to cheat you into believing that she loved you and thereby to wheedle you out of a new shawl she would still speak by the spirit of truth  a  i suppose so  s  but if again she said the same thing to phaethon she would still speak by the spirit of truth  by no means socrates said i laughing  s  be silent fair boy you are out of court as an interested party  alcibiades shall answer  if lyce being really mad with love like sappho were to believe phaethon to be fairer than you and say so she would still speak by the spirit of truth  a  i suppose so  s  do not frown your beauty is in no question  only she would then be saying what is not true  i must answer for him after all said i  s  then it seems from what has been agreed that it is indifferent to the spirit of truth whether it speak truth or not the spirit seems to be of an enviable serenity  but suppose again that i believed that alcibiades had an ulcer on his leg and were to proclaim the same now to the people when they come into the pnyx should i not be speaking by the spirit of truth  a  but that would be a shameful and blackguardly action  s  be it so  it seems therefore that it is indifferent to the spirit of truth whether that which it affirms be honourable or blackguardly  is it not so  a  it seems so most certainly in that case at least  s  and in others as i think  but tell meis not the man who does what he believes as much moved by this your spirit of truth as he who says what he believes  a  certainly he is  s  then if i believed it right to lie or steal i in lying or stealing should lie or steal by the spirit of truth  a  certainly  but that is impossible  s  my fine fellow and wherefore  i have heard of a nation among the indians who hold it a sacred duty to murder every one not of their own tribe whom they can waylay  and when they are taken and punished by the rulers of that country die joyfully under the greatest torments believing themselves certain of an entrance into the elysian fields in proportion to the number of murders which they have committed  a  they must be impious wretches  s  be it so  but believing themselves to be right they commit murder by the spirit of truth  a  it seems to follow from the argument  s  then it is indifferent to the spirit of truth whether the action which it prompts be right or wrong  a  it must be confessed  s  it is therefore not a moral faculty this spirit of truth  let us see now whether it be an intellectual one  how are intellectual things defined phaethon  tell me for you are cunning in such matters  p  those things which have to do with processes of the mind  s  with right processes or with wrong  p  with right of course  s  and processes for what purpose  p  for the discovery of facts  s  of facts as they are or as they are not  p  as they are  s  and he who discovers facts as they are discovers truth while he who discovers facts as they are not discovers falsehood  p  he discovers nothing socrates  s  true but it has been agreed already that the spirit of truth is indifferent to the question whether facts be true or false but only concerns itself with the sincere affirmation of them whatsoever they may be  much more then must it be indifferent to those processes by which they are discovered  p  how so  s  because it only concerns itself with affirmation concerning facts but these processes are anterior to that affirmation  p  i comprehend  s  and much more is it indifferent to whether those are right processes or not  p  much more so  s  it is therefore not intellectual  it remains therefore that it must be some merely physical faculty like that of fearing hungering or enjoying the sexual appetite  a  absurd socrates  s  that is the arguments concern not ours  let us follow manfully whithersoever it may lead us  a  lead on thou sophist  s  it was agreed then that he who does what he thinks right does so by the spirit of truthwas it not  a  it was  s  then he who eats when he thinks that he ought to eat does so by the spirit of truth  a  what next  s  this next that he who blows his nose when he thinks that it wants blowing blows his nose by the spirit of truth  a  what next  s  do not frown friend  believe me in such days as these i honour even the man who is honest enough to blow his nose because he finds that he ought to do so  but tell mea horse when he shies at a beggar does not he also do so by the spirit of truth  for he believes sincerely the beggar to be something formidable and honestly acts upon his conviction  not a doubt of it said i laughing in spite of myself at alcibiadess countenance  s  it is in danger then of proving to be something quite brutish and doggish this spirit of truth  i should not wonder therefore if we found it proper to be restrained  a  how so thou hairsplitter  s  have we not proved it to be common to man and animals but are not those passions which we have in common with animals to be restrained  p  restrain the spirit of truth socrates  s  if it be doggishly inclined  as for instance if a man knew that his father had committed a shameful act and were to publish it he would do so by the spirit of truth  yet such an act would be blackguardly and to be restrained  p  of course  s  but much more if he accused his father only on his own private suspicion not having seen him commit the act while many others who had watched his fathers character more than he did assured him that he was mistaken  p  such an act would be to be restrained not merely as blackguardly but as impious  s  or if a man believed things derogatory to the character of the gods not having seen them do wrong himself while all those who had given themselves to the study of divine things assured him that he was mistaken would he not be bound to restrain an inclination to speak such things even if he believed them  p  surely socrates and that even if he believed that the gods did not exist at all  for there would be far more chance that he alone was wrong and the many right than that the many were wrong and he alone right  he would therefore commit an insolent and conceited action and moreover a cruel and shameless one for he would certainly make miserable if he were believed the hearts of many virtuous persons who had never harmed him for no immediate or demonstrable purpose except that of pleasing his own selfwill and that much more were he wrong in his assertion  s  here then is another case in which it seems proper to restrain the spirit of truth whatsoever it may be  p  what then are we to say of those who speak fearlessly and openly their own opinions on every subject for in spite of all this one cannot but admire them whether rationally or irrationally  s  we will allow them at least the honour which we do to the wild boar who rushes fiercely through thorns and brambles upon the dogs not to be turned aside by spears or treetrunks and indeed charges forward the more valiantly the more tightly he shuts his eyes  that praise we can bestow on him but i fear no higher one  it is expedient nevertheless to have such a temperament as it is to have a good memory or a loud voice or a straight nose unlike mine only like other animal passions it must be restrained and regulated by reason and the law of right so as to employ itself only on such matters and to such a degree as they prescribe  it may seem so in the argument said i  yet no argument even of yours socrates with your pardon shall convince me that the spirit of truth is not fair and good ay the noblest possession of all throwing away which a man throws away his shield and becomes unworthy of the company of gods or men  s  or of beasts either as it seems to me and the argument nevertheless to this point has the argument in its cunning and malice brought us by crooked paths  can we find no escape  p  i know none  s  but may it not be possible that we not having been initiated like alcibiades into the babylonian mysteries have somewhat mistaken the meaning of that expression spirit of truth  for truth we defined to be facts as they are  the spirit of truth then should mean should it not the spirit of facts as they are  p  it should  s  but what shall we say that this expression in its turn means the spirit which makes facts as they are  a  surely not  that would be the supreme demiurgus himself  s  of whom you were not speaking when you spoke of the spirit of truth  a  certainly not  i was speaking of a spirit in man  s  and belonging to him  a  yes  s  and doingwhat with regard to facts as they are for this is just the thing which puzzles me  a  telling facts as they are  s  without seeing them as they are  a  how you bore one of course not  it sees facts as they are and therefore tells them  s  but perhaps it might see them as they are and find it expedient being of the same temperament as i to hold its tongue about them  would it then be still the spirit of truth  a  it would of course  s  the man then who possesses the spirit of truth will see facts as they are  a  he will  s  and conversely  a  yes  s  but if he sees anything only as it seems to him and is not in fact he will not with regard to that thing see it by the spirit of truth  a  i suppose not  s  neither then will he be able to speak of it by the spirit of truth  a  why  s  because by what we agreed before it will not be there to speak of my wondrous friend  for it appeared to us if i recollect right that facts can only exist as they are and not as they are not and that therefore the spirit of truth had nothing to do with any facts but those which are  but i interrupted o dear socrates i fear much that if the spirit of truth be such as this it must be beyond the reach of man  s  why then  p  because the immortal gods only can see things as they really are having alone made all things and ruling them all according to the laws of each  they therefore i much fear will be alone able to behold them how they are really in their inner nature and properties and not merely from the outside and by guess as we do how then can we obtain such a spirit ourselves  s  dear boy you seem to wish that i should as usual put you off with a myth when you begin to ask me about those who know far more about me than i do about them  nevertheless shall i tell you a myth  p  if you have nothing better  s  they say then that prometheus when he grew to mans estate found mankind though they were like him in form utterly brutish and ignorant so that as aeschylus says         seeing they saw in vain hearing they heard not but were like the shapes of dreams and long time did confuse all things at random   being as i suppose led like the animals only by their private judgments of things as they seemed to each man and enslaved to that subjective truth which we found to be utterly careless and ignorant of facts as they are  but prometheus taking pity on them determined in his mind to free them from that slavery and to teach them to rise above the beasts by seeing things as they are  he therefore made them acquainted with the secrets of nature and taught them to build houses to work in wood and metals to observe the courses of the stars and all other such arts and sciences which if any man attempts to follow according to his private opinion and not according to the rules of that art which are independent of him and of his opinions being discovered from the unchangeable laws of things as they are he will fail  but yet as the myth relates they became only a more cunning sort of animals not being wholly freed from their original slavery to a certain subjective opinion about themselves that each man should by means of those arts and sciences please and help himself only  fearing therefore lest their increased strength and cunning should only enable them to prey upon each other all the more fiercely he stole fire from heaven and gave to each man a share thereof for his hearth and to each community for their common altar  and by the light of this celestial fire they learnt to see those celestial and eternal bonds between man and man as of husband to wife of father to child of citizen to his country and of master to servant without which man is but a biped without feathers and which are in themselves being independent of the flux of matter and time most truly facts as they are  and since that time whatsoever household or nation has allowed these fires to become extinguished has sunk down again to the level of the brutes  while those who have passed them down to their children burning bright and strong become partakers of the bliss of the heroes in the happy islands  it seems to me then phaethon and alcibiades that if we find ourselves in anywise destitute of this heavenly fire we should pray for the coming of that day when prometheus shall be unbound from caucasus if by any means he may take pity on us and on our children and again bring us down from heaven that fire which is the spirit of truth that we may see facts as they are  for which if he were to ask zeus humbly and filially i cannot believe that he would refuse it  and indeed i think that the poets as is their custom corrupt the minds of young men by telling them that zeus chained prometheus to caucasus for his theft seeing that it befits such a ruler as i take the father of gods and men to be to know that his subjects can only do well by means of his bounty and therefore to bestow it freely as the kings of persia do on all who are willing to use it in the service of their sovereign  so then said alcibiades laughing till prometheus be unbound from caucasus we who have lost as you seem to hint this heavenly fire must needs go on upon our own subjective opinions having nothing better to which to trust  truly thou sophist thy conclusion seems to me after all not to differ much from that of protagoras  s  ah dear boy know you not that to those who have been initiated and as they say in the mysteries twice born prometheus is always unbound and stands ready to assist them while to those who are selfwilled and conceited of their own opinions he is removed to an inaccessible distance and chained in icy fetters on untrodden mountainpeaks where the vulture ever devours his fair heart which sympathises continually with the follies and the sorrows of mankind  of what punishment then must not those be worthy who by their own wilfulness and selfconfidence bind again to caucasus the fair titan the friend of men  by apollo said alcibiades this language is more fit for the tripod in delphos than for the bema in the pnyx  so farethee well thou pythoness  i must go and con over my oration at least if thy prophesying has not altogether addled my thoughts  but i as soon as alcibiades was gone for i was ashamed to speak before turning to socrates said to him all but weeping  oh socrates what cruel words are these which you have spoken  are you not ashamed to talk thus contemptuously to one like me even though he be younger and less cunning in argument than yourself knowing as you do how when i might have grown rich in my native city of rhodes and marrying there as my father purposed a wealthy merchants heiress so have passed my life delicately receiving the profits of many ships and warehouses i yet preferred truth beyond riches and leaving my fathers house came to athens in search of wisdom dissipating my patrimony upon one sophist after another listening greedily to hippias and polus and gorgias and protagoras and last of all to you hardhearted man that you are for from my youth i loved and longed after nothing so much as truth whatsoever it may be thinking nothing so noble as to know that which is right and knowing it to do it  and that longing or love of mine which is what i suppose protagoras meant by the spirit of truth i cherished as the fairest and most divine possession and that for which alone it was worth while to live  for it seemed to me that even if in my search i never attained to truth still it were better to die seeking than not to seek and that even if acting by what i considered to be the spirit of truth and doing honestly in every case that which seemed right i should often acting on a false conviction offend in ignorance against the absolute righteousness of the gods yet that such an offence was deserving if not of praise for its sincerity yet at least of pity and forgiveness but by no means to be classed as you class it with the appetites of brutes much less to be threatened as you threaten it with infinite and eternal misery by i know not what necessary laws of zeus and to be put off at last with some myth or other about prometheus  surely your mother bare you a scoffer and pitiless socrates and not as you boast a manmidwife fit for fair youths  then smiling sweetly dear boy said he were i such as you fancy how should i be here now discoursing with you concerning truth instead of conning my speech for the pnyx like alcibiades that i may become a demagogue deceiving the mob with flattery and win for myself houses and lands and gold and slavegirls and fame and power even to a tyranny itself  for in this way i might have made my tongue a profitable member of my body but now being hurried up and down in barren places like one mad of love from my longing after fair youths i waste my speech on them receiving as is the wont of true lovers only curses and ingratitude from their arrogance  but tell me thou proud adonisthis spirit of truth in thee which thou thoughtest and rightly thy most noble possession did it desire truth or not  p  but socrates i told you that very thing and said that it was a longing after truth which i could not restrain or disobey  s  tell me now does one long for that which one possesses or for that which one does not possess  p  for that which one does not possess  s  and is one in love with that which is oneself or with that which is not  p  with that which is not oneself thou mocker  we are not all surely like narcissus  s  no by the dog not quite all  but see now  it appears that when any one is in love with a thing and longs for it as thou didst for truth it must be something which is not himself and which he does not possess  p  true  s  you then while you were loving facts as they are and longing to see them as they are yet did not possess that which you longed for  p  true indeed else why should i have been driven forth by the anger of the gods like bellerophon to pace the aleian plain eating my own soul if i had possessed that for which i longed  s  well said dear boy  but see again  this truth which you loved and which was not yourself or part of yourself was certainly also nothing of your own makingthough they say that pygmalion was enamoured of the statue which he himself had carved  p  but he was miserable socrates till the statue became alive  s  they say so but what has that to do with the argument  p  i know not  but it seems to me horrible as it did to pygmalion to be enamoured of anything which cannot return your love but is as it were your puppet  should we not think it a shameful thing if a mistress were to be enamoured of one of her own slaves  s  we should and that i suppose because the slave would have no free choice whether to refuse or to return his mistresss love but would be compelled being a slave to submit to her even if she were old or ugly or hateful to him  p  of course  s  and should we not say phaethon that there was no true enjoyment in such love even on the part of the mistress nay that it was not worthy of the name of love at all but was merely something base such as happens to animals  p  we should say so rightly  s  tell me then phaethonfor a strange doubt has entered my mind on account of your words  this truth of which you were enamoured seems from what has been agreed not to be a part of yourself nor a creation of your own like pygmalions statuehow then has it not happened to you to be even more miserable than pygmalion till you were sure that truth loved you in returnand moreover till you were sure that truth had free choice as to whether it should return or refuse your love  for otherwise you would be in danger of being found suffering the same base passion as a mistress enamoured of a slave who cannot resist her  p  i am puzzled socrates  s  shall we rather say then that you were enamoured not of truth itself but of the spirit of truth  for we have been all along defining truth to be facts as they are have we not  p  we have  s  but there are many facts as they are whereof to be enamoured would be base for they cannot return your love  as for instance that one and one make two or that a horse has four legs  with respect to such facts you would be would you not in the same position as a mistress towards her slave  p  certainly  it seems then better to assume the other alternative  s  it does  but does it not follow that when you were enamoured of this spirit you did not possess it  p  i fear so by the argument  s  and i fear too that we agreed that he only who possessed the spirit of truth saw facts as they are for that was involved in our definition of the spirit of truth  p  but socrates i knew at least that one and one made two and that a horse had four legs  i must then have seen some facts as they are  s  doubtless fair boy but not all  p  i do not pretend to that  s  but if you had possessed the spirit of truth you would have seen all facts whatsoever as they are  for he who possesses a thing can surely employ it freely for all purposes which are not contrary to the nature of that thing can he not  p  of course he can  but if i did not possess the spirit of truth how could i see any truth whatsoever  s  suppose dear boy that instead of your possessing it it were possible for it to possess you and possessing you to show you as much of itself or as little as it might choose and concerning such things only as it might choose  would not that explain the dilemma  p  it would assuredly  s  let us see then whether this spirit of truth may not be something which is capable of possessing you and employing you rather than of being possessed and employed by you  to me indeed this spirit seems likely to be some demon or deity and that one of the greatest  p  why then  s  can lifeless and material things see  p  certainly not only live ones  s  this spirit then seems to be living for it sees things as they are  p  yes  s  and it is also intellectual for intellectual facts can be only seen by an intellectual being  p  true  s  and also moral for moral facts can only be seen by a moral being  p  true also  s  but this spirit is evidently not a man it remains therefore that it must be some demon  p  but why one of the greatest  s  tell me phaethon is not god to be numbered among facts as they are  p  assuredly for he is before all others and more eternal and absolute than all  s  then this spirit of truth must also be able to see god as he is  p  it is probable  s  and certain if as we agreed it be the very spirit which sees all facts whatsoever as they are  now tell me can the less see the greater as it is  p  i think not for an animal cannot see a man as he is but only that part of him in which he is like an animal namely his outward figure and his animal passions but not his moral sense or reason for of them it has itself no share  s  true and in like wise a man of less intellect could not see a man of greater intellect than himself as he is but only a part of his intellect  p  certainly  s  and does not the same thing follow from what we said just now that gods conceptions of himself must be the only perfect conceptions of him  for if any being could see god as he is the same would be able to conceive of him as he is  which we agreed was impossible  p  true  s  then surely this spirit which sees god as he is must be equal with god  p  it seems probable but none is equal to god except himself  s  most true phaethon  but what shall we say now but that this spirit of truth whereof thou hast been enamoured is according to the argument none other than zeus who alone comprehends all things and sees them as they are because he alone has given to each its inward and necessary laws  p  but socrates there seems something impious in the thought  s  impious truly if we held that this spirit of truth was a part of your own self  but we agreed that it was not a part of you but something utterly independent of you  p  noble would the news be socrates were it true yet it seems to me beyond belief  s  did we not prove just now concerning zeus that all mistakes concerning him were certain to be mistakes of defect  p  we did indeed  s  how do you know then that you have not fallen into some such error and have suspected zeus to be less condescending towards you than he really is  p  would that it were so  but i fear it is too fair a hope  s  do i seem to thee now dear boy more insolent and unfeeling than protagoras when he tried to turn thee away from the search after absolute truth by saying sophistically that it was an attempt of the titans to scale heaven and bade thee be content with asserting shamelessly and brutishly thine own subjective opinions for i do not bid thee scale the throne of zeus into whose presence none could arrive as it seems to me unless he himself willed it but to believe that he has given thee from thy childhood a glimpse of his own excellence that so thy heart conjecturing as in the case of a veiled statue from one part the beauty of the rest might become enamoured thereof and long for that sight of him which is the highest and only good that so his splendour may give thee light to see facts as they are  p  oh socrates and how is this blessedness to be attained  s  even as the myths relate the nymphs obtained the embraces of the gods by pleasing him and obeying him in all things lifting up daily pure hands and a thankful heart if by any means he may condescend to purge thine eyes that thou mayest see clearly and without those motes and specks and distortions of thine own organs of vision which flit before the eyeballs of those who have been drunk overnight and which are called by sophists subjective truth watching everywhere anxiously and reverently for those glimpses of his beauty which he will vouchsafe to thee more and more as thou provest thyself worthy of them and will reward thy love by making thee more and more partaker of his own spirit of truth whereby seeing facts as they are thou wilt see him who has made them according to his own ideas that they may be a mirror of his unspeakable splendour  is not this a fairer hope for thee oh phaethon than that which protagoras held out to theethat neither seeing zeus nor seeing facts as they are nor affirming any truth whatsoever nor depending for thy knowledge on any one but thine own ignorant self thou mightest nevertheless be so fortunate as to escape punishment  not knowing as it seems to me that such a state of ignorance and blindfold rashness even if tartarus were a dream of the poets or the priests is in itself the most fearful of punishments  p  it is indeed my dear socrates  yet what are we to say of those who sincerely loving and longing after knowledge yet arrive at false conclusions which are proved to be false by contradicting each other  s  we are to say phaethon that they have not loved knowledge enough to desire utterly to see facts as they are but only to see them as they would wish them to be and loving themselves rather than zeus have wished to remodel in some things or other his universe according to their own subjective opinions  by this or by some other act of selfwill or selfconceit or selfdependence they have compelled zeus not as i think without pity and kindness to them to withdraw from them in some degree the sight of his own beauty  we must therefore i fear liken them to acharis the painter of lemnos who intending to represent phoebus painted from a mirror a copy of his own defects and deformities or perhaps to that nymph who finding herself beloved by phoebus instead of reverently and silently returning the affection boasted of it to all her neighbours as a token of her own beauty and despised the god so that he being angry changed her into a chattering magpie or again to arachne who having been taught the art of weaving by athene pretended to compete with her own instructress and being metamorphosed by her into a spider was condemned like the sophists to spin out of her own entrails endless ugly webs which are destroyed as soon as finished by every slavegirls broom  p  but shall we despise and hate such oh socrates  s  no dearest boy we will rather pity and instruct them lovingly remembering always that we shall become such as they the moment we begin to fancy that truth is our own possession and not the very beauty of zeus himself which he shows to those whom he will and in such measure as he finds them worthy to behold  but to me considering how great must be the condescension of zeus in unveiling to any man even the worthiest the least portion of his own loveliness there has come at times a sort of dream that the divine splendour will at last pierce through and illumine all dark souls even in the house of hades showing them as by a great sunrise both what they themselves and what all other things are really and in the sight of zeus which if it happened even to ixion i believe that his wheel would stop and his fetters drop off of themselves and that he would return freely to the upper air for as long as he himself might choose  just then the people began to throng into the pnyx and we took our places with the rest to hear the business of the day after socrates had privately uttered this prayer  oh zeus give to me and to all who shall counsel here this day that spirit of truth by which we may behold that whereof we deliberate as it is in thy sight   as i expected said templeton with a smile as i folded up my manuscript  my friend the parson could not demolish the poor professors bad logic without a little professional touch by way of finish  what do you mean  ohnever mind  only i owe you little thanks for sweeping away any one of my lingering sympathies with mr windrush if all you can offer me instead is the confounded old nostrum of religion over again  heydey friend  what next  really my dear fellow i beg your pardon i forgot that i was speaking to a clergyman  pray dont beg my pardon on that ground  if what you say be right a clergyman above all others ought to hear it and if it be wrong and a symptom of spiritual disease he ought to hear it all the more  but i cannot tell whether you are right or wrong till i know what you mean by religion for there is a great deal of very truly confounded and confounding religion abroad in the world just now as there has been in all ages and perhaps you may be alluding to that  templeton sat silent for a few minutes playing with the tackle in his flybook and then murmured to himself the wellknown lines of lucretius   humana ante oculos foede cum vita jaceret in terris oppressa gravi sub relligione quae caput a coeli regionibus ostendebat horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans   thereblasphemous reprobate fellow am i not  on the contrary i said i think that in the sense in which lucretius intended that the lines should be taken they contain a great deal of truth  he had seen the basest and foullest crimes spring from that which he calls relligio and he had a full right to state that fact  i am not aware that one blasphemes the catholic and apostolic faith by saying that the devilries of the spanish inquisition were the direct offspring of that religious sentiment which mr windrushs schoolthough they are at all events right in saying that its source is in man himself and not in the regionibus coeliare now glorifying as something which enables man to save his own soul without the interference of the deityindeed whether the deity chooses or not  do leave these poor emersonians alone for a few minutes and tell me how you can reconcile what you have just said with your own dialogue  why not  is not lucretius glorying in the notion that the gods do not trouble themselves with mortals while you have been asserting that the deity troubles himself even with the souls of heathens  certainly  but that is quite a distinct matter from his dislike of what he calls relligio  in that dislike i can sympathise fully but on his method of escape mr windrush will probably look with more complaisance than i do who call it by the ugly name of atheism  then i fear you would call me an atheist if you knew all  so we had better say no more about it  a most curious speech certainly to make to a parson or soul curer by profession  why what on earth have you to do but to abhor and flee me asked he with a laugh though by no means a merry one  would your having a headache be a reason for the medical mans running away from you or coming to visit you  ah but this you know is my fault and my crime and my sin  eh and he laughed again  would the doctor visit you the less because it was your own fault that your head ached  ah but suppose i professed openly no faith in his powers of curing and had a great hankering after unaccredited homoeopathies like mr windrushs would not that be a fair cause for interdiction from fire and water sacraments and christian burial  come come templeton i said you shall not thus jest away serious thoughts with an old friend  i know you are ill at ease why not talk over the matter with me fairly and soberly  how do you know till you have tried whether i can help you or not  because i know that your arguments will have no force with me they will demand of me or assume in me certain faculties sentiments notions experiencescall them what you like i am beginning to suspect sometimes with cabanis that they are a product of the small intestineswhich i never have had and never could make myself have and now dont care whether i have them or not  on my honour i will address you only as what you are and know yourself to be  but what are these faculties so strangely beyond my friend templetons reach  he used to be distinguished at college for a very clear head and a very kind heart and the nicest sense of honour which i ever saw in living man and i have not heard that they have failed him since he became templeton of templeton  and as for his churchmanship were not the county papers ringing last month with the accounts of the beautiful new church which he had built and the stained glass which he brought from belgium and the marble font which he brought from italy and how he had even given for an altarpiece his own pet luini the gem of templeton house  effeminate picture he said  it was part and parcel of the idea   before i could ask him what he meant he looked up suddenly at me with deep sadness on his usually nonchalant face  well my dear fellow i suppose i must tell you all as i have told you so much without your shaking the dust off your feet against me and consulting bradshaw for the earliest train to shrewsbury  you knew my dear mother  i did  the best of women  the best of women and the best of mothers  but if you recollect she was a great lowchurch saint  why but  how does that derogate in any wise from her excellence  not from her excellence god forbid or from the excellence of the people of her own party whom she used to have round her and who were some of them i do believe as really earnest and pious and charitable and all that as human beings could be  but it did take away very much indeed from her influence on me  surely she did not neglect to teach you  it is a strange thing to say but she rather taught me too much  i dont deny that it may have been my own fault  i dont blame her or any one  but you know what i was at collegeno worse than other men i dare say but no better  i had no reason for being better  no reason  surely she gave you reasons  thereyou have touched the ailing nerve now  the reasons were what you would call paralogisms  they had no more to do with me than with those trout  you mistake friend you mistake indeed said i  i dont mistake at all about this that whether or not the reasons in themselves had to do with me the way in which she put them made them practically so much hebrew  she demanded of me as the only grounds on which i was to consider myself safe from hell certain fears and hopes which i did not feel and experiences which i did not experience and it was my fault and a sign of my being in a wrong stateto use no harder termthat i did not feel them and yet it was only gods grace which could make me feel them  and so i grew up with a dark secret notion that i was a very bad boy but that it was gods fault and not mine that i was so  you were ripe indeed then said i sadly like hundreds more for professor windrushs teaching  i will come to that presently  but in the meantimewas it my fault  i was never what you call a devout person  my organ of veneration as the phrenologists would say was never very large i was a shrewd dashing boy enjoying life to the fingertips and enjoying above all i will say pleasing my mother in every way except in the understanding what she told meand what i felt i could not understand  but as i grew older and watched her and the men round her i began to suspect that religion and effeminacy had a good deal to do with each other  for the women whatsoever their temperaments or even their tastes might be took to this to me incomprehensible religion naturally and instinctively while the very few men who were in their clique werei dont deny some of them were good men enoughif they had been men at all  if they had been wellread or wellbred or gallant or clearheaded or liberal minded or in short anything but the silky smoothtongued hunt theslippers nine out of ten of them were  i recollect well asking my mother once whether there would not be five times more women than men in heavenand her answering me sadly and seriously that she feared there would be  and in the meantime she brought me up to pray and hope that i might some day be converted and become a child of godand one could not help wishing to enjoy oneself as much as possible before that event happened  before that event happened my dear fellow  pardon me but your tone is somewhat irreverent  very likely  i had no reason put before me for regarding such a change as anything but an unpleasant doom which would cut me off or ought to do so from field sports from poetry from art from science from politicsfor christians i was told had nothing to do with the politics of this worldfrom man and all mans civilisation in short and leave to me as the only two lawful indulgences those of living in a good house and begetting a family of children  and did you throw off the old creeds for the sake of the civilisation which you fancied that they forbid  no  i am a churchman you know principally on political grounds or from custom or fromthe devil knows what perhapsi do not  probably it is god and not the devil who knows why templeton  be it sofrightful as it is to have to say iti do not so much carei suppose it is all right  if it is not it will all come right at last  and in the meantime i compromise like the rest of the world and hear jane making the children every weekday pray that they may become gods children and then teaching them every sunday evening the catechism which says that they are so already i dont understand iti suppose if it was important one would understand it  one knows right from wrong you know and other fundamentals  if that were necessary one would know that too  but can you submit quietly to such a barefaced contradiction  i  i am only a plain country squire  of course i should call such dealing with an act of parliament a lie and a shambut about these things i fancy the women know best  jane is ten thousand times as good as i amyou dont know half her worthand i havent the heart to contradict hernor the right either for i have no reasons to give her no faith to substitute for hers  our friend the highchurch curate could have given you a few plain reasons i should think  of course he could  and i believe in my heart the man is in the right in calling jane wrong  he has honesty and common sense on his side just as he has when he calls the present state of convocation in the face of that prayer for gods spirit on its deliberations a blasphemous lie and sham  of course it is  any ensign in a marching regiment could tell us that from his mere sense of soldiers honour  but thenif she is wrong is he right  how do i know  i want reasons  he gives me historic authorities  and very good things too for they are fair phenomena for induction  but how will proving to me that certain people once thought a thing right prove to me that it is right  good people think differently every day  good people have thought differently about those very matters in every age  i want some proof which will coincide with the little which i do know about science and philosophy  they must fight out their own battle if they choose to fight it on mere authority  if one could but have the implicit faith of a child it would be all very well  but one cant  if one has once been fool enough to think about these things one must have reasons or something better than mere ipse dixits or one cant believe them i should be glad enough to believe do you suppose that i dont envy poor dear jane from morning to nightbut i cant  and so  and so what asked i  and so i believe i am growing to have no religion at all and no substitute for it either for i feel i have no ground or reason for admiring or working out any subject  i have tired of philosophy perhaps its all wrongat least i cant see what it has to do with god and christianity and all which if it is true must be more important than anything else  i have tired of art for the same reason  how can i be anything but a wretched dilettante when i have no principles to ground my criticism on beyond bosh about the beautiful  i did pluck up heart and read mr ruskins books greedily when they came out because i heard he was a good christian  but i fell upon a little tract of his notes on sheepfolds and gave him up again when i found that he had a leaning to that clapham sect  i have dropped politics  for i have no reason no ground no principle in them but expediency when they asked me this summer to represent the interests of the county in parliament i asked them how they came to make such a mistake as to fancy that i knew what was their interest or anyone elses  i am becoming more and more of an animal fragmentary inconsistent seeing to the root of nothing unable to unite things in my own mind  i just do the duty which lies nearest and looks simplest  i try to make the boys grow up plucky and knowingthough whats the use of it  they will go to college with even less principles than i had and will get into proportionably worse scrapes i expect to be ruined by their debts before i die  and for the rest i read nothing but the edinburgh and the agricultural gazette  my talk is of bullocks  i just know right from wrong enough to see that the farms are in good order pay my labourers living wages keep the old people out of the workhouse and see that my cottages and schools are all right for i suppose i was put here for some purpose of that kindthough what it is i cant very clearly defineand theres an end of my long story  not quite an animal yet it seems said i with a smile half to hide my own sadness at a set of experiences which are alas already far too common and will soon be more common still  nearer it than you fancy  i am getting fonder and fonder of a good dinner and a second bottle of claretabout their meaning there is no mistake  and my principal reason for taking the hounds two years ago was i do believe to have something to do in the winter which required no thought and to have an excuse for falling asleep after dinner instead of arguing with jane about her scurrilous religious newspapersthere is a great gulf opening i see between me and her and as i cant bridge it over i may as well forget it  pah  i am boring you and overtalking myself  have a cigar and let us say no more about it  there is more here old fellow than you will cure by doses of socratic dialectics  i am not so sure of that i replied  on the contrary i should recommend you in your present state of mind to look out your old plato as quickly as possible and see if he and his master socrates cannot give you if not altogether a solution for your puzzle at least a method whereby you may solve it yourself  but tell me firstwhat has all this to do with your evident sympathy for a man so unlike yourself as professor windrush  perhaps i feel for him principally because he has broken loose from it all in desperation just as i have  but to tell you the truth i have been reading more than one book of his school lately and as i said i owe you no thanks for demolishing the little comfort which i seemed to find in them  and what was that then  whyin the first place you cant deny that however incoherent they may be they do say a great many clever things and noble things too about man and society and art and nature  no doubt of it  and moreover they seem to connect all they say withwithi suppose you will laugh at mewith god and spiritual truths and eternal divine laws in short to consecrate common matters in that very way which i could not find in my poor mothers teaching  no doubt of that either  and therein is one real value of them as protests in behalf of something nobler and more unselfish than the mere dollargetting spirit of their country  well then can you not see how pleasant it was to me to find someone who would give me a peep into the unseen world without requiring as an entrancefee any religious emotions and experiences here i had been for years shut out told that i had no business with anything eternal and pure and noble and good that to all intents and purposes i was nothing better than a very cunning animal who could be damned because i was still carnal and had not been through all janes mysterious sorrows and joys  and it was really good news to me to hear that they were not required after all and that all i need do was to be a good man and leave devotion to those who were inclined to it by temperament  not to be a good man said i but only a good specimen of some sort of man  that i think would be the outcome of emersons representative men or of those most tragic memoirs of margaret puller ossoli  how then hairsplitter  what is the mighty difference  would you call dick turpin a good man because he was a good highwayman  what now  that he would be an excellent representative man of his class and therefore on mr emersons grounds a fit subject for a laudatory lecture  i hate reductiones ad absurdum  let turpin take care of himself i suppose i do not belong to such a very bad sort of men but that it may be worth my while to become a good specimen of it  certainly not only i think contrary to mr emersons opinion that you will not become even that unless you first become something better still namely a good man  there you are too refined for me  but can you not understand now the causes of my sympathy even with windrush and his spirit of truth  i can and those of many more  it seems that you thought you found in that school a wider creed than the one to which you had been accustomed  there was a more comprehensive view of humanity about them and that pleased me  doubtless one can be easily comprehensive if one comprehends good and bad true and false under one category by denying the absolute existence of either goodness or badness truth or falsehood  but let the view be as comprehensive as it will i am afraid that the creed founded thereon will not be very comprehensive  why then  because it will comprehend so few people fewer even than the sect of those who will believe with mr emerson that harvey and newton made their discoveries by the aristotelian method  the sect of those who believe that there is no absolute right and wrong no absolute truth external to himself discoverable by man will it seems to me be a very narrow one to the end of time owing to a certain primeval superstition of our race who even in barbarous countries have always been platonists enough to have some sort of instinct and hope that there was a right and a wrong and truths independent of their own sentiments and faculties  so that though this school may enable you to fancy that you understand lady jane somewhat more by the simple expedient of putting on her religious experiences an arbitrary interpretation of your own which she would indignantly and justly deny it will enable her to understand you all the less and widen the gulf between you immeasurably  you are severe  i only wish you to face one result of a theory which while it pretends to offer the most comprehensive liberality will be found to lead in practice to the most narrow and sectarian epicurism for a cultivated few  but for the many struggling with the innate consciousness of evil in them and around theman instinctive consciousness which no argumentation about evil being a lower form of good will ever explain away to those who grind among the iron facts of life and have no time for selfdeceptionwhat good news for them is there in mr emersons cosy and tolerant epicurism they cry for deliverance from their natures they know that they are not that which they were intended to be because they follow their natures and he answers them with  follow your natures and be that which you were intended to be  you began this argument by stipulating that i should argue with you simply as a man  does mr emersons argument look like doing that or only arguing as with an individual of that kind of man or rather animal to which some iron fate has compelled you to belong  but i say these books have made me a better man  i do not doubt it  an earnest cultivated man speaking his whole mind to an earnest cultivated man will hardly fail of telling him something he did not know before  but if you had not been a cultivated man templeton a man with few sorrows and few trials and few unsatisfied desiresif you had been the village shopkeeper with his bad debts and his temptations to make those who can pay for those who cannotif you had been one of your own labourers environed with the struggle for daily bread and the alehouse and hungry children and a sick wife and a dull taste and a duller headin short if you had been a man such as nine out of ten are what would his school have taught you then  you want some truths which are common to men as men which will help and teach them let their temperament or their circumstances be what they willdo you not  if you do not your complaint of lady janes exclusive creed is a mere selfish competition on your part between a creed which will fit her peculiarities and a creed which will fit your peculiarities  do you not see that  i dogo on  then i say you will not find that in professor windrushs school i say you will find it in lady janes creed  what  in the very creed which excludes me  whether that creed excludes you or not is a question of the true meaning of its words  and that again is a question of dialectics i say it includes you and all mankind  you must mistake her doctrines then  i do not i assure you  i know what they are and i know also the misreading of them to which your dear mothers school has accustomed her and which has taught her that these creeds only belong to the few who have discovered their own share in them  but whether the creeds really do that or notwhether lady jane does not implicitly confess that they do not by her own words and deeds of every day that i say is a question of dialectics in the platonic sense of that word as the science which discovers the true and false in thought by discovering the true and false concerning the meanings of words which represent thought  be it so  i should be glad to hold what jane holds for the sake of the marvellous practical effect on her charactersweet creature that she iswhich it has produced in the last seven years  and which effect i presume was not increased by her denying to you any share in the same  alas no  it is only when she falls on thatwhen she begins denouncing and excludingthat all the old faults few and light as they are seem to leap into ugly life again for the moment  few and light indeed  ah my dear templeton the gulf between you and happiness looks wide but only because it is magnified in mist  which you would have me disperse by lightningflashes of dialectics eh  well every man has his nostrum  i have not  my method is not my own but platos  but my good fellow the windrush school admire plato as much as you do and yet certainly arrive at somewhat different conclusions  they do plato the honour of patronising him as a representative man but their real textbook you will find is proclus  that hapless philosophasters a priori method even his very verbiage is dear to their souls for they copy it through wet and dry through sense and nonsense  but as for platowhen i find them using platos weapons i shall believe in their understanding and love of him  and in the meanwhile claim him as a new verger for the reformed church catholic  not a new verger templeton  augustine said fourteen hundred years ago that socrates was the philosopher of the catholic faith if he has not seemed so of late years it is i suspect because we do not understand quite the same thing as augustine did when we talk of the catholic faith and christianity  but you forget in your hurry of clerical confidence that the question still remains whether these creeds are true  that too as i take it is a question of dialectics unless you choose to reduce the whole to a balanceofprobabilities argument rather too narrow a basis for a worldfaith to stand upon  try all mythic theories straussite and others by honest dialectics  try your own thoughts and experiences and the accredited thoughts and experiences of wise men by the same method  mesmerism and the development of species may wait till they have settled themselves somewhat more into sciences at present it does not much matter what agrees or disagrees with them  but using this weapon fearlessly and honestly you will unless socrates and plato were fools arrive at absolute eternal truths which are equally true for all men good or bad conscious or unconscious and i tell youof course you need not believe me till you have made trialthat those truths will coincide with the plain honest meaning of the catholic creeds as determined by the same methodthe only one indeed by which they or anything else can be determined  you forget baconian induction of which you are so fond  and pray what are dialectics but strict baconian induction applied to words as the phenomena of mind instead of to things the phenomena of  what  i cant tell you or rather i will not  i have my own opinion about what those trees and stones are but it will require a few years more verification before i tell  really you and your dialectics seem in a hopeful and valiant state of mind  why not  can truth do anything but conquer  of courseassuming as every one does that the truth is with you  my dear fellow i have seldom met a man who could not be a far better dialectician than i shall ever be if he would but use his common sense  common sense  that really sounds something like a bathos after the great big greek word which you have been propounding to me as the cure for all my doubts  what  are you about to gib after all just as i was flattering myself that i had broken you in to go quietly in harness  i am very much minded to do so  the truth is i cannot bring myself to believe that the universal panacea lies in an obscure and ancient scientific method  obscure and ancient  did i not just say that any man might be a dialectician  did socrates ever appeal to any faculty but the common sense of man as man which exists just as much in england now i presume as it did in athens in his day  does he not in pursuance of that method of his draw his arguments and illustrations to the horror of the bigworded sophists from dogs kettles fishwives and what not which is vulgar and commonplace or did i in my clumsy attempt to imitate him make use of a single argument which does not lie developed or undeveloped in the common sense of every clown in that human reason of his which is part of gods image in him and in every man  and has not my complaint against mr windrushs school been that they will not do this that they will not accept the ground which is common to men as men but disregard that part of the vox populi which is truly vox dei for that which is vox diabolifor private sentiments fancies and aspirations and so casting away the common sense of mankind build up each man on the pins point of his own private judgment his own inverted pyramid  but are you not asking me to do just the same when you propose to me to start as a scientific dialectician  why what are dialectics or any other scientific method but conscious common sense  and what is common sense but unconscious scientific method  every man is a dialectician be he scholar or boor in as far as he tries to use no words which he does not understand and to sift his own thoughts and his expression of them by that reason which is at once common to men and independent of them  as m jourdain talked prose all his life without knowing it  well i prefer the unconscious method  i have as little faith as mr carlyle would have in saying  go to let us makean induction about words or anything else  it seems to me no very hopeful method of finding out facts as they are  certainly provided you mean any particular induction and not a general inductive and severelyinquiring habit of mind that very go to being a fair sign that you have settled beforehand what the induction shall be in plain english that you have come to your conclusion already and are now looking about for facts to prove it but is it any wiser to say  go to i will be conscious of being unconscious of being conscious of my own forms of thought  for that is what you do say when having read plato and knowing his method and its coincidence with common sense you determine to ignore it on commonsense questions  but why not ignore it if motherwit does as well  because you cannot ignore it  you have learnt it more or less and cannot forget it try as you will and must either follow it or break it and talk nonsense  and moreover you ought not to ignore it  for it seems to me that you were sent to cambridge by one greater than your parents in order that you might learn it and bring it home hither for the use of the m jourdains round you here who have no doubt been talking prose all their life but may have been also talking it very badly  you speak riddles  my dear fellow may not a man employ reason or any other common human faculty all his life and yet employ them very clumsily and defectively  i should say so from the gross amount of human unwisdom  and that in the case of uneducated persons happens because they are not conscious of those faculties or of their right laws but use them blindly and capriciously by fits and starts talking sense on one point and nonsense on another  too true heaven knows  but the educated man if education mean anything is the man who has become conscious of those common human faculties and their laws and has learnt to use them continuously and accurately on all matters alike  true o socraticule  then is it not his especial business to teach the right use of them to the less educatedunless you agree with the old sophists that the purpose of education is to enable us to deceive or coerce the uneducated for our own aggrandisement  i am therefore it seems to get up platonic dialectics simply in order to teach my ploughmen to use their common sense  exactly so  teach yourself first and every one around you afterwards not the doctrines nor the formulasthough he had none but the habit of mind which socrates tried in vain to teach the athenian youth  teach them to face all questions patiently and fearlessly  to begin always by asking every word great or small from predestination to protection what it really means  teach them that by your words you shall be justified and by your words you shall be condemned is no barren pulpittest but a tremendous practical law for every day and for every matter  teach them to be sure that man can find out truth because god his father and archetype will show it to those who hunger after it  try to make them see clearly the divine truths which are implied not only in their creeds but in their simplest household words and  and fail as socrates failed or rather worse for he did teach himself  but i shall not even do that  do not despair in haste  in the first place i deny that socrates taught himself for i believe that one taught him who has promised to teach every man who desires wisdom and in the next place i have no fear but that the sound practical intellect which that same one has bestowed on the englishman will give you a far better auditory in any harvest field than socrates could find among the mercurial athenians of a fallen age  well that is at all events a comfort for poor me  i will really take to my plato again till the hunting begins  and even then you know you dont keep two packs so you will have three days out of the six wherein to study him  four you meanfor i have long given up reading sunday books on sunday  then you read your bible and prayerbook or even borrow some of lady janes devotional treatises and try after you have translated the latter into plain english to make out what they one and all really do mean by the light which old socrates has given you during the week  you will find them wiser than you fancy and simpler also  so be it my dear souldoctor  here come lewis and the luncheon  and so ended our conversation
