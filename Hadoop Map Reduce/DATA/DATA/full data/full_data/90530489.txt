90530489	madame de mauves   byhenry james     i  the view from the terrace at saintgermainenlaye is immense and famous paris lies spread before you in dusky vastness domed and fortified glittering here and there through her light vapours and girdled with her silver seine behind you is a park of stately symmetry and behind that a forest where you may lounge through turfy avenues and lightchequered glades and quite forget that you are within half an hour of the boulevards one afternoon however in midspring some five years ago a young man seated on the terrace had preferred to keep this in mind his eyes were fixed in idle wistfulness on the mighty human hive before him he was fond of rural things and he had come to saintgermain a week before to meet the spring halfway but though he could boast of a six months acquaintance with the great city he never looked at it from his present vantage without a sense of curiosity still unappeased there were moments when it seemed to him that not to be there just then was to miss some thrilling chapter of experience and yet his winters experience had been rather fruitless and he had closed the book almost with a yawn though not in the least a cynic he was what one may call a disappointed observer and he never chose the righthand road without beginning to suspect after an hours wayfaring that the left would have been the better he now had a dozen minds to go to paris for the evening to dine at the cafe brebant and repair afterwards to the gymnase and listen to the latest exposition of the duties of the injured husband he would probably have risen to execute this project if he had not noticed a little girl who wandering along the terrace had suddenly stopped short and begun to gaze at him with roundeyed frankness for a moment he was simply amused the childs face denoting such helpless wonderment the next he was agreeably surprised why this is my friend maggie he said i see youve not forgotten me  maggie after a short parley was induced to seal her remembrance with a kiss invited then to explain her appearance at saintgermain she embarked on a recital in which the general according to the infantine method was so fatally sacrificed to the particular that longmore looked about him for a superior source of information he found it in maggies mamma who was seated with another lady at the opposite end of the terrace so taking the child by the hand he led her back to her companions  maggies mamma was a young american lady as you would immediately have perceived with a pretty and friendly face and a great elegance of fresh finery she greeted longmore with amazement and joy mentioning his name to her friend and bidding him bring a chair and sit with them the other lady in whom though she was equally young and perhaps even prettier muslins and laces and feathers were less of a feature remained silent stroking the hair of the little girl whom she had drawn against her knee she had never heard of longmore but she now took in that her companion had crossed the ocean with him had met him afterwards in travelling andhaving left her husband in wall streetwas indebted to him for sundry services maggies mamma turned from time to time and smiled at this lady with an air of invitation the latter smiled back and continued gracefully to say nothing for ten minutes meanwhile longmore felt a revival of interest in his old acquaintance then as mild riddles are more amusing than mere commonplaces it gave way to curiosity about her friend his eyes wandered her volubility shook a sort of sweetness out of the friends silence  the stranger was perhaps not obviously a beauty nor obviously an american but essentially both for the really seeing eye she was slight and fair and though naturally pale was delicately flushed just now as by the effect of late agitation what chiefly struck longmore in her face was the union of a pair of beautifully gentle almost languid grey eyes with a mouth that was all expression and intention her forehead was a trifle more expansive than belongs to classic types and her thick brown hair dressed out of the fashion just then even more ugly than usual her throat and bust were slender but all the more in harmony with certain rapid charming movements of the head which she had a way of throwing back every now and then with an air of attention and a sidelong glance from her dovelike eyes she seemed at once alert and indifferent contemplative and restless and longmore very soon discovered that if she was not a brilliant beauty she was at least a most attaching one this very impression made him magnanimous he was certain he had interrupted a confidential conversation and judged it discreet to withdraw having first learned from maggies mammamrs draperthat she was to take the six oclock train back to paris he promised to meet her at the station  he kept his appointment and mrs draper arrived betimes accompanied by her friend the latter however made her farewells at the door and drove away again giving longmore time only to raise his hat who is she he asked with visible ardour as he brought the traveller her tickets  come and see me tomorrow at the hotel de lempire she answered and ill tell you all about her the force of this offer in making him punctual at the hotel de lempire longmore doubtless never exactly measured and it was perhaps well he was vague for he found his friend who was on the point of leaving paris so distracted by procrastinating milliners and perjured lingeres that coherence had quite deserted her you must find saintgermain dreadfully dull she nevertheless had the presence of mind to say as he was going why wont you come with me to london  introduce me to madame de mauves he answered and saintgermain will quite satisfy me all he had learned was the ladys name and residence  ah she poor woman wont make your affair a carnival shes very unhappy said mrs draper  longmores further enquiries were arrested by the arrival of a young lady with a bandbox but he went away with the promise of a note of introduction to be immediately dispatched to him at saintgermain  he then waited a week but the note never came and he felt how little it was for mrs draper to complain of engagements unperformed he lounged on the terrace and walked in the forest studied suburban street life and made a languid attempt to investigate the records of the court of the exiled stuarts but he spent most of his time in wondering where madame de mauves lived and whether she ever walked on the terrace sometimes he was at last able to recognise for one afternoon toward dusk he made her out from a distance arrested there alone and leaning against the low wall in his momentary hesitation to approach her there was almost a shade of trepidation but his curiosity was not chilled by such a measure of the effect of a quarter of an hours acquaintance she at once recovered their connexion on his drawing near and showed it with the frankness of a person unprovided with a great choice of contacts her dress her expression were the same as before her charm came out like that of fine music on a second hearing she soon made conversation easy by asking him for news of mrs draper longmore told her that he was daily expecting news and after a pause mentioned the promised note of introduction  it seems less necessary now he saidfor me at least but for youi should have liked you to know the good things our friend would probably have been able to say about me  if it arrives at last she answered you must come and see me and bring it if it doesnt you must come without it  then as she continued to linger through the thickening twilight she explained that she was waiting for her husband who was to arrive in the train from paris and who often passed along the terrace on his way home longmore well remembered that mrs draper had spoken of uneasy things in her life and he found it natural to guess that this same husband was the source of them edified by his six months in paris what else is possible he put it for a sweet american girl who marries an unholy foreigner  but this quiet dependence on her lords return rather shook his shrewdness and it received a further check from the free confidence with which she turned to greet an approaching figure longmore distinguished in the fading light a stoutish gentleman on the fair side of forty in a high grey hat whose countenance obscure as yet against the quarter from which it came mainly presented to view the large outward twist of its moustache m de mauves saluted his wife with punctilious gallantry and having bowed to longmore asked her several questions in french before taking his offered arm to walk to their carriage which was in waiting at the gate of the terrace she introduced our hero as a friend of mrs draper and also a fellow countryman whom she hoped they might have the pleasure of seeing as she said chez eux m de mauves responded briefly but civilly in fair english and led his wife away  longmore watched him as he went renewing the curl of his main facial featurewatched him with an irritation devoid of any mentionable ground his one pretext for gnashing his teeth would have been in his apprehension that this gentlemans worst english might prove a matter to shame his own best french for reasons involved apparently in the very structure of his being longmore found a colloquial use of that idiom as insecure as the back of a restive horse and was obliged to take his exercise as he was aware with more tension than grace he reflected meanwhile with comfort that madame de mauves and he had a common tongue and his anxiety yielded to his relief at finding on his table that evening a letter from mrs draper it enclosed a short formal missive to madame de mauves but the epistle itself was copious and confidential she had deferred writing till she reached london where for a week of course she had found other amusements  i think its the sight of so many women here who dont look at all like her that has reminded me by the law of contraries of my charming friend at saintgermain and my promise to introduce you to her she wrote i believe i spoke to you of her rather blighted state and i wondered afterwards whether i hadnt been guilty of a breach of confidence but you would certainly have arrived at guesses of your own and besides she has never told me her secrets the only one she ever pretended to was that shes the happiest creature in the world after assuring me of which poor thing she went off into tears so that i prayed to be delivered from such happiness its the miserable story of an american girl born neither to submit basely nor to rebel crookedly marrying a shining sinful frenchman who believes a woman must do one or the other of those things the lightest of us have a ballast that they cant imagine and the poorest a moral imagination that they dont require she was romantic and perverseshe thought the world she had been brought up in too vulgar or at least too prosaic to have a decent homelife isnt perhaps the greatest of adventures but i think she wishes nowadays she hadnt gone in quite so desperately for thrills m de mauves cared of course for nothing but her money which hes spending royally on his menus plaisirs i hope you appreciate the compliment i pay you when i recommend you to go and cheer up a lady domestically dejected believe me ive given no other man a proof of this esteem so if you were to take me in an inferior sense i would never speak to you again prove to this fine sore creature that our manners may have all the grace without wanting to make such selfish terms for it she avoids society and lives quite alone seeing no one but a horrible french sisterinlaw do let me hear that youve made her patience a little less absentminded make her want to forget make her like you  this ingenious appeal left the young man uneasy he found himself in presence of more complications than had been in his reckoning to call on madame de mauves with his present knowledge struck him as akin to fishing in troubled waters he was of modest composition and yet he asked himself whether an appearance of attentions from any gallant gentleman mightnt give another twist to her tangle a flattering sense of unwonted opportunity howeverof such a possible value constituted for him as he had never before been invited to rise tomade him with the lapse of time more confident possibly more reckless it was too inspiring not to act upon the idea of kindling a truer light in his fair countrywomans slow smile and at least he hoped to persuade her that even a raw representative of the social order she had not done justice to was not necessarily a mere fortuitous collocation of atoms he immediately called on her     ii  she had been placed for her education fourteen years before in a parisian convent by a widowed mammma who was fonder of homburg and nice than of letting out tucks in the frocks of a vigorously growing daughter here besides various elegant accomplishmentsthe art of wearing a train of composing a bouquet of presenting a cup of teashe acquired a certain turn of the imagination which might have passed for a sign of precocious worldliness she dreamed of marrying a man of hierarchical ranknot for the pleasure of hearing herself called madame la vicomtesse for which it seemed to her she should never greatly care but because she had a romantic belief that the enjoyment of inherited and transmitted consideration consideration attached to the fact of birth would be the direct guarantee of an ideal delicacy of feeling she supposed it would be found that the state of being noble does actually enforce the famous obligation romances are rarely worked out in such transcendent good faith and euphemias excuse was the prime purity of her moral vision she was essentially incorruptible and she took this pernicious conceit to her bosom very much as if it had been a dogma revealed by a whitewinged angel even after experience had given her a hundred rude hints she found it easier to believe in fables when they had a certain nobleness of meaning than in wellattested but sordid facts she believed that a gentleman with a long pedigree must be of necessity a very fine fellow and enjoyment of a chance to carry further a family chronicle begun ever so far back must be as a consciousness a source of the most beautiful impulses it wasnt therefore only that noblesse oblige she thought as regards yourself but that it ensures as nothing else does in respect to your wife she had never at the start spoken to a nobleman in her life and these convictions were but a matter of extravagant theory they were the fruit in part of the perusal of various ultramontane works of fictionthe only ones admitted to the convent libraryin which the hero was always a legitimist vicomte who fought duels by the dozen but went twice a month to confession and in part of the strong social scent of the gossip of her companions many of them filles de haut lieu who in the conventgarden after sundays at home depicted their brothers and cousins as prince charmings and young paladins euphemia listened and said nothing she shrouded her visions of matrimony under a coronet in the silence that mostly surrounds all ecstatic faith she was not of that type of young lady who is easily induced to declare that her husband must be six feet high and a little nearsighted part his hair in the middle and have amber lights in his beard to her companions her flights of fancy seemed short rather and poor and untutored and even the fact that she was a sprig of the transatlantic democracy never sufficiently explained her apathy on social questions she had a mental image of that son of the crusaders who was to suffer her to adore him but like many an artist who has produced a masterpiece of idealisation she shrank from exposing it to public criticism it was the portrait of a gentleman rather ugly than handsome and rather poor than rich but his ugliness was to be nobly expressive and his poverty delicately proud she had a fortune of her own which at the proper time after fixing on her in eloquent silence those fine eyes that were to soften the feudal severity of his visage he was to accept with a world of stifled protestations one condition alone she was to makethat he should have race in a state as documented as it was possible to have it on this she would stake her happiness and it was so to happen that several accidents conspired to give convincing colour to this artless philosophy  inclined to long pauses and slow approaches herself euphemia was a great sitter at the feet of breathless volubility and there were moments when she fairly hung upon the lips of mademoiselle marie de mauves her intimacy with this chosen schoolmate was founded on the perceptionall her ownthat their differences were just the right ones mademoiselle de mauves was very positive very shrewd very ironical very frencheverything that euphemia felt herself unpardonable for not being during her sundays en ville she had examined the world and judged it and she imparted her impressions to our attentive heroine with an agreeable mixture of enthusiasm and scepticism she was moreover a handsome and wellgrown person on whom euphemias ribbons and trinkets had a trick of looking better than on their slender proprietress she had finally the supreme merit of being a rigorous example of the virtue of exalted birth having as she did ancestors honourably mentioned by joinville and commines and a stately grandmother with a hooked nose who came up with her after the holidays from a veritable castel in auvergne it seemed to our own young woman that these attributes made her friend more at home in the world than if she had been the daughter of even the most prosperous grocer a certain aristocratic impudence mademoiselle de mauves abundantly possessed and her raids among her friends finery were quite in the spirit of her baronial ancestors in the twelfth centurya spirit regarded by euphemia but as a large way of understanding friendship a freedom from conformities without style and one that would sooner or later express itself in acts of surprising magnanimity there doubtless prevailed in the breast of mademoiselle de mauves herself a dimmer vision of the large securities that euphemia envied her she was to become later in life so accomplished a schemer that her sense of having further heights to scale might well have waked up early the especially fine appearance made by our heroines ribbons and trinkets as her friend wore them ministered to pleasure on both sides and the spell was not of a nature to be menaced by the young americans general gentleness the concluding motive of maries writing to her grandmamma to invite euphemia for a three weeks holiday to the castel in auvergne involved however the subtlest considerations mademoiselle de mauves indeed at this time seventeen years of age and capable of views as wide as her wants was as proper a figure as could possibly have been found for the foreground of a scene artfully designed and euphemia whose years were of like number asked herself if a right harmony with such a place mightnt come by humble prayer it is a proof of the sincerity of the latters aspirations that the castel was not a shock to her faith it was neither a cheerful nor a luxurious abode but it was as full of wonders as a box of old heirlooms or objects willed it had battered towers and an empty moat a rusty drawbridge and a court paved with crooked grassgrown slabs over which the antique coachwheels of the lady with the hooked nose seemed to awaken the echoes of the seventeenth century euphemia was not frightened out of her dream she had the pleasure of seeing all the easier passages translated into truth as the learner of a language begins with the common words she had a taste for old servants old anecdotes old furniture faded household colours and sweetly stale odoursmusty treasures in which the chateau de mauves abounded she made a dozen sketches in watercolours after her conventual pattern but sentimentally as one may say she was for ever sketching with a freer hand  old madame de mauves had nothing severe but her nose and she seemed to euphemiawhat indeed she had every claim to pass forthe very image and pattern of an historical character belonging to a great order of things she patronised the young stranger who was ready to sit all day at her feet and listen to anecdotes of the bon temps and quotations from the family chronicles madame de mauves was a very honest old woman she uttered her thoughts with ancient plainness one day after pushing back euphemias shining locks and blinking with some tenderness from behind an immense faceamain that acted as for the relegation of the girl herself to the glass case of a museum she declared with an energetic shake of the head that she didnt know what to make of such a little person and in answer to the little persons evident wonder i should like to advise you she said but you seem to me so all of a piece that im afraid that if i advise you i shall spoil you its easy to see youre not one of us i dont know whether youre better but you seem to me to have been wound up by some key that isnt kept by your governess or your confessor or even your mother but that you wear by a fine black ribbon round your own neck little persons in my daywhen they were stupid they were very docile but when they were clever they were very sly youre clever enough i imagine and yet if i guessed all your secrets at this moment is there one i should have to frown at i can tell you a wickeder one than any youve discovered for yourself if you wish to live at ease in the doux pays de france dont trouble too much about the key of your conscience or even about your conscience itselfi mean your own particular one youll fancy it saying things it wont help your case to hear theyll make you sad and when youre sad youll grow plain and when youre plain youll grow bitter and when youre bitter youll be peu aimable i was brought up to think that a womans first duty is to be infinitely so and the happiest women ive known have been in fact those who performed this duty faithfully as youre not a catholic i suppose you cant be a devote and if you dont take life as a fifty years mass the only way to take its as a game of skill listen to this not to lose at the game of life you musti dont say cheat but not be too sure your neighbour wont and not be shocked out of your selfpossession if he does dont lose my deari beseech you dont lose be neither suspicious nor credulous and if you find your neighbour peeping dont cry out only very politely wait your own chance ive had my revenge more than once in my day but i really think the sweetest i could take en somme against the past ive known would be to have your blest innocence profit by my experience  this was rather bewildering advice but euphemia understood it too little to be either edified or frightened she sat listening to it very much as she would have listened to the speeches of an old lady in a comedy whose diction should strikingly correspond to the form of her highbacked armchair and the fashion of her coif her indifference was doubly dangerous for madame de mauves spoke at the instance of coming events and her words were the result of a worry of scruplesscruples in the light of which euphemia was on the one hand too tender a victim to be sacrificed to an ambition and the prosperity of her own house on the other too precious a heritage to be sacrificed to an hesitation the prosperity in question had suffered repeated and grievous breaches and the menaced institution been overmuch pervaded by that cold comfort in which people are obliged to balance dinnertable allusions to feudal ancestors against the absence of sidedishes a state of things the sorrier as the family was now mainly represented by a gentleman whose appetite was large and who justly maintained that its historic glories hadnt been established by underfed heroes  three days after euphemias arrival richard de mauves coming down from paris to pay his respects to his grandmother treated our heroine to her first encounter with a gentilhomme in the flesh on appearing he kissed his grandmothers hand with a smile which caused her to draw it away with dignity and set euphemia who was standing by to ask herself what could have happened between them her unanswered wonder was but the beginning of a long chain of puzzlements but the reader is free to know that the smile of m de mauves was a reply to a postscript affixed by the old lady to a letter addressed to him by her granddaughter as soon as the girl had been admitted to justify the latters promises mademoiselle de mauves brought her letter to her grandmother for approval but obtained no more than was expressed in a frigid nod the old lady watched her with this coldness while she proceeded to seal the letter then suddenly bade her open it again and bring her a pen  your sisters flatteries are all nonsense she wrote the young ladys far too good for you mauvais sujet beyond redemption if youve a particle of conscience youll not come and disturb the repose of an angel of innocence  the other relative of the subject of this warning who had read these lines made up a little face as she freshly indited the address but she laid down her pen with a confident nod which might have denoted that by her judgement her brother was appealed to on the ground of a principle that didnt exist in him and if you meant what you said the young man on his side observed to his grandmother on his first private opportunity it would have been simpler not to have sent the letter  put out of humour perhaps by this gross impugnment of her sincerity the head of the family kept her room on pretexts during a greater part of euphemias stay so that the latters angelic innocence was left all to her grandsons mercy it suffered no worse mischance however than to be prompted to intenser communion with itself richard de mauves was the hero of the young girls romance made real and so completely accordant with this creature of her imagination that she felt afraid of him almost as she would have been of a figure in a framed picture who should have stepped down from the wall he was now thirtythreeyoung enough to suggest possibilities of ardent activity and old enough to have formed opinions that a simple woman might deem it an intellectual privilege to listen to he was perhaps a trifle handsomer than euphemias rather grim quixotic ideal but a very few days reconciled her to his good looks as effectually they would have reconciled her to a characterised want of them he was quiet grave eminently distinguished he spoke little but his remarks without being sententious had a nobleness of tone that caused them to reecho in the young girls ears at the end of the day he paid her very little direct attention but his chance wordswhen he only asked her if she objected to his cigarettewere accompanied by a smile of extraordinary kindness  it happened that shortly after his arrival riding an unruly horse which euphemia had with shy admiration watched him mount in the castleyard he was thrown with a violence which without disparaging his skill made him for a fortnight an interesting invalid lounging in the library with a bandaged knee to beguile his confinement the accomplished young stranger was repeatedly induced to sing for him which she did with a small natural tremor that might have passed for the finish of vocal art he never overwhelmed her with compliments but he listened with unfailing attention remembered all her melodies and would sit humming them to himself while his imprisonment lasted indeed he passed hours in her company making her feel not unlike some unfriended artist who has suddenly gained the opportunity to devote a fortnight to the study of a great model euphemia studied with noiseless diligence what she supposed to be the character of m de mauves and the more she looked the more fine lights and shades she seemed to behold in this masterpiece of nature m de mauvess character indeed whether from a sense of being so generously and intensely taken for granted or for reasons which bid graceful defiance to analysis had never been so much on show even to the very casual critic lodged as might be said in an outoftheway corner of it it seemed really to reflect the purity of euphemias pious opinion there had been nothing especially to admire in the state of mind in which he left parisa settled resolve to marry a young person whose charms might or might not justify his sisters account of them but who was mistress at the worst of a couple of hundred thousand francs a year he had not counted out sentimentif she pleased him so much the better but he had left a meagre margin for it and would hardly have admitted that so excellent a match could be improved by it he was a robust and serene sceptic and it was a singular fate for a man who believed in nothing to be so tenderly believed in what his original faith had been he could hardly have told you for as he came back to his childhoods home to mend his fortunes by pretending to fall in love he was a thoroughly perverse creature and overlaid with more corruptions than a summer days questioning of his conscience would have put to flight ten years pursuit of pleasure which a bureau full of unpaid bills was all he had to show for had pretty well stifled the natural lad whose violent will and generous temper might have been shaped by a different pressure to some such showing as would have justified a romantic faith so should he have exhaled the natural fragrance of a lateblooming flower of hereditary honour his violence indeed had been subdued and he had learned to be irreproachably polite but he had lost the fineness of his generosity and his politeness which in the long run society paid for was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism like his fondness for ciphered pockethandkerchiefs lavender gloves and other fopperies by which shopkeepers remained out of pocket in afteryears he was terribly polite to his wife he had formed himself as the phrase was and the form prescribed to him by the society into which his birth and his tastes had introduced him was marked by some peculiar features that which mainly concerns us is its classification of the fairer half of humanity as objects not essentially differentsay from those very lavender gloves that are soiled in an evening and thrown away to do m de mauves justice he had in the course of time encountered in the feminine character such plentiful evidence of its pliant softness and fine adjustability that idealism naturally seemed to him a losing game  euphemia as he lay on his sofa struck him as by no means contradictory she simply reminded him that very young women are generally innocent and that this is on the whole the most potent source of their attraction her innocence moved him to perfect consideration and it seemed to him that if he shortly became her husband it would be exposed to a danger the less old madame de mauves who flattered herself that in this whole matter she was very laudably rigid might almost have taken a lesson from the delicacy he practised for two or three weeks her grandson was wellnigh a blushing boy again he watched from behind the figaro he admired and desired and held his tongue he found himself not in the least moved to a flirtation he had no wish to trouble the waters he proposed to transfuse into the golden cup of matrimony sometimes a word a look a gesture of euphemias gave him the oddest sense of being or of seeming at least almost bashful for she had a way of not dropping her eyes according to the mysterious virginal mechanism of not fluttering out of the room when she found him there alone of treating him rather as a glorious than as a pernicious influencea radiant frankness of demeanour in fine despite an infinite natural reserve which it seemed at once graceless not to be complimentary about and indelicate not to take for granted in this way had been wrought in the young mans mind a vague unwonted resonance of soft impressions as we may call it which resembled the happy stir of the change from dreaming pleasantly to waking happily his imagination was touched he was very fond of music and he now seemed to give easy ear to some of the sweetest he had ever heard in spite of the bore of being laid up with a lame knee he was in better humour than he had known for months he lay smoking cigarettes and listening to the nightingales with the satisfied smile of one of his country neighbours whose big ox should have taken the prize at a fair every now and then with an impatient suspicion of the resemblance he declared himself pitifully bete but he was under a charm that braved even the supreme penalty of seeming ridiculous one morning he had half an hours teteatete with his grandmothers confessor a softvoiced old abbe whom for reasons of her own madame de mauves had suddenly summoned and had left waiting in the drawingroom while she rearranged her curls his reverence going up to the old lady assured her that m le comte was in a most edifying state of mind and the likeliest subject for the operation of grace this was a theological interpretation of the counts unusual equanimity he had always lazily wondered what priests were good for and he now remembered with a sense of especial obligation to the abbe that they were excellent for marrying people  a day or two after this he left off his bandages and tried to walk he made his way into the garden and hobbled successfully along one of the alleys but in the midst of his progress was pulled up by a spasm of pain which forced him to stop and call for help in an instant euphemia came tripping along the path and offered him her arm with the frankest solicitude  not to the house he said taking it further on to the bosquet this choice was prompted by her having immediately confessed that she had seen him leave the house had feared an accident and had followed him on tiptoe  why didnt you join me he had asked giving her a look in which admiration was no longer disguised and yet felt itself half at the mercy of her replying that a jeune fille shouldnt be seen following a gentleman but it drew a breath which filled its lungs for a long time afterwards when she replied simply that if she had overtaken him he might have accepted her arm out of politeness whereas she wished to have the pleasure of seeing him walk alone  the bosquet was covered with an odorous tangle of blossoming creepers and a nightingale overhead was shaking out lovenotes with a profusion that made the count feel his own conduct the last word of propriety ive always heard that in america when a man wishes to marry a young girl he offers himself simply face to face and without ceremonywithout parents and uncles and aunts and cousins sitting round in a circle  why i believe so said euphemia staring and too surprised to be alarmed  very well thensuppose our arbour here to be your great sensible country i offer you my hand a lamericaine it will make me intensely happy to feel you accept it  whether euphemias acceptance was in the american manner is more than i can say i incline to think that for fluttering grateful trustful softlyamazed young hearts there is only one manner all over the world  that evening in the massive turret chamber it was her happiness to inhabit she wrote a dutiful letter to her mamma and had just sealed it when she was sent for by madame de mauves she found this ancient lady seated in her boudoir in a lavender satin gown and with her candles all lighted as for the keeping of some fete are you very happy the old woman demanded making euphemia sit down before her  im almost afraid to say so lest i should wake myself up  may you never wake up belle enfant madame de mauves grandly returned this is the first marriage ever made in our family in this wayby a comte de mauves proposing to a young girl in an arbour like jeannot and jeannette it has not been our way of doing things and people may say it wants frankness my grandson tells me he regards itfor the conditionsas the perfection of good taste very well im a very old woman and if your differences should ever be as marked as your agreements i shouldnt care to see them but i should be sorry to die and think you were going to be unhappy you cant be my dear beyond a certain point because though in this world the lord sometimes makes light of our expectations he never altogether ignores our deserts but youre very young and innocent and easy to dazzle there never was a man in the worldamong the saints themselvesas good as you believe my grandson but hes a galant homme and a gentleman and ive been talking to him tonight to you i want to say thisthat youre to forget the worldly rubbish i talked the other day about the happiness of frivolous women its not the kind of happiness that would suit you ma toutebelle whatever befalls you promise me this to be to remain your own sincere little self only charming in your own serious little way the comtesse de mauves will be none the worse for it your brave little self understand in spite of everythingbad precepts and bad examples bad fortune and even bad usage be persistently and patiently just what the good god has made you and even one of usand one of those who is most what we arewill do you justice  euphemia remembered this speech in afteryears and more than once wearily closing her eyes she seemed to see the old woman sitting upright in her faded finery and smiling grimly like one of the fates who sees the wheel of fortune turning up her favourite event but at the moment it had for her simply the proper gravity of the occasion this was the way she supposed in which lucky young girls were addressed on their engagement by wise old women of quality  at her convent to which she immediately returned she found a letter from her mother which disconcerted her far more than the remarks of madame de mauves who were these people mrs cleve demanded who had presumed to talk to her daughter of marriage without asking her leave questionable gentlefolk plainly the best french people never did such things euphemia would return straightway to her convent shut herself up and await her own arrival it took mrs cleve three weeks to travel from nice to paris and during this time the young girl had no communication with her lover beyond accepting a bouquet of violets marked with his initials and left by a female friend ive not brought you up with such devoted care she declared to her daughter at their first interview to marry a presumptuous and penniless frenchman i shall take you straight home and youll please forget m de mauves  mrs cleve received that evening at her hotel a visit from this personage which softened her wrath but failed to modify her decision he had very good manners but she was sure he had horrible morals and the lady who had been a goodnatured censor on her own account felt a deep and real need to sacrifice her daughter to propriety she belonged to that large class of americans who make light of their native land in familiar discourse but are startled back into a sense of having blasphemed when they find europeans taking them at their word i know the type my dear she said to her daughter with a competent nod he wont beat you sometimes youll wish he would  euphemia remained solemnly silent for the only answer she felt capable of making was that her mothers mind was too small a measure of things and her lovers type an historic a social masterpiece that it took some mystic illumination to appreciate a person who confounded him with the common throng of her wateringplace acquaintance was not a person to argue with it struck the girl she had simply no cause to plead her cause was in the lords hands and in those of m de mauves  this agent of providence had been irritated and mortified by mrs cleves opposition and hardly knew how to handle an adversary who failed to perceive that a member of his family gave of necessity more than he received but he had obtained information on his return to paris which exalted the uses of humility euphemias fortune wonderful to say was greater than its fame and in view of such a prize even a member of his family could afford to take a snubbing  the young mans tact his deference his urbane insistence won a concession from mrs cleve the engagement was to be put off and her daughter was to return home be brought out and receive the homage she was entitled to and which might well take a form representing peril to the suit of this first headlong aspirant they were to exchange neither letters nor mementoes nor messages but if at the end of two years euphemia had refused offers enough to attest the permanence of her attachment he should receive an invitation to address her again this decision was promulgated in the presence of the parties interested the count bore himself gallantly looking at his young friend as if he expected some tender protestation but she only looked at him silently in return neither weeping nor smiling nor putting out her hand on this they separated and as m de mauves walked away he declared to himself that in spite of the confounded two years he was one of the luckiest of mento have a fiancee who to several millions of francs added such strangely beautiful eyes  how many offers euphemia refused but scantily concerns usand how the young man wore his two years away he found he required pastimes and as pastimes were expensive he added heavily to the list of debts to be cancelled by euphemias fortune sometimes in the thick of what he had once called pleasure with a keener conviction than now he put to himself the case of their failing him after all and then he remembered that last mute assurance of her pale face and drew a long breath of such confidence as he felt in nothing else in the world save his own punctuality in an affair of honour  at last one morning he took the express to havre with a letter of mrs cleves in his pocket and ten days later made his bow to mother and daughter in new york his stay was brief and he was apparently unable to bring himself to view what euphemias uncle mr butterworth who gave her away at the altar called our great experiment of democratic selfgovernment in a serious light he smiled at everything and seemed to regard the new world as a colossal plaisanterie it is true that a perpetual smile was the most natural expression of countenance for a man about to marry euphemia cleve     iii  longmores first visit seemed to open to him so large a range of quiet pleasure that he very soon paid a second and at the end of a fortnight had spent uncounted hours in the little drawingroom which madame de mauves rarely quitted except to drive or walk in the forest she lived in an oldfashioned pavilion between a highwalled court and an excessively artificial garden beyond whose enclosure you saw a long line of treetops longmore liked the garden and in the mild afternoons used to move his chair through the open window to the smooth terrace which overlooked it while his hostess sat just within presently she would come out and wander through the narrow alleys and beside the thinspouting fountain and at last introduce him to a private gate in the high wall the opening to a lane which led to the forest hitherwards she more than once strolled with him bareheaded and meaning to go but twenty rods but always going goodnaturedly further and often stretching it to the freedom of a promenade they found many things to talk about and to the pleasure of feeling the hours slip along like some silver stream longmore was able to add the satisfaction of suspecting that he was a resource for madame de mauves he had made her acquaintance with the sense not wholly inspiring that she was a woman with a painful twist in her life and that seeking her acquaintance would be like visiting at a house where there was an invalid who could bear no noise but he very soon recognised that her grievance if grievance it was was not aggressive that it was not fond of attitudes and ceremonies and that her most earnest wish was to remember it as little as possible he felt that even if mrs draper hadnt told him she was unhappy he would have guessed it and yet that he couldnt have pointed to his proof the evidence was chiefly negativeshe never alluded to her husband beyond this it seemed to him simply that her whole being was pitched in a lower key than harmonious nature had designed she was like a powerful singer who had lost her high notes she never drooped nor sighed nor looked unutterable things she dealt no sarcastic digs at her fate she had in short none of the conscious graces of the woman wronged only longmore was sure that her gentle gaiety was but the milder or sharper flush of a settled ache and that she but tried to interest herself in his thoughts in order to escape from her own if she had wished to irritate his curiosity and lead him to take her confidence by storm nothing could have served her purpose better than this studied discretion he measured the rare magnanimity of selfeffacement so deliberate he felt how few women were capable of exchanging a luxurious woe for a thankless effort madame de mauves he himself felt wasnt sweeping the horizon for a compensation or a consoler she had suffered a personal deception that had disgusted her with persons she wasnt planning to get the worth of her trouble back in some other way for the present she was proposing to live with it peaceably reputably and without scandalturning the key on it occasionally as you would on a companion liable to attacks of insanity longmore was a man of fine senses and of a speculative spirit leadingstrings that had never been slipped he began to regard his hostess as a figure haunted by a shadow which was somehow her intenser and more authentic self this lurking duality in her put on for him an extraordinary charm her delicate beauty acquired to his eye the serious cast of certain blankbrowed greek statues and sometimes when his imagination more than his ear detected a vague tremor in the tone in which she attempted to make a friendly question seem to have behind it none of the hollow resonance of absentmindedness his marvelling eyes gave her an answer more eloquent though much less to the point than the one she demanded  she supplied him indeed with much to wonder about so that he fitted in his ignorance a dozen highflown theories to her apparent history she had married for love and staked her whole soul on it of that he was convinced she hadnt changed her allegiance to be near paris and her base of supplies of millinery he was sure she had seen her perpetrated mistake in a light of which her present life with its conveniences for shopping and its moral aridity was the absolute negation but by what extraordinary process of the heartthrough what mysterious intermission of that moral instinct which may keep pace with the heart even when this organ is making unprecedented timehad she fixed her affections on an insolently frivolous frenchman longmore needed no telling he knew that m de mauves was both cynical and shallow these things were stamped on his eyes his nose his mouth his voice his gesture his step of frenchwomen themselves when all was said our young man full of nursed discriminations went in no small fear they all seemed to belong to the type of a certain fine lady to whom he had ventured to present a letter of introduction and whom directly after his first visit to her he had set down in his notebook as metallic why should madame de mauves have chosen a frenchwomans lotshe whose nature had an atmospheric envelope absent even from the brightest metals he asked her one day frankly if it had cost her nothing to transplant herselfif she werent oppressed with a sense of irreconcileable difference from all these people she replied nothing at first till he feared she might think it her duty to resent a question that made light of all her husbands importances he almost wished she would it would seem a proof that her policy of silence had a limit i almost grew up here she said at last and it was here for me those visions of the future took shape that we all have when we begin to think or to dream beyond mere playtime as matters stand one may be very american and yet arrange it with ones conscience to live in europe my imagination perhapsi had a little when i was youngerhelped me to think i should find happiness here and after all for a woman what does it signify this isnt america nothis element but its quite as little france france is out there beyond the garden france is in the town and the forest but here close about me in my room andshe paused a momentin my mind its a nameless and doubtless not at all remarkable little country of my own its not her country she added that makes a woman happy or unhappy  madame clairin euphemias sisterinlaw might meanwhile have been supposed to have undertaken the graceful task of making longmore ashamed of his uncivil jottings about her sex and nation mademoiselle de mauves bringing example to the confirmation of precept had made a remunerative match and sacrificed her name to the millions of a prosperous and aspiring wholesale druggista gentleman liberal enough to regard his fortune as a moderate price for being towed into circles unpervaded by pharmaceutic odours his system possibly was sound but his own application of it to be deplored m clairins head was turned by his good luck having secured an aristocratic wife he adopted an aristocratic vice and began to gamble at the bourse in an evil hour he lost heavily and then staked heavily to recover himself but he was to learn that the law of compensation works with no such pleasing simplicity and he rolled to the dark bottom of his folly there he felt everything gohis wits his courage his probity everything that had made him what his fatuous marriage had so promptly unmade he walked up the rue vivienne with his hands in his empty pockets and stood half an hour staring confusedly up and down the brave boulevard people brushed against him and half a dozen carriages almost ran over him until at last a policeman who had been watching him for some time took him by the arm and led him gently away he looked at the mans cocked hat and sword with tears in his eyes he hoped for some practical application of the wrath of heaven something that would express violently his deadweight of selfabhorrence the sergent de ville however only stationed him in the embrasure of a door out of harms way and walked off to supervise a financial contest between an old lady and a cabman poor m clairin had only been married a year but he had had time to measure the great spirit of true children of the anciens preux when night had fallen he repaired to the house of a friend and asked for a nights lodging and as his friend who was simply his old head bookkeeper and lived in a small way was put to some trouble to accommodate him you must pardon me the poor man said but i cant go home im afraid of my wife toward morning he blew his brains out his widow turned the remnants of his property to better account than could have been expected and wore the very handsomest mourning it was for this latter reason perhaps that she was obliged to retrench at other points and accept a temporary home under her brothers roof  fortune had played madame clairin a terrible trick but had found an adversary and not a victim though quite without beauty she had always had what is called the grand air and her air from this time forth was grander than ever as she trailed about in her sable furbelows tossing back her welldressed head and holding up her vigilant longhandled eyeglass she seemed to be sweeping the whole field of society and asking herself where she should pluck her revenge suddenly she espied it ready made to her hand in poor longmores wealth and amiability american dollars and american complaisance had made her brothers fortune why shouldnt they make hers she overestimated the wealth and misinterpreted the amiability for she was sure a man could neither be so contented without being rich nor so backward without being weak longmore met her advances with a formal politeness that covered a good deal of unflattering discomposure she made him feel deeply uncomfortable and though he was at a loss to conceive how he could be an object of interest to a sharp parisienne he had an indefinable sense of being enclosed in a magnetic circle of having become the victim of an incantation if madame clairin could have fathomed his puritanic soul she would have laid by her wand and her book and dismissed him for an impossible subject she gave him a moral chill and he never named her to himself save as that dreadful womanthat awful woman he did justice to her grand air but for his pleasure he preferred the small air of madame de mauves and he never made her his bow after standing frigidly passive for five minutes to one of her gracious overtures to intimacy without feeling a peculiar desire to ramble away into the forest fling himself down on the warm grass and staring up at the blue sky forget that there were any women in nature who didnt please like the swaying treetops one day on his arrival at the house she met him in the court with the news that her sisterinlaw was shut up with a headache and that his visit must be for her he followed her into the drawingroom with the best grace at his command and sat twirling his hat for half an hour suddenly he understood her her caressing cadences were so almost explicit an invitation to solicit the charming honour of her hand he blushed to the roots of his hair and jumped up with uncontrollable alacrity then dropping a glance at madame clairin who sat watching him with hard eyes over the thin edge of her smile perceived on her brow a flash of unforgiving wrath it was not pleasing in itself but his eyes lingered a moment for it seemed to show off her character what he saw in the picture frightened him and he felt himself murmur poor madame de mauves his departure was abrupt and this time he really went into the forest and lay down on the grass  after which he admired his young countrywoman more than ever her intrinsic clearness shone out to him even through the darker shade cast over it at the end of a month he received a letter from a friend with whom he had arranged a tour through the low countries reminding him of his promise to keep their tryst at brussels it was only after his answer was posted that he fully measured the zeal with which he had declared that the journey must either be deferred or abandonedsince he couldnt possibly leave saintgermain he took a walk in the forest and asked himself if this were indeed portentously true such a truth somehow made it surely his duty to march straight home and put together his effects poor webster who he knew had counted ardently on this excursion was the best of men six weeks ago he would have gone through anything to join poor webster it had never been in his books to throw overboard a friend whom he had loved ten years for a married woman whom he had six weekswell admired it was certainly beyond question that he hung on at saintgermain because this admirable married woman was there but in the midst of so much admiration what had become of his fine old power to conclude this was the conduct of a man not judging but drifting and he had pretended never to drift if she were as unhappy as he believed the active sympathy of such a man would help her very little more than his indifference if she were less so she needed no help and could dispense with his professions he was sure moreover that if she knew he was staying on her account she would be extremely annoyed this very feeling indeed had much to do with making it hard to go her displeasure would be the flush on the snow of the high cold stoicism that touched him to the heart at moments withal he assured himself that staying to watch herand what else did it come towas simply impertinent it was gross to keep tugging at the cover of a book so intentionally closed then inclination answered that some day her selfsupport would fail and he had a vision of this exquisite creature calling vainly for help he would just be her friend to any length and it was unworthy of either to think about consequences he was a friend however who nursed a brooding regret for his not having known her five years earlier as well as a particular objection to those who had smartly anticipated him it seemed one of fortunes most mocking strokes that she should be surrounded by persons whose only merit was that they threw every side of her as she turned in her pain into radiant relief  our young mans growing irritation made it more and more difficult for him to see any other merit than this in richard de mauves and yet disinterestedly it would have been hard to give a name to the pitiless perversity lighted by such a conclusion and there were times when longmore was almost persuaded against his finer judgement that he was really the most considerate of husbands and that it was not a mans fault if his wifes love of life had pitched itself once for all in the minor key the counts manners were perfect his discretion irreproachable and he seemed never to address his companion but sentimentally speaking hat in hand his tone to longmoreas the latter was perfectly awarewas that of a man of the world to a man not quite of the world but what it lacked in true frankness it made up in easy form i cant thank you enough for having overcome my wifes shyness he more than once declared if we left her to do as she pleased she wouldin her youth and her beautybury herself all absurdly alive come often and bring your good friends and compatriotssome of them are so amusing shell have nothing to do with mine but perhaps youll be able to offer her better son affaire  m de mauves made these speeches with a bright assurance very amazing to our hero who had an innocent belief that a mans head may point out to him the shortcomings of his heart and make him ashamed of them he couldnt fancy him formed both to neglect his wife and to take the derisive view of her minding it longmore had at any rate an exasperated sense that this nobleman thought rather the less of their interesting friend on account of that very same fine difference of nature which so deeply stirred his own sympathies he was rarely present during the sessions of the american visitor and he made a daily journey to paris where he had de gros soucis daffaires as he once mentionedwith an allembracing flourish and not in the least in the tone of apology when he appeared it was late in the evening and with an imperturbable air of being on the best of terms with every one and every thing which was peculiarly annoying if you happened to have a tacit quarrel with him if he was an honest man he was an honest man somehow spoiled for confidence something he had however that his critic vaguely envied something in his address splendidly positive a manner rounded and polished by the habit of conversation and the friction of full experience an urbanity exercised for his own sake not for his neighbours which seemed the fruit of one of those strong temperaments that rule the inward scene better than the best conscience the count had plainly no sense for morals and poor longmore who had the finest would have been glad to borrow his recipe for appearing then so to range the whole scale of the senses what was it that enabled him short of being a monster with visibly cloven feet and exhaling brimstone to misprize so cruelly a nature like his wifes and to walk about the world with such a handsome invincible grin it was the essential grossness of his imagination which had nevertheless helped him to such a store of neat speeches he could be highly polite and could doubtless be damnably impertinent but the life of the spirit was a world as closed to him as the world of great music to a man without an ear it was ten to one he didnt in the least understand how his wife felt he and his smooth sister had doubtless agreed to regard their relative as a puritanical little person of meagre aspirations and few talents content with looking at paris from the terrace and as a special treat having a countryman very much like herself to regale her with innocent echoes of their native wit m de mauves was tired of his companion he liked women who could frankly amuse him better she was too dim too delicate too modest she had too few arts too little coquetry too much charity lighting a cigar some day while he summed up his situation her husband had probably decided she was incurably stupid it was the same taste in essence our young man moralised as the taste for m gerome and m baudry in painting and for m gustave flaubert and m charles baudelaire in literature the count was a pagan and his wife a christian and between them an impassable gulf he was by race and instinct a grand seigneur longmore had often heard of that historic type and was properly grateful for an opportunity to examine it closely it had its elegance of outline but depended on spiritual sources so remote from those of which he felt the living gush in his own soul that he found himself gazing at it in irreconcileable antipathy through a dim historic mist im a modern bourgeois he said and not perhaps so good a judge of how far a pretty womans tongue may go at supper before the mirrors properly crack to hear but ive not met one of the rarest of women without recognising her without making my reflexion that charm for charm such a maniere detre is more fetching even than the worst of theresas songs sung by a dissipated duchess wit for wit i think mine carries me further it was easy indeed to perceive that as became a grand seigneur m de mauves had a stock of social principles he wouldnt especially have desired perhaps that his wife should compete in amateur operettas with the duchesses in question for the most part of comparatively recent origin but he held that a gentleman may take his amusement where he finds it that he is quite at liberty not to find it at home and that even an adoptive daughter of his house who should hang her head and have red eyes and allow herself to make any other response to officious condolence than that her husbands amusements were his own affair would have forfeited every claim to having her fingertips bowed over and kissed and yet in spite of this definite faith longmore figured him much inconvenienced by the countesss avoidance of betrayals did it dimly occur to him that the principle of this reserve was selfcontrol and not selfeffacement she was a model to all the inferior matrons of his line past and to come and an occasional scene from her at a manageable hour would have had something reassuringwould have attested her stupidity rather better than this mere polish of her patience  longmore would have given much to be able to guess how this latter secret worked and he tried more than once though timidly and awkwardly enough to make out the game she was playing she struck him as having long resisted the force of cruel evidence and as though succumbing to it at last having denied herself on simple grounds of generosity the right to complain her faith might have perished but the sense of her own old deep perversity remained he believed her thus quite capable of reproaching herself with having expected too much and of trying to persuade herself out of her bitterness by saying that her hopes had been vanities and follies and that what was before her was simply life i hate tragedy she once said to him im a dreadful coward about having to suffer or to bleed ive always tried to believe thatwithout base concessionssuch extremities may always somehow be dodged or indefinitely postponed i should be willing to buy myself off from having ever to be overwhelmed by giving upwell any amusement you like she lived evidently in nervous apprehension of being fatally convincedof seeing to the end of her deception longmore when he thought of this felt the force of his desire to offer her something of which she could be as sure as of the sun in heaven     iv  his friend webster meanwhile lost no time in accusing him of the basest infidelity and in asking him what he found at suburban saintgermain to prefer to van eyck and memling rubens and rembrandt a day or two after the receipt of this friends letter he took a walk with madame de mauves in the forest they sat down on a fallen log and she began to arrange into a bouquet the anemones and violets she had gathered ive a word here he said at last from a friend whom i some time ago promised to join in brussels the time has comeit has passed it finds me terribly unwilling to leave saintgermain  she looked up with the immediate interest she always showed in his affairs but with no hint of a disposition to make a personal application of his words saintgermain is pleasant enough but are you doing yourself justice shant you regret in future days that instead of travelling and seeing cities and monuments and museums and improving your mind you simply sat herefor instanceon a log and pulled my flowers to pieces  what i shall regret in future days he answered after some hesitation is that i should have sat heresat here so muchand never have shown whats the matter with me im fond of museums and monuments and of improving my mind and im particularly fond of my friend webster but i cant bring myself to leave saintgermain without asking you a question you must forgive me if its indiscreet and be assured that curiosity was never more respectful are you really as unhappy as i imagine you to be  she had evidently not expected his appeal and making her change colour it took her unprepared if i strike you as unhappy she none the less simply said ive been a poorer friend to you than i wished to be  i perhaps have been a better friend of yours than youve supposed he returned ive admired your reserve your courage your studied gaiety but ive felt the existence of something beneath them that was more youmore you as i wished to know youthan they were some trouble in you that ive permitted myself to hate and resent  she listened all gravely but without an air of offence and he felt that while he had been timorously calculating the last consequences of friendship she had quietly enough accepted them you surprise me she said slowly and her flush still lingered but to refuse to answer you would confirm some impression in you even now much too strong any troubleif you mean any unhappinessthat one can sit comfortably talking about is an unhappiness with distinct limitations if i were examined before a board of commissioners for testing the felicity of mankind im sure i should be pronounced a very fortunate woman there was something that deeply touched him in her tone and this quality pierced further as she continued but let me add with all gratitude for your sympathy that its my own affair altogether it neednt disturb you my dear sir she wound up with a certain quaintness of gaiety for ive often found myself in your company contented enough and diverted enough  well youre a wonderful woman the young man declared and i admire you as ive never admired any one youre wiser than anything i for one can say to you and what i ask of you is not to let me advise or console you but simply thank you for letting me know you he had intended no such outburst as this but his voice rang loud and he felt an unfamiliar joy as he uttered it  she shook her head with some impatience let us be friendsas i supposed we were going to bewithout protestations and fine words to have you paying compliments to my wisdomthat would be real wretchedness i can dispense with your admiration better than the flemish painters canbetter than van eyck and rubens in spite of all their worshippers go join your friendsee everything enjoy everything learn everything and write me an excellent letter brimming over with your impressions im extremely fond of the dutch painters she added with the faintest quaver in the world an impressible break of voice that longmore had noticed once or twice before and had interpreted as the sudden weariness the controlled convulsion of a spirit selfcondemned to play a part  i dont believe you care a button for the dutch painters he said with a laugh but i shall certainly write you a letter  she rose and turned homeward thoughtfully rearranging her flowers as she walked little was said longmore was asking himself with an agitation of his own in the unspoken words whether all this meant simply that he was in love he looked at the rooks wheeling against the goldenhued sky between the treetops but not at his companion whose personal presence seemed lost in the felicity she had created madame de mauves was silent and graveshe felt she had almost grossly failed and she was proportionately disappointed an emotional friendship she had not desired her scheme had been to pass with her visitor as a placid creature with a good deal of leisure which she was disposed to devote to profitable conversation of an impersonal sort she liked him extremely she felt in him the living force of something to which when she made up her girlish mind that a needy nobleman was the ripest fruit of time she had done too scant justice they went through the little gate in the gardenwall and approached the house on the terrace madame clairin was entertaining a frienda little elderly gentleman with a white moustache and an order in his buttonhole madame de mauves chose to pass round the house into the court whereupon her sisterinlaw greeting longmore with an authoritative nod lifted her eyeglass and stared at them as they went by longmore heard the little old gentleman uttering some oldfashioned epigram about la vieille galanterie francaisethen by a sudden impulse he looked at madame de mauves and wondered what she was doing in such a world she stopped before the house not asking him to come in i hope you will act on my advice and waste no more time at saintgermain  for an instant there rose to his lips some faded compliment about his time not being wasted but it expired before the simple sincerity of her look she stood there as gently serious as the angel of disinterestedness and it seemed to him he should insult her by treating her words as a bait for flattery i shall start in a day or two he answered but i wont promise you not to come back  i hope not she said simply i expect to be here a long time  i shall come and say goodbye he returnedwhich she appeared to accept with a smile as she went in  he stood a moment then walked slowly homeward by the terrace it seemed to him that to leave her thus for a gain on which she herself insisted was to know her better and admire her more but he was aware of a vague ferment of feeling which her evasion of his question half an hour before had done more to deepen than to allay in the midst of it suddenly on the great terrace of the chateau he encountered m de mauves planted there against the parapet and finishing a cigar the count who he thought he made out had an air of peculiar affability offered him his white plump hand longmore stopped he felt a sharp a sore desire to cry out to him that he had the most precious wife in the world that he ought to be ashamed of himself not to know it and that for all his grand assurance he had never looked down into the depths of her eyes richard de mauves we have seen considered he had but there was doubtless now something in this young womans eyes that had not been there five years before the two men conversed formally enough and m de mauves threw off a light bright remark or two about his visit to america his tone was not soothing to longmores excited sensibilities he seemed to have found the country a gigantic joke and his blandness went but so far as to allow that jokes on that scale are indeed inexhaustible longmore was not by habit an aggressive apologist for the seat of his origin but the counts easy diagnosis confirmed his worst estimate of french superficiality he had understood nothing felt nothing learned nothing and his critic glancing askance at his aristocratic profile declared that if the chief merit of a long pedigree was to leave one so fatuously stupid he thanked goodness the longmores had emerged from obscurity in the present century and in the person of an enterprising timbermerchant m de mauves dwelt of course on that prime oddity of the american orderthe liberty allowed the fairer half of the unmarried young and confessed to some personal study of the occasions it offered to the speculative visitor a line of research in which during a fortnights stay he had clearly spent his most agreeable hours im bound to admit he said that in every case i was disarmed by the extreme candour of the young lady and that they took care of themselves to better purpose than i have seen some mammas in france take care of them longmore greeted this handsome concession with the grimmest of smiles and damned his impertinent patronage  mentioning however at last that he was about to leave saintgermain he was surprised without exactly being flattered by his interlocutors quickened attention im so very sorry i hoped we had you for the whole summer longmore murmured something civil and wondered why m de mauves should care whether he stayed or went youve been a real resource to madame de mauves the count added i assure you ive mentally blessed your visits  they were a great pleasure to me longmore said gravely some day i expect to come back  pray doand the count made a great and friendly point of it you see the confidence i have in you longmore said nothing and m de mauves puffed his cigar reflectively and watched the smoke madame de mauves he said at last is a rather singular person and then while our young man shifted his position and wondered whether he was going to explain madame de mauves being as you are her fellow countryman this ladys husband pursued i dont mind speaking frankly shes a little overstrained the most charming woman in the world as you see but a little volontaire and morbid now you see she has taken this extraordinary fancy for solitude i cant get her to go anywhere to see any one when my friends present themselves shes perfectly polite but it cures them of coming again she doesnt do herself justice and i expect every day to hear two or three of them say to me your wifes jolie a croquer what a pity she hasnt a little esprit you must have found out that she has really a great deal but to tell the whole truth what she needs is to forget herself she sits alone for hours poring over her english books and looking at life through that terrible brown fog they seem to medont theyto fling over the world i doubt if your english authors the count went on with a serenity which longmore afterwards characterised as sublime are very sound reading for young married women i dont pretend to know much about them but i remember that not long after our marriage madame de mauves undertook to read me one day some passages from a certain wordswortha poet highly esteemed it appears chez vous it was as if she had taken me by the nape of the neck and held my head for half an hour over a basin of soupe aux choux i felt as if we ought to ventilate the drawingroom before any one called but i suppose you know himce geniela every nation has its own ideals of every kind but when i remember some of our charming writers i think at all events my wife never forgave me and that it was a real shock to her to find she had married a man who had very much the same taste in literature as in cookery but youre a man of general culture a man of the world said m de mauves turning to longmore but looking hard at the seal of his watchguard you can talk about everything and im sure you like alfred de musset as well as monsieur wordsworth talk to her about everything you can alfred de musset included bah i forgot youre going come back then as soon as possible and report on your travels if my wife too would make a little voyage it would do her great good it would enlarge her horizonand m de mauves made a series of short nervous jerks with his stick in the airit would wake up her imagination shes too much of one piece you knowit would show her how much one may bend without breaking he paused a moment and gave two or three vigorous puffs then turning to his companion again with eyebrows expressively raised i hope you admire my candour i beg you to believe i wouldnt say such things to one of us  evening was at hand and the lingering light seemed to charge the air with faintly golden motes longmore stood gazing at these luminous particles he could almost have fancied them a swarm of humming insects the chorus of a refrain she has a great deal of espritshe has a great deal of esprit yesshe has a great deal he said mechanically turning to the count m de mauves glanced at him sharply as if to ask what the deuce he was talking about she has a great deal of intelligence said longmore quietly a great deal of beauty a great many virtues  m de mauves busied himself for a moment in lighting another cigar and when he had finished with a return of his confidential smile i suspect you of thinking that i dont do my wife justice he made answer take caretake care young man thats a dangerous assumption in general a man always does his wife justice more than justice the count laughedthat we keep for the wives of other men  longmore afterwards remembered in favour of his friends fine manner that he had not measured at this moment the dusky abyss over which it hovered hut a deepening subterranean echo loudest at the last lingered on his spiritual ear for the present his keenest sensation was a desire to get away and cry aloud that m de mauves was no better than a pompous dunce he bade him an abrupt goodnight which was to serve also he said as goodbye  decidedly then you go it was spoken almost with the note of irritation  decidedly  but of course youll come and take leave his manner implied that the omission would be uncivil but there seemed to longmore himself something so ludicrous in his taking a lesson in consideration from m de mauves that he put the appeal by with a laugh the count frowned as if it were a new and unpleasant sensation for him to be left at a loss ah you people have your facons he murmured as longmore turned away not foreseeing that he should learn still more about his facons before he had done with him  longmore sat down to dinner at his hotel with his usual good intentions but in the act of lifting his first glass of wine to his lips he suddenly fell to musing and set down the liquor untasted this mood lasted long and when he emerged from it his fish was cold but that mattered little for his appetite was gone that evening he packed his trunk with an indignant energy this was so effective that the operation was accomplished before bedtime and as he was not in the least sleepy he devoted the interval to writing two letters one of them a short note to madame de mauves which he entrusted to a servant for delivery the next morning he had found it best he said to leave saintgermain immediately but he expected to return to paris early in the autumn the other letter was the result of his having remembered a day or two before that he had not yet complied with mrs drapers injunction to give her an account of his impression of her friend the present occasion seemed propitious and he wrote half a dozen pages his tone however was grave and mrs draper on reading him over was slightly disappointedshe would have preferred he should have raved a little more but what chiefly concerns us is the concluding passage  the only time she ever spoke to me of her marriage he wrote she intimated that it had been a perfect lovematch with all abatements i suppose this is what most marriages take themselves to be but it would mean in her case i think more than in that of most women for her love was an absolute idealisation she believed her husband to be a hero of rosecoloured romance and he turns out to be not even a hero of very sadcoloured reality for some time now she has been sounding her mistake but i dont believe she has yet touched the bottom she strikes me as a person whos begging off from full knowledgewho has patched up a peace with some painful truth and is trying a while the experiment of living with closed eyes in the dark she tries to see again the gilding on her idol illusion of course is illusion and one must always pay for it but theres something truly tragical in seeing an earthly penalty levied on such divine folly as this as for m de mauves hes a shallow frenchman to his fingers ends and i confess i should dislike him for this if he were a much better man he cant forgive his wife for having married him too extravagantly and loved him too well since he feels i suppose in some uncorrupted corner of his being that as she originally saw him so he ought to have been it disagrees with him somewhere that a little american bourgeoise should have fancied him a finer fellow than he is or than he at all wants to be he hasnt a glimmering of real acquaintance with his wife he cant understand the stream of passion flowing so clear and still to tell the truth i hardly understand it myself but when i see the sight i find i greatly admire it the count at any rate would have enjoyed the comfort of believing his wife as bad a case as himself and youll hardly believe me when i assure you he goes about intimating to gentlemen whom he thinks it may concern that it would be a convenience to him they should make love to madame de mauves     v  on reaching paris longmore straightaway purchased a murrays belgium to help himself to believe that he would start on the morrow for brussels but when the morrow came it occurred to him that he ought by way of preparation to acquaint himself more intimately with the flemish painters in the louvre this took a whole morning but it did little to hasten his departure he had abruptly left saintgermain because it seemed to him that respect for madame de mauves required he should bequeath her husband no reason to suppose he had as it were taken a low hint but now that he had deferred to that scruple he found himself thinking more and more ardently of his friend it was a poor expression of ardour to be lingering irresolutely on the forsaken boulevard but he detested the idea of leaving saintgermain five hundred miles behind him he felt very foolish nevertheless and wandered about nervously promising himself to take the next train a dozen trains started however and he was still in paris this inward ache was more than he had bargained for and as he looked at the shopwindows he wondered if it represented a passion he had never been fond of the word and had grown up with much mistrust of what it stood for he had hoped that when he should fall really in love he should do it with an excellent conscience with plenty of confidence and joy doubtless but no strange soreness no pangs nor regrets here was a sentiment concocted of pity and anger as well as of admiration and bristling with scruples and doubts and fears he had come abroad to enjoy the flemish painters and all others but what fairtressed saint of van eyck or memling was so interesting a figure as the lonely lady of saintgermain his restless steps carried him at last out of the long villabordered avenue which leads to the bois de boulogne  summer had fairly begun and the drive beside the lake was empty but there were various loungers on the benches and chairs and the great cafe had an air of animation longmores walk had given him an appetite and he went into the establishment and demanded a dinner remarking for the hundredth time as he admired the smart little tables disposed in the open air how much better than anywhere else they ordered this matter in france will monsieur dine in the garden or in the salon the waiter blandly asked longmore chose the garden and observing that a great cluster of june roses was trained over the wall of the house placed himself at a table near by where the best of dinners was served him on the whitest of linen and in the most shining of porcelain it so happened that his table was near a window and that as he sat he could look into a corner of the salon so it was that his attention rested on a lady seated just within the window which was open face to face apparently with a companion who was concealed by the curtain she was a very pretty woman and longmore looked at her as often as was consistent with good manners after a while he even began to wonder who she was and finally to suspect that she was one of those ladies whom it is no breach of good manners to look at as often as you like our young man too if he had been so disposed would have been the more free to give her all his attention that her own was fixed upon the person facing her she was what the french call a belle brune and though longmore who had rather a conservative taste in such matters was but halfcharmed by her bold outlines and even braver complexion he couldnt help admiring her expression of basking contentment  she was evidently very happy and her happiness gave her an air of innocence the talk of her friend whoever he was abundantly suited her humour for she sat listening to him with a broad idle smile and interrupting him fitfully while she crunched her bonbons with a murmured response presumably as broad which appeared to have the effect of launching him again she drank a great deal of champagne and ate an immense number of strawberries and was plainly altogether a person with an impartial relish for strawberries champagne and what she doubtless would have called betises  they had halffinished dinner when longmore sat down and he was still in his place when they rose she had hung her bonnet on a nail above her chair and her companion passed round the table to take it down for her as he did so she bent her head to look at a winestain on her dress and in the movement exposed the greater part of the back of a very handsome neck the gentleman observed it and observed also apparently that the room beyond them was empty that he stood within eyeshot of longmore he failed to observe he stooped suddenly and imprinted a gallant kiss on the fair expanse in the author of this tribute longmore then recognised richard de mauves the lady to whom it had been rendered put on her bonnet using his flushed smile as a mirror and in a moment they passed through the garden on their way to their carriage then for the first time m de mauves became aware of his wifes young friend he measured with a rapid glance this spectators relation to the open window and checked himself in the impulse to stop and speak to him he contented himself with bowing all imperturbably as he opened the gate for his companion  that evening longmore made a railway journey but not to brussels he had effectually ceased to care for brussels all he cared for in the world now was madame de mauves the air of his mind had had a sudden clearingup pity and anger were still throbbing there but they had space to range at their pleasure for doubts and scruples had abruptly departed it was little he felt that he could interpose between her resignation and the indignity of her position but that little if it involved the sacrifice of everything that bound him to the tranquil past he could offer her with a rapture which at last made stiff resistance a terribly inferior substitute for faith nothing in his tranquil past had given such a zest to consciousness as this happy sense of choosing to go straight back to saintgermain how to justify his return how to explain his ardour troubled him little he wasnt even sure he wished to be understood he wished only to show how little by any fault of his madame de mauves was alone so with the harshness of fate he was conscious of no distinct desire to make love to her if he could have uttered the essence of his longing he would have said that he wished her to remember that in a world coloured grey to her vision by the sense of her mistake there was one vividly honest man she might certainly have remembered it however without his coming back to remind her and it is not to be denied that as he waited for the morrow he longed immensely for the sound of her voice  he waited the next day till his usual hour of callingthe late afternoon but he learned at the door that the mistress of the house was not at home the servant offered the information that she was walking a little way in the forest longmore went through the garden and out of the small door into the lane and after half an hours vain exploration saw her coming toward him at the end of a green bypath as he appeared she stopped a moment as if to turn aside then recognising him she slowly advanced and had presently taken the hand he held out  nothing has happened she said with her beautiful eyes on him youre not ill  nothing except that when i got to paris i found how fond i had grown of saintgermain  she neither smiled nor looked flattered it seemed indeed to longmore that she took his reappearance with no pleasure but he was uncertain for he immediately noted that in his absence the whole character of her face had changed it showed him something momentous had happened it was no longer selfcontained melancholy that he read in her eyes but grief and agitation which had lately struggled with the passionate love of peace ruling her before all things else and forced her to know that deep experience is never peaceful she was pale and had evidently been shedding tears he felt his heart beat hardhe seemed now to touch her secret she continued to look at him with a clouded brow as if his return had surrounded her with complications too great to be disguised by a colourless welcome for some moments as he turned and walked beside her neither spoke then abruptly tell me truly mr longmore she said why youve come back he inclined himself to her almost pulling up again with an air that startled her into a certainty of what she had feared because ive learned the real answer to the question i asked you the other day youre not happyyoure too good to be happy on the terms offered you madame de mauves he went on with a gesture which protested against a gesture of her own i cant be happy you know when youre as little so as i make you out i dont care for anything so long as i only feel helpless and sore about you i found during those dreary days in paris that the thing in life i most care for is this daily privilege of seeing you i know its very brutal to tell you i admire you its an insult to you to treat you as if you had complained to me or appealed to me but such a friendship as i waked up to thereand he tossed his head toward the distant cityis a potent force i assure you when forces are stupidly stifled they explode however he went on if you had told me every trouble in your heart it would have mattered little i couldnt say more than ithat if that in life from which youve hoped most has given you least this devoted respect of mine will refuse no service and betray no trust  she had begun to make marks in the earth with the point of her parasol but she stopped and listened to him in perfect immobilityimmobility save for the appearance by the time he had stopped speaking of a flush in her guarded clearness such as it was it told longmore she was moved and his first perceiving it was the happiest moment of his life she raised her eyes at last and they uttered a plea for noninsistence that unspeakably touched him  thank youthank you she said calmly enough but the next moment her own emotion baffled this pretence a convulsion shook her for ten seconds and she burst into tears her tears vanished as quickly as they came but they did longmore a world of good he had always felt indefinably afraid of her her being had somehow seemed fed by a deeper faith and a stronger will than his own but her halfdozen smothered sobs showed him the bottom of her heart and convinced him she was weak enough to be grateful excuse me she said im too nervous to listen to you i believe i could have dealt with an enemy today but i cant bear up under a friend  youre killing yourself with stoicismthats what is the matter with you he cried listen to a friend for his own sake if not for yours ive never presumed to offer you an atom of compassion and you cant accuse yourself of an abuse of charity  she looked about her as under the constraint of this appeal but it promised him a reluctant attention noting however by the wayside the fallen log on which they had rested a few evenings before she went and sat down on it with a resigned grace while the young man silent before her and watching her took from her the mute assurance that if she was charitable now he must at least be very wise  something came to my knowledge yesterday he said as he sat down beside her which gave me an intense impression of your loneliness youre truth itself and theres no truth about you you believe in purity and duty and dignity and you live in a world in which theyre daily belied i ask myself with vain rage how you ever came into such a world and why the perversity of fate never let me know you before  she waited a little she looked down straight before her i like my world no better than you do and it was not for its own sake i came into it but what particular group of people is worth pinning ones faith upon i confess it sometimes seems to me men and women are very poor creatures i suppose im too romantic and always was ive an unfortunate taste for poetic fitness lifes hard prose and one must learn to read prose contentedly i believe i once supposed all the prose to be in america which was very foolish what i thought what i believed what i expected when i was an ignorant girl fatally addicted to falling in love with my own theories is more than i can begin to tell you now sometimes when i remember certain impulses certain illusions of those days they take away my breath and i wonder that my false point of view hasnt led me into troubles greater than any ive now to lament i had a conviction which youd probably smile at if i were to attempt to express it to you it was a singular form for passionate faith to take but it had all of the sweetness and the ardour of passionate faith it led me to take a great step and it lies behind me now far off a vague deceptive form melting in the light of experience it has faded but it hasnt vanished some feelings im sure die only with ourselves some illusions are as much the condition of our life as our heartbeats they say that life itself is an illusionthat this world is a shadow of which the reality is yet to come life is all of a piece then and theres no shame in being miserably human as for my loneliness it doesnt greatly matter it is the fault in part of my obstinacy there have been times when ive been frantically distressed and to tell you the truth wretchedly homesick because my maida jewel of a maidlied to me with every second breath there have been moments when ive wished i was the daughter of a poor new england ministerliving in a little white house under a couple of elms and doing all the housework  she had begun to speak slowly with reserve and effort but she went on quickly and as if talk were at last a relief my marriage introduced me to people and things which seemed to me at first very strange and then very horrible and then to tell the truth of very little importance at first i expended a great deal of sorrow and dismay and pity on it all but there soon came a time when i began to wonder if it were worth ones tears if i could tell you the eternal friendships ive seen broken the inconsolable woes consoled the jealousies and vanities scrambling to outdo each other youd agree with me that tempers like yours and mine can understand neither such troubles nor such compensations a year ago while i was in the country a friend of mine was in despair at the infidelity of her husband she wrote me a most dolorous letter and on my return to paris i went immediately to see her a week had elapsed and as i had seen stranger things i thought she might have recovered her spirits not at all she was still in despairbut at what at the conduct the abandoned shameless conduct ofwell of a lady ill call madame de t youll imagine of course that madame de t was the lady whom my friends husband preferred to his wife far from it he had never seen her who then was madame de t madame de t was cruelly devoted to m de v and who was m de v m de v waswell in two words again my friend was cultivating two jealousies at once i hardly know what i said to her something at any rate that she found unpardonable for she quite gave me up shortly afterwards my husband proposed we should cease to live in paris and i gladly assented for i believe i had taken a turn of spirits that made me a detestable companion i should have preferred to go quite into the country into auvergne where my husband has a house but to him paris in some degree is necessary and saintgermain has been a conscious compromise  a conscious compromise longmore expressively repeated thats your whole life  its the life of many people she made prompt answerof most people of quiet tastes and its certainly better than acute distress ones at a loss theoretically to defend compromises but if i found a poor creature who had managed to arrive at one i should think myself not urgently called to expose its weak side but she had no sooner uttered these words than she laughed all amicably as if to mitigate their too personal application  heaven forbid one should do that unless one has something better to offer longmore returned and yet im haunted by the dream of a life in which you should have found no compromises for theyre a perversion of natures that tend only to goodness and rectitude as i see it you should have found happiness serene profound complete a femme de chambre not a jewel perhaps but warranted to tell but one fib a day a society possibly rather provincial butin spite of your poor opinion of mankinda good deal of solid virtue jealousies and vanities very tame and no particular iniquities and adulteries a husband he added after a momenta husband of your own faith and race and spiritual substance who would have loved you well  she rose to her feet shaking her head youre very kind to go to the expense of such dazzling visions for me visions are vain things we must make the best of the reality we happen to be in for  and yet said longmore provoked by what seemed the very wantonness of her patience the reality you happen to be in for has if im not in error very recently taken a shape that keenly tests your philosophy  she seemed on the point of replying that his sympathy was too zealous but a couple of impatient tears in his eyes proved it founded on a devotion of which she mightnt make light ah philosophy she echoed i have none thank heaven she cried with vehemence i have none i believe mr longmore she added in a moment that ive nothing on earth but a conscienceits a good time to tell you sonothing but a dogged obstinate clinging conscience does that prove me to be indeed of your faith and race and have you one yourself for which you can say as much i dont speak in vanity for i believe that if my conscience may prevent me from doing anything very base it will effectually prevent me also from doing anything very fine  im delighted to hear it her friend returned with high emphasisthat proves were made for each other its very certain i too shall never cut a great romantic figure and yet ive fancied that in my case the unaccommodating organ we speak of might be blinded and gagged a while in a really good cause if not turned out of doors in yours he went on with the same appealing irony is it absolutely beyond being squared  but she made no concession to his tone dont laugh at your conscience she answered gravely thats the only blasphemy i know  she had hardly spoken when she turned suddenly at an unexpected sound and at the same moment he heard a footstep in an adjacent bypath which crossed their own at a short distance from where they stood  its m de mauves she said at once with which she moved slowly forward longmore wondering how she knew without seeing had overtaken her by the time her husband came into view a solitary walk in the forest was a pastime to which m de mauves was not addicted but he seemed on this occasion to have resorted to it with some equanimity he was smoking a fragrant cigar and had thrust his thumb into the armhole of his waistcoat with the air of a man thinking at his ease he stopped short with surprise on seeing his wife and her companion and his surprise had for longmore even the pitch of impertinence he glanced rapidly from one to the other fixed the young mans own look sharply a single instant and then lifted his hat with formal politeness  i was not aware he said turning to madame de mauves that i might congratulate you on the return of monsieur  you should at once have known it she immediately answered if i had expected such a pleasure  she had turned very pale and longmore felt this to be a first meeting after some commotion my return was unexpected to myself he said to her husband i came back last night  m de mauves seemed to express such satisfaction as could consort with a limited interest its needless for me to make you welcome madame de mauves knows the duties of hospitality and with another bow he continued his walk  she pursued her homeward course with her friend neither of them pretending much not to consent to appear silent the counts few moments with them had both chilled longmore and angered him casting a shadow across a prospect which had somehow just before begun to open and almost to brighten he watched his companion narrowly as they went and wondered what she had last had to suffer her husbands presence had checked her disposition to talk though nothing betrayed she had recognised his making a point at her expense yet if matters were none the less plainly at a crisis between them he could but wonder vainly what it was on her part that prevented some practical protest or some rupture what did she suspecthow much did she know to what was she resignedhow much had she forgiven how above all did she reconcile with knowledge or with suspicion that intense consideration she had just now all but assured him she entertained she has loved him once longmore said with a sinking of the heart and with her to love once is to commit herself for ever her clever husband thinks her too prim what would a stupid poet call it he relapsed with aching impotence into the sense of her being somehow beyond him unattainable immeasurable by his own fretful logic suddenly he gave three passionate switches in the air with his cane which made madame de mauves look round she could hardly have guessed their signifying that where ambition was so vain the next best thing to it was the very ardour of hopelessness  she found in her drawingroom the little elderly frenchman m de chalumeau whom longmore had observed a few days before on the terrace on this occasion too madame clairin was entertaining him but as her sisterinlaw came in she surrendered her post and addressed herself to our hero longmore at thirty was still an ingenuous youth and there was something in this ladys large assured attack that fairly intimidated him he was doubtless not as reassured as he ought to have been at finding he had not absolutely forfeited her favour by his want of resource during their last interview and a suspicion of her being prepared to approach him on another line completed his distress  so youve returned from brussels by way of the forest she archly asked  ive not been to brussels i returned yesterday from paris by the only wayby the train  madame clairin was infinitely struck ive never known a person at all to be so fond of saintgermain they generally declare its horribly dull  thats not very polite to you said longmore vexed at his lack of superior form and determined not to be abashed  ah what have i to do with it madame clairin brightly wailed im the dullest thing here theyve not had other gentlemen your success with my sisterinlaw  it would have been very easy to have it madame de mauves is kindness itself  she swung open her great fan to her own countrymen  longmore remained silent he hated the tone of this conversation  the speaker looked at him a little and then took in their hostess to whom m de chalumeau was serving up another epigram which the charming creature received with a droop of the head and eyes that strayed through the window dont pretend to tell me madame clairin suddenly exhaled that youre not in love with that pretty woman  allons donc cried longmore in the most inspired french he had ever uttered he rose the next minute and took a hasty farewell     vi  he allowed several days to pass without going back it was of a sublime suitability to appear to regard his friends frankness during their last interview as a general invitation the sacrifice cost him a great effort for hopeless passions are exactly not the most patient and he had moreover a constant fear that if as he believed deep within the circle round which he could only hover the hour of supreme explanations had come the magic of her magnanimity might convert m de mauves vicious men it was abundantly recorded had been so converted as to be acceptable to god and the something divine in this ladys composition would sanctify any means she should choose to employ her means he kept repeating were no business of his and the essence of his admiration ought to be to allow her to do as she liked but he felt as if he should turn away into a world out of which most of the joy had departed if she should like after all to see nothing more in his interest in her than might be repaid by mere current social coin  when at last he went back he found to his vexation that he was to run the gauntlet of madame clairins officious hospitality it was one of the first mornings of perfect summer and the drawingroom through the open windows was flooded with such a confusion of odours and birdnotes as might warrant the hope that madame de mauves would renew with him for an hour or two the exploration of the forest her sisterinlaw however whose hair was not yet dressed emerged like a brassy discord in a maze of melody at the same moment the servant returned with his mistresss regrets she begged to be excused she was indisposed and unable to see mr longmore the young man knew just how disappointed he looked and just what madame clairin thought of it and this consciousness determined in him an attitude of almost aggressive frigidity this was apparently what she desired she wished to throw him off his balance and if she was not mistaken knew exactly how  put down your hat mr longmore she said and be polite for once you were not at all polite the other day when i asked you that friendly question about the state of your heart  i have no heartto talk about he returned with as little grace  as well say youve none at all i advise you to cultivate a little eloquence you may have use for it that was not an idle question of mine i dont ask idle questions for a couple of months now that youve been coming and going among us it seems to me youve had very few to answer of any sort  ive certainly been very well treated he still dryly allowed  his companion waited ever so little to bring out have you never felt disposed to ask any  her look her tone were so charged with insidious meanings as to make him feel that even to understand her would savour of dishonest complicity what is it you have to tell me he cried with a flushed frown  her own colour rose at the question its rather hard when you come bearing yourself very much as the sibyl when she came to the roman king to be treated as something worse than a vulgar gossip i might tell you monsieur she returned that youve as bad a ton as any young man i ever met where have you livedwhat are your ideas a stupid one of my ownpossiblyhas been to call your attention to a fact that it takes some delicacy to touch upon youve noticed i suppose that my sisterinlaw isnt the happiest woman in the world  ohlongmore made short work of it  she seemed to measure his intelligence a little uncertainly youve formed i suppose she nevertheless continued your conception of the grounds of her discontent  it hasnt required much forming the groundsor at least a specimen or two of themhave simply stared me in the face  madame clairin considered a moment with her eyes on him yesces chosesla se voient my brother in a single word has the deplorable habit of falling in love with other women i dont judge him i dont judge my sisterinlaw i only permit myself to say that in her position i would have managed otherwise id either have kept my husbands affection or id have frankly done without it but my sisters an odd compound i dont profess to understand her therefore it is in a measure that i appeal to you her fellow countryman of course youll be surprised at my way of looking at the matter and i admit that its a way in use only among people whose historythat of a racehas cultivated in them the sense for high political solutions she paused and longmore wondered where the history of her race was going to lead her but she clearly saw her course there has never been a galant homme among us i fear who has not given his wife even when she was very charming the right to be jealous we know our history for ages back and the facts established its not a very edifying one if you like but its something to have scandals with pedigreesif you cant have them with attenuations our men have been frenchmen of france and their wivesi may say ithave been of no meaner blood you may see all their portraits at our poor charming old houseevery one of them an injured beauty but not one of them hanging her head not one of them ever had the bad taste to be jealous and yet not one in a dozen ever consented to an indiscretionallowed herself i mean to be talked about voila comme elles ont su sarranger how they did itgo and look at the dusky faded canvases and pastels and ask they were dear brave women of wit when they had a headache they put on a little rouge and came to supper as usual and when they had a heartache they touched up that quarter with just such another brush these are great traditions and charming precedents i hold and it doesnt seem to me fair that a little american bourgeoise should come in and pretend to alter themall to hang her modern photograph and her obstinate little air penche in the gallery of our shrewd greatgrandmothers she should fall into line she should keep up the tone when she married my brother i dont suppose she took him for a member of a societe de bonnes oeuvres i dont say were right who is right but we are as history has made us and if any ones to change it had better be our charming but not accommodating friend again madame clairin paused again she opened and closed her great modern fan which clattered like the screen of a shopwindow let her keep up the tone she prodigiously repeated  longmore felt himself gape but he gasped an ah to cover it madame clairins dip into the family annals had apparently imparted an honest zeal to her indignation for a long time she continued my bellesoeur has been taking the attitude of an injured woman affecting a disgust with the world and shutting herself up to read freethinking books ive never permitted myself you may believe the least observation on her conduct but i cant accept it as the last word either of taste or of tact when a woman with her prettiness lets her husband stray away she deserves no small part of her fate i dont wish you to agree with meon the contrary but i call such a woman a pure noodle she must have bored him to death what has passed between them for many months neednt concern us what provocation my sister has hadmonstrous if you wishwhat ennui my brother has suffered its enough that a week ago just after you had ostensibly gone to brussels something happened to produce an explosion she found a letter in his pocket a photograph a trinket que saisje at any rate there was a grand scene i didnt listen at the keyhole and i dont know what was said but ive reason to believe that my poor brother was hauled over the coals as i fancy none of his ancestors have ever beeneven by angry ladies who werent their wives  longmore had leaned forward in silent attention with his elbows on his knees and now impulsively he dropped his face into his hands ah poor poor woman  voila said madame clairin you pity her  pity her cried longmore looking up with ardent eyes and forgetting the spirit of the story to which he had been treated in the miserable facts dont you  a little but im not acting sentimentallyim acting scientifically weve always been capable of ideas i want to arrange things to see my brother free to do as he chooses to see his wife contented do you understand me  very well i think the young man said youre the most immoral person ive lately had the privilege of conversing with  madame clairin took it calmly possibly when was ever a great peacemaker not immoral  ah no longmore protested youre too superficial to be a great peacemaker you dont begin to know anything about madame de mauves  she inclined her head to one side while her fine eyes kept her visitor in view she mused a moment and then smiled as with a certain compassionate patience its not in my interest to contradict you  it would be in your interest to learn madam he resolutely returned what honest men most admire in a womanand to recognise it when you see it  she was wonderfulshe waited a moment so you are in love she then effectively brought out  for a moment he thought of getting up but he decided to stay i wonder if youd understand me he said at last if i were to tell you that i have for madame de mauves the most devoted and most respectful friendship  you underrate my intelligence but in that case you ought to exert your influence to put an end to these painful domestic scenes  do you imagine she talks to me about her domestic scenes longmore cried  his companion stared then your friendship isnt returned and as he but ambiguously threw up his hands now at least she added shell have something to tell you i happen to know the upshot of my brothers last interview with his wife longmore rose to his feet as a protest against the indelicacy of the position into which he had been drawn but all that made him tender made him curious and she caught in his averted eyes an expression that prompted her to strike her blow my brothers absurdly entangled with a certain person in paris of course he ought not to be but he wouldnt be my brother if he werent it was this irregular passion that dictated his words listen to me madam he cried at last let us live like people who understand life its unpleasant to be forced to say such things outright but youve a way of bringing one down to the rudiments im faithless im heartless im brutal im everything horribleits understood take your revenge console yourself youre too charming a woman to have anything to complain of heres a handsome young man sighing himself into a consumption for you listen to your poor compatriot and youll find that virtues none the less becoming for being goodnatured youll see that its not after all such a doleful world and that theres even an advantage in having the most impudent of husbands madame clairin paused longmore had turned very pale you may believe it she amazingly pursued the speech took place in my presence things were done in order and now monsieurthis with a wondrous strained grimace which he was too troubled at the moment to appreciate but which he remembered later with a kind of awewe count on you  her husband said this to her face to face as you say it to me now he asked after a silence  word for word and with the most perfect politeness  and madame de mauveswhat did she say  madame clairin smiled again to such a speech as that a woman saysnothing she had been sitting with a piece of needlework and i think she hadnt seen richard since their quarrel the day before he came in with the gravity of an ambassador and im sure that when he made his demande en mariage his manner wasnt more respectful he only wanted white gloves said longmores friend my bellesoeur sat silent a few moments drawing her stitches and then without a word without a glance walked out of the room it was just what she should have done  yes the young man repeated it was just what she should have done  and i left alone with my brother do you know what i said  longmore shook his head  mauvals sujet he suggested  youve done me the honour i said to take this step in my presence i dont pretend to qualify it you know what youre about and its your own affair but you may confide in my discretion do you think he has had reason to complain of it she received no answer her visitor had slowly averted himself he passed his gloves mechanically round the band of his hat i hope she cried youre not going to start for brussels  plainly he was much disturbed and madame clairin might congratulate herself on the success of her plea for oldfashioned manners and yet there was something that left her more puzzled than satisfied in the colourless tone with which he answered no i shall remain here for the present the processes of his mind were unsociably private and she could have fancied for a moment that he was linked with their difficult friend in some monstrous conspiracy of asceticism  come this evening she nevertheless bravely resumed the rest will take care of itself meanwhile i shall take the liberty of telling my sisterinlaw that ive repeatedin short that ive put you au fait  he had a start but he controlled himself speaking quietly enough tell her what you please nothing you can tell her will affect her conduct  voyons do you mean to tell me that a woman young pretty sentimental neglected wronged if you will i see you dont believe it believe simply in your own opportunity she went on but for heavens sake if it is to lead anywhere dont come back with that visage de croquemort you look as if you were going to bury your heartnot to offer it to a pretty woman youre much better when you smileyoure very nice then come do yourself justice  he remained a moment face to face with her but his expression didnt change i shall do myself justice he however after an instant made answer and abruptly with a bow he took his departure     vii  he felt when he found himself unobserved and outside that he must plunge into violent action walk fast and far and defer the opportunity for thought he strode away into the forest swinging his cane throwing back his head casting his eyes into verdurous vistas and following the road without a purpose he felt immensely excited but could have given no straight name to his agitation it was a joy as all increase of freedom is joyous something seemed to have been cleared out of his path and his destiny to have rounded a cape and brought him into sight of an open sea but it was a pain in the degree in which his freedom somehow resolved itself into the need of despising all mankind with a single exception and the fact that madame de mauves inhabited a planet contaminated by the presence of the baser multitude kept elation from seeming a pledge of ideal bliss  there she was at any rate and circumstances now forced them to be intimate she had ceased to have what men call a secret for him and this fact itself brought with it a sort of rapture he had no prevision that he should profit in the vulgar sense by the extraordinary position into which they had been thrown it might be but a cruel trick of destiny to make hope a harsher mockery and renunciation a keener suffering but above all this rose the conviction that she could do nothing that wouldnt quicken his attachment it was this conviction that gross accidentall odious in itselfwould force the beauty of her character into more perfect relief for him that made him stride along as if he were celebrating a spiritual feast he rambled at hazard for a couple of hours finding at last that he had left the forest behind him and had wandered into an unfamiliar region it was a perfectly rural scene and the still summer day gave it a charm for which its meagre elements but half accounted  he thought he had never seen anything so characteristically french all the french novels seemed to have described it all the french landscapists to have painted it the fields and trees were of a cool metallic green the grass looked as if it might stain his trousers and the foliage his hands the clear light had a mild greyness the sheen of silver not of gold was in the workaday sun a great redroofed highstacked farmhouse with whitewashed walls and a straggling yard surveyed the highroad on one side from behind a transparent curtain of poplars a narrow stream halfchoked with emerald rushes and edged with grey aspens occupied the opposite quarter the meadows rolled and sloped away gently to the low horizon which was barely concealed by the continuous line of clipped and marshalled trees the prospect was not rich but had a frank homeliness that touched the young mans fancy it was full of light atmosphere and diffused clearness and if it was prosaic it was somehow sociable  longmore was disposed to walk further and he advanced along the road beneath the poplars in twenty minutes he came to a village which straggled away to the right among orchards and potagers on the left at a stones throw from the road stood a little pinkfaced inn which reminded him that he had not breakfasted having left home with a prevision of hospitality from madame de mauves in the inn he found a bricktiled parlour and a hostess in sabots and a white cap whom over the omelette she speedily served himborrowing licence from the bottle of sound red wine that accompanied ithe assured she was a true artist to reward his compliment she invited him to smoke his cigar in her little garden behind the house  here he found a tonnelle and a view of tinted crops stretching down to the stream the tonnelle was rather close and he preferred to lounge on a bench against the pink wall in the sun which was not too hot here as he rested and gazed and mused he fell into a train of thought which in an indefinable fashion was a soft influence from the scene about him his heart which had been beating fast for the past three hours gradually checked its pulses and left him looking at life with rather a more level gaze the friendly tavern sounds coming out through the open windows the sunny stillness of the yellowing grain which covered so much vigorous natural life conveyed no strained nor highpitched message had little to say about renunciationnothing at all about spiritual zeal they communicated the sense of plain ripe nature expressed the unperverted reality of things declared that the common lot isnt brilliantly amusing and that the part of wisdom is to grasp frankly at experience lest you miss it altogether what reason there was for his beginning to wonder after this whether a deeplywounded heart might be soothed and healed by such a scene it would be difficult to explain certain it was that as he sat there he dreamt awake of an unhappy woman who strolled by the slowflowing stream before him and who pulled down the fruitladen boughs in the orchards he mused and mused and at last found himself quite angry that he couldnt somehow think worse of madame de mauvesor at any rate think otherwise he could fairly claim that in the romantic way he asked very little of lifemade modest demands on passion why then should his only passion be born to ill fortune why should his firsthis lastglimpse of positive happiness be so indissolubly linked with renunciation  it is perhaps because like many spirits of the same stock he had in his composition a lurking principle of sacrifice sacrifice for sacrifices sake to the authority of which he had ever paid due deference that he now felt all the vehemence of rebellion to renounce to renounce again to renounce for ever was this all that youth and longing and ardour were meant for was experience to be muffled and mutilated like an indecent picture was a man to sit and deliberately condemn his future to be the blank memory of a regret rather than the long possession of a treasure sacrifice the word was a trap for minds muddled by fear an ignoble refuge of weakness to insist now seemed not to dare but simply to be to live on possible terms  his hostess came out to hang a moist cloth on the hedge and though her guest was sitting quietly enough she might have imagined in his kindled eyes a flattering testimony to the quality of her wine as she turned back into the house she was met by a young man of whom longmore took note in spite of his high distraction he was evidently a member of that jovial fraternity of artists whose very shabbiness has an affinity with the unestablished and unexpected in lifethe element often gazed at with a certain wistfulness out of the curtained windows even of the highest respectability longmore was struck first with his looking like a very clever man and then with his looking like a contented one the combination as it was expressed in his face might have arrested the attention of a less exasperated reasoner he had a slouched hat and a yellow beard a light easel under one arm and an unfinished sketch in oils under the other he stopped and stood talking for some moments to the landlady while something pleasant played in his face they were discussing the possibilities of dinner the hostess enumerated some very savoury ones and he nodded briskly assenting to everything it couldnt be longmore thought that he found such ideal ease in the prospect of lambchops and spinach and a croute aux fruits when the dinner had been ordered he turned up his sketch and the good woman fell to admiring and comparing to picking up off by the streamside the objects represented  was it his work longmore wondered that made him so happy was a strong talent the best thing in the world the landlady went back to her kitchen and the young painter stood as if he were waiting for something beside the gate which opened upon the path across the fields longmore sat brooding and asking himself if it werent probably better to cultivate the arts than to cultivate the passions before he had answered the question the painter had grown tired of waiting he had picked up a pebble tossed it lightly into an upper window and called familiarly claudine claudine appeared longmore heard her at the window bidding the young man cultivate patience but im losing my light he said i must have my shadows in the same place as yesterday  go without me then claudine answered ill join you in ten minutes her voice was fresh and young it represented almost aggressively to longmore that she was as pleased as her companion  dont forget the chenier cried the young man who turning away passed out of the gate and followed the path across the fields until he disappeared among the trees by the side of the stream who might claudine be longmore vaguely wondered and was she as pretty as her voice before long he had a chance to satisfy himself she came out of the house with her hat and parasol prepared to follow her companion she had on a pink muslin dress and a little white hat and she was as pretty as suffices almost any frenchwoman to be pleasing she had a clear brown skin and a bright dark eye and a step that made walking as light a matter as being blownand this even though she happened to be at the moment not a little overweighted her hands were encumbered with various articles involved in her pursuit of her friend in one arm she held her parasol and a large roll of needlework and in the other a shawl and a heavy white umbrella such as painters use for sketching meanwhile she was trying to thrust into her pocket a papercovered volume which longmore saw to be the poems of andre chenier and in the effort dropping the large umbrella and marking this with a halfsmiled exclamation of disgust longmore stepped forward and picked up the umbrella and as she protesting her gratitude put out her hand to take it he recognised her as too obliging to the young man who had preceded her  youve too much to carry he said you must let me help you  youre very good monsieur she answered my husband always forgets something he can do nothing without his umbrella he is dune etourderie  you must allow me to carry the umbrella longmore risked theres too much of it for a lady  she assented after many compliments to his politeness and he walked by her side into the meadow she went lightly and rapidly picking her steps and glancing forward to catch a glimpse of her husband she was graceful she was charming she had an air of decision and yet of accommodation and it seemed to our friend that a young artist would work none the worse for having her seated at his side reading cheniers iambics they were newly married he supposed and evidently their path of life had none of the mocking crookedness of some others they asked little but what need to ask more than such quiet summer days by a shady stream with a comrade all amiability to say nothing of art and books and a wide unmenaced horizon to spend such a morning to stroll back to dinner in the redtiled parlour of the inn to ramble away again as the sun got lowall this was a vision of delight which floated before him only to torture him with a sense of the impossible all frenchwomen were not coquettes he noted as he kept pace with his companion she uttered a word now and then for politeness sake but she never looked at him and seemed not in the least to care that he was a wellfavoured and welldressed young man she cared for nothing but the young artist in the shabby coat and the slouched hat and for discovering where he had set up his easel  this was soon done he was encamped under the trees close to the stream and in the diffused green shade of the little wood couldnt have felt immediate need of his umbrella he received a free rebuke however for forgetting it and was informed of what he owed to longmores complaisance he was duly grateful he thanked our hero warmly and offered him a seat on the grass but longmore felt himself a marplot and lingered only long enough to glance at the young mans sketch and to see in it an easy rendering of the silvery stream and the vivid green rushes the young wife had spread her shawl on the grass at the base of a tree and meant to seat herself when he had left them meant to murmur cheniers verses to the music of the gurgling river longmore looked a while from one of these lucky persons to the other barely stifled a sigh bade them goodmorning and took his departure he knew neither where to go nor what to do he seemed afloat on the sea of ineffectual longing he strolled slowly back to the inn where in the doorway he met the landlady returning from the butchers with the lambchops for the dinner of her lodgers  monsieur has made the acquaintance of the dame of our young painter she said with a free smilea smile too free for malicious meanings monsieur has perhaps seen the young mans picture it appears that hes dune jolie force  his pictures very charming said longmore but his dame is more charming still  shes a very nice little woman but i pity her all the more  i dont see why shes to be pitied longmore pleaded they seem a very happy couple  the landlady gave a knowing nod dont trust to it monsieur those artistsca na pas de principes from one day to another he can plant her there i know them allez ive had them here very often one year with one another year with another  longmore was at first puzzled then you mean shes not his wife he asked  she took it responsibly what shall i tell you theyre not des hommes serieux those gentlemen they dont engage for eternity its none of my business and ive no wish to speak ill of madame shes gentillebut gentille and she loves her jeune homme to distraction  who then is so distinguished a young woman asked longmore what do you know about her  nothing for certain but its my belief that shes better than he ive even gone so far as to believe that shes a ladya vraie dameand that she has given up a great many things for him i do the best i can for them but i dont believe she has had all her life to put up with a dinner of two courses and she turned over her lambchops tenderly as to say that though a good cook could imagine better things yet if you could have but one course lambchops had much in their favour i shall do them with breadcrumbs voila les femmes monsieur  longmore turned away with the feeling that women were indeed a measureless mystery and that it was hard to say in which of their forms of perversity there was most merit he walked back to saintgermain more slowly than he had come with less philosophic resignation to any event and more of the urgent egotism of the passion pronounced by philosophers the supremely selfish one now and then the episode of the happy young painter and the charming woman who had given up a great many things for him rose vividly in his mind and seemed to mock his moral unrest like some obtrusive vision of unattainable bliss  the landladys gossip had cast no shadow on its brightness her voice seemed that of the vulgar chorus of the uninitiated which stands always ready with its gross prose rendering of the inspired passages of human action was it possible a man could take that from a womantake all that lent lightness to that other womans footstep and grace to her surrender and not give her the absolute certainty of a devotion as unalterable as the process of the sun was it possible that so clear a harmony had the seeds of trouble that the charm of so perfect union could be broken by anything but death longmore felt an immense desire to cry out a thousand times no for it seemed to him at last that he was somehow only a graver equivalent of the young lover and that rustling claudine was a lighter sketch of madame de mauves the heat of the sun as he walked along became oppressive and when he reentered the forest he turned aside into the deepest shade he could find and stretched himself on the mossy ground at the foot of a great beech he lay for a while staring up into the verdurous dusk overhead and trying mentally to see his friend at saintgermain hurry toward some quiet streamside where he waited as he had seen that trusting creature hurry an hour before it would be hard to say how well he succeeded but the effort soothed rather than excited him and as he had had a good deal both of moral and physical fatigue he sank at last into a quiet sleep while he slept moreover he had a strange and vivid dream he seemed to be in a wood very much like the one on which his eyes had lately closed but the wood was divided by the murmuring stream he had left an hour before he was walking up and down he thought restlessly and in intense expectation of some momentous event suddenly at a distance through the trees he saw a gleam of a womans dress on which he hastened to meet her as he advanced he recognised her but he saw at the same time that she was on the other bank of the river she seemed at first not to notice him but when they had come to opposite places she stopped and looked at him very gravely and pityingly she made him no sign that he must cross the stream but he wished unutterably to stand by her side he knew the water was deep and it seemed to him he knew how he should have to breast it and how he feared that when he rose to the surface she would have disappeared nevertheless he was going to plunge when a boat turned into the current from above and came swiftly toward them guided by an oarsman who was sitting so that they couldnt see his face he brought the boat to the bank where longmore stood the latter stepped in and with a few strokes they touched the opposite shore longmore got out and though he was sure he had crossed the stream madame de mauves was not there he turned with a kind of agony and saw that now she was on the other bankthe one he had left she gave him a grave silent glance and walked away up the stream the boat and the boatman resumed their course but after going a short distance they stopped and the boatman turned back and looked at the still divided couple then longmore recognised himjust as he had recognised him a few days before at the restaurant in the bois de boulogne     viii  he must have slept some time after he ceased dreaming for he had no immediate memory of this vision it came back to him later after he had roused himself and had walked nearly home no great arrangement was needed to make it seem a striking allegory and it haunted and oppressed him for the rest of the day he took refuge however in his quickened conviction that the only sound policy in life is to grasp unsparingly at happiness and it seemed no more than one of the vigorous measures dictated by such a policy to return that evening to madame de mauves and yet when he had decided to do so and had carefully dressed himself he felt an irresistible nervous tremor which made it easier to linger at his open window wondering with a strange mixture of dread and desire whether madame clairin had repeated to her sisterinlaw what she had said to him his presence now might be simply a gratuitous annoyance and yet his absence might seem to imply that it was in the power of circumstances to make them ashamed to meet each others eyes he sat a long time with his head in his hands lost in a painful confusion of hopes and ambiguities he felt at moments as if he could throttle madame clairin and yet couldnt help asking himself if it werent possible she had done him a service it was late when he left the hotel and as he entered the gate of the other house his heart beat so fast that he was sure his voice would show it  the servant ushered him into the drawingroom which was empty and with the lamp burning low but the long windows were open and their light curtains swaying in a soft warm wind so that longmore immediately stepped out upon the terrace there he found madame de mauves alone slowly pacing its length she was dressed in white very simply and her hair was arranged not as she usually wore it but in a single loose coil and as if she were unprepared for company she stopped when she saw her friend showed some surprise uttered an exclamation and stood waiting for him to speak he tried with his eyes on her to say something but found no words he knew it was awkward it was offensive to stand gazing at her but he couldnt say what was suitable and mightnt say what he wished her face was indistinct in the dim light but he felt her eyes fixed on him and wondered what they expressed did they warn him did they plead or did they confess to a sense of provocation for an instant his head swam he was sure it would make all things clear to stride forward and fold her in his arms but a moment later he was still dumb there before her he hadnt moved he knew she had spoken but he hadnt understood  you were here this morning she continued and now slowly the meaning of her words came to him i had a bad headache and had to shut myself up she spoke with her usual voice  longmore mastered his agitation and answered her without betraying himself i hope youre better now  yes thank you im bettermuch better  he waited again and she moved away to a chair and seated herself after a pause he followed her and leaned closer to her against the balustrade of the terrace i hoped you might have been able to come out for the morning into the forest i went alone it was a lovely day and i took a long walk  it was a lovely day she said absently and sat with her eyes lowered slowly opening and closing her fan longmore as he watched her felt more and more assured her sisterinlaw had seen her since her interview with him that her attitude toward him was changed it was this same something that hampered the desire with which he had come or at least converted all his imagined freedom of speech about it to a final hush of wonder no certainly he couldnt clasp her to his arms now any more than some antique worshipper could have clasped the marble statue in his temple but longmores statue spoke at last with a full human voice and even with a shade of human hesitation she looked up and it seemed to him her eyes shone through the dusk  im very glad you came this eveningand ive a particular reason for being glad i halfexpected you and yet i thought it possible you mightnt come  as the case has been present to me longmore answered it was impossible i shouldnt come ive spent every minute of the day in thinking of you  she made no immediate reply but continued to open and close her fan thoughtfully at last ive something important to say to you she resumed with decision i want you to know to a certainty that ive a very high opinion of you longmore gave an uneasy shift to his position to what was she coming but he said nothing and she went on i take a great interest in you theres no reason why i shouldnt say it i feel a great friendship for you he began to laugh all awkwardlyhe hardly knew why unless because this seemed the very irony of detachment but she went on in her way you know i suppose that a great disappointment always implies a great confidencea great hope  ive certainly hoped he said hoped strongly but doubtless never rationally enough to have a right to bemoan my disappointment  there was something troubled in her face that seemed all the while to burn clearer you do yourself injustice ive such confidence in your fairness of mind that i should be greatly disappointed if i were to find it wanting  i really almost believe youre amusing yourself at my expense the young man cried my fairness of mind of all the questionbegging terms he laughed the only thing for ones mind to be fair to is the thing one feels  she rose to her feet and looked at him hard his eyes by this time were accustomed to the imperfect light and he could see that if she was urgent she was yet beseechingly kind she shook her head impatiently and came near enough to lay her fan on his arm with a strong pressure if that were so it would be a weary world i know enough however of your probable attitude you neednt try to express it its enough that your sincerity gives me the right to ask a favour of youto make an intense a solemn request  make it i listen  dont disappoint me if you dont understand me now you will tomorrow or very soon when i said just now that i had a high opinion of you you see i meant it very seriously she explained it wasnt a vain compliment i believe theres no appeal one may make to your generosity that can remain long unanswered if this were to happenif i were to find you selfish where i thought you generous narrow where i thought you largeand she spoke slowly her voice lingering with all emphasis on each of these wordsvulgar where i thought you rare i should think worse of human nature i should take it i assure you very hard indeed i should say to myself in the dull days of the future there was one man who might have done so and so and he too failed but this shant be youve made too good an impression on me not to make the very best if you wish to please me for ever theres a way  she was standing close to him with her dress touching him her eyes fixed on his as she went on her tone became to his sense extraordinary and she offered the odd spectacle of a beautiful woman preaching reason with the most communicative and irresistible passion longmore was dazzled but mystified and bewildered the intention of her words was all remonstrance refusal dismissal but her presence and effect there so close so urgent so personal a distracting contradiction of it she had never been so lovely in her white dress with her pale face and deeplylighted brow she seemed the very spirit of the summer night when she had ceased speaking she drew a long breath he felt it on his cheek and it stirred in his whole being a sudden perverse imagination were not her words in their high impossible rigour a mere challenge to his sincerity a mere precaution of her pride meant to throw into relief her almost ghostly beauty and wasnt this the only truth the only law the only thing to take account of  he closed his eyes and felt her watch him not without pain and perplexity herself he looked at her again met her own eyes and saw them fill with strange tears then this last sophistry of his great desire for her knew itself touched as a bubble is pricked it died away with a stifled murmur and her beauty more and more radiant in the darkness rose before him as a symbol of something vague which was yet more beautiful than itself i may understand you tomorrow he said but i dont understand you now  and yet i took counsel with myself today and asked myself how i had best speak to you on one side i might have refused to see you at all longmore made a violent movement and she added in that case i should have written to you i might see you i thought and simply say to you that there were excellent reasons why we should part and that i begged this visit should be your last this i inclined to do what made me decide otherwise waswell simply that i like you so i said to myself that i should be glad to remember in future days not that i had in the horrible phrase got rid of you but that you had gone away out of the fulness of your own wisdom and the excellence of your own taste  ah wisdom and taste the poor young man wailed  im prepared if necessary madame de mauves continued after a pause to fall back on my strict right but as i said before i shall be greatly disappointed if im obliged to do that  when i listen to your horrible and unnatural lucidity longmore answered i feel so angry so merely sore and sick that i wonder i dont leave you without more words  if you should go away in anger this idea of mine about our parting would be but halfrealised she returned with no drop in her ardour no i dont want to think of you as feeling a great pain i dont want even to think of you as making a great sacrifice i want to think of you  as a stupid brute who has never existed who never can exist he broke in a creature who could know you without loving you who could leave you without for ever missing you  she turned impatiently away and walked to the other end of the terrace when she came back he saw that her impatience had grown sharp and almost hard she stood before him again looking at him from head to foot and without consideration now so that as the effect of it he felt his assurance finally quite sink this then she took from him withholding in consequence something she had meant to say she moved off afresh walked to the other end of the terrace and stood there with her face to the garden she assumed that he understood her and slowly slowly half as the fruit of this mute pressure he let everything go but the rage of a purpose somehow still to please her she was giving him a chance to do gallantly what it seemed unworthy of both of them he should do meanly she must have liked him indeed as she said to wish so to spare him to go to the trouble of conceiving an ideal of conduct for him with this sense of her tenderness still in her dreadful consistency his spirit rose with a new flight and suddenly felt itself breathe clearer air her profession ceased to seem a mere bribe to his eagerness it was charged with eagerness itself it was a present reward and would somehow last he moved rapidly toward her as with the sense of a gage that he might sublimely yet immediately enjoy  they were separated by two thirds of the length of the terrace and he had to pass the drawingroom window as he did so he started with an exclamation madame clairin stood framed in the opening as if though just arriving on the scene she too were already aware of its interest conscious apparently that she might be suspected of having watched them she stepped forward with a smile and looked from one to the other such a teteatete as that one owes no apology for interrupting one ought to come in for good manners  madame de mauves turned to her but answered nothing she looked straight at longmore and her eyes shone with a lustre that struck him as divine he was not exactly sure indeed what she meant them to say but it translated itself to something that would do call it what you will what youve wanted to urge upon me is the thing this woman can best conceive what i ask of you is something she cant begin to they seemed somehow to beg him to suffer her to be triumphantly herself and to intimateyet this too all decentlyhow little that self was of madame clairins particular swelling measure he felt an immense answering desire not to do anything then that might seem probable or prevu to this lady he had laid his hat and stick on the parapet of the terrace he took them up offered his hand to madame de mauves with a simple goodnight bowed silently to madame clairin and found his way with tingling ears out of the place     ix  he went home and without lighting his candle flung himself on his bed but he got no sleep till morning he lay hour after hour tossing thinking wondering his mind had never been so active it seemed to him his friend had laid on him in those last moments a heavy charge and had expressed herself almost as handsomely as if she had listened complacently to an assurance of his love it was neither easy nor delightful thoroughly to understand her but little by little her perfect meaning sank into his mind and soothed it with a sense of opportunity which somehow stifled his sense of loss for to begin with she meant that she could love him in no degree or contingency in no imaginable future this was absolutehe knew he could no more alter it than he could pull down one of the constellations he lay gazing at through his open window he wondered to what it was in the background of her life she had so dedicated herself a conception of duty unquenchable to the end a love that no outrage could stifle great heaven he groaned is the world so rich in the purest pearls of passion that such tenderness as that can be wasted for everpoured away without a sigh into bottomless darkness had she in spite of the detestable present some precious memory that still kept the door of possibility open was she prepared to submit to everything and yet to believe was it strength was it weakness was it a vulgar fear was it conviction conscience constancy  longmore sank back with a sigh and an oppressive feeling that it was vain to guess at such a womans motives he only felt that those of this one were buried deep in her soul and that they must be of the noblest must contain nothing base he had his hard impression that endless constancy was all her lawa constancy that still found a foothold among crumbling ruins she has loved once he said to himself as he rose and wandered to his window and thats for ever yes yesif she loved again shed be common he stood for a long time looking out into the starlit silence of the town and forest and thinking of what life would have been if his constancy had met her own in earlier days but life was this now and he must live it was living really to stand there with such a faith even in ones self still flung over one by such hands he was not to disappoint her he was to justify a conception it had beguiled her weariness to form his imagination embraced it he threw back his head and seemed to be looking for his friends conception among the blinking mocking stars but it came to him rather on the mild nightwind wandering in over the housetops which covered the rest of so many heavy human hearts what she asked he seemed to feel her ask not for her own sakeshe feared nothing she needed nothingbut for that of his own happiness and his own character he must assent to destiny why else was he young and strong intelligent and resolute he mustnt give it to her to reproach him with thinking she had had a moments attention for his love give it to her to plead to argue to break off in bitterness he must see everything from above her indifference and his own ardour he must prove his strength must do the handsome thing must decide that the handsome thing was to submit to the inevitable to be supremely delicate to spare her all pain to stifle his passion to ask no compensation to depart without waiting and to try to believe that wisdom is its own reward all this neither more nor less it was a matter of beautiful friendship with him for her to expect of him and what should he himself gain by it he should have pleased her well he flung himself on his bed again fell asleep at last and slept till morning  before noon next day he had made up his mind to leave saintgermain at once it seemed easiest to go without seeing her and yet if he might ask for a grain of compensation this would be five minutes face to face with her he passed a restless day wherever he went he saw her stand before him in the dusky halo of evening saw her look at him with an air of still negation more intoxicating than the most passionate selfsurrender he must certainly go and yet it was hideously hard he compromised and went to paris to spend the rest of the day he strolled along the boulevard and paused sightlessly before the shops sat a while in the tuileries gardens and looked at the shabby unfortunates for whom this only was nature and summer but simply felt afresh as a result of it all the dusty dreary lonely world to which madame de mauves had consigned him  in a sombre mood he made his way back to the centre of motion and sat down at a table before a cafe door on the great plain of hot asphalt night arrived the lamps were lighted the tables near him found occupants and paris began to wear that evening grimace of hers that seems to tell in the flare of plate glass and of theatredoors the muffled rumble of swiftrolling carriages how this is no world for you unless you have your pockets lined and your delicacies perverted longmore however had neither scruples nor desires he looked at the great preoccupied place for the first time with an easy sense of repaying its indifference before long a carriage drove up to the pavement directly in front of him and remained standing for several minutes without sign from its occupant it was one of those neat plain coupes drawn by a single powerful horse in which the flaneur figures a pale handsome woman buried among silk cushions and yawning as she sees the gaslamps glittering in the gutters at last the door opened and out stepped richard de mauves he stopped and leaned on the window for some time talking in an excited manner to a person within at last he gave a nod and the carriage rolled away he stood swinging his cane and looking up and down the boulevard with the air of a man fumbling as one might say the loose change of time he turned toward the cafe and was apparently for want of anything better worth his attention about to seat himself at one of the tables when he noticed longmore he wavered an instant and then without a shade of difference in his careless gait advanced to the accompaniment of a thin recognition it was the first time they had met since their encounter in the forest after longmores false start for brussels madame clairins revelations as he might have regarded them had not made the count especially present to his mind he had had another call to meet than the call of disgust but now as m de mauves came toward him he felt abhorrence well up he made out however for the first time a cloud on this noblemans superior clearness and a delight at finding the shoe somewhere at last pinching him mingled with the resolve to be blank and unaccommodating enabled him to meet the occasion with due promptness  m de mauves sat down and the two men looked at each other across the table exchanging formal remarks that did little to lend grace to their encounter longmore had no reason to suppose the count knew of his sisters various interventions he was sure m de mauves cared very little about his opinions and yet he had a sense of something grim in his own new york face which would have made him change colour if keener suspicion had helped it to be read there m de mauves didnt change colour but he looked at his wifes so oddly so more than naturally wouldnt it be detached friend with an intentness that betrayed at once an irritating memory of the episode in the bois de boulogne and such vigilant curiosity as was natural to a gentleman who had entrusted his honour to another gentlemans magnanimityor to his artlessness  it might appear that these virtues shone out of our young man less engagingly or reassuringly than a few days before the shadow at any rate fell darker across the brow of his critic who turned away and frowned while lighting a cigar the person in the coupe he accordingly judged whether or no the same person as the heroine of the episode of the bois de boulogne was not a source of unalloyed delight longmore had dark blue eyes of admirable clarity settled truthtelling eyes which had in his childhood always made his harshest taskmasters smile at his notion of a subterfuge an observer watching the two men and knowing something of their relations would certainly have said that what he had at last both to recognise and to miss in those eyes must not a little have puzzled and tormented m de mauves they took possession of him they laid him out they measured him in that state of flatness they triumphed over him they treated him as no pair of eyes had perhaps ever treated any member of his family before the counts scheme had been to provide for a positive state of ease on the part of no one save himself but here was longmore already if appearances perhaps not appreciable to the vulgar meant anything primed as for some prospect of pleasure more than parisian was this candid young barbarian but a faux bonhomme after all he had never really quite satisfied his occasional host but was he now for a climax to leave him almost gaping  m de mauves as if hating to seem preoccupied took up the evening paper to help himself to seem indifferent as he glanced over it he threw off some perfunctory allusion to the crisisthe politicalwhich enabled longmore to reply with perfect veracity that with other things to think about he had had no attention to spare for it and yet our hero was in truth far from secure against rueful reflexion the counts ruffled state was a comfort so far as it pointed to the possibility that the lady in the coupe might be proving too many for him but it ministered to no vindictive sweetness for longmore so far as it should perhaps represent rising jealousy it passed through his mind that jealousy is a passion with a double face and that on one of its sides it may sometimes almost look generous it glimmered upon him odiously m de mauves might grow ashamed of his political compact with his wife and he felt how far more tolerable it would be in future to think of him as always impertinent than to think of him as occasionally contrite the two men pretended meanwhile for half an hour to outsit each other conveniently and the endat that ratemight have been distant had not the tension in some degree yielded to the arrival of a friend of m de mauvesa tall pale consumptivelooking dandy who filled the air with the odour of heliotrope he looked up and down the boulevard wearily examined the counts garments in some detail then appeared to refer restlessly to his own and at last announced resignedly that the duchess was in town m de mauves must come with him to call she had abused him dreadfully a couple of evenings beforea sure sign she wanted to see him i depend on you said with an infantine drawl this specimen of an order longmore felt he had never had occasion so intimately to appreciate to put her en train  m de mauves resisted he protested that he was dune humeur massacrante but at last he allowed himself to be drawn to his feet and stood looking awkwardlyawkwardly for m de mauvesat longmore youll excuse me he appeared to find some difficulty in saying you too probably have occupation for the evening  none but to catch my train and our friend looked at his watch  ah you go back to saintgermain  in half an hour  m de mauves seemed on the point of disengaging himself from his companions arm which was locked in his own but on the latters uttering some persuasive murmur he lifted his hat stiffly and turned away  longmore the next day wandered off to the terrace to try and beguile the restlessness with which he waited for the evening he wished to see madame de mauves for the last time at the hour of long shadows and pale reflected amber lights as he had almost always seen her destiny however took no account of this humble plea for poetic justice it was appointed him to meet her seated by the great walk under a tree and alone the hour made the place almost empty the day was warm but as he took his place beside her a light breeze stirred the leafy edges of their broad circle of shadow she looked at him almost with no pretence of not having believed herself already rid of him and he at once told her that he should leave saintgermain that evening but must first bid her farewell her face lighted a moment he fancied as he spoke but she said nothing only turning it off to far paris which lay twinkling and flashing through hot exhalations ive a request to make of you he added that you think of me as a man who has felt much and claimed little  she drew a long breath which almost suggested pain i cant think of you as unhappy thats impossible youve a life to lead youve duties talents inspirations interests i shall hear of your career and then she pursued after a pause though as if it had before this quite been settled between them one cant be unhappy through having a better opinion of a friend instead of a worse  for a moment he failed to understand her do you mean that there can be varying degrees in my opinion of you  she rose and pushed away her chair i mean she said quickly that its better to have done nothing in bitternessnothing in passion and she began to walk  longmore followed her without answering at first but he took off his hat and with his pockethandkerchief wiped his forehead where shall you go what shall you do he simply asked at last  do i shall do as ive always doneexcept perhaps that i shall go for a while to my husbands old home  i shall go to my old one ive done with europe for the present the young man added  she glanced at him as he walked beside her after he had spoken these words and then bent her eyes for a long time on the ground but suddenly as if aware of her going too far she stopped and put out her hand goodbye may you have all the happiness you deserve  he took her hand with his eyes on her but something was at work in him that made it impossible to deal in the easy way with her touch something of infinite value was floating past him and he had taken an oath with which any such case interfered not to raise a finger to stop it it was borne by the strong current of the worlds great life and not of his own small one madame de mauves disengaged herself gathered in her long scarf and smiled at him almost as you would do at a child you should wish to encourage several moments later he was still there watching her leave him and leave him when she was out of sight he shook himself walked at once back to his hotel and without waiting for the evening train paid his bill and departed  later in the day m de mauves came into his wifes drawingroom where she sat waiting to be summoned to dinner he had dressed as he usually didnt dress for dining at home he walked up and down for some moments in silence then rang the bell for a servant and went out into the hall to meet him he ordered the carriage to take him to the station paused a moment with his hand on the knob of the door dismissed the servant angrily as the latter lingered observing him reentered the drawingroom resumed his restless walk and at last stopped abruptly before his wife who had taken up a book may i ask the favour he said with evident effort in spite of a forced smile as of allusion to a large past exercise of the very best taste of having a question answered  its a favour i never refused she replied  very true do you expect this evening a visit from mr longmore  mr longmore said his wife has left saintgermain m de mauves waited but his smile expired mr longmore his wife continued has gone to america  m de mauves took ita rare thing for himwith confessed if momentary intellectual indigence but he raised as it were the wind has anything happened he asked had he a sudden call but his question received no answer at the same moment the servant threw open the door and announced dinner madame clairin rustled in rubbing her white hands madame de mauves passed silently into the diningroom but he remained outsideoutside of more things clearly than his mere salleamanger before long he went forth to the terrace and continued his uneasy walk at the end of a quarter of an hour the servant came to let him know that his carriage was at the door send it away he said without hesitation i shant use it when the ladies had halffinished dinner he returned and joined them with a formal apology to his wife for his inconsequence  the dishes were brought back but he hardly tasted them he drank on the other hand more wine than usual there was little talk scarcely a convivial sound save the occasional expressive appreciative mmm of madame clairin over the succulence of some dish twice this lady saw her brothers eyes fixed on her own over his wineglass put to her a question she knew she should have to irritate him later on by not being able to answer she replied for the present at least by an elevation of the eyebrows that resembled even to her own humour the vain raising of an umbrella in anticipation of a storm m de mauves was left alone to finish his wine he sat over it for more than an hour and let the darkness gather about him at last the servant came in with a letter and lighted a candle the letter was a telegram which m de mauves when he had read it burnt at the candle after five minutes meditation he wrote a message on the back of a visitingcard and gave it to the servant to carry to the office the man knew quite as much as his master suspected about the lady to whom the telegram was addressed but its contents puzzled him they consisted of the single word impossible as the evening passed without her brothers reappearing in the drawingroom madame clairin came to him where he sat by his solitary candle he took no notice of her presence for some time but this affected her as unexpected indulgence at last however he spoke with a particular harshness ce jeune mufle has gone home at an hours notice what the devil does it mean  madame clairin now felt thankful for her umbrella it means that ive a sisterinlaw whom ive not the honour to understand  he said nothing more and silently allowed her after a little to depart it had been her duty to provide him with an explanation and he was disgusted with her blankness but she wasif there was no more to comegetting off easily when she had gone he went into the garden and walked up and down with his cigar he saw his wife seated alone on the terrace but remained below wandering turning pausing lingering he remained a long time it grew late and madame de mauves disappeared toward midnight he dropped upon a bench tired with a long vague exhalation of unrest it was sinking into his spirit that he too didnt understand madame clairins sisterinlaw  longmore was obliged to wait a week in london for a ship it was very hot and he went out one day to richmond in the garden of the hotel at which he dined he met his friend mrs draper who was staying there she made eager enquiry about madame de mauves but longmore at first as they sat looking out at the famous view of the thames parried her questions and confined himself to other topics at last she said she was afraid he had something to conceal whereupon after a pause he asked her if she remembered recommending him in the letter she had addressed him at saintgermain to draw the sadness from her friends smile the last i saw of her was her smile he saidwhen i bade her goodbye  i remember urging you to console her mrs draper returned and i wondered afterwards whethermodel of discretion as you arei hadnt cut you out work for which you wouldnt thank me  she has her consolation in herself the young man said she needs none that any one else can offer her thats for troubles for whichbe it more be it lessour own folly has to answer madame de mauves hasnt a grain of folly left  ah dont say thatmrs draper knowingly protested just a little follys often very graceful  longmore rose to goshe somehow annoyed him dont talk of grace he said till youve measured her reason  for two years after his return to america he heard nothing of madame de mauves that he thought of her intently constantly i need hardly say most people wondered why such a clever young man shouldnt devote himself to something but to himself he seemed absorbingly occupied he never wrote to her he believed she wouldnt have liked it at last he heard that mrs draper had come home and he immediately called on her of course she said after the first greetings youre dying for news of madame de mauves prepare yourself for something strange i heard from her two or three times during the year after your seeing her she left saintgermain and went to live in the country on some old property of her husbands she wrote me very kind little notes but i felt somehow thatin spite of what you said about consolationthey were the notes of a wretched woman the only advice i could have given her was to leave her scamp of a husband and come back to her own land and her own people but this i didnt feel free to do and yet it made me so miserable not to be able to help her that i preferred to let our correspondence die a natural death i had no news of her for a year last summer however i met at vichy a clever young frenchman whom i accidentally learned to be a friend of that charming sister of the counts madame clairin i lost no time in asking him what he knew about madame de mauvesa countrywoman of mine and an old friend i congratulate you on the friendship of such a person he answered thats the terrible little woman who killed her husband you may imagine i promptly asked for an explanation and he told mefrom his point of viewwhat he called the whole story m de mauves had fait quelques folies which his wife had taken absurdly to heart he had repented and asked her forgiveness which she had inexorably refused she was very pretty and severity must have suited her style for whether or no her husband had been in love with her before he fell madly in love with her now he was the proudest man in france but he had begged her on his knees to be readmitted to favour all in vain she was stone she was ice she was outraged virtue people noticed a great change in him he gave up society ceased to care for anything looked shockingly one fine day they discovered he had blown out his brains my friend had the story of course from madame clairin  longmore was strongly moved and his first impulse after he had recovered his composure was to return immediately to europe but several years have passed and he still lingers at home the truth is that in the midst of all the ardent tenderness of his memory of madame de mauves he has become conscious of a singular feelinga feeling of wonder of uncertainty of awe
