72694925	tales of trail and town   by bret harte     contents   the ancestors of peter atherly  two americans  the judgment of bolinas plain  the strange experience of alkali dick  a night on the divide  the youngest prospector in calaveras  a tale of three truants     tales of trail and town     the ancestors of peter atherly   chapter i   it must be admitted that the civilizing processes of rough and ready were not marked by any of the ameliorating conditions of other improved camps after the discovery of the famous eureka lead there was the usual influx of gamblers and saloonkeepers but that was accepted as a matter of course but it was thought hard that after a church was built and a new school erected it should suddenly be found necessary to have doors that locked instead of standing shamelessly open to the criticism and temptation of wayfarers or that portable property could no longer be left out at night in the old fond reliance on universal brotherhood the habit of borrowing was stopped with the introduction of more money into the camp and the establishment of rates of interest the poorer people either took what they wanted or as indiscreetly bought on credit there were better clothes to be seen in its one long straggling street but those who wore them generally lacked the grim virtue of the old pioneers and the fairer faces that were to be seen were generally rouged there was a year or two of this kind of mutation in which the youthful barbarism of rough and ready might have been said to struggle with adult civilized wickedness and then the name itself disappeared by an act of the legislature the growing town was called atherly after the owner of the eureka minepeter atherlywho had given largess to the town in its waterworks and a gin mill as the new atherly hotel and its gilded barrooms were now called even at the last moment however the new title of atherly hung in the balance the romantic daughter of the pastor had said that mr atherly should be called atherly of atherly an aristocratic title so strongly suggestive of an innovation upon democratic principles that it was not until it was discreetly suggested that everybody was still free to call him atherly late of rough and ready that opposition ceased  possibly this incident may have first awakened him to the value of his name and some anxiety as to its origin roughly speaking atherlys father was only a bucolic emigrant from mizzouri and his mother had done the washing for the camp on her first arrival the atherlys had suffered on their overland journey from drought and famine with the addition of being captured by indians who had held them captive for ten months indeed mr atherly senior never recovered from the effects of his captivity and died shortly after mrs atherly had given birth to twins peter and jenny atherly this was scant knowledge for peter in the glorification of his name through his immediate progenitors but atherly of atherly still sounded pleasantly and as the young lady had said smacked of old feudal days and honors it was believed beyond doubt even in their simple family recordsthe flyleaf of a biblethat peter atherlys greatgrandfather was an englishman who brought over to his majestys virginian possessions his only son then a boy it was not established however to what class of deportation he belonged whether he was suffering exile from religious or judicial conviction or if he were only one of the articled apprentices who largely made up the american immigration of those days howbeit atherly was undoubtedly an english name even suggesting respectable and landed ancestry and peter atherly was proud of it he looked somewhat askance upon his irish and german fellow citizens and talked a good deal about race two things however concerned him he was not in looks certainly like any type of modern englishman as seen either on the stage in san francisco or as an actual tourist in the mining regions and his accent was undoubtedly southwestern he was tall and dark with deepset eyes in a singularly immobile countenance he had an erect but lithe and sinewy figure even for his thirty odd years and might easily have been taken for any other american except for the single exception that his nose was distinctly roman and gave him a distinguished air there was a suggestion of abraham lincoln and even of don quixote in his tall melancholy figure and length of limb but nothing whatever that suggested an englishman  it was shortly after the christening of atherly town that an incident occurred which at first shook and then the more firmly established his mild monomania his widowed mother had been for the last two years an inmate of a private asylum for inebriates through certain habits contracted while washing for the camp in the first year of her widowhood this had always been a matter of open sympathy to rough and ready but it was a secret reproach hinted at in atherly although it was known that the rich peter atherly kept his mother liberally supplied and that both he and his sister jinny or jenny atherly visited her frequently one day he was telegraphed for and on going to the asylum found mrs atherly delirious and raving through her sons liberality she had bribed an attendant and was fast succumbing to a private debauch in the intervals of her delirium she called peter by name talked frenziedly and mysteriously of his high connectionsalluded to himself and his sister as being of the true breedand with a certain vigor of epithet picked up in the familiarity of the camp during the days when she was known as old maam atherly or aunt sally declared that they were no corncracking hoosiers hayseed pikes nor northern yankee scum and that she should yet live to see them holding their own lands again and the lands of their forefathers quieted at last by opiates she fell into a more lucid but scarcely less distressing attitude recognizing her son again as well as her own fast failing condition she sarcastically thanked him for coming to see her off congratulated him that he would soon be spared the lie and expense of keeping her here on account of his pride under the thin pretext of trying to cure her she knew that sally atherly of rough and ready wasnt considered fit company for atherly of atherly by his fine new friends this and much more in a voice mingling maudlin sentiment with bitter resentment and with an ominous glitter in her bloodshot and glairy eyes peter winced with a consciousness of the halftruth of her reproaches but the curiosity and excitement awakened by the revelations of her frenzy were greater than his remorse he said quickly  you were speaking of fatherof his familyhis lands and possessions tell me again  wot are ye givin us she ejaculated in husky suspicion opening upon him her beady eyes in which the film of death was already gathering  tell me of fathermy father and his family his greatgrandfatherthe atherlys my relationswhat you were saying what do you know about them  thats all ye wanter knowis it thats what yer comin to the old washerwoman foris it she burst out with the desperation of disgust wellgive it up ask me another  but motherthe old records you know the family biblewhat you once told usme and jinny  something gurgled in her throat like a chuckle with the energy of malevolence she stammered there wasnt no recordsthere wasnt no family bible its all a lieyou hear me your atherly that youre so proud of was just a british bummer who was kicked outer his family in england and sent to buzz round in americky he honeyfogled mesally magregorout of a better family than hisn in kansas and skyugled me away but it was a straight out marriage and i kin prove it it was in the st louis papers and ive got it stored away safe enough in my trunk you hear me im shoutin but he wasnt no old settler in mizzourihe wasnt descended from any settler either he was a new man outer englandfresh caughtand talked down his throat and he fooled methe darter of an old family that was settled on the right bank of the mizzouri afore danl boone came to kentuckywith his new philanderings then he broke up and went all to pieces when we struck californy and left mesally magregor whose father had niggers of his ownto wash for rough and ready thats your atherly take him i dont want himive done with him i was done with him long aforeaforea cough checked her utteranceaforeshe gasped again but the words seemed to strangle in her throat intent only on her words and scarcely heeding her sufferings peter was bending over her eagerly when the doctor rudely pulled him away and lifted her to a sitting posture but she never spoke again the strongest restoratives quickly administered only left her in a state of scarcely breathing unconsciousness  is she dying cant you bring her to said the anxious peter if only for a moment doctor  im thinkin said the visiting doctor an old scotch army surgeon looking at the rich mr atherly with cool professional contempt that your mother willna do any more washing for me as in the old time nor give up her life again to support her bairns and it isna my eentention to bring her back to pain for the purposes of geeneral conversation  nor indeed did she ever come back to any purpose but passed away with her unfinished sentence and her limbs were scarcely decently composed by the attendants before peter was rummaging the trunk in her room for the paper she had spoken of it was in an old workboxa now faded yellow clipping from a newspaper lying amidst spoils of cotton thread buttons and beeswax which he even then remembered to have seen upon his mothers lap when she superadded the sewing on of buttons to her washing of the miners shirts and his dark and hollow cheek glowed with gratified sentiment as he read the clipping  we hear with regret of the death of philip atherly esq of rough and ready california mr atherly will be remembered by some of our readers as the hero of the romantic elopement of miss sallie magregor daughter of colonel bob magregor which created such a stir in welltodo circles some thirty years ago it was known vaguely that the young couple had gone westa then unknown regionbut it seems that after severe trials and tribulations on the frontier with savages they emigrated early to oregon and then on the outbreak of the gold fever to california but it will be a surprise to many to know that it has just transpired that mr atherly was the second son of sir ashley atherly an english baronet and by the death of his brother might have succeeded to the property and title  he remained for some moments looking fixedly at the paper until the commonplace paragraph imprinted itself upon his brain as no line of sage or poet had ever done and then he folded it up and put it in his pocket in his exaltation he felt that even the mother he had never loved was promoted to a certain respect as his fathers wife although he was equally conscious of a new resentment against her for her contemptuous allusions to his father and her evident hopeless inability to comprehend his position his mother he feared was indeed lowbut he was his fathers son nevertheless he gave her a funeral at atherly long remembered for its barbaric opulence and display thirty carriages procured from sacramento at great expense were freely offered to his friends to join in the astounding pageant a wonderful casket of iron and silver brought from san francisco held the remains of the exwasherwoman of rough and ready but a more remarkable innovation was the addition of a royal crown to the other ornamentation of the casket peter atherlys ideas of heraldry were very vaguesacramento at that time offered him no opportunity of knowing what were the arms of the atherlysand the introduction of the royal crown seemed to satisfy peters mind as to what a crest might be while to the ordinary democratic mind it simply suggested that the corpse was english political criticism being thus happily averted mrs atherlys body was laid in the little cemetery not far away from certain rude wooden crosses which marked the burialplace of wanderers whose very names were unknown and in due time a marble shaft was erected over it but when the next day the county paper contained in addition to the columnandahalf description of the funeral the more formal announcement of the death of mrs sallie atherly wife of the late philip atherly second son of sir ashley atherly of england criticism and comment broke out the old pioneers of rough and ready felt that they had been imposed upon and that in some vague way the unfortunate woman had made them the victims of a huge practical joke during all these years that she had grimly enjoyed their ignorance of her position they did not doubt why i remember onct when i was sorter bullyraggin her about mixin up my duds with doc simmonss and sendin me whiskey dicks old rags she turned round sudden with a kind of screech and ran out into the brush i reckoned at the time that it was either drink or feelins and could hev kicked myself for being sassy to the old woman but i know now that all this time that air critterthat barrownets daughterinlawwas just laughin herself into fits in the brush no sir she played this yer camp for all it was worth year in and out and we just gave ourselves away like speckled idiots and now shes lyin out thar in the bone yard and keeps on pintin the joke and aroarin at us in marble  even the later citizens in atherly felt an equal resentment against her but from different motives that her drinking habits and her powerful vocabulary were all the effect of her aristocratic alliance they never doubted and although it brought the virtues of their own superior republican sobriety into greater contrast they felt a scandal at having been tricked into attending this gilded funeral of dissipated rank peter atherly found himself unpopular in his own town the sober who drank from his free waterworks and the giddy ones who imbibed at his gin mill equally criticised him he could not understand it his peculiar predilections had been accepted before when they were mere presumptions why should they not now when they were admitted facts he was conscious of no change in himself since the funeral yet the criticism went on presently it took the milder but more contagious form of ridicule in his own hotel built with his own money and in his own presence he had heard a reckless frequenter of the barroom decline some proffered refreshment on the ground that he only drank with his titled relatives a local humorist amidst the applause of an admiring crowd at the postoffice window had openly accused the postmaster of withholding letters to him from his only surviving brother the dook of doncherknow the ole dooky never onct missed the mail to let me know wots goin on in me childhoods home remarked the humorist plaintively and yers this dodblasted govment mule of a postmaster keepin me letters back letters with pretentious and gilded coats of arms taken from the decorated inner lining of cigarboxes were posted to prominent citizens the neighboring and unregenerated settlement of red dog was more outrageous in its contribution the red dog sentinel in commenting on the death of haulbowline tom a drunken english manowars man said it may not be generally known that our regretted fellow citizen while serving on h m s boxer was secretly married to queen kikalu of the friendly group but unlike some of our prosperous neighbors he never boasted of his royal alliance and resisted with steady british pluck any invitation to share the throne indeed any allusion to the subject affected him deeply there are those among us who will remember the beautiful portrait of his royal bride tattooed upon his left arm with the royal crest and the crossed flags of the two nations only peter atherly and his sister understood the sting inflicted either by accident or design in the latter sentence both he and his sister had some singular hieroglyphic branded on their armsprobably a reminiscence of their life on the plains in their infant indian captivity but there was no mistaking the general sentiment the criticisms of a small town may become inevasible atherly determined to take the first opportunity to leave rough and ready he was rich his property was secure there was no reason why he should stay where his family pretensions were a drawback and a further circumstance determined his resolution  he was awaiting his sister in his new house on a little crest above the town she had been at the time of her mothers death and since a private boarder in the sacred heart convent at santa clara whence she had been summoned to the funeral but had returned the next day few people had noticed in her brothers carriage the veiled figure which might have belonged to one of the religious orders still less did they remember the dark lank heavybrowed girl who had sometimes been seen about rough and ready for she had her brothers melancholy and greater reticence and had continued of her own free will long after her girlish pupilage at the convent to live secluded under its maternal roof without taking orders a general suspicion that she was either a religious crank or considered herself too good to live in a mountain mining town had not contributed to her brothers popularity in her abstraction from worldly ambitions she had naturally taken no part in her brothers family pretensions he had given her an independent allowance and she was supposed to be equally a sharer in his good fortune yet she had suddenly declared her intention of returning to atherly to consult him on affairs of importance peter was both surprised and eager there was but little affection between them but preoccupied with his one idea he was satisfied that she wanted to talk about the family  but he was amazed disappointed and disconcerted for jenny atherly the sober recluse of santa clara hidden in her sombre draperies at the funeral was no longer to be recognized in the fashionable smartly but somewhat overdressed woman he saw before him in spite of her large features and the distinguishing roman nose like his own she looked even pretty in her excitement she had left the convent she was tired of the life there she was satisfied that a religious vocation would not suit her in brief she intended to enjoy herself like other women if he really felt a pride in the family he ought to take her out like other brothers and give her a show he could do it there if he liked and she would keep house for him if he didnt want to she must have enough money to keep her fashionably in san francisco but she wanted excitement and that she would have she wanted to go to balls theatres and entertainments and she intended to her voice grew quite high and her dark cheek glowed with some newfound emotion  astounded as he was peter succumbed it was better that she should indulge her astounding caprice under his roof than elsewhere it would not do for the sister of an atherly to provoke scandal he gave entertainments picnics and parties and jinny atherly plunged into these mild festivities with the enthusiasm of a schoolgirl she not only could dance with feverish energy all night but next day could mount a horseshe was a fearless riderand lead the most accomplished horsemen she was a good shot she walked with the untiring foot of a coyote she threaded the woods with the instinct of a pioneer peter regarded her with a singular mingling of astonishment and fear surely she had not learned this at school these were not the teachings nor the sports of the good sisters he once dared to interrogate her regarding this change in her habits i always felt like it she answered quickly but i kept it down i used sometimes to feel that i couldnt stand it any longer but must rush out and do something she said passionately but she went on with furtive eyes and a sudden wild timidity like that of a fawn i was afraid i was afraid it was like mother it seemed to me to be her blood that was rising in me and i kept it downi didnt want to be like herand i prayed and struggled against it did you she said suddenly grasping his hand ever feel like that  but peter never had his melancholy faith in his fathers race had left no thought of his mothers blood mingling with it but he said gravely believing this why did you change  because i could hold out no longer i should have gone crazy times i wanted to take some of those meek nuns some of those whitefaced pupils with their blue eyes and wavy flaxen hair and strangle them i couldnt strive and pray and struggle any longer there and so i came here to let myself out i suppose when i get marriedand i ought to with my moneyit may change me you dont suppose she said with a return of her wildanimallike timidity it is anything that was in father in those atherlysdo you  but peter had no idea of anything but virtue in the atherly blood he had heard that the upper class of europeans were fond of field sports and of hunting it was odd that his sister should inherit this propensity and not he he regarded her more kindly for this evidence of race you think of getting married he said more gently yet with a certain brotherly doubt that any man could like her enough even with her money is there any one here wouldsuit you he added diplomatically  noi hate them all she burst out there isnt one i dont despise for his sickening foppish womanish airs  nevertheless it was quite evident that some of the men were attracted by her singular originality and a certain good comradeship in her ways and it was on one of their riding excursions that peter noticed that she was singled out by a goodlooking blondhaired young lawyer of the town for his especial attentions as the cavalcade straggled in climbing the mountain the young fellow rode close to her saddlebow and as the distance lengthened between the other stragglers they at last were quite alone when the trail became more densely wooded peter quite lost sight of them but when a few moments later having lost the trail himself they again appeared in the distance before him he was so amazed that he unconsciously halted for the two horses were walking side by side and the strangers arm was round his sisters waist  had peter any sense of humor he might have smiled at this weakness in his amazonian sister but he saw only the serious practical side of the situation with of course its inevitable relation to his one controlling idea the young man was in good practice and would have made an eligible husband to any one else but was he fit to mate with an atherly what would those as yet unknown and powerful relatives say to it at the same time he could not help knowing that jinny in the eccentricities of her virgin spinsterhood might be equally objectionable to them as she certainly was a severe trial to him here if she were off his hands he might be able to prosecute his search for his relatives with more freedom after all there were mesalliances in all families and being a woman she was not in the direct line instead therefore of spurring forward to join them he lingered a little until they passed out of sight and until he was joined by a companion from behind him too he purposely delayed they were walking slowly breathing their mustangs when his companion suddenly uttered a cry of alarm and sprang from his horse for on the trail before them lay the young lawyer quite unconscious with his riderless steed nipping the young leaves of the underbrush he was evidently stunned by a fall although across his face was a livid welt which might have been caused by collision with the small elastic limb of a sapling or a blow from a ridingwhip happily the last idea was only in peters mind as they lifted him up he came slowly to consciousness he was bewildered and dazed at first but as he began to speak the color came back freshly to his face he could not conceive he stammered what had happened he was riding with miss atherly and he supposed his horse had slipped upon some withered pine needles and thrown him a spasm of pain crossed his face suddenly and he lifted his hand to the top of his head was he hurt there no but perhaps his hair which was flowing and curly had caught in the brancheslike absaloms he tried to smile and even begged them to assist him to his horse that he might follow his fair companion who would be wondering where he was but peter satisfied that he had received no serious injury hurriedly enjoined him to stay while he himself would follow his sister putting spurs to his horse he succeeded in spite of the slippery trail in overtaking her near the summit at the sound of his horses hoofs she wheeled quickly came dashing furiously towards him and only pulled up at the sound of his voice but she had not time to change her first attitude and expression which was something which perplexed and alarmed him her long lithe figure was half crouching half clinging to the horses back her loosened hair flying over her shoulders her dark eyes gleaming with an odd nymphlike mischief her white teeth flashed as she recognized him but her laugh was still mocking and uncanny he took refuge in indignation  what has happened he said sharply  the fool tried to kiss me she said simply and iilet out at himlike mother  nevertheless she gave him one of those shy timid glances he had noticed before and began coiling something around her fingers with a suggestion of coy embarrassment indescribably inconsistent with her previous masculine independence  you might have killed him said peter angrily  perhaps i might ought i have killed him peter she said anxiously yet with the same winning timid smile if she had not been his sister he would have thought her quite handsome  as it is he said impetuously you have made a frightful scandal here  he wont say anything about itwill he she inquired shyly still twisting the something around her finger  peter did not reply perhaps the young lawyer really loved her and would keep her secret but he was vexed and there was something maniacal in her twisting fingers what have you got there he said sharply  she shook the object in the air before her with a laugh only a lock of his hair she said gayly but i didnt cut it off  throw it away and come here he said angrily  but she only tucked the little blond curl into her waist belt and shook her head he urged his horse forward but she turned and fled laughing as he pursued her being the better rider she could easily evade him whenever he got too near and in this way they eventually reached the town and their house long before their companions but she was far enough ahead of her brother to be able to dismount and hide her trophy with childish glee before he arrived  she was right in believing that her unfortunate cavalier would make no revelation of her conduct and his catastrophe passed as an accident but peter could not disguise the fact that much of his unpopularity was shared by his sister the matrons of atherly believed that she was fast and remembered more distinctly than ever the evil habits of her mother that she would in the due course of time take to drink they never doubted her dancing was considered outrageous in its unfettered freedom and her extraordinary powers of endurance were looked upon as masculine by the weaker girls whose partners she took from them she reciprocally looked down upon them and made no secret of her contempt for their small refinements and fancies she affected only the society of men and even treated them with a familiarity that was both fearless and scornful peter saw that it was useless to face the opposition miss atherly did not seem to encourage the renewal of the young lawyers attentions although it was evident that he was still attracted by her nor did she seem to invite advances from others he must go awayand he would have to take her with him it seemed ridiculous that a woman of thirty of masculine character should require a chaperon in a brother of equal age but peter knew the singular blending of childlike ignorance with this amazonian quality he had made his arrangements for an absence from atherly of three or four years and they departed together the young fairhaired lawyer came to the stagecoach office to see them off peter could detect no sentiment in his sisters familiar farewell of her unfortunate suitor at new york however it was arranged that jinny should stay with some friends whom they had made en route and that if she wished she could come to europe later and join him in london  thus relieved of one peter atherly of atherly started on his cherished quest of his other and more remote relations   chapter ii   peter atherly had been four months in england but knew little of the country until one summer afternoon when his carriage rolled along the wellordered road between nonningsby station and ashley grange  in that four months he had consulted authorities examined records visited the heralds college written letters and made a few friends a rich american tracing his genealogical tree was not a new thingeven in that dayin london but there was something original and simple in his methods and so much that was grave reserved and unamerican in his personality that it awakened interest a recognition that he was a foreigner but a puzzled doubt however of his exact nationality which he found everywhere at first pained him but he became reconciled to it at about the same time that his english acquaintances abandoned their own reserve and caution before the greater reticence of this melancholy american and actually became the questioners in this way his quest became known only as a disclosure of his own courtesy and offers of assistance were pressed eagerly upon him that was why sir edward atherly found himself gravely puzzled as he sat with his family solicitor one morning in the library of ashley grange  humph said sir edward and you say he has absolutely no other purpose in making these inquiries  positively none returned the solicitor he is even willing to sign a renunciation of any claim which might arise out of this information it is rather a singular case but he seems to be a rich man and quite able to indulge his harmless caprices  and you are quite sure he is philips son  quite from the papers he brings me of course i informed him that even if he should be able to establish a legal marriage he could expect nothing as next of kin as you had children of your own he seemed to know that already and avowed that his only wish was to satisfy his own mind  i suppose he wants to claim kinship and all that sort of thing for societys sake  i do not think so said the solicitor dryly i suggested an interview with you but he seemed to think it quite unnecessary if i could give him the information he required  ha said sir edward promptly well invite him here lady atherly can bring in some people to see him is heahemwhat is he like the usual american i suppose  not at all quite foreignlookingdark and rather like an italian there is no resemblance to mr philip he said glancing at the painting of a flaxenhaired child fondling a greyhound under the elms of ashley park  ah yes yes perhaps the mother was one of those southern creoles or mulattoes said sir edward with an englishmans tolerant regard for the vagaries of people who were clearly not english theyre rather attractive women i hear  i think you do quite well to be civil to him said the solicitor he seems to take an interest in the family and being rich and apparently only anxious to enhance the family prestige you ought to know him now in reference to those mortgages on appleby farm if you could get  yes yes said sir edward quickly well have him down here and i say youll come too  the solicitor bowed and by the way continued sir edward there was a girl toowasnt there he has a sister i believe  yes but he has left her in america  ah yesvery goodyesof course well have lord greyshott and sir roger and old lady evertonshe knows all about sir ashley and the family anderis he young or old  about thirty i should say sir edward  ah well well have lady elfrida over from the towers  had peter known of these preparations he might have turned back to nonningsby without even visiting the old church in ashley park which he had been told held the ashes of his ancestors for during these four months the conviction that he was a foreigner and that he had little or nothing in common with things here had been clearly forced upon him he could recognize some kinship in the manners and customs of the people to those he had known in the west and on the atlantic coast but not to his own individuality and he seemed even more a stranger herewhere he had expected to feel the thrill of consanguinitythan in the west he had accepted the invitation of the living atherly for the sake of the atherlys long dead and forgotten as the great quadrangle of stone and ivy lifted itself out of the park he looked longingly towards the little square tower which peeped from between the yews nearer the road as the carriage drove up to the carved archway whence so many atherlys had issued into the world he could not believe that any of his blood had gone forth from it or except himself had ever entered it before once in the great house he felt like a prisoner as he wandered through the long corridors to his room even the noble trees beyond his mullioned windows seemed of another growth than those he had known  there was no doubt that he created a sensation at ashley grange not only from his singular kinship but from his striking individuality the atherlys and their guests were fascinated and freely admiring his very originality which prevented them from comparing him with any english or american standard of excellence gave them a comfortable assurance of safety in their admiration his reserve his seriousness his simplicity very unlike their own and yet near enough to suggest a delicate flattery was in his favor so was his naive frankness in regard to his status in the family shown in the few words of greeting with sir ashley and in his later simple yet free admissions regarding his obscure youth his former poverty and his present wealth he boasted of neither he was disturbed by neither standing alone a stranger for the first time in an assemblage of distinguished and titled men and women he betrayed no consciousness surrounded for the first time by objects which he knew his wealth could not buy he showed the most unmistakable indifferencethe indifference of temperament the ladies vied with each other to attack this unimpressible naturethis profound isolation from external attraction they followed him about they looked into his dark melancholy eyes it was impossible they thought that he could continue this superb acting forever a glance a smile a burst of ingenuous confidence a covert appeal to his chivalry would yet catch him tripping but the melancholy eyes that had gazed at the treasures of ashley grange and the opulent ease of its guests without kindling opened to their first emotionwonder at which lady elfrida who had ingenuously admired him hated him a little as the first step towards a kindlier feeling  the next day having declared his intention of visiting ashley church and as frankly his intention of going there alone he slipped out in the afternoon and made his way quietly through the park to the square ivied tower he had first seen in this tranquil level length of the wood there was the one spot the churchyard where oddly enough the green earth heaved into little billows as if to show the turbulence of that life which those who lay below them had lately quitted it was a relief to the somewhat studied and formal monotony of the wellordered woodlandevery rood of which had been paced by visitors keepers or poachersto find those decrepit and bending tombstones lurching at every angle or deeply sinking into the green sea of forgetfulness around them all this and the trodden paths of the villagers towards that common place of meeting struck him as being more human than anything he had left behind him at the grange  he entered the ivygrown porch and stared for a moment at the halflegal official parochial notices posted on the oaken doorhis first obtrusive intimation of the combination of church and stateand hesitated he was not prepared to find that this last restingplace of his people had something to do with taxes and tithes and that a certain material respectability and security attended his votive sigh god and the reigning sovereign of the realm preserved a decorous alliance in the royal arms that appeared above the official notices presently he pushed open the door gently and entered the nave for a moment it seemed to him as if the arched gloom of the woods he had left behind was repeated in the dim aisle and vaulted roof there was an earthy odor as if the church itself springing from the fertilizing dust below had taken root in the soil the chequers of light from the faded stainedglass windows fell like the flicker of leaves on the pavement he paused before the cold altar and started for beside him lay the recumbent figure of a warrior pillowed on his helmet with the paraphernalia of his trade around him a sudden childish memory of the great western plains and the biers of the indian braves raised on upright poles against the staring sky and above the sunbaked prairie rushed upon him there too had lain the weapons of the departed chieftain there too lay the indians faithful hound here simulated by the crosslegged crusaders canine effigy and now strangest of all he found that this unlookedfor recollection and remembrance thrilled him more at that moment than the dead before him here they restedthe atherlys of centuries recumbent in armor or priestly robes upright in busts that were periwigged or hidden in long curls above the marble record of their deeds and virtues some of these records were in latinan unknown tongue to petersome in a quaint english almost as unintelligible but none as foreign to him as the dead themselves their banners waved above his head their voices filled the silent church but fell upon his vacant eye and duller ear he was none of them  presently he was conscious of a footstep so faint so subtle that it might have come from a peregrinating ghost he turned quickly and saw lady elfrida half bold yet half frightened halting beside a pillar of the chancel but there was nothing of the dead about her she was radiating and pulsating with the uncompromising and material freshness of english girlhood the wild rose in the hedgerow was not more tangible than her cheek nor the summer sky more clearly cool and blue than her eyes the vigor of health and unfettered freedom of limb was in her figure from her buckled walkingshoe to her brown hair topped by a sailor hat the assurance and contentment of a wellordered life of secured position and freedom from vain anxieties or expectations were visible in every line of her refined delicate and evenly quiescent features and yet lady elfrida for the first time in her girlhood felt a little nervous  yet she was frank too with the frankness of those who have no thought of being misunderstood she said she had come there out of curiosity to see how he would get on with his ancestors she had been watching him from the chancel ever since he cameand she was disappointed as far as emotion went she thought he had the advantage of the stoniest and longest dead of them all perhaps he did not like them but he must be careful what he said for some of her own people were theremanifestly this one she put the toe of her buckled shoe on the crusader peter had just looked at and then there was another in the corner so she had a right to come there as well as heand she could act as cicerone this one was a de brecy one of king johns knights who married an atherly she swung herself into a halfsitting posture on the effigy of the dead knight composed her straight short skirt over her trim ankles and looked up in peters dark face that would make them some kind of relationswouldnt it he must come over to bentley towers and see the rest of the de brecys in the chapel there tomorrow perhaps there might be some he liked better and who looked more like him for there was no one here or at the grange who resembled him in the least  he assented to the truth of this with such grave disarming courtesy and yet with such undisguised wonderas she appeared to talk with greater freedom to a stranger than an american girl wouldthat she at once popped off the crusader and accompanied him somewhat more demurely around the church suddenly she stopped with a slight exclamation  they had halted before a tablet to the memory of a later atherly an officer of his majestys 100th foot who was killed at braddocks defeat the tablet was supported on the one side by a weeping fame and on the other by a manacled north american indian she stammered and said you see there are other atherlys who went to america even before your father and then stopped with a sense of having made a slip  a wild and inexplicable resentment against this complacent historical outrage suddenly took possession of peter he knew that his rage was inconsistent with his usual calm but he could not help it his swarthy cheek glowed his dark eyes flashed he almost trembled with excitement as he hurriedly pointed out to lady elfrida that the indians were victorious in that illfated expedition of the british forces and that the captive savage was an allegorical lie so swift and convincing was his emotion that the young girl knowing nothing of the subject and caring less shared his indignation followed him with anxious eyes and their hands for an instant touched in innocent and generous sympathy and thenhe knew not how or whya still more wild and terrible idea sprang up in his fancy he knew it was madness yet for a moment he could only stand and grapple with it silently and breathlessly it was to seize this young and innocent girl this witness of his disappointment this complacent and beautiful type of all they valued here and bear her awaya prisoner a hostagehe knew not whyon a galloping horse in the dust of the prairiefar beyond the seas it was only when he saw her cheek flush and pale when he saw her staring at him with helpless frightened but fascinated eyesthe eyes of the fluttering bird under the spell of the rattlesnakethat he drew his breath and turned bewildered away and do you know dear she said with naive simplicity to her sister that evening that although he was an american and everybody says that they dont care at all for those poor indians he was so magnanimous in his indignation that i fancied he looked like one of coopers heroes himself rather than an atherly it was such a stupid thing for me to show him that tomb of major atherly you know who fought the americansdidnt heor was it laterbut i quite forgot he was an american and with this belief in her mind and in the high expiation of a noble nature she forbore her characteristic raillery and followed him meekly manacled in spirit like the allegorical figure to the church porch where they separated to meet on the morrow but that morrow never came  for late in the afternoon a cable message reached him from california asking him to return to accept a nomination to congress from his own district it determined his resolution which for a moment at the church porch had wavered under the bright eyes of lady elfrida he telegraphed his acceptance hurriedly took leave of his honestly lamenting kinsman followed his dispatch to london and in a few days was on the atlantic  how he was received in california how he found his sister married to the blond lawyer how he recovered his popularity and won his election are details that do not belong to this chronicle of his quest and that quest seems to have terminated forever with his appearance at washington to take his seat as congressman  it was the night of a levee at the white house the east room was crowded with smartly dressed men and women of the capital quaintly simple legislators from remote states in bygone fashions officers in uniform and the diplomatic circle blazing with orders the invoker of this brilliant assembly stood in simple evening dress near the doorunattended and hedged by no formality he shook the hand of the new congressman heartily congratulated him by name and turned smilingly to the next comer presently there was a slight stir at one of the opposite doors the crowd fell back and five figures stalked majestically into the centre of the room they were the leading chiefs of an indian reservation coming to pay their respects to their great father the president their costumes were a mingling of the picturesque with the grotesque of tawdriness with magnificence of artificial tinsel and glitter with the regal spoils of the chase of childlike vanity with barbaric pride yet before these the glittering orders and ribbons of the diplomats became dull and meaningless the uniforms of the officers mere servile livery their painted immobile faces and plumed heads towered with grave dignity above the meaner crowd their inscrutable eyes returned no response to the timid glances directed towards them they stood by themselves alone and impassiveyet their presence filled the room with the sense of kings the unostentatious simple republican court suddenly seemed to have become royal even the interpreter who stood between their remote dignity and the nearer civilized world acquired the status of a court chamberlain  when their great father apparently the less important personage had smilingly received them a political colleague approached peter and took his arm gray eagle would like to speak with you come on heres your chance you may be put on the committee on indian relations and pick up a few facts remember we want a firm policy no more palaver about the great father and no more blankets and guns you know what we used to say out west the only good indian is a dead one so wade in and hear what the old plug hat has to say  peter permitted himself to be led to the group even at that moment he remembered the figure of the indian on the tomb at ashley grange and felt a slight flash of satisfaction over the superior height and bearing of gray eagle  how said gray eagle how said the other four chiefs how repeated peter instinctively at a gesture from gray eagle the interpreter said let your friend stand back gray eagle has nothing to say to him he wishes to speak only with you  peters friend reluctantly withdrew but threw a cautioning glance towards him ugh said gray eagle ugh said the other chiefs a few guttural words followed to the interpreter who turned and facing peter with the monotonous impassiveness which he had caught from the chiefs said he says he knew your father he was a great chiefwith many horses and many squaws he is dead  my father was an englishmanphilip atherly said peter with an odd nervousness creeping over him  the interpreter repeated the words to grey eagle who after a guttural ugh answered in his own tongue  he says continued the interpreter with a slight shrug yet relapsing into his former impassiveness that your father was a great chief and your mother a pale face or white woman she was captured with an englishman but she became the wife of the chief while in captivity she was only released before the birth of her children but a year or two afterwards she brought them as infants to see their fatherthe great chiefand to get the mark of their tribe he says you and your sister are each marked on the left arm  then gray eagle opened his mouth and uttered his first english sentence his father big injin take common white squaw papoose no goodtoo much white squaw mother not enough big injin father look he big man but no can bear pain ugh  the interpreter turned in time to catch peter he had fainted   chapter iii   a hot afternoon on the plains a dusty cavalcade of united states cavalry and commissary wagons which from a distance preserved a certain military precision of movement but on nearer view resolved itself into straggling troopers in twos and fours interspersed between the wagons two noncommissioned officers and a guide riding ahead who had already fallen into the cavalry slouch but off to the right smartly erect and cadetlike the young lieutenant in command a wide road that had the appearance of being at once well traveled and yet deserted and that although well defined under foot still seemed to disappear and lose itself a hundred feet ahead in the monotonous level a horizon that in that clear dry hazeless atmosphere never mocked you yet never changed but kept its eternal rim of mountains at the same height and distance from hour to hour and day to day dusta parching alkaline powder that cracked the skineverywhere clinging to the hubs and spokes of the wheels without being disturbed by movement incrusting the cavalryman from his high boots to the crossed sabres of his cap going off in small puffs like explosions under the plunging hoofs of the horses but too heavy to rise and follow them a reeking smell of horse sweat and boot leather that lingered in the road long after the train had passed an external silence broken only by the cough of a jaded horse in the suffocating dust or the cracking of harness leather within one of the wagons that seemed a miracle of military neatness and methodical stowage a lazy conversation carried on by a grizzled driver and sunbrowned farrier  who be you sezee im philip atherly a member of congress sez the long darkcomplected man sezee and im on a commission for looking into this yer injin grievance sezee you may be god almighty sez nebraska bill sezee but you look a dd sight more like a hossstealin apache and we dont want any of your psalmsinging bigtalkin peacemakers interferin with our ways of treatin pizenyou hear me im shoutin sezee with that the darkcomplected mans eyes began to glisten and he sorter squirmed all over to get at bill and bill outs with his batterywhoa will ye whats up with you now the latter remark was directed to the young spirited near horse he was driving who was beginning to be strangely excited  what happened then said the farrier lazily  well continued the driver having momentarily quieted his horse i reckoned it was about time for me to wheel into line for fellers of the bill stripe out on the plains would ez leave plug a man in citizens clothes even if he was the president himself as they would drop on an injin or a nigger look here bill sez i im escortin this stranger under govment orders and im responsible for him i aint allowed to waste govment powder and shot on your kind onless ive orders but if youll wait till i strip off this shell ill lam the stuffin outer ye afore the stranger with that bill just danced with rage but dassent fire for he knew and i knew that if hed plugged me hed been a dead frontiersman afore the next mornin        cavalry jacket  but youd have had to give him up to the authorities and a jury of his own kind would have set him free  not much if you hadnt just joined youd know that aint the way o 30th cavalry returned the driver the kernel would have issued his orders to bring in bill dead or alive and the 30th would have managed to bring him in dead then your jury might have sat on him tell you what chaps of the bill stripe dont care overmuch to tackle the yaller braid        characteristic trimming of cavalry jacket  but whats this yer congressman interferin for anyway  hes a rich californian thinks hes got a call i reckon to look arter injins just as them abolitionists looked arter slaves and get hated just as they was by the folks hereand as we are too for the matter of that  well i dunno rejoined the farrier it dont seem nateral for white men to quarrel with each other about the way to treat an injin and that injin lyin in ambush to shoot em both and ef govment would only make up its mind how to treat em instead of one day pretendin to be their great father and treatin them like babies and the next makin treaties with em like as they wos forriners and the next sendin out a handful of us to lick ten thousand of themwots the use of one regimenteven twoagin a nationon their own ground  a nationand on their own groundthats just whar youve hit it softy thats the argument of that congressman atherly as ive heard him talk with the kernel  and what did the kernel say  the kernel reckoned it was his business to obey ordersand so should you so shut your head if ye wanted to talk about govment ye might say suthin about its usin us to convoy picnics and excursion parties around who come out here to have a days shootin under some bigwig of a political boss or a railroad president with a letter to the general and were told off to look arter their precious skins and keep the injins off emand they shootin or skeerin off the injins natral game and our provender darn my skin ef therell be much to scout for ef this goes on and bgoshof they arent now ringin in a lot of titled forriners to hunt big game as they call itlord thisandthat and count soandsoall of em with letters to the general from the washington cabinet to show hospitality or from millionaires whove bin hobnobbin with em in the old country and darn my skin ef some of em aint bringin their wives and sisters along too there was a lord and lady passed through here under escort last week and were goin to pick up some more of em at fort biggs tomorrowand i reckon some of us will be told off to act as ladies maids or milliners nothin short of a good injin scare i reckon would send them and us about our reglar business whoa then will ye at it again are ye whats gone of the dd critter  here the fractious near horse was again beginning to show signs of disturbance and active terror his quivering nostrils were turned towards the wind and he almost leaped the centre pole in his frantic effort to avoid it the eyes of the two men were turned instinctively in that direction nothing was to be seenthe illimitable plain and the sinking sun were all that met the eye but the horse continued to struggle and the wagon stopped then it was discovered that the horse of an adjacent trooper was also laboring under the same mysterious excitement and at the same moment wagon no 3 halted the infection of some inexplicable terror was spreading among them then two noncommissioned officers came riding down the line at a sharp canter and were joined quickly by the young lieutenant who gave an order the trumpeter instinctively raised his instrument to his lips but was stopped by another order  and then as seen by a distant observer a singular spectacle was unfolded the straggling train suddenly seemed to resolve itself into a large widening circle of horsemen revolving round and partly hiding the few heavy wagons that were being rapidly freed from their struggling teams these too joined the circle and were driven before the whirling troopers gradually the circle seemed to grow smaller under the windingup of those evolutions until the horseless wagons reappeared again motionless fronting the four points of the compass thus making the radii of a smaller inner circle into which the teams of the wagons as well as the troopers horses were closely wound up and densely packed together in an immovable mass as the circle became smaller the troopers leaped from their horseswhich however continued to blindly follow each other in the narrower circleand ran to the wagons carbines in hand in five minutes from the time of giving the order the straggling train was a fortified camp the horses corralled in the centre the dismounted troopers securely posted with their repeating carbines in the angles of the rude bastions formed by the deserted wagons and ready for an attack the stampede if such it was was stopped  and yet no cause for it was to be seen nothing in earth or sky suggested a reason for this extraordinary panic or the marvelous evolution that suppressed it the guide with three men in open order rode out and radiated across the empty plain returning as empty of result in an hour the horses were sufficiently calmed and fed the camp slowly unwound itself the teams were set to and were led out of the circle and as the rays of the setting sun began to expand fanlike across the plain the cavalcade moved on but between them and the sinking sun and visible through its last rays was a faint line of haze parallel with their track yet even this too quickly faded away  had the guide however penetrated half a mile further to the west he would have come upon the cause of the panic and a spectacle more marvelous than that he had just witnessed for the illimitable plain with its monotonous prospect was far from being level a hundred yards further on he would have slowly and imperceptibly descended into a depression nearly a mile in width here he not only would have completely lost sight of his own cavalcade but have come upon another thrice its length for here was a trailing line of jogtrotting dusky shapes some crouching on dwarf ponies half their size some trailing lances lodgepoles rifles women and children after them all moving with a monotonous rhythmic motion as marked as the military precision of the other cavalcade and always on a parallel line with it they had done so all day keeping touch and distance by stealthy videttes that crept and crawled along the imperceptible slope towards the unconscious white men it was no doubt the near proximity of one of those watchers that had touched the keen scent of the troopers horses  the moon came up the two cavalcades scarcely a mile apart moved on in unison together then suddenly the dusky caravan seemed to arise stretch itself out and swept away like a morning mist towards the west the bugles of fort biggs had just rung out    peter atherly was up early the next morning pacing the veranda of the commandants house at fort biggs it had been his intention to visit the new indian reservation that day but he had just received a letter announcing an unexpected visit from his sister who wished to join him he had never told her the secret of their indian paternity as it had been revealed to him from the scornful lips of gray eagle a year ago he knew her strangely excitable nature besides she was a wife now and the secret would have to be shared with her husband when he himself had recovered from the shock of the revelation two things had impressed themselves upon his reserved and gloomy nature a horror of his previous claim upon the atherlys and an infinite pity and sense of duty towards his own race he had devoted himself and his increasing wealth to this one object it seemed to him at times almost providential that his position as a legislator which he had accepted as a whim or fancy should have given him this singular opportunity  yet it was not an easy task or an enviable position he was obliged to divorce himself from his political party as well as keep clear of the wild schemes of impractical enthusiasts too practical contractors and the still more helpless bigotry of christian civilizers who would have regenerated the indian with a text which he did not understand and they were unable to illustrate by example he had expected the opposition of lawless frontiersmen and ignorant settlersas roughly indicated in the conversation already recorded indeed he had felt it difficult to argue his humane theories under the smoking roof of a raided settlers cabin whose owner however had forgotten his own repeated provocations or the trespass of which he was proud but atherlys unaffected and unobtrusive zeal his fixity of purpose his undoubted courage his selfabnegation and above all the gentle melancholy and halfphilosophical wisdom of this new missionary won him the respect and assistance of even the most callous or the most skeptical of officials the secretary of the interior had given him carte blanche the president trusted him and it was said had granted him extraordinary powers oddly enough it was only his own californian constituency who had once laughed at what they deemed his early aristocratic pretensions who now found fault with his democratic philanthropy that a man who had been so well received in englandthe news of his visit to ashley grange had been duly recordedshould sink so low as to take up with the injins of his own country galled their republican pride a few of his personal friends regretted that he had not brought back from england more conservative and fashionable graces and had not improved his opportunities unfortunately there was no essentially english policy of trusting aborigines that they knew of  in his gloomy selfscrutiny he had often wondered if he ought not to openly proclaim his kinship with the despised race but he was always deterred by the thought of his sister and her husband as well as by the persistent doubt whether his advocacy of indian rights with his fellow countrymen would be as well served by such a course and here again he was perplexed by a singular incident of his early missionary efforts which he had at first treated with cold surprise but to which later reflection had given a new significance after gray eagles revelation he had made a pilgrimage to the indian country to verify the statements regarding his dead fatherthe indian chief silver cloud despite the confusion of tribal dialects he was amazed to find that the indian tongue came back to him almost as a forgotten boyish memory so that he was soon able to do without an interpreter but not until that functionary who knew his secret appeared one day as a more significant ambassador gray eagle says if you want truly to be a brother to his people you must take a wife among them he loves youtake one of his peter through whose veinsalbeit of mixed bloodran that puritan ice so often found throughout the great west was frigidly amazed in vain did the interpreter assure him that the wife in question little daybreak was a wife only in name a prudent reserve kept by gray eagle in the orphan daughter of a brother brave but peter was adamant whatever answer the interpreter returned to gray eagle he never knew but to his alarm he presently found that the indian maiden little daybreak had been aware of gray eagles offer and had with pathetic simplicity already considered herself peters spouse during his stay at the encampment he found her sitting before his lodge every morning a girl of sixteen in years a child of six in intellect she flashed her little white teeth upon him when he lifted his tent flap content to receive his grave melancholy bow or patiently trotted at his side carrying things he did not want which she had taken from the lodge when he sat down to work she remained seated at a distance looking at him with glistening beady eyes like blackberries set in milk and softly scratching the little bare brown ankle of one foot with the turnedin toes of the other after an infantine fashion yet after he had lefta still single man solely though his interpreters diplomacy as he always believedhe was very worried as to the wisdom of his course why should he not in this way ally himself to his unfortunate race irrevocably perhaps there was an answer somewhere in his consciousness which he dared not voice to himself since his visit to the english atherlys he had put resolutely aside everything that related to that episode which he now considered was an unhappy imposture but there were times when a vision of lady elfrida gazing at him with wondering fascinated eyes passed across his fancy even the contact with his own race and his thoughts of their wrongs recalled to him the tomb of the soldier atherly and the carven captive savage supporter he could not pass the upright supported bier of an indian braveslowly desiccating in the desert airwithout seeing in the dead warriors paraphernalia of arms and trophies some resemblance to the crosslegged crusader on whose marble effigy she had girlishly perched herself as she told the story of her ancestors yet only the peaceful gloom and repose of the old church touched him now even she too with all her glory of english girlhood seemed to belong to that remote past she was part of the restful quiet of the church the yews in the quaint old churchyard might have waved over her as well  still he was eager to see his sister and if he should conclude to impart to her his secret she might advise him at all events he decided to delay his departure until her arrival a decision with which the commanding officer concurred as a foraging party had that morning discovered traces of indians in the vicinity of the fort and the lately arrived commissary train had reported the unaccountable but promptly prevented stampede  unfortunately his sister jenny appeared accompanied by her husband who seized an early opportunity to take peter aside and confide to him his anxiety about her health and the strange fits of excitement under which she occasionally labored remembering the episode of the californian woods three years ago peter stared at this goodnatured goodlooking man whose life he had always believed she once imperiled and wondered more than ever at their strange union  do you ever quarrel asked peter bluntly  no said the goodhearted fellow warmly never we have never had a harsh word shes the dearest girlthe best wife in the world to me buthe hesitated you know there are times when i think she confounds me with somebody else and is strange sometimes when we are in company she stands alone and stares at everybody without saying a word as if she didnt understand them or else she gets painfully excited and dances all night until she is exhausted i thought perhaps he added timidly that you might know and would tell me if she had any singular experience as a childany illness or he went on still more gently if perhaps her mother or father  no interrupted peter almost brusquely with the sudden conviction that this was no time for revelation of his secret no nothing  the doctor says continued lascelles with that hesitating almost mystic delicacy with which most gentlemen approach a subject upon which their wives talk openly that it may be owing to jennys peculiar state of health just now you know and that ifall went well you know and there should bedont you seea little child  peter interrupted him with a start a child jennys child silver clouds grandchild this was a complication he had not thought of no it was too late to tell his secret now he only nodded his head abstractedly and said coldly i dare say he is right  nevertheless jenny was looking remarkably well perhaps it was the excitement of travel and new surroundings but her tall lithe figure nearly half a head taller than her husbands was a striking one among the officers wives in the commandants sittingroom her olive cheek glowed with a faint illuminating color there was something even patrician in her slightly curved nose and high cheek bones and her smile rare even in her most excited moments was like her brothers singularly fascinating the officers evidently thought so too and when the young lieutenant of the commissary escort fresh from west point and flirtation walk gallantly attached himself to her the ladies were slightly scandalized at the naive air of camaraderie with which mrs lascelles received his attentions even peter was a little disturbed only lascelles delighted with his wifes animation and pleased at her success gazed at her with unqualified admiration indeed he was so satisfied with her improvement and so sanguine of her ultimate recovery that he felt justified in leaving her with her brother and returning to omaha by the regular mail wagon next day there was no danger to be apprehended in her accompanying peter they would have a full escort the reservation lay in a direction unfrequented by marauding tribes the road was the principal one used by the government to connect the fort with the settlements and well traveled the officers wives had often journeyed thither  the childish curiosity and high spirits which jenny showed on the journey to the reservation was increased when she reached it and drew up before the house of the indian agent peter was relieved he had been anxious and nervous as to any instinctive effect which might be produced on her excitable nature by a first view of her own kinsfolk although she was still ignorant of her relationship her interest and curiosity however had nothing abnormal in it but he was not prepared for the effect produced upon them at her first appearance a few of the braves gathered eagerly around her and one even addressed her in his own guttural tongue at which she betrayed a slight feeling of alarm and peter saw with satisfaction that she drew close to him knowing that his old interpreter and gray eagle were of a different and hostile tribe a hundred miles away and that his secret was safe with them he simply introduced her as his sister but he presently found that the braves had added to their curiosity a certain suspiciousness and sullen demeanor and he was glad to resign his sister into the hands of the agents wife while he prosecuted his business of examination and inspection later on his return to the cabin he was met by the agent who seemed to be with difficulty suppressing a laugh  your sister is exciting quite a sensation here he said do you know that some of these idiotic braves and the medicine man insist upon it that shes a squaw and that youre keeping her in captivity against your plighted faith to them youll excuse me he went on with an attempt to recover his gravity troubling you with their dd fool talk and you wont say anything to her about it but i thought you ought to know it on account of your position among em you dont want to lose their confidence and you know how easily their skeery faculties are stampeded with an idea  where is she now demanded peter with a darkening face  somewhere with the squaws i reckon i thought she might be a little skeered of the braves and ive kept them away shes all right you know only if you intend to stay here long id  but peter was already striding away in the direction of a thicket of cottonwood where he heard the ripple of womens and childrens voices when he had penetrated it he found his sister sitting on a stump surrounded by a laughing gesticulating crowd of young girls and old women with a tightly swaddled papoose in her lap some of them had already half mischievously half curiously possessed themselves of her dust cloak hat parasol and gloves and were parading before her in their grotesque finery apparently as much to her childish excited amusement as their own she was even answering their gesticulations with equivalent gestures in her attempt to understand them and trying amidst shouts of laughter to respond to the monotonous chant of the old women who were zigzagging a dance before her with the gayly striped blankets lying on the ground the strings of beads wampum and highly colored feathers hanging from the trees and the flickering lights and shadows it was an innocent and even idyllic picture but the more experienced peter saw in the performances only the uncertain temper and want of consecutive idea of playing animals and the stolid unwinking papoose in his sisters lap gave his sentiment a momentary shock  seeing him approach she ran to meet him the squaws and children slinking away from his grave face i have had such a funny time peter only to think of it i believe theyve never seen men or women with decent clothes beforeof course the settlers wives dont dress muchand i believe theyd have had everything i possess if you hadnt come but theyre too funny for anything it was killing to see them put on my hat wrong side before and try to make one out of my parasol but i like them a great deal better than those gloomy chiefs and i think i understand them almost and do you know peter somehow i seem to have known them all before and those dear little papooses arent they ridiculously lovely i only wishshe stopped for peter had somewhat hurriedly taken the indian boy from her arms and restored it to the frightened mother a singular change came over her face and she glanced at him quickly but she resumed with a heightened color i like it ever so much better here than down at the fort and ever so much better than new york i dont wonder that you like them so much peter and are so devoted to them dont be angry dear because i let them have my things im sure i never cared particularly for them and i think it would be such fun to dress as they do peter remembered keenly his sudden shock at her precipitate change to bright colors after leaving her novitiate at the sacred heart i do hope she went on eagerly that we are going to stay a long time here  we are leaving tomorrow he said curtly i find i have urgent business at the fort  and they did leave none too soon thought peter and the indian agent as they glanced at the faces of the dusky chiefs who had gathered around the cabin luckily the presence of their cavalry escort rendered any outbreak impossible and the stoical taciturnity of the race kept peter from any verbal insult but mrs lascelles noticed their lowering dissatisfaction and her eyes flashed i wonder you dont punish them she said simply  for a few days after their return she did not allude to her visit and peter was beginning to think that her late impressions were as volatile as they were childlike he devoted himself to his government report and while he kept up his communications with the reservation and the agent for the present domiciled himself at the fort  colonel bryce the commandant though doubtful of civilians was not slow to appreciate the difference of playing host to a man of atherlys wealth and position and even found in peters reserve and melancholy an agreeable relief to the somewhat boisterous and material recreations of garrison life and a gentle check upon the younger officers for while peter did not gamble or drink there was yet an unobtrusive and gentle dignity in his abstention that relieved him from the attitude of a prig or an example mrs lascelles was popular with the officers and accepted more tolerantly by the wives since they recognized her harmlessness once or twice she was found apparently interested in the gesticulations of a few friendlies who had penetrated the parade ground of the fort to barter beads and wampum the colonel was obliged at last to caution her against this as it was found that in her inexperience she had given them certain articles that were contraband of the rules and finally to stop them from an intrusion which was becoming more frequent and annoying left thus to herself she relieved her isolation by walks beyond the precincts of the garrison where she frequently met those friendly wanderers chiefly squaws and children here she was again cautioned by the commander  dont put too much faith in those creatures mrs lascelles  jenny elevated her black brows and threw up her arched nose like a charger im not afraid of old women and children she said loftily  but i am said the colonel gravely its a horrible thing to think of but these feeble old women and innocent children are always selected to torture the prisoners taken by the braves and by jove they seem to like it  thus restricted mrs lascelles fell back upon the attentions of lieutenant forsyth whose gallantry was always as fresh as his smart cadetlike tunics and they took some rides together whether it was military caution or the feminine discretion of the colonels wifeto the quiet amusement of the other officersa trooper was added to the riding party by the order of the colonel and thereafter it consisted of three one night however the riders did not appear at dinner and there was considerable uneasiness mingled with some gossip throughout the garrison it was already midnight before they arrived and then with horses blown and trembling with exhaustion and the whole party bearing every sign of fatigue and disturbance the colonel said a few sharp decisive words to the subaltern who pale and reticent plucked at his little moustache but took the whole blame upon himself he and mrs lascelles had he said outridden the trooper and got lost it was late when cassidy the trooper found them but it was no fault of his and they had to ride at the top of their speed to cover the ground between them and the fort it was noticed that mrs lascelles scarcely spoke to forsyth and turned abruptly away from the colonels interrogations and went to her room  peter absorbed in his report scarcely noticed the incident nor the singular restraint that seemed to fall upon the little military household for a day or two afterwards he had accepted the lieutenants story without comment or question he knew his own sister too well to believe that she had lent herself to a flirtation with forsyth indeed he had rather pitied the young officer when he remembered lascelles experience in his early courtship but he was somewhat astonished one afternoon to find the trooper cassidy alone in his office  oi thought oid make bould to have a word wid ye sorr he said recovering from a stiff salute with his fingers nipping the cord of his trousers its not for meeself sorr although the ould man was harrd on me nor for the leddy your sister but for the sake of the leftenant sorr who the ould man was harrdest on of all oi was of the parrty that rode with your sister  yes yes i remember i heard the story said peter she and mr forsyth got lost  axin your pardin sorr she didnt mr forsyth loid loid like an officer and a jintlemanas he is god bless himto save a leddy more betoken your sister sorr they never got lost sorr we was all three together from the toime we shtarted till we got back and its the love av god that we ever got back at all and its breaking me hearrt sorr to see him goin round with the black looks of everybody upon him and he atwirlin his moustache and purtending not to mind  what do you mean said peter uneasily  oi mane to be tellin you what happened sorr said cassidy stoutly when we shtarted out oi fell three files to the rear as became me so as not to be in the way o their colloguing but sorra a bit o stragglin was there and oi kept them afore me all the toime when we got to post oak bottom the leddy pints her whip off to the roight and sez she its a fine bit of turf there misther forsyth invitin like and with that she gallops away to the right the leftenant follys her and oi closed up the rear so we rides away innoshent like amongst the trees me thinkin only it wor a mighty queer place for manoovrin until we seed just beyond us in the hollow the smoke of an injin camp and a lot of women and childer and mrs lascelles gets off and goes to discoursin and blarneying wid em and oi sees mr forsyth glancin round and lookin oneasy then he goes up and sez something to your sister and she wont give him a hearin and then he tells her she must mount and be off and she turns upon him bedad like a tayger and bids him be off himself then he comes to me and sez he oi dont like the look o this cassidy sez he the woods behind is full of braves sez he thrue for you leftenant sez oi its into a trap that the leddy hez led us god save her whisht he sez take my horse its the strongest go beside her and when oi say the word lift her up into the saddle before ye and gallop like blazes oill bring up the rear and the other horse wid that we changed horses and cantered up to where she was standing and he gives the word when she isnt lookin and oi grabs her upshe sthrugglin like mad but not utterin a cryand oi lights out for the trail agin and sure enough the braves made as if they would folly but the leftenant throws the reins of her horse over the horn of his saddle and whips out his revolver and houlds em back till ive got well away to the trail again and then they let fly their arrows and begorra the next thing a bullet whizzes by him and then he knows they have arrms wid em and are hostiles and he rowls the nearest one over wheelin and fightin and coverin our retreat till we gets to the road agin and they darent folly us out of cover then the lady gets more sinsible and the leftenant pershuades her to mount her horse agin but before we comes to the fort he sez to me cassidy sez he not a word o this on account of the leddy and i was mum sorr while he was shootin off his mouth about him bein lost and all that and him bein bullyragged by the kernel and me knowin that but for him your sister wouldnt be between these walls here and oi wouldnt be talkin to ye and shure sorr ye might be tellins the kernel as how the leddy was took by the hysterics and was that loony that she didnt know whatever she was sayin and so get the leftenant in favor again  i will speak with the colonel tonight said peter gloomily  lord save yer honor returned the trooper gratefully and if ye could be sayin that the leddy tould youit would only be the merest taste of a loi yed be tellinand youd save me from breakin me word to the leftenant  i shall of course speak to my sister first returned peter with a guilty consciousness that he had accepted the troopers story mainly from his previous knowledge of his sisters character nevertheless in spite of this foregone conclusion he did speak to her to his surprise she did not deny it lieutenant forsytha vain and conceited foolwhose silly attentions she had accepted solely that she might get recreation beyond the forthad presumed to tell her what she must do as if she was one of those stupid officers wives or sisters and it never would have happened if hepeterhad let her remain at the reservation with the indian agents wife or if charley the gentle lascelles were here he would have let her go or taken her there besides all the while she was among friends his peters own friendsthe people whose cause he was championing in vain did peter try to point out to her that these people were still children in mind and impulse and capable of vacillation or even treachery he remembered he was talking to a child in mind and impulse who had shown the same qualities and in trying to convince her of her danger he felt he was only voicing the common arguments of his opponents  he spoke also to the colonel excusing her through her ignorance her trust in his influence with the savages and the general derangement of her health the colonel relieved of his suspicions of a promising young officer was gentle and sympathetic but firm as to peters future course in a moment of caprice and willfulness she might imperil the garrison as she had her escort and more than that she was imperiling peters influence with the indians absurd stories had come to his ears regarding the attitude of the reservation towards him he thought she ought to return home as quickly as possible fortunately an opportunity offered the general commanding had advised him of the visit to the fort of a party of english tourists who had been shooting in the vicinity and who were making the fort the farthest point of their western excursion there were three or four ladies in the party and as they would be returning to the line of railroad under escort she could easily accompany them this added colonel carter was also mrs carters opinionshe was a woman of experience and had a married daughter of her own in the mean time peter had better not broach the subject to his sister but trust to the arrival of the strangers who would remain for a week and who would undoubtedly divert mrs lascelles impressible mind and eventually make the proposition more natural and attractive  in the interval peter revisited the reservation and endeavored to pacify the irritation that had sprung from his previous inspection the outrage at post oak bottom he was assured had no relation to the incident at the reservation but was committed by some stragglers from other tribes who had not yet accepted the government bounty yet had not been thus far classified as hostile there had been no ghost dancing nor other indication of disturbance the colonel had not deemed it necessary to send out an exemplary force or make a counter demonstration the incident was allowed to drop at the reservation peter had ignored the previous conduct of the chiefs towards him had with quiet courage exposed himself fullyunarmed and unattendedamongst them and had as fully let it be known that this previous incident was the reason that his sister had not accompanied him on his second visit he left them at the close of the second day more satisfied in his mind and perhaps in a more enthusiastic attitude towards his report  as he came within sound of the sunset bugles he struck a narrower trail which led to the fort through an oasis of oaks and cottonwoods and a small stream or branch which afterwards lost itself in the dusty plain he had already passed a few settlers cabins a sutlers shop and other buildings that had sprung up around this armed nucleus of civilizationwhich in due season was to become a frontier town but as yet the brief wood was wild and secluded frequented only by the women and children of the fort within whose protecting bounds it stood and to whose formal parade and trim white and green cottage quarters it afforded an agreeable relief as he rode abstractedly forward under the low cottonwood vault he felt a strange influence stealing over him an influence that was not only a present experience but at the same time a faroff memory the concave vault above deepened the sunset light from the level horizon beyond streamed through the leaves as through the chequers of stained glass windows through the two shafts before him stretched the pillared aisles of ashley church he was riding as in a dream and when a figure suddenly slipped across his pathway from a columnlike tree trunk he woke with the disturbance and sense of unreality of a dream for he saw lady elfrida standing before him  it was not a mere memory conjured up by association for although the figure face and attitude were the same there were certain changes of costume which the eye of recollection noticed in place of the smart narrowbrimmed sailor hat he remembered she was wearing a slouched cavalry hat with a gold cord around its crown that with all its becomingness and picturesque audacity seemed to become characteristic and respectable as a crest to her refined head and as historic as a lely canvas she wore a flannel shirt belted in at her slight waist with a band of yellow leather defining her small hips and short straight pleatless skirts that fell to her trim ankles and buckled leather shoes she was fresh and cool wholesome and clean free and unfettered indeed her beauty seemed only an afterthought or accident so much so that when peter saw her afterwards amidst the billowy gauzy and challenging graces of the officers wives who were dressed in their best and prettiest frocks to welcome her the eye turned naturally from that suggestion of enhancement to the girl who seemed to defy it she was clearly not an idealized memory a spirit or a ghost but naturalistic and rosy he thought a trifle rosier as she laughingly addressed him  i suppose it isnt quite fair to surprise you like that she said with an honest girlish handshake for you see i know all about you now and what you are doing here and even when you were expected and i dare say you thought we were still in england if you remembered us at all and we havent met since that day at ashley church when i put my foot in itor rather on your pet proteges the indians you remember major atherlys tomb and to think that all the while we didnt know that you were a public man and a great political reformer and had a fad like this why wed have got up meetings for you and my father would have presidedhes always fond of doing these thingsand wed have passed resolutions and given you subscriptions and bibles and flannel shirts and revolversbut i believe you draw the line at that my brother was saying only the other day that you werent half praised enough for going in for this sort of thing when you were so rich and neednt care and so thats why you rushed away from ashley grangejust to come here and work out your mission  his whole life his first wild californian dream his english visit the revelation of gray eagle the final collapse of his old beliefs were whirling through his brain to the music of this clear young voice and by some cruel irony of circumstance it seemed now to even mock his later dreams of expiation as it also called back his unhappy experience of the last week  have youhave youhe stammered with a faint smile seen my sister  not yet said lady elfrida i believe she is not well and is confined to her room you will introduce me wont you she added eagerly of course when we heard that there was an atherly here we inquired about you and i told them you were a relation of ours she went on with a halfmischievous shynessyou remember the de bracysand they seemed surprised and rather curious i suppose one does not talk so much about these things over here and i dare say you have so much to occupy your mind you dont talk of us in england with the quickness of a refined perception she saw a slight shade in his face and changed the subject and we have had such a jolly time we have met so many pleasant people and theyve all been so awfully good to us from the officials and officers down to the plainest workingman and all so naturally tooso different from us i sometimes think we have to work ourselves up to be civil to strangers no she went on gayly in answer to his protesting gesture and his stammered reminder of his own reception no you came as a sort of kinsman and sir edward knew all about you before he asked you down to the grangeor even sent over for me from the towers no you americans take people on their face value as my brother reggy says and we always want to know what are the securities and then american men are more gallant though she declared mischievously i think you are an exception in that way indeed she went on the more i see of your countrymen the less you seem like them you are more like usmore like an englishmanindeed more like an englishman than most englishmeni mean in the matter of reserve and all that sort of thing you know its oddisnt it is your sister like you  you shall judge for yourself said peter with a gayety that was forced in proportion as his forebodings became more gloomy would his sisters peculiaritieseven her secretbe safe from the clear eyes of the young girl  i know i shall like her said lady elfrida simply i mean to make friends with her before we leave and i hope to see a great deal of her and she said with a naive non sequitur that however had its painful significance to peter i do want you to show me some indiansyour indians you know your friends ive seen some of them of course i am afraid i am a little prejudiced for i did not like them you see my taste has to be educated i suppose but i thought them so foolishly vain and presuming  that is their perfect childishness said peter quickly it is not i believe considered a moral defect he added bitterly  lady elfrida laughed and yet at the same moment a look of appeal that was in itself quite as childlike shone in her blue eyes there i have blundered again i know but i told you i have such ridiculous prejudices and i really want to like them as you do only she laughed again it seems strange that you of all men should have interested yourself in people so totally different to you but what will be the result if your efforts are successful will they remain a distinct race will you make citizens soldiers congressmen governors of them will they intermarry with the whites is that a part of your plan i hope not  it was a part of peters sensitive excitement that even through the unconscious irony of this speech he was noticing the difference between the young english girls evident interest in a political problem and the utter indifference of his own countrywomen here was a girl scarcely out of her teens with no pretension to being a blue stocking with half the aplomb of an american girl of her own age gravely considering a question of political economy oddly enough it added to his other irritation and he said almost abruptly why not  she took the question literally and with a little youthful timidity but these mixed races never attain to anything do they i thought that was understood but she added with feminine quickness and i suppose its again only a personal argument you wouldnt like your sister to have married an indian would you  the irony of the situation had reached its climax to peter it didnt seem to be his voice that said i can answer by an argument still more personal i have even thought myself of marrying an indian woman  it seemed to him that what he said was irrevocable but he was desperate it seemed to him that in a moment more he would have told her his whole secret but the young girl drew back from him with a slight start of surprise there may have been something in the tone of his voice and in his manner that verged upon a seriousness she was never contemplating in her random talk it may have been an uneasiness of some youthful imprudence in pressing the subject upon a man of his superiority and that his abrupt climax was a rebuke but it was only for a moment her youthful buoyancy and above all a certain common sense that was not incompatible to her high nature came to her rescue but that she said with quick mischievousness would be a sacrifice taken in the interest of these people dont you see and being a sacrifice its no argument  peter saw his mistake but there was something so innocent and delightful in the youthful triumph of this redlipped logician that he was forced to smile i have said that his smile was rare and fascinating a concession wrung from his dark face and calm beardless lips that most people found irresistible but it was odd nevertheless that lady elfrida now for the first time felt a sudden and not altogether unpleasant embarrassment over the very subject she had approached with such innocent fearlessness there was a new light in her eyes a fresher color in her cheeks as she turned her faceshe knew not whyaway from him but it enabled her to see a figure approaching them from the fort and i grieve to say that perhaps for the first time in her life lady elfrida was guilty of an affected start  oh heres reggy coming to look for me id quite forgotten but im so glad i want you to know my brother reggy he was always so sorry he missed you at the grange  the tall young goodlooking brown englishman who had sauntered up bestowed a far more critical glance upon peters horse than upon peter but nevertheless grasped his hand heartily as his sister introduced him perhaps both men were equally undemonstrative although the reserve of one was from temperament and the other from education nevertheless lord reginald remarked with a laugh that it was awfully jolly to be there and that it had been a beastly shame that he was in scotland when atherly was at the grange that none of them had ever suspected till they came to the fort that he atherly was one of those government chappies and so awfully keen on indian politics friddy had been the first to find it out but they thought she was chaffing at which friddy who had suddenly resolved herself into the youthfulest of schoolgirls in the presence of her brother put her parasol like an indian club behind her back and still rosy beamed admiringly upon reggy then the three peter leading his horse moved on towards the fort presently meeting georgy the sixfoot guardsman cousin in extraordinary tweeds and flannel shirt lord runnybroke uncle of friddy middleaged and flannelshirted a mighty hunter lady runnybroke in a brown duster but with a stately head that suggested ostrich feathers moylerspence m p with an eyeglass and the hon evelyn kayne closely attended by the always gallant lieutenant forsyth peter began to feel a nervous longing to be alone on the burning plain and the empty horizon beyond them until he could readjust himself to these new conditions and glanced halfwearily around him but his eye met friddys who seemed to have evoked this gathering with a wave of her parasol like the fairy of a pantomime and he walked on in silence  a day or two of unexpected pleasure passed for peter in these new surroundings he found he could separate lady elfrida from his miserable past and the conventional restraint of ashley grange again the revelation of her familiar name friddy seemed to make her more accessible and human to him than her formal title and suited the girlish simplicity that lay at the foundation of her character of which he had seen so little before at least so he fancied and so excused himself it was delightful to find her referring to him as an older friend pleasant indeed to see that her family tacitly recognized it and frequently appealed to him with the introduction friddy says you can tell us or you and friddy had better arrange it between you even the dreaded introduction of his sister was an agreeable surprise owing to lady elfridas frank and sympathetic prepossession which jenny could not resist in a few moments they were walking together in serious and apparently confidential conversation for to peters wonder it was the lady elfrida side of the english girls nature that seemed to have attracted jenny and not the playfulness of friddy and he was delighted to see that the young girl had assumed a grave chaperonship of the tall mrs lascelles that would have done credit to mrs carter or lady runnybroke had he been less serious he might have been amused too at the importance of his own position in the military outpost through the arrival of the strangers that this grave political enthusiast and civilian should be on familiar terms with a young englishwoman of rank was at first inconceivable to the officers and that he had never alluded to it before seemed to them still more remarkable  nevertheless there was much liveliness and good fellowship at the fort captains and lieutenants down to the youngest cub forsyth vied with each other to please the englishmen supplied them with that characteristic american humor and anecdote which it is an englishmans privilege to bring away with him and were picturesquely and chivalrously devoted in their attentions to the ladies who were pleased and amused by it though it is to be doubted if it increased their respect for the giver although they were more grateful for it than the average american woman lady elfrida found the officers very entertaining and gallant accustomed to the english officer and his somewhat bored way of treating his profession and his duties she may have been amused at the zeal earnestness and enthusiasm of these youthful warriors who aspired to appear as nothing but soldiers when she contrasted them with her guardsmen relatives who aspired to be everything else but that but she kept it to herself it was a recognized respectable and even superior occupation for gentlemen in england what it might be in americawho knows she certainly found peter the civilian more attractive for there really was nothing english to compare him with and she had something of the same feeling in her friendship for jenny except the patronage which jenny seemed to solicit and perhaps require as a foreigner  one afternoon the english guests accompanied by a few of their hosts and a small escort were making a shooting expedition to the vicinity of green spring when peter plunged in his report looked up to find his sister entering his office her face was pale and there was something in her expression which reawakened his old anxiety nevertheless he smiled and said gently  why are you not enjoying yourself with the others  i have a headache she said languidly but lifting her eyes suddenly to his why are you not you are their good friend you knoweven their relation  no more than you are he returned with affected gayety but look at the reportit is only half finished i have already been shirking it for them  you mustnt let your devotion to the indians keep you from your older friends said mrs lascelles with an odd laugh but you never told me about these people before peter tell me now they were very kind to you werent they on account of your relationship  entirely on account of that said peter with a sudden bitterness he could not repress but they are very pleasant he added quickly and very simple and unaffected in spite of their rank perhaps i ought to say because of it  you mean they are kind to us because they feel themselves superiorjust as you are kind to the indians peter  i am afraid they have no such sense of political equality towards us jenny as impels me to be just to the indian he said with affected lightness but lady elfrida sympathizes with the indiansvery much  she the emphasis which his sister put upon the personal pronoun was unmistakable but peter ignored it and so apparently did she as she said the next moment in a different voice shes very pretty dont you think  very said peter coldly  there was a long pause peter slightly fingered one of the sheets of his delayed report on his desk his sister looked up im afraid im as bad as lady elfrida in keeping you from your indians but i had something to say to you no matter another time will do when youre not so busy  please go on now said peter with affected unconcern yet with a feeling of uneasiness creeping over him  it was only this said jenny seating herself with her elbow on the desk and her chin in a cuplike hollow of her hand did you ever think that in the interests of these poor indians you know purely for the sake of your belief in them and just to show that you were above vulgar prejudicesdid you ever think you could marry one of them  two thoughts flashed quickly on peters mindfirst that lady elfrida had repeated something of their conversation to his sister secondly that some one had told her of little daybreak each was equally disturbing but he recovered himself quickly and said i might if i thought it was required but even a sacrifice is not always an example  then you think it would be a sacrifice she said slowly raising her dark eyes to his  if i did something against received opinion against precedent and for aught i know against even the prejudices of those i wish to serve however lofty my intention was and however great the benefit to them in the end it would still be a sacrifice in the present he saw his own miserable logic and affected didactics but he went on lightly but why do you ask such a question you havent any one in your mind for me have you  she had risen thoughtfully and was moving towards the door suddenly she turned with a quick odd vivacity perhaps i had oh peter there was such a lovely little squaw i saw the last time i was at oak bottom she was no darker than i am but so beautiful even in her little cotton gown and blanket with only a string of beads around her throat she was as pretty as any one here and i dare say she could be educated and appear as well as any white woman i should so like to have you see her i would have tried to bring her to the fort but the braves are very jealous of their wives or daughters seeing white men you know and i was afraid of the colonel  she had spoken volubly and with a strange excitement but even at the moment her face changed again and as she left the office with a quick laugh and parting gesture there were tears in her eyes  accustomed to her moods and caprices peter thought little of the intrusion relieved as he was of his first fears she had come to him from loneliness and curiosity and perhaps he thought with a sad smile from a little sisterly jealousy of the young girl who had evinced such an interest in him and had known him before he took up his pen and continued the interrupted paragraph of his report  i am satisfied that much of the mischievous and extravagant prejudice against the half breed and all alliances of the white and red races springs from the ignorance of the frontiersman and his hasty generalization of facts there is no doubt that an intermixture of blood brings out purely superficial contrasts the more strongly and that against the civilizing habits and even costumes of the half breed certain indian defects appear the more strongly as in the case of the color line of the quadroon and octoroon but it must not be forgotten that these are only the contrasts of specific improvement and the inference that the borrowed defects of a half breed exceed the original defects of the fullblooded aborigine is utterly illogical he stopped suddenly and laid down his pen with a heightened color the bugle had blown the guard was turning out to receive the commandant and his returning party among whom was friddy    through the illusions of depression and distance the sink of butternut creek seemed only an incrustation of blackish moss on the dull gray plain it was not until one approached within half a mile of it that it resolved itself into a copse of butternuttrees sunken below the distant levels here once in geological story the waters of butternut creek despairing of ever crossing the leagues of arid waste before them had suddenly disappeared in the providential interposition of an area of looser soil and so given up the effort and the ghost forever their grave being marked by the butternut copse chancesown by bird or beast in the saturated ground in indian legend the sink commemorated the equally providential escape of a great tribe who surrounded by enemies appealed to the great spirit for protection and was promptly conveyed by subterraneous passages to the banks of the great river a hundred miles away its outer edges were already invaded by the dust of the plain but within them ran cool recesses a few openings and the ashes of some longforgotten campfires today its sombre shadows were relieved by bright colored dresses the jackets of the drivers of a large sutlers wagon whose white canvas head marked the entrance of the copse and all the paraphernalia of a picnic it was a party gotten up by the foreign guests to the ladies of the fort prepared and arranged by the active lady elfrida assisted by the only gentleman of the party peter atherly who from his acquaintance with the locality was allowed to accompany them the other gentlemen who with a large party of officers and soldiers were shooting in the vicinity were sufficiently near for protection they would rejoin the ladies later  it does not seem in the least as if we were miles away from any town or habitation said lady runnybroke complacently seating herself on a stump and i shouldnt be surprised to see a church tower through those trees its very like the hazel copse at longworth you know not at all what i expected  for the matter of that neither are the indians said the hon evelyn rayne did you ever see such grotesque creatures in their castoff boots and trousers theyre no better than gypsies i wonder what mr atherly can find in them  and he a rich man toothey say hes got a mine in california worth a millionto take up a craze like this added the lively mrs captain joyce thats what gets me you know she went on confidentially that cranks and reformers are always poorits quite natural but i dont see what he a rich man expects to make by his reforms im sure  hell get over it in time said the hon evelyn kayne they all do at least he expects to get the reforms he wants in a year and then hes coming over to england again  indeed how very nice responded lady runnybroke quickly did he say so  no but friddy says he is  the two officers wives glanced at each other lady runnybroke put up her eyeglass in default of ostrich feathers and said didactically im sure mr atherly is very much in earnest and sincerely devoted to his work and in a man of his wealth and position here its most estimable my dear she said getting up and moving towards mrs lascelles we were just saying how good and unselfish your brother was in his work for these poor people  but jenny lascelles must have been in one of those abstracted moods which so troubled her husband for she seemed to be staring straight before her into the recesses of the wood in her there was a certain resemblance to the attitude of a listening animal  i wish mr atherly was a little more unselfish to us poor people said the hon evelyn kayne for he and friddy have been nearly an hour looking for a place to spread our luncheon baskets i wish theyd leave the future of the brown races to look after itself and look a little more after us im famished  i fancy they find it difficult to select a clear space for so large a party as we will be when the gentlemen come in returned lady runnybroke glancing in the direction of jennys abstracted eyes  i suppose you must feel like chicken and salad too lady runnybroke suggested mrs captain joyce  i dont think i quite know how chicken and salad feel dear said lady runnybroke with a puzzled air but if thats one of your husbands delightful american stories do tell us i never can get runnybroke to tell me any although he roars over them all and i dare say he gets them all wrong but look here comes our luncheon  peter and lady elfrida were advancing towards them the scrutiny of a dozen pairs of eyeswondering mischievous critical impertinent or resentfulwould have been a trying ordeal to any errant couple but there was little if any change in peters grave and gentle demeanor albeit his dark eyes were shining with a peculiar light and lady elfrida had only the animation color and slight excitability that became the responsible leader of the little party they neither apologized or alluded to their delay they had selected a spot on the other side of the copse and the baskets could be sent around by the wagon they had seen a slight haze on the plain towards the east which betokened the vicinity of the rest of the party and they were about to propose that as the gentlemen were so near they had better postpone the picnic until they came up lady runnybroke smiled affably the only thing she had noticed was that lady elfrida in joining them had gone directly to the side of the abstracted jenny and placed her arm around her waist at which lady runnybroke airily joined them  the surmises of peter and friddy appeared to be correct the transfer of the provisions and the party to the other side was barely concluded before they could see the gentlemen coming they were riding a little more rapidly than when they had set out and were arriving fully three hours before their time they burst upon the ladies a little boisterously but gayly they had had a glorious time but little sport they had hurried back to join the ladies so as to be able to return with them betimes they were ravenously hungry they wanted to fall to at once only the officers wives noticed that the two files of troopers did not dismount but filed slowly before the entrance to the woods lady elfrida as hostess was prettily distressed by it but was told by captain joyce that it was against rules and that she could feed them at the fort the officers wives put a few questions in whispers and were promptly frowned down nevertheless the luncheon was a successful festivity the gentlemen were loud in the praises of their gracious hostess the delicacies she had provided by express from distant stations and much that was distinctly english and despoiled from her own stores were gratefully appreciated by the officers of a remote frontier garrison lady elfridas health was toasted by the gallant colonel in a speech that was the soul of chivalry lord runnybroke responded perhaps without the american abandon but with the steady conscientiousness of an hereditary legislator but the m p summed up a slightly exaggerated but well meaning episode by pointing out that it was on occasions like this that the two nations showed their common ancestry by standing side by side only one thing troubled the rosy excited but still clearheaded friddy the plates were whisked away like magic after each delicacy by the military servants and vanished the tables were in the same mysterious way cleared as rapidly as they were set and any attempt to recall a dish was met by the declaration that it was already packed away in the wagon as they at last rose from the actually empty board and saw even the tables disappear lady elfrida plaintively protested that she felt as if she had been presiding over an arabian nights entertainment served by genii and she knew that they would all awaken hungry when they were well on their way back nevertheless in spite of this expedition the officers lounged about smoking until every trace of the festivity had vanished reggy found himself standing near peter you know he said confidentially i dont think the colonel has a very high opinion of your petsthe indians and by jove if the friendlies are as nasty towards you as they were to us this morning i wonder what you call the hostile tribes  did you have any difficulty with them said peter quickly  no not exactly dont you knowwe were too many i fancy but by jove the beggars whenever we met themand we met one or two gypsy bands of themyou know they seemed to look upon us as trespassers dont you know  and you were in point of fact said peter smiling grimly  oh i say come now said reggy opening his eyes after a moment he laughed oh yes i seeof course looking at it from their point of view by jove i dare say the beggars were right you know all the samedont you seeyour people were poaching too  so we were said peter gravely  but here at a word from the major the whole party debouched from the woods everything appeared to be awaiting themthe large covered carryall for the guests and the two saddle horses for mrs lascelles and lady elfrida who had ridden there together peter also mounted accompanied the carryall with two of the officers the troopers and wagons brought up the rear  it was very hot with little or no wind on this part of the plain the dust seemed lighter and finer and rose with the wheels of the carryall and the horses of the escort trailing a white cloud over the cavalcade like the smoke of an engine over a train it was with difficulty the troopers could be kept from opening out on both sides of the highway to escape it the whole atmosphere seemed charged with it it even appeared in a long bank to the right rising and obscuring the declining sun but they were already within sight of the fort and the little copse beside it then trooper cassidy trotted up to the colonel who was riding in a dusty cloud beside the carryall captain fleetwoods compliments sorr and there are two sthragglersmrs lascelles and the english lady he pointed to the rapidly flying figures of jenny and friddy making towards the wood  the colonel made a movement of impatience tell mr forsyth to bring them back at once he said  but here a feminine chorus of excuses and expostulations rose from the carryall its only mrs lascelles going to show friddy where the squaws and children bathe said lady runnybroke its near the fort and theyll be there as quick as we shall  one moment colonel said peter with mortified concern its another folly of my sisters pray let me take it upon myself to bring them back  very well but see you dont linger and turning to cassidy as peter galloped away he added you follow him  peter kept the figures of the two women in view but presently saw them disappear in the wood he had no fear for their safety but he was indignant at this last untimely caprice of his sister he knew the idea had originated with her and that the officers knew it and yet she had made lady elfrida bear an equal share of the blame he reached the edge of the copse entered the first opening but he had scarcely plunged into its shadow and shut out the plain behind him before he felt his arms and knees quickly seized from behind so sudden and unexpected was the attack that he first thought his horse had stumbled against a coil of wild grapevine and was entangled but the next moment he smelled the rank characteristic odor and saw the brown limbs of the indian who had leaped on his crupper while another rose at his horses head then a warning voice in his ear said in the native tongue  if the great white medicine man calls to his fighting men the palefaced girl and the squaw he calls his sister die they are here he understands  but peter had neither struggled nor uttered a cry at that touch and with the accents of that tongue in his ears all his own indian blood seemed to leap and tingle through his veins his eyes flashed pinioned as he was he drew himself erect and answered haughtily in his captors own speech  good the great white medicine man obeys for he and his sister have no fear but if the paleface girl is not sent back to her people before the sun sets then the yellow jackets will swarm the woods and they will follow her trail to the death my brother is wise let the girl go i have spoken  my brother is very cunning too he would call to his fighting men through the lips of the paleface girl  he will not the great white medicine man does not lie to his red brother he will tell the paleface girl to say to the chief of the yellow jackets that he and his sister are with his brothers and all is peace but the paleface girl must not see the great white medicine man in these bonds nor as a captive i have spoken  the two indians fell back there was so much of force and dignity in the man so much of their own stoic calmness that they at once mechanically loosened the thongs of plaited deer hide with which they had bound him and side by side led him into the recesses of the wood    there was some astonishment although little alarm at the fort when lady elfrida returned accompanied by the orderly who had followed peter to the wood but without peter and his sister the reason given was perfectly natural and conceivable mrs lascelles had preceded lady elfrida in entering the wood and taken another opening so that lady elfrida had found herself suddenly lost and surrounded by two or three warriors in dreadful paint they motioned her to dismount and said something she did not understand but she declined knowing that she had heard mr atherly and the orderly following her and feeling no fear and sure enough mr atherly presently came up with a couple of braves apologized to her for their mistake but begged her to return to the fort at once and assure the colonel that everything was right and that he and his sister were safe he was perfectly cool and collected and like himself she blushed slightly as she said she thought that he wished to impress upon her for some reason she could not understand that he did not want the colonel to send any assistance she was positive of that she told her story unexcitedly it was evident that she had not been frightened but lady runnybroke noticed that there was a shade of anxious abstraction in her face  when the officers were alone the colonel took hurried counsel of them i think said captain fleetwood that lady elfridas story quite explains itself i believe this affair is purely a local one and has nothing whatever to do with the suspicious appearances we noticed this afternoon or the presence of so large a body of indians near butternut had this been a hostile movement they would have scarcely allowed so valuable a capture as lady elfrida to escape them  unless they kept atherly and his sister as a hostage said captain joyce  but atherly is one of their friends indeed he is their mediator and apostle a noncombatant and has their confidence returned the colonel it is much more reasonable to suppose that atherly has noticed some disaffection among these friendlies and he fears that our sending a party to his assistance might precipitate a collision or he may have reason to believe that this stopping of the two women under the very walls of the fort is only a feint to draw our attention from something more serious did he know anything of our suspicions of the conduct of those indians this morning  not unless he gathered it from what lord reginald foolishly told him we said nothing of course returned captain fleetwood with a soldiers habitual distrust of the wisdom of the civil arm  that will do gentlemen said the colonel as the officers dispersed send cassidy here  the colonel was alone on the veranda as cassidy came up  you followed mr atherly today  yes sorr  and you saw him when he gave the message to the young lady  yes sorr  did you form any opinion from anything else you saw of his object in sending that message  only from what i saw of him  well what was that  i saw him look afther the young leddy as she rode away and then wheel about and go straight back into the wood  and what did you think of that said the colonel with a half smile  i thought it was shacrifice sorr  what do you mean said the colonel sharply  i mane sorr said cassidy stoutly that he was givin up hisself and his sister for that young leddy  the colonel looked at the sergeant ask mr forsyth to come to me privately and return here with him  as darkness fell some half a dozen dismounted troopers headed by forsyth and cassidy passed quietly out of the lower gate and entered the wood an hour later the colonel was summoned from the dinner table and the guests heard the quick rattle of a wagon turning out of the road gatebut the colonel did not return an indefinable uneasiness crept over the little party which reached its climax in the summoning of the other officers and the sudden flashing out of news the reconnoitring party had found the dead bodies of peter atherly and his sister on the plains at the edge of the empty wood  the women were gathered in the commandants quarters and for the moment seemed to have been forgotten the officers wives talked with professional sympathy and disciplined quiet the english ladies were equally sympathetic but collected lady elfrida rather white but patient asked a few questions in a voice whose contralto was rather deepened one and all wished to do somethinganything to helpand one and all rebelled that the colonel had begged them to remain within doors there was an occasional quick step on the veranda or the clatter of a hoof on the parade a continued but subdued murmur from the whitewashed barracks but everywhere a sense of keen restraint  when they emerged on the veranda again the whole aspect of the garrison seemed to have changed in that brief time in the faint moonlight they could see motionless files of troopers filling the parade the officers in belted tunics and slouched hatsbut apparently not the same men the half lounging ease and lazy dandyism gone a grim tension in all their faces a set abstraction in all their acts then there was the rolling of heavy wheels in the road and the two horses of the ambulance appeared the sentries presented arms the colonel took off his hat the officers uncovered the wagon wheeled into the parade the surgeon stepped out he exchanged a single word with the colonel and lifted the curtain of the ambulance  as the colonel glanced within a deep but embarrassed voice fell upon his ear he turned quickly it was lord reginald flushed and sympathetic  he was a frienda relation of ours you know he stammered my sister would liketo look at him again  not now said the colonel in a low voice the surgeon added something in a voice still lower which scarcely reached the veranda  lord reginald turned away with a white face  fall back there captain fleetwood rode up  all ready sir  one moment captain said the colonel quietly file your first half company before that ambulance and bid the men look in  the singular order was obeyed the men filed slowly forward each in turn halting before the motionless wagon and its immobile freight they were men inured to frontier bloodshed and savage warfare some halted and hurried on others lingered others turned to look again one man burst into a short laugh but when the others turned indignantly upon him they saw that in his face that held them in awe what they saw in the ambulance did not transpire what they felt was not known strangely enough however what they repressed themselves was mysteriously communicated to their horses who snorted and quivered with eagerness and impatience as they rode back again the horse of the trooper who had laughed almost leaped into the air only sergeant cassidy was communicative he took a larger circuit in returning to his place and managed to lean over and whisper hoarsely in the ear of a camp follower spectator tell the young leddy that the torturin divvils couldnt take the smile off him  the little column filed out of the gateway into the road as captain fleetwood passed colonel carter the two mens eyes met the colonel said quietly good night captain let us have a good report from you  the captain replied only with his gauntleted hand against the brim of his slouched hat but the next moment his voice was heard strong and clear enough in the road the little column trotted away as evenly as on parade but those who climbed the roof of the barracks a quarter of an hour later saw in the moonlight a white cloud drifting rapidly across the plain towards the west it was a small cloud in that bare menacing cruel and illimitable waste but in its breast was crammed a thunderbolt  it fell thirty miles away blasting and scattering a thousand warriors and their camp giving and taking no quarter vengeful exterminating and complete later there were different opinions about it and the horrible crime that had provoked it the opposers of peters policy jubilant over the irony of the assassination of the apostle of peace peters disciples as actively deploring the merciless and indiscriminating vengeance of the military and so the problem that peter had vainly attempted to solve was left an open question there were those too who believed that peter had never sacrificed himself and his sister for the sake of another but had provoked and incensed the savages by the blind arrogance of a reformer there were wild stories by scouts and interpreters how he had challenged his fate by an indian bravado how himself and his sister had met torture with an indian stoicism and how the indian braves themselves at last in a turmoil of revulsion had dipped their arrows and lances in the heroic hearts blood of their victims and worshiped their still palpitating flesh  but there was one honest loyal little heart that carried backthree thousand milesto england the man as it had known and loved him lady elfrida runnybroke never married neither did she go into retirement but lived her life and fulfilled her duties in her usual cleareyed fashion she was particularly kind to all americansbarring i fear a few prettyfaced finelyfrocked titlehunterstold stories of the far west and had theories of a people of which they knew little cared less and believed to be vulgar but i think she found a new pleasure in the old church at ashley grange and loved to linger over the effigy of the old crusaderher kinsman the swashbuckler de bracywith a vague but pretty belief that devotion and love do not die with brave men but live and flourish even in lands beyond the seas     two americans   perhaps if there was anything important in the migration of the maynard family to europe it rested solely upon the singular fact that mr maynard did not go there in the expectation of marrying his daughter to a nobleman a charleston merchant whose house represented two honorable generations had thirty years ago a certain selfrespect which did not require extraneous aid and foreign support and it is exceedingly probable that his intention of spending a few years abroad had no ulterior motive than pleasure seeking and the observation of many thingsprincipally of the pastwhich his own country did not possess his future and that of his family lay in his own land yet with practical common sense he adjusted himself temporarily to his new surroundings in doing so he had much to learn of others and others had something to learn of him he found that the best people had a high simplicity equal to his own he corrected their impressions that a southerner had more or less negro blood in his veins and that although a slave owner he did not necessarily represent an aristocracy with a distinguishing dialect of which he was not ashamed a frank familiarity of approach joined to an invincible courtesy of manner which made even his republican sir equal to the ordinary address to royalty he was always respected and seldom misunderstood when he wasit was unfortunate for those who misunderstood him his type was as distinctive and original as his cousins the englishman whom it was not the fashion then to imitate so that whether in the hotel of a capital the kursaal of a spa or the humbler pension of a swiss village he was always characteristic less so was his wife who with the chameleon quality of her transplanted countrywomen was already parisian in dress still less so his daughter who had by this time absorbed the peculiarities of her french german and italian governesses yet neither had yet learned to evade their nationalityor apologize for it  mr maynard and his family remained for three years in europe his stay having been prolonged by political excitement in his own state of south carolina commerce is apt to knock the insularity out of people distance from ones own distinctive locality gives a wider range to the vision and the retired merchant foresaw ruin in his states politics and from the viewpoint of all europe beheld instead of the usual collection of individual stateshis whole country but the excitement increasing he was finally impelled to return in a faint hope of doing something to allay it taking his wife with him but leaving his daughter at school in paris at about this time however a single cannon shot fired at the national flag on fort sumter shook the whole country reverberated even in europe sending some earnest hearts back to do battle for state or country sending others less earnest into inglorious exile but saddest of all knocking over the school bench of a girl at the paris pensionnat for that shot had also sunk maynards ships at the charleston wharves scattered his piled cotton bales awaiting shipment at the quays and drove him a ruined man into the home guard against his better judgment helen maynard like a good girl had implored her father to let her return and share his risks but the answer was to wait until this nine days madness of an uprising was over that madness lasted six years outlived maynard whose gray misdoubting head bit the dust at balls bluff outlived his colorless widow and left kelly a penniless orphan  yet enough of her country was left in her to make her courageous and independent of her past they say that when she got the news she cried a little and then laid the letter and what was left of her last monthly allowance in madame ablas lap madame was devastated but you impoverished and desolated angel what of you i shall get some of it back said the desolated angel with ingenuous candor for i speak better french and english than the other girls and i shall teach them until i can get into the conservatoire for i have a voice you yourself have told papa so from such angelic directness there was no appeal madame ablas had a heartmore she had a french manageresss discriminating instinct the american schoolgirl was installed in a teachers desk her bosom friends and fellow students became her pupils to some of the richest and they were mainly of her own country she sold her smartest latest dresses jewels and trinkets at a very good figure and put the money away against the conservatoire in the future she worked hard she endured patiently everything but commiseration id have you know miss she said to miss de laine daughter of the famous house of musslin de laine  co of new york that whatever my position here may be it is not one to be patronized by a tapesellers daughter my case is not such a very sad one thank you and i prefer not to be spoken of as having seen better days by people who havent there dont rap your desk with your pencil when you speak to me or i shall call out cash before the whole class so regrettable an exhibition of temper naturally alienated certain of her compatriots who were unduly sensitive of their origin and as they formed a considerable colony who were then reveling in the dregs of the empire and the last orgies of a tottering court eventually cost her her place a republican so aristocratic was not to be tolerated by the trueborn americans who paid court to de morny for the phosphorescent splendors of st cloud and the tuileries and miss helen lost their favor but she had already saved enough money for the conservatoire and a little attic in a very tall house in a narrow street that trickled into the ceaseless flow of the rue lafayette here for four years she trotted backwards and forwards regularly to work with the freshness of youth and the inflexible set purpose of maturity here rain or shine summer or winter in the mellow season when the large cafes expanded under the white sunshine into an overflow of little tables on the pavement or when the red glow of the brasserie shone through frosty panes on the turnedup collars of pinched parisians who hurried by she was always to be seen  half paris had looked into her clear gray eyes and passed on a smaller and not very youthful portion of paris had turned and followed her with small advantage to itself and happily no fear to her for even in her young womanhood she kept her childs loving knowledge of that great city she even had an innocent camaraderie with street sweepers kiosk keepers and lemonade venders and the sternness of conciergedom melted before her in this wholesome practical childs experience she naturally avoided or overlooked what would not have interested a child and so kept her freshness and a certain national shrewd simplicity invincible there is a story told of her girlhood that one day playing in the tuileries gardens she was approached by a gentleman with a waxed mustache and a still more waxen cheek beneath his heavylidded eyes there was an exchange of polite amenities  and your name ma petite  helen responded the young girl naively whats yours  ah said the kind gentleman gallantly pulling at his mustache if you are helen i am paris  the young girl raised her clear eyes to his and said gravely i reckon your majesty is france  she retained this childish fearlessness as the poor student of the conservatoire went alone all over paris with her maiden skirts untarnished by the gilded dust of the boulevards or the filth of byways knew all the best shops for her friends and the cheapest for her own scant purchases discovered breakfasts for a few sous with pale sempstresses whose sadness she understood and reckless chorus girls whose gayety she didnt she knew where the earliest chestnut buds were to be found in the bois when the slopes of the buttes chaumont were green and which was the old woman who sold the cheapest flowers before the madeleine alone and independent she earned the affection of madame bibelot the concierge and what was more her confidence her outgoings and incomings were never questioned the little american could take care of herself ah if her son jacques were only as reasonable miss maynard might have made more friends had she cared she might have joined hands with the innocent and lighthearted poverty of the coterie of her own artistic compatriots but something in her blood made her distrust bohemianism her poverty was something to her too sacred for jest or companionship her own artistic aim was too long and earnest for mere temporary enthusiasms she might have found friends in her own profession her professor opened the sacred doors of his family circle to the young american girl she appreciated the delicacy refinement and cheerful equal responsibilities of that household so widely different from the accepted anglosaxon belief but there were certain restrictions that rightly or wrongly galled her american habits of girlish freedom and she resolutely tripped past the first etage four or five flights higher to her attic the free sky and independence here she sometimes met another kind of independence in monsieur alphonse aged twenty two and she who ought to have been madame alphonse aged seventeen and they often exchanged greetings on the landing with great respect towards each other and oddly enough no confusion or distrait later they even borrowed each others matches without fear and without reproach until one day monsieur alphonses parents took him away and the desolated soidisant madame alphonse in a cheerful burst of confidence gave helen her private opinion of monsieur and from her seventeen years experience warned the american infant of twenty against possible similar complications  one dayit was near the examination for prizes and her funds were running lowshe was obliged to seek one of those humbler restaurants she knew of for her frugal breakfast but she was not hungry and after a few mouthfuls left her meal unfinished as a young man entered and half abstractedly took a seat at her table she had already moved towards the comptoir to pay her few sous when chancing to look up in a mirror which hung above the counter reflecting the interior of the cafe she saw the stranger after casting a hurried glance around him remove from her plate the broken roll and even the crumbs she had left and as hurriedly sweep them into his pockethandkerchief there was nothing very strange in this she had seen something like it before in these humbler cafesit was a crib for the birds in the tuileries gardens or the poor artists substitute for rubber in correcting his crayon drawing but there was a singular flushing of his handsome face in the act that stirred her with a strange pity made her own cheek hot with sympathy and compelled her to look at him more attentively the back that was turned towards her was broadshouldered and symmetrical and showed a frame that seemed to require stronger nourishment than the simple coffee and roll he had ordered and was devouring slowly his clothes well made though worn fitted him in a smart soldierlike way and accentuated his decided military bearing the singular use of his left hand in lifting his cup made her uneasy until a slight movement revealed the fact that his right sleeve was empty and pinned to his coat he was onearmed she turned her compassionate eyes aside yet lingered to make a few purchases at the counter as he paid his bill and walked away but she was surprised to see that he tendered the waiter the unexampled gratuity of a sou perhaps he was some eccentric englishman he certainly did not look like a frenchman  she had quite forgotten the incident and in the afternoon had strolled with a few fellow pupils into the galleries of the louvre it was copyingday and as her friends loitered around the easels of the different students with the easy consciousness of being themselves artists she strolled on somewhat abstractedly before them her own art was too serious to permit her much sympathy with another and in the chatter of her companions with the young painters a certain levity disturbed her suddenly she stopped she had reached a less frequented room there was a single easel at one side but the stool before it was empty and its late occupant was standing in a recess by the window with his back towards her he had drawn a silk handkerchief from his pocket she recognized his square shoulders she recognized the handkerchief and as he unrolled it she recognized the fragments of her mornings breakfast as he began to eat them it was the onearmed man  she remained so motionless and breathless that he finished his scant meal without noticing her and even resumed his place before the easel without being aware of her presence the noise of approaching feet gave a fresh impulse to her own and she moved towards him but he was evidently accustomed to these interruptions and worked on steadily without turning his head as the other footsteps passed her she was emboldened to take a position behind him and glance at his work it was an architectural study of one of canalettos palaces even her inexperienced eyes were struck with its vigor and fidelity but she was also conscious of a sense of disappointment why was he notlike the otherscopying one of the masterpieces becoming at last aware of a motionless woman behind him he rose and with a slight gesture of courtesy and a halfhesitating vous verrez mieux la mademoiselle moved to one side  thank you said miss maynard in english but i did not want to disturb you  he glanced quickly at her face for the first time ah you are english he said  no i am american  his face lightened so am i  i thought so she said  from my bad french  no because you did not look up to see if the woman you were polite to was old or young  he smiled and you mademoiselleyou did not murmur a compliment to the copy over the artists back  she smiled too yet with a little pang over the bread but she was relieved to see that he evidently had not recognized her you are modest she said you do not attempt masterpieces  oh no the giants like titian and corregio must be served with both hands i have only one he said half lightly half sadly  but you have been a soldier she said with quick intuition  not much only during our waruntil i was compelled to handle nothing larger than a palette knife then i came home to new york and as i was no use there i came here to study  i am from south carolina she said quietly with a rising color  he put his palette down and glanced at her black dress yes she went on doggedly my father lost all his property and was killed in battle with the northerners i am an orphana pupil of the conservatoire it was never her custom to allude to her family or her lost fortunes she knew not why she did it now but something impelled her to rid her mind of it to him at once yet she was pained at his grave and pitying face  i am very sorry he said simply then after a pause he added with a gentle smile at all events you and i will not quarrel here under the wings of the french eagles that shelter us both  i only wanted to explain why i was alone in paris she said a little less aggressively  he replied by unhooking his palette which was ingeniously fastened by a strap over his shoulder under the missing arm and opened a portfolio of sketches at his side perhaps they may interest you more than the copy which i have attempted only to get at this mans method they are sketches i have done here  there was a buttress of notre dame a black arch of the pont neuf part of an old courtyard in the faubourg st germainall very fresh and striking yet with the recollection of his poverty in her mind she could not help saying but if you copied one of those masterpieces you know you could sell it there is always a demand for that work  yes he replied but these help me in my line which is architectural study it is perhaps not very ambitious he added thoughtfully but brightening up again i sell these sketches too they are quite marketable i assure you  helens heart sank again she remembered now to have seen such sketchesshe doubted not they were hisin the cheap shops in the rue poissoniere ticketed at a few francs each she was silent as he patiently turned them over suddenly she uttered a little cry  he had just uncovered a little sketch of what seemed at first sight only a confused cluster of roof tops dormer windows and chimneys level with the skyline but it was bathed in the white sunshine of paris against the blue sky she knew so well there too were the gritty crystals and rust of the tiles the red brown and greenish mosses of the gutters and lower down the more vivid colors of geraniums and pansies in flowerpots under the white dimity curtains which hid the small panes of garret windows yet every sordid detail touched and transfigured with the poetry and romance of youth and genius  you have seen this she said  yes it is a study from my window one must go high for such effects you would be surprised if you could see how different the air and sunshine  no she interrupted gently i have seen it  you he repeated gazing at her curiously  helen ran the point of her slim finger along the sketch until it reached a tiny dormer window in the lefthand corner halfhidden by an irregular chimneystack the curtains were closely drawn keeping her finger upon the spot she said interrogatively and you saw that window  yes quite plainly i remember it was always open and the room seemed empty from early morning to evening when the curtains were drawn  it is my room she said simply  their eyes met with this sudden confession of their equal poverty and mine he said gayly from which this view was taken is in the rear and still higher up on the other street  they both laughed as if some singular restraint had been removed helen even forgot the incident of the bread in her relief then they compared notes of their experiences of their different concierges of their housekeeping of the cheap stores and the cheaper restaurants of parisexcept one she told him her name and learned that his was philip or if she pleased major ostrander suddenly glancing at her companions who were ostentatiously lingering at a little distance she became conscious for the first time that she was talking quite confidentially to a very handsome man and for a brief moment wished she knew not why that he had been plainer this momentary restraint was accented by the entrance of a lady and gentleman rather distingue in dress and bearing who had stopped before them and were eying equally the artist his work and his companion with somewhat insolent curiosity helen felt herself stiffening her companion drew himself up with soldierly rigidity for a moment it seemed as if under that banal influence they would part with ceremonious continental politeness but suddenly their hands met in a national handshake and with a frank smile they separated  helen rejoined her companions  so you have made a conquest of the recently acquired but unknown greek statue said mademoiselle renee lightly you should take up a subscription to restore his arm ma petite if there is a modern sculptor who can do it you might suggest it to the two russian cognoscenti who have been hovering around him as if they wanted to buy him as well as his work madame la princesse is rich enough to indulge her artistic taste  it is a countryman of mine said helen simply  he certainly does not speak french said mademoiselle mischievously  nor think it responded helen with equal vivacity nevertheless she wished she had seen him alone  she thought nothing more of him that day in her finishing exercises but the next morning as she went to open her window after dressing she drew back with a new consciousness and then making a peephole in the curtain looked over the opposite roofs she had seen them many times before but now they had acquired a new picturesqueness which as her view was of course the reverse of the poor painters sketch must have been a transfigured memory of her own then she glanced curiously along the line of windows level with hers all these however with their occasional revelations of the menage behind them were also familiar to her but now she began to wonder which was his a singular instinct at last impelled her to lift her eyes higher in the corner house and so near the roof that it scarcely seemed possible for a grown man to stand upright behind it was an oeil de boeuf looking down upon the other roofs and framed in that circular opening like a vignette was the handsome face of major ostrander his eyes seemed to be turned towards her window her first impulse was to open it and recognize him with a friendly nod but an odd mingling of mischief and shyness made her turn away quickly  nevertheless she met him the next morning walking slowly so near her house that their encounter might have been scarcely accidental on his part she walked with him as far as the conservatoire in the light of the open street she thought he looked pale and hollowcheeked she wondered if it was from his enforced frugality and was trying to conceive some elaborate plan of obliging him to accept her hospitality at least for a single meal when he said  i think you have brought me luck miss maynard  helen opened her eyes wonderingly  the two russian connoisseurs who stared at us so rudely were pleased however to also stare at my work they offered me a fabulous sum for one or two of my sketches it didnt seem to me quite the square thing to old favel the picturedealer whom i had forced to take a lot at one fifteenth the price so i simply referred them to him  no said miss helen indignantly you were not so foolish  ostrander laughed  im afraid what you call my folly didnt avail for they wanted what they saw in my portfolio  of course said helen why that sketch of the housetop alone was worth a hundred times more than what youshe stopped she did not like to reveal what he got for his pictures and added more than what any of those usurers would give  i am glad you think so well of it for i do not mean to sell it he said simply yet with a significance that kept her silent  she did not see him again for several days the preparation for her examination left her no time and her earnest concentration in her work fully preoccupied her thoughts she was surprised but not disturbed on the day of the awards to see him among the audience of anxious parents and relations miss helen maynard did not get the first prize nor yet the second an accessit was her only award she did not know until afterwards that this had long been a foregone conclusion of her teachers on account of some intrinsic defect in her voice she did not know until long afterwards that the handsome painters nervousness on that occasion had attracted even the sympathy of some of those who were near him for she herself had been calm and collected no one else knew how crushing was the blow which shattered her hopes and made her three years of labor and privation a useless struggle yet though no longer a pupil she could still teach her master had found her a small patronage that saved her from destitution that night she circled up quite cheerfully in her usual swallow flight to her nest under the eaves and even twittered on the landing a little over the condolences of the conciergewho knew mon dieu what a beast the director of the conservatoire was and how he could be bribed but when at last her brown head sank on her pillow she criedjust a little  but what was all this to that next morningthe glorious spring morning which bathed all the roofs of paris with warmth and hope rekindling enthusiasm and ambition in the breast of youth and gilding even much of the sordid dirt below it seemed quite natural that she should meet major ostrander not many yards away as she sallied out in that bright spring sunshine and the hopeful spring of their youth they even laughed at the previous days disappointment ah what a claque it was after all for himself he ostrander would much rather see that satinfaced parisian girl who had got the prize smirking at the critics from the boards of the grand opera than his countrywoman the conservatoire settled things for paris but paris wasnt the world america would come to the fore yet in art of all kindsthere was a free academy there nowthere should be a conservatoire of its own of course paris schooling and paris experience werent to be despised in art but thank heaven she had that and no directors could take it from her this and much more until comparing notes they suddenly found that they were both free for that day why should they not take advantage of that rare weather and rarer opportunity to make a little suburban excursion but where there was the bois but that was still paris fontainebleau too far there were always artists sketching in the forest and he would like for that day to sink the shop versailles ah yes versailles  thither they went it was not new to either of them ostrander knew it as an artist and as an american reader of that french historic romancea reader who hurried over the sham intrigues of the oeil de boeuf the sham pastorals of the petit trianon and the sham heroics of a shifty court to get to lafayette helen knew it as a child who had dodged these lessons from her patriotic father but had enjoyed the woods the parks the terraces and particularly the restaurant at the park gates that day they took it like a boy and girlwith the amused omniscient tolerance of youth for a past so inferior to the present ostrander thought this grayeyed independent americanfrench girl far superior to the obsequious filles dhonneur whose brocades had rustled through those quinquonces and helen vaguely realized the truth of her fellow pupils mischievous criticism of her companion that day at the louvre surely there was no classical statue here comparable to the onearmed soldierpainter  all this was as yet free from either sentiment or passion and was only the frank pride of friendship but oddly enough their mere presence and companionship seemed to excite in others that tenderness they had not yet felt themselves family groups watched the handsome pair in their innocent confidences and with french exuberant recognition of sentiment thought them the incarnation of love something in their manifest equality of condition kept even the vainest and most susceptible of spectators from attempted rivalry or cynical interruption and when at last they dropped side by side on a sunwarmed stone bench on the terrace and helen inclining her brown head towards her companion informed him of the difficulty she had experienced in getting gumbo soup rice and chicken corn cakes or any of her favorite home dishes in paris an exhausted but gallant boulevardier rose from a contiguous bench and politely lifting his hat to the handsome couple turned slowly away from what he believed were tender confidences he would not permit himself to hear  but the shadow of the trees began to lengthen casting broad bars across the alle and the sun sank lower to the level of their eyes they were quite surprised on looking around a few moments later to discover that the gardens were quite deserted and ostrander on consulting his watch found that they had just lost a train which the other pleasureseekers had evidently availed themselves of no matter there was another train an hour later they could still linger for a few moments in the brief sunset and then dine at the local restaurant before they left they both laughed at their forgetfulness and then without knowing why suddenly lapsed into silence a faint wind blew in their faces and trilled the thin leaves above their heads nothing else moved the long windows of the palace in that sunset light seemed to glisten again with the incendiary fires of the revolution and then went out blankly and abruptly the two companions felt that they possessed the terrace and all its memories as completely as the shadows who had lived and died there  i am so glad we have had this day together said the painter with a very conscious breaking of the silence for i am leaving paris tomorrow  helen raised her eyes quickly to his  for a few days only he continued my russian customersperhaps i ought to say my patronshave given me a commission to make a study of an old chateau which the princess lately bought  a swift recollection of her fellow pupils raillery regarding the princesss possible attitude towards the painter came over her and gave a strange artificiality to her response  i suppose you will enjoy it very much she said dryly  no he returned with the frankness that she had lacked id much rather stay in paris but he added with a faint smile its a question of money and that is not to be despised yet iisomehow feel that i am deserting youleaving you here all alone in paris  ive been all alone for four years she said with a bitterness she had never felt before and i suppose im accustomed to it  nevertheless she leaned a little forward with her fawncolored lashes dropped over her eyes which were bent upon the ground and the point of the parasol she was holding with her little gloved hands between her knees he wondered why she did not look up he did not know that it was partly because there were tears in her eyes and partly for another reason as she had leaned forward his arm had quite unconsciously moved along the back of the bench where her shoulders had rested and she could not have resumed her position except in his half embrace  he had not thought of it he was lost in a greater abstraction that infinite tendernessfar above a womansthe tenderness of strength and manliness towards weakness and delicacy the tenderness that looks down and not up was already possessing him an instinct of protection drew him nearer this bowed but charming figure and if he then noticed that the shoulders were pretty and the curves of the slim waist symmetrical it was rather with a feeling of timidity and a halfconsciousness of unchivalrous thought yet why should he not try to keep the brave and honest girl near him always why should he not claim the right to protect her why should they notthey who were alone in a strange landjoin their two lonely lives for mutual help and happiness  a sudden perception of delicacy the thought that he should have spoken before her failure at the conservatoire had made her feel her helplessness brought a slight color to his cheek would it not seem to her that he was taking an unfair advantage of her misfortune yet it would be so easy now to slip a loving arm around her waist while he could work for her and protect her with the other the other his eye fell on his empty sleeve ah he had forgotten that he had but one arm  he rose up abruptlyso abruptly that helen rising too almost touched the arm that was hurriedly withdrawn yet in that accidental contact which sent a vague tremor through the young girls frame there was still time for him to have spoken but he only said  perhaps we had better dine  she assented quicklyshe knew not whywith a feeling of relief they walked very quietly and slowly towards the restaurant not a word of love had been spoken not even a glance of understanding had passed between them yet they both knew by some mysterious instinct that a crisis of their lives had come and gone and that they never again could be to each other as they were but a brief moment ago they talked very sensibly and gravely during their frugal meal the previous spectator of their confidences would have now thought them only simple friends and have been as mistaken as before they talked freely of their hopes and prospectsall save one they even spoke pleasantly of repeating their little expedition after his return from the country while in their secret hearts they had both resolved never to see each other again yet by that sign each knew that this was love and were proud of each others pride which kept it a secret  the train was late and it was past ten oclock when they at last appeared before the concierge of helens home during their journey and while passing though the crowds at the station and in the streets ostrander had exhibited a new and grave guardianship over the young girl and on the first landing after a scrutinizing and an almost fierce glance at one or two of helens odd fellow lodgers he had extended his protection so far as to accompany her up the four flights to the landing of her apartment here he took leave of her with a grave courtesy that half pained half pleased her she watched his broad shoulders and dangling sleeve as he went down the stairs and then quickly turned entered her room and locked the door the smile had faded from her lips going to the window she pressed her hot forehead against the cool glass and looked out upon the stars nearly level with the black roofs around her she stood there some moments until another star appeared higher up against the roof ridge the star she was looking for but here the glass pane before her eyes became presently dim with moisture she was obliged to rub it out with her handkerchief yet somehow it soon became clouded at which she turned sharply away and went to bed  but miss helen did not know that when she had looked after the retreating figure of her protector as he descended the stairs that night that he was really carrying away on those broad shoulders the character she had so laboriously gained during her four years solitude for when she came down the next morning the concierge bowed to her with an air of easy cynical abstraction the result of a long conversation with his wife the night before he had taken helens part with a kindly cynicism ah what would youit was bound to come the affair of the conservatoire had settled that the poor child could not starve penniless she could not marry only why consort with other swallows under the eaves when she could have had a gilded cage on the first etage but girls were so foolishin their first affair then it was always love the second time they were wiser and this maimed warrior and painter was as poor as she a compatriot too well perhaps that saved some scandal one could never know what the americans were accustomed to do the first floor which had been inclined to be civil to the young teacher was more so but less respectful one or two young men were tentatively familiar until they looked in her gray eyes and remembered the broad shoulders of the painter oddly enough only mademoiselle fifine of her own landing exhibited any sympathy with her and for the first time helen was frightened she did not show it however only she changed her lodgings the next day but before she left she had a few moments conversation with the concierge and an exchange of a word or two with some of her fellow lodgers i have already hinted that the young lady had great precision of statement she had a pretty turn for handling colloquial french and an incisive knowledge of french character she left no 34 rue de frivole working itself into a white rage but utterly undecided as to her real character  but all this and much more was presently blown away in the hot breath that swept the boulevards at the outburst of the francogerman war and miss helen maynard disappeared from paris with many of her fellow countrymen the excitement reached even a quaint old chateau in brittany where major ostrander was painting the woman who was standing by his side as he sat before his easel on the broad terrace observed that he looked disturbed  what matters she said gently you have progressed so well in your work that you can finish it elsewhere i have no great desire to stay in france with a frontier garrisoned by troops while i have a villa in switzerland where you could still be my guest paris can teach you nothing more my friend you have only to create nowand be famous  i must go to paris he said quietly i have friendscountrymenthere who may want me now  if you mean the young singer of the rue de frivole you have compromised her already you can do her no good  madame  the pretty face which he had been familiar with for the past six weeks somehow seemed to change its character under the mask of dazzling skin he fancied he saw the high cheekbones and square tartar angle the brilliant eyes were even brighter than before but they showed more of the white than he had ever seen in them  nevertheless she smiled with an equally stony revelation of her white teeth yet said still gently forgive me if i thought our friendship justified me in being frankperhaps too frank for my own good  she stopped as if half expecting an interruption but as he remained looking wonderingly at her she bit her lip and went on you have a great career before you those who help you must do so without entangling you a chain of roses may be as impeding as lead until you are independent youwho may in time compass everything yourselfwill need to be helped you know she added with a smile you have but one arm  in your kindness and appreciation you have made me forget it he stammered yet he had a swift vision of the little bench at versailles where he had not forgotten it and as he glanced around the empty terrace where they stood he was struck with a fateful resemblance to it  and i should not remind you now of it she went on except to say that money can always take its place as in the fairy story the prince must have a new arm made of gold she stopped and then suddenly coming closer to him said hurriedly and almost fiercely can you not see that i am advising you against my interestsagainst myself go then to paris and go quickly before i change my mind only if you do not find your friends there remember you have always one here before he could reply or even understand that white face she was gone  he left for paris that afternoon he went directly to the rue de frivole his old resolution to avoid helen was blown to the winds in the prospect of losing her utterly but the concierge only knew that mademoiselle had left a day or two after monsieur had accompanied her home and pointedly there was another gentleman who had inquired eagerlyand bountifully as far as money wentfor any trace of the young lady it was a russe the concierge smiled to himself at ostranders flushed cheek it served this onearmed conceited american poseur right mademoiselle was wiser in this second affair  ostrander did not finish his picture the princess sent him a cheque which he coldly returned nevertheless he had acquired through his russian patronage a local fame which stood him well with the picture dealersin spite of the excitement of the war but his heart was no longer in his work a fever of unrest seized him which at another time might have wasted itself in mere dissipation some of his fellow artists had already gone into the army after the first great reverses he offered his one arm and his military experience to that paris which had given him a home the old fighting instinct returned to him with a certain desperation he had never known before in the sorties from paris the onearmed american became famous until a few days before the capitulation when he was struck down by a bullet through the lung and left in a temporary hospital here in the whirl and terror of commune days he was forgotten and when paris revived under the republic he had disappeared as completely as his compatriot helen  but miss helen maynard had been only obscured and not extinguished at the first outbreak of hostilities a few americans had still kept giddy state among the ruins of the tottering empire a day or two after she left the rue de frivole she was invited by one of her wealthy former schoolmates to assist with her voice and talent at one of their extravagant entertainments you will understand dear said miss de laine with ingenious delicacy as she eyed her old comrades wellworn dress that poppa expects to pay you professional prices and it may be an opening for you among our other friends  i should not come otherwise dear said miss helen with equal frankness but she played and sang very charmingly to the fashionable assembly in the champs elyseesso charmingly indeed that miss de laine patronizingly expatiated upon her worth and her better days in confidence to some of the guests  a most deserving creature said miss de laine to the dowager duchess of soho who was passing through paris on her way to england you would hardly believe that poppa knew her father when he was one of the richest men in south carolina  your father seems to have been very fortunate said the duchess quietly and so are you introduce me  this not being exactly the reply that miss de laine expected she momentarily hesitated but the duchess profited by it to walk over to the piano and introduce herself when she rose to go she invited helen to luncheon with her the next day come early my dear and well have a long talk helen pointed out hesitatingly that she was practically a guest of the de laines ah well thats true my dear then you may bring one of them with you  helen went to the luncheon but was unaccompanied she had a long talk with the dowager i am not rich my dear like your friends and cannot afford to pay ten napoleons for a song like you i have seen better days but this is no place for you child and if you can bear with an old womans company for a while i think i can find you something to do that evening helen left for england with the duchess a piece of ingratitude indelicacy and shameless snobbery which miss de laine was never weary of dilating upon and to think i introduced her though she was a professional    it was three years after paris reviving under the republic had forgotten helen and the american colony and the american colony emigrating to more congenial courts had forgotten paris  it was a bleak day of english summer when helen standing by the window of the breakfastroom at hamley court and looking over the wonderful lawn kept perennially green by humid english skies heard the practical masculine voice of the duchess in her ear at the same moment that she felt the gentle womanly touch of her hand on her shoulder  we are going to luncheon at moreland hall today my dear  why we were there only last week said helen  undoubtedly returned the duchess dryly and we may luncheon there next week and the next following and she added looking into her companions gray eyes it rests with you to stay there if you choose  helen stared at her protector  my dear continued the duchess slipping her arm around helens waist sir james has honored meas became my relations to youwith his confidences as you havent given me yours i suppose you have none and that i am telling you news when i say that sir james wishes to marry you  the unmistakable astonishment in the girls eye satisfied the duchess even before her voice  but he scarcely knows me or anything of me said the young girl quickly  on the contrary my dear he knows everything about you i have been particular in telling him all i knowand some things even you dont know and couldnt tell him for instance that you are a very nice person come my dear dont look so stupefied or i shall really think theres something in it that i dont know its not a laughing nor a crying matter yetat present its only luncheon again with a civil man who has three daughters and a place in the county dont make the mistake however of refusing him before he offerswhatever you do afterwards  butstammered helen  butyou are going to say that you dont love him and have never thought of him as a husband interrupted the duchess i read it in your faceand its a very proper thing to say  it is so unexpected urged helen  everything is unexpected from a man in these matters said the duchess we women are the only ones that are prepared  but persisted helen if i dont want to marry at all  i should say then that it is a sign that you ought if you were eager my dear i should certainly dissuade you she paused and then drawing helen closer to her said with a certain masculine tenderness as long as i live dear you know that you have a home here but i am an old woman living on the smallest of settlements death is as inevitable to me as marriage should be to you  nevertheless they did not renew the conversation and later received the greetings of their host at moreland hall with a simplicity and frankness that were however perfectly natural and unaffected in both women sir jamesa tall wellpreserved man of middle age with the unmistakable bearing of long years of recognized and unchallenged positionhowever exhibited on this occasion that slight consciousness of weakness and susceptibility to ridicule which is apt to indicate the invasion of the tender passion in the heart of the average briton his duty as host towards the elder woman of superior rank however covered his embarrassment and for a moment left helen quite undisturbed to gaze again upon the treasures of the long drawingroom of moreland hall with which she was already familiar there were the halfdozen old masters whose respectability had been as recognized through centuries as their owners ancestors there were the ancestors themselveswigged ruffled and whitehanded by vandyke lely romney and gainsborough there were the uniform expressionless ancestresses in stiff brocade or shortwaisted clinging draperies but all possessing that brilliant coloring which the gray skies outside lacked and which seemed to have departed from the dresses of their descendants the american girl had sometimes speculated upon what might have been the appearance of the limetree walk dotted with these gayly plumaged folk and wondered if the tyranny of environment had at last subdued their brilliant colors and a new feeling touched her like most of her countrywomen she was strongly affected by the furniture of life the thought that all that she saw there might be hers that she might yet stand in succession to these strange courtiers and stranger shepherdesses and like them look down from the canvas upon the intruding foreigner thrilled her for a moment with a halfproud halfpassive sense of yielding to what seemed to be her fate a narroweyed stiffhaired dutch maid of honor before whom she was standing gazed at her with staring vacancy suddenly she started before the portrait upon a fanciful easel stood a small elaborately framed sketch in oils it was evidently some recently imported treasure she had not seen it before as she moved quickly forward she recognized at a glance that it was ostranders sketch from the paris grenier  the wall the room the park beyond even the gray sky seemed to fade away before her she was standing once more at her attic window looking across the roofs and chimney stacks upward to the blue sky of paris through a gap in the roofs she could see the chestnuttrees trilling in the little square she could hear the swallows twittering in the leaden troughs of the gutter before her the call of the chocolate vender or the cry of a gamin floated up to her from the street below or the latest song of the cafe chantant was whistled by the bluebloused workman on the scaffolding hard by the breath of paris of youth of blended work and play of ambition of joyous freedom again filled her and mingled with the scent of the mignonette that used to stand on the old windowledge  i am glad you like it i have only just put it up  it was the voice of sir jamesa voice that had regained a little of its naturalnessa calm even lazy english voiceconfident from the experience of years of respectful listeners yet it somehow jarred upon her nerves with its complacency and its utter incongruousness to her feelings nevertheless the impulse to know more about the sketch was the stronger  do you mean you have just bought it asked helen its not english  no said sir james gratified with his companions interest i bought it in paris just after the commune  from the artist continued helen in a slightly constrained voice  no said sir james although i knew the poor chap well enough you can easily see that he was once a painter of great promise i rather think it was stolen from him while he was in hospital by those incendiary wretches i recognized it however and bought for a few francs from them what i would have paid him a thousand for  in hospital repeated helen dazedly  yes said sir james the fact is it was the ending of the usual bohemian artists life though in this case the man was a real artistand i believe by the way was a countryman of yours  in hospital again repeated helen then he was poor  reckless i should rather say he threw himself into the fighting before paris and was badly wounded but it was all the result of the usual love affairthe girl they say ran off with the usual richer man at all events it ruined him for painting he never did anything worth having afterwards  and now said helen in the same unmoved voice  sir james shrugged his shoulders he disappeared probably hell turn up some day on the london pavementwith chalks that sketch by the way was one that had always attracted me to his studiothough he never would part with it i rather fancy dont you know that the girl had something to do with it its a wonderfully realistic sketch dont you see and i shouldnt wonder if it was the girl herself who lived behind one of those queer little windows in the roof there  she did live there said helen in a low voice  sir james uttered a vague laugh helen looked around her the duchess had quietly and unostentatiously passed into the library and in full view though out of hearing was examining with her glass to her eye some books upon the shelves  i mean said helen in a perfectly clear voice that the young girl did not run away from the painter and that he had neither the right nor the cause to believe her faithless or attribute his misfortunes to her she hesitated not from any sense of her indiscretion but to recover from a momentary doubt if the girl were really her own selfbut only for a moment  then you knew the painter as i did he said in astonishment  not as you did responded helen she drew nearer the picture and pointing a slim finger to the canvas said  do you see that small window with the mignonette  perfectly  that was my room his was opposite he told me so when i first saw the sketch i am the girl you speak of for he knew no other and i believe him to have been a truthful honorable man  but what were you doing there surely you are joking said sir james with a forced smile  i was a poor pupil at the conservatoire and lived where i could afford to live  alone  alone  and the man was  major ostrander was my friend i even think i have a better right to call him that than you had  sir james coughed slightly and grasped the lapel of his coat of course i dare say i had no idea of this dont you know when i spoke he looked around him as if to evade a scene ah suppose we ask the duchess to look at the sketch i dont think shes seen it he began to move in the direction of the library  she had better wait said helen quietly  for what  untilhesitated helen smilingly  until i am afraid i dont understand said sir james stiffly coloring with a slight suspicion  until you have apologized  of course said sir james with a halfhysteric laugh i do you understand i only repeated a story that was told me and had no idea of connecting you with it i beg your pardon im sure i ererin fact he added suddenly the embarrassed smile fading from his face as he looked at her fixedly i remember now it must have been the concierge of the house or the opposite one who told me he said it was a russian who carried off that young girl of course it was some madeup story  i left paris with the duchess said helen quietly before the war  of course and she knows all about your friendship with this man  i dont think she does i havent told her why should i returned helen raising her clear eyes to his  really i dont know stammered sir james but here she is of course if you prefer it i wont say anything of this to her  helen gave him her first glance of genuine emotion it happened however to be scorn  how odd she said as the duchess leisurely approached them her glass still in her eye sir james quite unconsciously has just been showing me a sketch of my dear old mansarde in paris look that little window was my room and only think of it sir james bought it of an old friend of mine who painted it from the opposite attic where he lived and quite unconsciously too  how very singular said the duchess indeed quite romantic  very said sir james  very said helen  the tone of their voices was so different that the duchess looked from one to the other  but that isnt all said helen with a smile sir james actually fancied  will you excuse me for a moment said sir james interrupting and turning hastily to the duchess with a forced smile and a somewhat heightened color i had forgotten that i had promised lady harriet to drive you over to deep hill after luncheon to meet that south american who has taken such a fancy to your place and i must send to the stables  as sir james disappeared the duchess turned to helen i see what has happened dear dont mind me for i frankly confess i shall now eat my luncheon less guiltily than i feared but tell me how did you refuse him  i didnt refuse him said helen i only prevented his asking me  how  then helen told her alleverything except her first meeting with ostrander at the restaurant a true woman respects the pride of those she loves more even than her own and while helen felt that although that incident might somewhat condone her subsequent romantic passion in the duchesss eyes she could not tell it  the duchess listened in silence  then you two incompetents have never seen each other since she asked  no  but you hope to  i cannot speak for him said helen  and you have never written to him and dont know whether he is alive or dead  no  then i have been nursing in my bosom for three years at one and the same time a brave independent matteroffact young person and the most idiotic sentimental heroine that ever figured in a romantic opera or a country ballad helen did not reply well my dear said the duchess after a pause i see that you are condemned to pass your days with me in some cheap hotel on the continent helen looked up wonderingly yes she continued i suppose i must now make up my mind to sell my place to this gilded south american who has taken a fancy to it but i am not going to spoil my day by seeing him now no we will excuse ourselves from going to deep hill today and we will go back home quietly after luncheon it will be a mercy to sir james  but said helen earnestly i can go back to my old life and earn my own living  not if i can help it said the duchess grimly your independence has made you a charming companion to me i admit but i shall see that it does not again spoil your chances of marrying here comes sir james really my dear i dont know which one of you looks the more relieved  on their way back through the park helen again urged the duchess to give up the idea of selling hamley court and to consent to her taking up her old freedom and independence once more i shall never never forget your loving kindness and protection continued the young girl tenderly you will let me come to you always when you want me but you will let me also shape my life anew and work for my living the duchess turned her grave half humorous face towards her that means you have determined to seek him well perhaps if you give up your other absurd idea of independence i may assist you and now i really believe dear that there is that dreadful south american pointing to a figure that was crossing the lawn at hamley court hovering round like a vulture well i cant see him today if he calls but you may by the way they say he is not badlooking was a famous general in the south american war and is rolling in money and comes here on a secret mission from his government but i forgetthe rest of our life is to be devoted to seeking another and i begin to think i am not a good matchmaker  helen was in no mood for an interview with the stranger whom like the duchess she was inclined to regard as a portent of fate and sacrifice she knew her friends straitened circumstances which might make such a sacrifice necessary to insure a competency for her old age and as helen feared also a provision for herself she knew the strange tenderness of this masculine woman which had survived a husbands infidelities and a sons forgetfulness to be given to her and her heart sank at the prospect of separation even while her pride demanded that she should return to her old life again then she wondered if the duchess was right did she still cherish the hope of meeting ostrander again the tears she had kept back all that day asserted themselves as she flung open the library door and ran across the garden into the myrtle walk in hospital the words had been ringing in her ears though sir jamess complacent speech through the oddly constrained luncheon through the halftender halfmasculine reasoning of her companion he had loved herhe had suffered and perhaps thought her false suddenly she stopped at the further end of the walk the ominous stranger whom she wished to avoid was standing looking towards the house  how provoking she glanced again he was leaning against a tree and was obviously as preoccupied as she was herself he was actually sketching the ivycovered gable of the library what presumption and he was sketching with his left hand a sudden thrill of superstition came over her she moved eagerly forward for a better view of him no he had two arms  but his quick eye had already caught sight of her and before she could retreat she could see that he had thrown away his sketchbook and was hastening eagerly toward her amazed and confounded she would have flown but her limbs suddenly refused their office and as he at last came near her with the cry of helen upon his lips she felt herself staggering and was caught in his arms  thank god he said then she has let you come to me  she disengaged herself slowly and dazedly from him and stood looking at him with wondering eyes he was bronzed and worn there was the second arm but still it was he and with the love which she now knew he had felt looking from his honest eyes  she has let me come she repeated vacantly whom do you mean  the duchess  the duchess  yes he stopped suddenly gazing at her blank face while his own grew ashy white helen for gods sake tell me you have not accepted him  i have accepted no one she stammered with a faint color rising to her cheeks i do not understand you  a look of relief came over him but he said amazedly has not the duchess told you how i happen to be here how when you disappeared from paris long agowith my ambition crushed and nothing left to me but my old trade of the fighteri joined a secret expedition to help the chilian revolutionists how i who might have starved as a painter gained distinction as a partisan general and was rewarded with an envoyship in europe how i came to paris to seek you how i found that even the pictureyour picture helenhad been sold how in tracing it here i met the duchess at deep hill and learning you were with her in a moment of impulse told her my whole story how she told me that though she was your best friend you had never spoken of me and how she begged me not to spoil your chance of a good match by revealing myself and so awakening a pastwhich she believed you had forgotten how she implored me at least to let her make a fair test of your affections and your memory and until then to keep away from youand to spare you helen and for your sake i consented surely she has told this now  not a word said helen blankly  then you mean to say that if i had not haunted the park today in the hope of seeing you believing that as you would not recognize me with this artificial arm i should not break my promise to heryou would not have known i was even living  noyesstay a smile broke over her pale face and left it rosy i see it all now oh philip dont you understand she wanted only to try us  there was a silence in the lonely wood broken only by the trills of a frightened bird whose retreat was invaded  not now please wait come with me  the next moment she had seized philips left hand and dragging him with her was flying down the walk towards the house but as they neared the garden door it suddenly opened on the duchess with her glasses to her eyes smiling  the general don felipe ostrander did not buy hamley court but he and his wife were always welcome guests there and sir james as became an english gentlemanamazed though he was at philips singular return and more singular incognitoafterwards gallantly presented philips wife with philips first picture      the judgment of bolinas plain   the wind was getting up on the bolinas plain it had started the fine alkaline dust along the level stage road so that even that faint track the only break in the monotony of the landscape seemed fainter than ever but the dust cloud was otherwise a relief it took the semblance of distant woods where there was no timber of moving teams where there was no life and as sue beasley standing in the doorway of one spring house that afternoon shading her sandy lashes with her small red hand glanced along the desolate track even her eyes trained to the dreary prospect were once or twice deceived  sue  it was a mans voice from within sue took no notice of it but remained with her hand shading her eyes  sue wot yer yawpin at thar  yawpin would seem to have been the local expression for her abstraction since without turning her head she answered slowly and languidly reckoned i seed som un on the stage road but taint nothin nor nobody  both voices had in their accents and delivery something of the sadness and infinite protraction of the plain but the womans had a musical possibility in its longdrawn cadence while the mans was only monotonous and wearying and as she turned back into the room again and confronted her companion there was the like difference in their appearance ira beasley her husband had suffered from the combined effects of indolence carelessness misadventure and disease two of his fingers had been cut off by a scythe his thumb and part of his left ear had been blown away by an overcharged gun his knees were crippled by rheumatism and one foot was lame from ingrowing nailsdeviations that however did not tend to correct the original angularities of his frame his wife on the other hand had a pretty figure which still retainedthey were childlessthe rounded freshness of maidenhood her features were irregular yet not without a certain piquancy of outline her hair had the two shades sometimes seen in imperfect blondes and her complexion the sallowness of combined exposure and alkaline assimilation  she had lived there since an angular girl of fifteen she had been awkwardly helped by ira from the tailboard of the emigrant wagon in which her mother had died two weeks before and which was making its first halt on the californian plains before iras door on the second day of their halt ira had tried to kiss her while she was drawing water and had received the contents of the bucket insteadthe girl knowing her own value on the third day ira had some conversation with her father regarding locations and stock on the fourth day this conversation was continued in the presence of the girl on the fifth day the three walked to parson davies house four miles away where ira and sue were married the romance of a week had taken place within the confines of her present view from the doorway the episode of her life might have been shut in in that last sweep of her sandy lashes  nevertheless at that moment some instinct she knew not what impelled her when her husband left the room to put down the dish she was washing and with the towel lapped over her bare pretty arms to lean once more against the doorpost lazily looking down the plain a cylindrical cloud of dust trailing its tattered skirt along the stage road suddenly assaulted the house and for an instant enveloped it as it whirled away again something emerged or rather dropped from its skirts behind the little cluster of low bushes which encircled the one spring it was a man  thar i knew it was suthin she began aloud but the words somehow died upon her lips then she turned and walked towards the inner door wherein her husband had disappearedbut here stopped again irresolutely then she suddenly walked through the outer door into the road and made directly for the spring the figure of a man crouching covered with dust half rose from the bushes when she reached them she was not frightened for he seemed utterly exhausted and there was a singular mixture of shame hesitation and entreaty in his broken voice as he gasped out  look herei say hide me somewhere wont you just for a little you seethe fact isim chased theyre hunting me nowtheyre just behind me anywhere will do till they go by tell you all about it another time quick please do  in all this there was nothing dramatic nor even startling to her nor did there seem to be any present danger impending to the man he did not look like a horsethief nor a criminal and he had tried to laugh halfapologetically halfbitterlythe consciousness of a man who had to ask help of a woman at such a moment  she gave a quick glance towards the house he followed her eyes and said hurriedly dont tell on me dont let any one see me im trusting you  come she said suddenly get on this side  he understood her and slipped to her side halfcreeping halfcrouching like a dog behind her skirts but keeping her figure between him and the house as she moved deliberately towards the barn scarce fifty yards away when she reached it she opened the halfdoor quickly said in thereat the topamong the hayclosed it and was turning away when there came a faint rapping from within she opened the door again impatiently the man said hastily wanted to tell youit was a man who insulted a woman i went for him you seeand  but she shut the door sharply the fugitive had made a blunder the importation of her own uncertain sex into the explanation did not help him she kept on towards the house however without the least trace of excitement or agitation in her manner entered the front door again walked quietly to the door of the inner room glanced in saw that her husband was absorbed in splicing a riata and had evidently not missed her and returned quietly to her dishwashing with this singular difference a few moments before she had seemed inattentive and careless of what she was doing as if from some abstraction now when she was actually abstracted her movements were mechanically perfect and deliberate she carefully held up a dish and examined it minutely for cracks rubbing it cautiously with the towel but seeing all the while only the man she had left in the barn a few moments elapsed then there came another rush of wind around the house a drifting cloud of dust before the door the clatter of hoofs and a quick shout  her husband reached the door from the inner room almost as quickly as she did they both saw in the road two armed mounted menone of whom ira recognized as the sheriffs deputy  has anybody been here just now he asked sharply  no  seen anybody go by he continued  no whats up  one of them circus jumpers stabbed hal dudley over the table in dolores monte shop last night and got away this morning we hunted him into the plain and lost him somewhere in this dd dust  why sue reckoned she saw suthin just now said ira with a flash of recollection didnt ye sue  why the hll didnt she say it beforei beg your pardon maam didnt see you youll excuse haste  both the mens hats were in their hands embarrassed yet gratified smiles on their faces as sue came forward there was the faintest of color in her sallow cheek a keen brilliancy in her eyes she looked singularly pretty even ira felt a slight antenuptial stirring through his monotonously wedded years  the young woman walked out folding the towel around her red hands and forearmsleaving the rounded whiteness of bared elbow and upper arm in charming contrastand looked gravely past the admiring figures that nearly touched her own it was somewhar over thar she said lazily pointing up the road in the opposite direction to the barn but i aint sure it was any one  then hed already passed the house afore you saw him said the deputy  i reckonif it was him returned sue  he must have got on said the deputy but then he runs like a deer its his trade  wot trade  acrobat  wots that  the two men were delighted at this divine simplicity a man who runs jumps climbsand all that sort in the circus  but isnt he runnin jumpin and climbin away from ye now she continued with adorable naivete  the deputy smiled but straightened in the saddle were bound to come up with him afore he reaches lowville and between that and this house its a dead level where a gopher couldnt leave his hole without your spottin him a mile off goodby the words were addressed to ira but the parting glance was directed to the pretty wife as the two men galloped away  an odd uneasiness at this sudden revelation of his wifes prettiness and its evident effect upon his visitors came over ira it resulted in his addressing the empty space before his door with well ye wont ketch much if ye go on yawpin and dawdlin with womenfolks like this and he was unreasonably delighted at the pretty assent of disdain and scorn which sparkled in his wifes eyes as she added  not much i reckon  thats the kind of official trash we have to pay taxes to keep up said ira who somehow felt that if public policy was not amenable to private sentiment there was no value in free government mrs beasley however complacently resumed her dishwashing and ira returned to his riata in the adjoining room for quite an interval there was no sound but the occasional click of a dish laid upon its pile with fingers that however were firm and untremulous presently sues low voice was heard  wonder if that deputy caught anything yet ive a good mind to meander up the road and see  but the question brought ira to the door with a slight return of his former uneasiness he had no idea of subjecting his wife to another admiring interview i reckon ill go myself he said dubiously youd better stay and look after the house  her eyes brightened as she carried a pile of plates to the dresser it was possible she had foreseen this compromise yes she said cheerfully you could go farther than me  ira reflected he could also send them about their business if they thought of returning he lifted his hat from the floor took his rifle down carefully from its pegs and slouched out into the road sue watched him until he was well away then flew to the back door stopping only an instant to look at her face in a small mirror on the wallyet without noticing her new prettinessthen ran to the barn casting a backward glance at the diminishing figure of her husband in the distance she threw open the door and shut it quickly behind her at first the abrupt change from the dazzling outer plain to the deep shadows of the barn bewildered her she saw before her a bucket half filled with dirty water and a quantity of wet straw littering the floor then lifting her eyes to the hayloft she detected the figure of the fugitive unclothed from the waist upward emerging from the loose hay in which he had evidently been drying himself whether it was the excitement of his perilous situation or whether the perfect symmetry of his bared bust and armsunlike anything she had ever seen beforeclothed him with the cold ideality of a statue she could not say but she felt no shock of modesty while the man accustomed to the public halfexposure in tights and spangles was more conscious of detected unreadiness than of shame  gettin the dust off me he said in hurried explanation be down in a second indeed in another moment he had resumed his shirt and flannel coat and swung himself to the floor with a like grace and dexterity that was to her the revelation of a descending god she found herself face to face with himhis features cleansed of dirt and grime his hair plastered in wet curls on his low forehead it was a face of cheap adornment not uncommon in his professionunintelligent unrefined and even unheroic but she did not know that overcoming a sudden timidity she nevertheless told him briefly and concisely of the arrival and departure of his pursuers  his low forehead wrinkled thars no getting away until they come back he said without looking at her could ye keep me in here tonight  yes she returned simply as if the idea had already occurred to her but you must lie low in the loft  and could youhe hesitated and went on with a forced smileyou see ive eaten nothing since last night could you  ill bring you something she said quickly nodding her head  and if you hadhe went on more hesitatingly glancing down at his traveltorn and frayed garmentsanything like a coat or any other clothing it would disguise me also you see and put em off the track  she nodded her head again rapidly she had thought of that too there was a pair of doeskin trousers and a velvet jacket left by a mexican vaquero who had bought stock from them two years ago practical as she was a sudden conviction that he would look well in the velvet jacket helped her resolve  did they sayhe said with his forced smile and uneasy glancedid theytell you anything about me  yes she said abstractedly gazing at him  you see he began hurriedly ill tell you how it was  no dont she said quickly she meant it she wanted no facts to stand between her and this single romance of her life i must go and get the things she added turning away before he gets back  whos he asked the man  she was about to reply my husband but without knowing why stopped and said mr beasley and then ran off quickly to the house  she found the vaqueros clothes took some provisions filled a flask of whiskey in the cupboard and ran back with them her mouth expanded to a vague smile and pulsating like a schoolgirl she even repressed with difficulty the ejaculation there as she handed them to him he thanked her but with eyes fixed and fascinated by the provisions she understood it with a new sense of delicacy and saying ill come again when he gets back ran off and returned to the house leaving him alone to his repast  meantime her husband lounging lazily along the high road had precipitated the catastrophe he wished to avoid for his slouching figure silhouetted against the horizon on that monotonous level had been the only one detected by the deputy sheriff and the constable his companion and they had charged down within fifty yards of him before they discovered their mistake they were not slow in making this an excuse for abandoning their quest as far as lowville in fact after quitting the distraction of mrs beasleys presence they had without in the least suspecting the actual truth become doubtful if the fugitive had proceeded so far he might at that moment be snugly ensconced behind some low wiregrass ridge watching their own clearly defined figures and waiting only for the night to evade them the beasley house seemed a proper place of operation in beating up the field iras cold reception of the suggestion was duly disposed of by the deputy i have the right ye know he said with a grim pleasantry to summon ye as my posse to aid and assist me in carrying out the law but i aint the man to be rough on my friends and i reckon it will do jest as well if i requisition your house the dreadful recollection that the deputy had the power to detail him and the constable to scour the plain while he remained behind in company with sue stopped iras further objections yet if he could only get rid of her while the deputy was in the housebut then his nearest neighbor was five miles away there was nothing left for him to do but to return with the men and watch his wife keenly strange to say there was a certain stimulus in this which stirred his monotonous pulses and was not without a vague pleasure there is a revelation to some natures in newly awakened jealousy that is a reincarnation of love  as they came into the house a slight circumstance which an hour ago would have scarcely touched his sluggish sensibilities now appeared to corroborate his fear his wife had changed her cuffs and collar taken off her rough apron and evidently redressed her hair this with the enhanced brightness of her eyes which he had before noticed convinced him that it was due to the visit of the deputy there was no doubt that the official was equally attracted and fascinated by her prettiness and although her acceptance of his return was certainly not a cordial one there was a kind of demure restraint and overconsciousness in her manner that might be coquetry ira had vaguely observed this quality in other young women but had never experienced it in his brief courtship there had been no rivalry no sexual diplomacy nor insincerity in his capture of the motherless girl who had leaped from the tailboard of her fathers wagon almost into his arms and no man had since come between them the idea that sue should care for any other than himself had been simply inconceivable to his placid matteroffact nature that their sacrament was final he had never doubted if his two cows bought with his own money or reared by him should suddenly have developed an inclination to give milk to a neighbor he would not have been more astonished but they could have been brought back with a rope and without a heart throb  passion of this kind which in a less sincere society restricts its expression to innuendo or forced politeness left the rustic ira only dumb and lethargic he moved slowly and abstractedly around the room accenting his slight lameness more than ever or dropped helplessly into a chair where he sat inanely conscious of the contiguity of his wife and the deputy and stupidly expectant ofhe knew not what the atmosphere of the little house seemed to him charged with some unwholesome electricity it kindled his wifes eyes stimulating the deputy and his follower to coarse playfulness enthralled his own limbs to the convulsive tightening of his fingers around the rungs of his chair yet he managed to cling to his idea of keeping his wife occupied and of preventing any eyeshot between her and her guests or the indulgence of dangerously flippant conversation by ordering her to bring some refreshment whats gone o the whiskey bottle he said after fumbling in the cupboard  mrs beasley did not blench she only gave her head a slight toss ef you men cant get along with the coffee and flapjacks im going to give ye made with my own hands ye kin just toddle right along to the first bar and order your tanglefoot there ef its a barkeeper youre looking for and not a lady say so  the novel audacity of this speech and the fact that it suggested that preoccupation he hoped for relieved ira for a moment while it enchanted the guests as a stroke of coquettish fascination mrs beasley triumphantly disappeared in the kitchen slipped off her cuffs and set to work and in a few moments emerged with a tray bearing the cakes and steaming coffee as neither she nor her husband ate anything possibly owing to an equal preoccupation the guests were obliged to confine their attentions to the repast before them the sun too was already nearing the horizon and although its nearly level beams acted like a powerful searchlight over the stretching plain twilight would soon put an end to the quest yet they lingered ira now foresaw a new difficulty the cows were to be brought up and fodder taken from the barn to do this he would be obliged to leave his wife and the deputy together i do not know if mrs beasley divined his perplexity but she carelessly offered to perform that evening function herself iras heart leaped and sank again as the deputy gallantly proposed to assist her but here rustic simplicity seemed to be equal to the occasion ef i propose to do iras work said mrs beasley with provocative archness its because i reckon hell do more good helpin you catch your man than youll do helpin me so clear out both of ye a feminine audacity that recalled the deputy to himself and left him no choice but to accept iras aid i do not know whether mrs beasley felt a pang of conscience as her husband arose gratefully and limped after the deputy i only know that she stood looking at them from the door smiling and triumphant  then she slipped out of the back door again and ran swiftly to the barn fastening on her clean cuffs and collar as she ran the fugitive was anxiously awaiting her with a slight touch of brusqueness in his eagerness  thought you were never coming he said  she breathlessly explained and showed him through the halfopened door the figures of the three men slowly spreading and diverging over the plain like the nearly level sunrays they were following the sunlight fell also on her panting bosom her electrified sandy hair her red halfopened mouth and short and freckled upper lip the relieved fugitive turned from the three remoter figures to the one beside him and saw for the first time that it was fair at which he smiled and her face flushed and was irradiated  then they fell to talkhe grateful boastfulas the distant figures grew dim she quickly assenting but following his expression rather than his words with her own girlish face and brightening eyes but what he said or how he explained his position with what speciousness he dwelt upon himself his wrongs and his manifold manly virtues is not necessary for us to know nor was it indeed for her to understand enough for her that she felt she had found the one man of all the world and that she was at that moment protecting him against all the world he was the unexpected spontaneous gift to her the companion her childhood had never known the lover she had never dreamed of even the child of her unsatisfied maternal yearnings if she could not comprehend all his selfish incoherences she felt it was her own fault if she could not follow his ignorant assumptions she knew it was she who was deficient if she could not translate his coarse speech it was because it was the language of a larger world from which she had been excluded to this world belonged the beautiful limbs she gazed ona very different world from that which had produced the rheumatic deformities and useless mayhem of her husband or the provincially foppish garments of the deputy sitting in the hayloft together where she had mounted for greater security they forgot themselves in his monologue of cheap vaporing broken only by her assenting smiles and her halfchecked sighs the sharp spices of the heated pineshingles over their heads and the fragrance of the cloverscented hay filled the close air around them the sun was falling with the wind but they heeded it not until the usual fateful premonition struck the woman and saying i must go now she only halfunconsciously precipitated the end for as she rose he caught first her hand and then her waist and attempted to raise the face that was suddenly bending down as if seeking to hide itself in the hay it was a brief struggle ending in a submission as sudden and their lips met in a kiss so eager that it might have been impending for days instead of minutes  oh sue where are ye  it was her husbands voice out of a darkness that they only then realized the man threw her aside with a roughness that momentarily shocked her above any sense of surprise or shame she would have confronted her husband in his armsglorified and translatedhad he but kept her there yet she answered with a quiet level voice that astonished her lover here im just coming down and walked coolly to the ladder looking over and seeing her husband with the deputy standing in the barnyard she quickly returned put her finger to her lips made a gesture for her companion to conceal himself in the hay again and was turning away when perhaps shamed by her superior calmness he grasped her hand tightly and whispered come again tonight dear do she hesitated raised her hand suddenly to her lips and then quickly disengaging it slipped down the ladder  ye havent done much work yet as i kin see said ira wearily whitey and red tip the cows are hangin over the corral just waitin  the yellow hen we reckoned was lost is sittin in the hayloft and mustnt be disturbed said mrs beasley with decision and yell have to take the hay from the stack tonight and with an arch glance at the deputy as i dont see that you two have done much either youre just in time to help fodder down  setting the three men to work with the same bright audacity the task was soon completedparticularly as the deputy found no opportunity for exclusive dalliance with mrs beasley she shut the barn door herself and led the way to the house learning incidentally that the deputy had abandoned the chase was to occupy a shakedown on the kitchenfloor that night with the constable and depart at daybreak the gloom of her husbands face had settled into a look of heavy resignation and alternate glances of watchfulness which only seemed to inspire her with renewed vivacity but the cooking of supper withdrew her disturbing presence for a time from the room and gave him some relief when the meal was ready he sought further surcease from trouble in copious draughts of whiskey which she produced from a new bottle and even pressed upon the deputy in mischievous contrition for her previous inhospitality  now i know that it wasnt whiskey only ye came for ill show you that sue beasley is no slouch of a barkeeper either she said  then rolling her sleeves above her pretty arms she mixed a cocktail in such delightful imitation of the fashionable barkeepers dexterity that her guests were convulsed with admiration even ira was struck with this revelation of a youthfulness that five years of household care had checked but never yet subdued he had forgotten that he had married a child only once when she glanced at the cheap clock on the mantel had he noticed another change more remarkable still from its very inconsistency with her burst of youthful spirits it was another face that he sawolder and matured with an intensity of abstraction that struck a chill to his heart it was not his sue that was standing there but another sue wrought as it seemed to his morbid extravagance by some one elses hand  yet there was another interval of relief when his wife declaring she was tired and even jocosely confessing to some effect of the liquor she had pretended to taste went early to bed the deputy not finding the gloomy company of the husband to his taste presently ensconced himself on the floor before the kitchen fire in the blankets that she had provided the constable followed his example in a few moments the house was silent and sleeping save for ira sitting alone with his head sunk on his chest and his hands gripping the arms of his chair before the dying embers of his hearth  he was trying with the alternate quickness and inaction of an inexperienced intellect and an imagination morbidly awakened to grasp the situation before him the common sense that had hitherto governed his life told him that the deputy would go tomorrow and that there was nothing in his wifes conduct to show that her coquetry and aberration would not pass as easily but it recurred to him that she had never shown this coquetry or aberration to him during their own brief courtshipthat she had never looked or acted like this before if this was love she had never known it if it was only womens ways as he had heard men say and so dangerously attractive why had she not shown it to him he remembered that matteroffact wedding the bride without timidity without blushes without expectation beyond the transference of her home to his would it have been different with another manwith the deputy who had called this color and animation to her face what did it all mean were all married people like this there were the westons their neighborswas mrs weston like sue but he remembered that mrs weston had run away with mr weston from her fathers house it was what they called a love match would sue have run away with him would she now run away with  the candle was guttering as he rose with a fierce starthis first impulse of angerfrom the table he took another gulp of whiskey it tasted like water its fire was quenched in the greater heat of his blood he would go to bed here a new and indefinable timidity took possession of him he remembered the strange look in his wifes face it seemed suddenly as if the influence of the sleeping stranger in the next room had not only isolated her from him but would make his presence in her bedroom an intrusion on their hidden secrets he had to pass the open door of the kitchen the head of the unconscious deputy was close to iras heavy boot he had only to lift his heel to crush that ruddy goodlooking complacent face he hurried past him up the creaking stairs his wife lay still on one side of the bed apparently asleep her face halfhidden in her loosened fluffy hair it was well for in the vague shyness and restraint that was beginning to take possession of him he felt he could not have spoken to her or if he had it would have been only to voice the horrible unformulated things that seemed to choke him he crept softly to the opposite side of the bed and began to undress as he pulled off his boots and stockings his eye fell upon his bare malformed feet this caused him to look at his maimed hand to rise drag himself across the floor to the mirror and gaze upon his lacerated ear she this prettily formed woman lying there must have seen it often she must have known all these years that he was not like other mennot like the deputy with his tight ridingboots his soft hand and the diamond that sparkled vulgarly on his fat little finger a cold sweat broke over him he drew on his stockings again lifted the outer counterpane and half undressed crept under it wrapping its corner around his maimed hand as if to hide it from the light yet he felt that he saw things dimly there was a moisture on his cheeks and eyelids he could not account for it must be the whiskey coming out  his wife lay very still she scarcely seemed to breathe what if she should never breathe again but die as the old sue he knew the lanky girl he had married unchanged and uncontaminated it would be better than this yet at the same moment the picture was before him of her pretty simulation of the barkeeper of her white bared arms and laughing eyes all so new so fresh to him he tried to listen to the slow ticking of the clock the occasional stirring of air through the house and the movement like a deep sigh which was the regular inarticulate speech of the lonely plain beyond and quite distinct from the evening breeze he had heard it often but like so many things he had learned that day he never seemed to have caught its meaning before then perhaps it was his supine position perhaps some cumulative effect of the whiskey he had taken but all this presently became confused and whirling out of its gyrations he tried to grasp something to hear voices that called him to wake and in the midst of it he fell into a profound sleep  the clock ticked the wind sighed the woman at his side lay motionless for many minutes  then the deputy on the kitchen floor rolled over with an appalling snort struggled stretched himself and awoke a healthy animal he had shaken off the fumes of liquor with a dry tongue and a thirst for water and fresh air he raised his knees and rubbed his eyes the water bucket was missing from the corner well he knew where the spring was and a turn out of the close and stifling kitchen would do him good he yawned put on his boots softly opened the back door and stepped out everything was dark but above and around him to the very level of his feet all apparently pricked with bright stars the bulk of the barn rose dimly before him on the right to the left was the spring he reached it drank dipped his head and hands in it and arose refreshed the dry wholesome breath that blew over this flat disk around him rimmed with stars did the rest he began to saunter slowly back the only reminiscence of his evenings potations being the figure he recalled of his pretty hostess with bare arms and lifted glasses imitating the barkeeper a complacent smile straightened his yellow mustache how she kept glancing at him and watching him the little witch ha no wonder what could she find in the surly slinking stupid brute yonder the gentleman here alluded to was his host but the deputy had not been without a certain provincial success with the fair he was true to most men and fearless to all one may not be too hard upon him at this moment of his life  for as he was passing the house he stopped suddenly above the dry dusty herbal odors of the plain above the scent of the newmown hay within the barn there was distinctly another fragrancethe smell of a pipe but where was it his host who had risen to take the outer air then it suddenly flashed upon him that beasley did not smoke nor the constable either the smell seemed to come from the barn had he followed out the train of ideas thus awakened all might have been well but at this moment his attention was arrested by a far more exciting incident to himthe draped and hooded figure of mrs beasley was just emerging from the house he halted instantly in the shadow and held his breath as she glided quickly across the intervening space and disappeared in the halfopened door of the barn did she know he was there a keen thrill passed over him his mouth broadened into a breathless smile it was his last for as he glided forward to the door the starry heavens broke into a thousand brilliant fragments around him the earth gave way beneath his feet and he fell forward with half his skull shot away  where he fell there he lay without an outcry with only one movementthe curved and grasping fingers of the fighters hand towards his guarded hip where he fell there he lay dead his face downwards his good right arm still curved around across his back nothing of him moved but his bloodbroadening slowly round him in vivid color and then sluggishly thickening and darkening until it stopped too and sank into the earth a dull brown stain for an instant the stillness of death followed the echoless report then there was a quick and feverish rustling within the barn the hurried opening of a window in the loft scurrying footsteps another interval of silence and then out of the farther darkness the sounds of horsehoofs in the muffled dust of the road but not a sound or movement in the sleeping house beyond   the stars at last paled slowly the horizon lines came backa thin streak of opal fire a solitary bird twittered in the bush beside the spring then the back door of the house opened and the constable came forth halfawakened and apologetic and with the bewildered haste of a belated man his eyes were level looking for his missing leader as he went on until at last he stumbled and fell over the now cold and rigid body he scrambled to his feet again cast a hurried glance around himat the halfopened door of the barn at the floor littered with trampled hay in one corner lay the ragged blouse and trousers of the fugitive which the constable instantly recognized he went back to the house and reappeared in a few moments with ira white stupefied and hopelessly bewildered clear only in his statement that his wife had just fainted at the news of the catastrophe and was equally helpless in her own room the constablea man of narrow ideas but quick actionsaw it all the mystery was plain without further evidence the deputy had been awakened by the prowling of the fugitive around the house in search of a horse sallying out they had met and iras gun which stood in the kitchen and which the deputy had seized had been wrested from him and used with fatal effect at arms length and the now double assassin had escaped on the sheriffs horse which was missing turning the body over to the trembling ira he saddled his horse and galloped to lowville for assistance  these facts were fully established at the hurried inquest which met that day there was no need to go behind the evidence of the constable the only companion of the murdered man and first discoverer of the body the fact that he on the ground floor had slept through the struggle and the report made the obliviousness of the couple in the room above a rational sequence the dazed ira was set aside after half a dozen contemptuous questions the chivalry of a californian jury excused the attendance of a frightened and hysterical woman confined to her room by noon they had departed with the body and the long afternoon shadows settled over the lonely plain and silent house at nightfall ira appeared at the door and stood for some moments scanning the plain he was seen later by two packers who had glanced furtively at the scene of the late tragedy sitting outside his doorway a mere shadow in the darkness and a mounted patrol later in the night saw a light in the bedroom window where the invalid mrs beasley was confined but no one saw her afterwards later ira explained that she had gone to visit a relative until her health was restored having few friends and fewer neighbors she was not missed and even the constable the sole surviving guest who had enjoyed her brief eminence of archness and beauty that fatal night had quite forgotten her in his vengeful quest of the murderer so that people became accustomed to see this lonely man working in the fields by day or at nightfall gazing fixedly from his doorway at the end of three months he was known as the recluse or hermit of bolinas plain in the rapid historymaking of that epoch it was forgotten that he had ever been anything else  but justice which in those days was apt to nod over the affairs of the average citizen was keenly awake to offenses against its own officers and it chanced that the constable one day walking through the streets of marysville recognized the murderer and apprehended him he was removed to lowville here probably through some modest doubt of the ability of the county court which the constable represented to deal with purely circumstantial evidence he was not above dropping a hint to the local vigilance committee who singularly enough in spite of his resistance got possession of the prisoner it was the rainy season and business was slack the citizens of lowville were thus enabled to give so notorious a case their fullest consideration and to assist cheerfully at the ultimate hanging of the prisoner which seemed to be a foregone conclusion  but herein they were mistaken for when the constable had given his evidence already known to the county there was a disturbance in the fringe of humanity that lined the walls of the assembly room where the committee was sitting and the hermit of bolinas plain limped painfully into the room he had evidently walked there he was soaked with rain and plastered with mud he was exhausted and inarticulate but as he staggered to the witnessbench and elbowed the constable aside he arrested the attention of every one a few laughed but were promptly silenced by the court it was a reflection upon its only virtuesincerity  do you know the prisoner asked the judge  ira beasley glanced at the pale face of the acrobat and shook his head  never saw him before he said faintly  then what are you doing here demanded the judge sternly  ira collected himself with evident effort and rose to his halting feet first he moistened his dry lips then he said slowly and distinctly because i killed the deputy of bolinas  with the thrill which ran through the crowded room and the relief that seemed to come upon him with that utterance he gained strength and even a certain dignity  i killed him he went on turning his head slowly around the circle of eager auditors with the rigidity of a wax figure because he made love to my wife i killed him because he wanted to run away with her i killed him because i found him waiting for her at the door of the barn at the dead o night when shed got outer bed to jine him he hadnt no gun he hadnt no fight i killed him in his tracks that man pointing to the prisoner wasnt in it at all he stopped loosened his collar and baring his rugged throat below his disfigured ear said now take me out and hang me  what proof have we of this wheres your wife does she corroborate it  a slight tremor ran over him  she ran away that night and never came back again perhaps he added slowly because she loved him and couldnt bear me perhaps as ive sometimes allowed to myself gentlemen it was because she didnt want to bear evidence agin me  in the silence that followed the prisoner was heard speaking to one that was near him then he rose all the audacity and confidence that the husband had lacked were in his voice nay there was even a certain chivalry in his manner which for the moment the rascal really believed  its true he said after i stole the horse to get away i found that woman running wild down the road cryin and sobbin at first i thought shed done the shooting it was a risky thing for me to do gentlemen but i took her up on the horse and got her away to lowville it was that much dead weight agin my chances but i took it she was a woman andi aint a dog  he was so exalted and sublimated by his fiction that for the first time the jury was impressed in his favor and when ira beasley limped across the room and extending his maimed hand to the prisoner said shake there was another dead silence  it was broken by the voice of the judge addressing the constable  what do you know of the deputys attentions to mrs beasley were they enough to justify the husbands jealousy did he make love to her  the constable hesitated he was a narrow man with a crude sense of the principles rather than the methods of justice he remembered the deputys admiration he now remembered even more strongly the object of that admiration simulating with her pretty arms the gestures of the barkeeper and the delight it gave them he was loyal to his dead leader but he looked up and down and then said slowly and halfdefiantly well judge he was a man  everybody laughed that the strongest and most magic of all human passions should always awake levity in any public presentment of or allusion to it was one of the inconsistencies of human nature which even a lynch judge had to admit he made no attempt to control the tittering of the court for he felt that the element of tragedy was no longer there the foreman of the jury arose and whispered to the judge amid another silence then the judge spoke  the prisoner and his witness are both discharged the prisoner to leave the town within twentyfour hours the witness to be conducted to his own house at the expense of and with the thanks of the committee  they say that one afternoon when a low mist of rain had settled over the sodden bolinas plain a haggard bedraggled and wornout woman stepped down from a common freighting wagon before the doorway where beasley still sat that coming forward he caught her in his arms and called her sue and they say that they lived happily together ever afterwards but they sayand this requires some corroborationthat much of that happiness was due to mrs beasleys keeping forever in her husbands mind her own heroic sacrifice in disappearing as a witness against him her own forgiveness of his fruitless crime and the gratitude he owed to the fugitive     the strange experience of alkali dick   he was a cowboy a reckless and dashing rider yet mindful of his horses needs goodhumored by nature but quick in quarrel independent of circumstance yet shy and sensitive of opinion abstemious by education and general habit yet intemperate in amusement selfcentred yet possessed of a childish vanitytaken altogether a characteristic product of the western plains which he never should have left  but reckless adventure after adventure had brought him into difficulties from which there was only one equally adventurous escape he joined a company of indians engaged by buffalo bill to simulate before civilized communities the sports and customs of the uncivilized in divers christian arenas of the nineteenth century he rode as a northern barbarian of the first might have disported before the roman populace but harmlessly of his own free will and of some little profit to himself he threw his lasso under the curious eyes of languid men and women of the world eager for some new sensation with admiring plaudits from them and a half contemptuous egotism of his own but outside of the arena he was lonely lost and impatient for excitement  an ingenious attempt to paint the town red did not commend itself as a spectacle to the householders who lived in the vicinity of earls court london and alkali dick was haled before a respectable magistrate by a serious policeman and fined as if he had been only a drunken coster a later attempt at paris to incarnadine the neighborhood of the champs de mars and round up a number of boulevardiers met with a more disastrous resultthe gleam of steel from mounted gendarmes and a mandate to his employers  so it came that one night after the conclusion of the performance alkali dick rode out of the corral gate of the hippodrome with his last weeks salary in his pocket and an imprecation on his lips he had shaken the sawdust of the sham arena from his high tightfitting boots he would shake off the white dust of france and the effeminate soil of all europe also and embark at once for his own country and the far west  a more practical and experienced man would have sold his horse at the nearest market and taken train to havre but alkali dick felt himself incomplete on terra firma without his mustangit would be hard enough to part from it on embarkingand he had determined to ride to the seaport  the spectacle of a lithe horseman clad in a rembrandt sombrero velvet jacket turnover collar almost van dyke in its proportions white trousers and high boots with long curling hair falling over his shoulders and a pointed beard and mustache was a picturesque one but still not a novelty to the latesupping parisians who looked up under the midnight gas as he passed and only recognized one of those men whom paris had agreed to designate as booflobils going home  at three oclock he pulled up at a wayside cabaret preferring it to the publicity of a larger hotel and lay there till morning the slight consternation of the cabaretkeeper and his wife over this longhaired phantom with glittering deepset eyes was soothed by a royallyflung gold coin and a few words of french slang picked up in the arena which with the name of havre comprised dicks whole knowledge of the language but he was touched with their ready and intelligent comprehension of his needs and their genial if not so comprehensive loquacity luckily for his quick temper he did not know that they had taken him for a traveling quackdoctor going to the fair of yvetot and that madame had been on the point of asking him for a magic balsam to prevent migraine  he was up betimes and away giving a wide berth to the larger towns taking byways and cutoffs yet always with the western pathfinders instinct even among these alien poplarhaunted plains lowbanked willowfringed rivers and cloverless meadows the white sun shining everywhereon dazzling arbors summerhouses and trellises on light green vines and delicate pearows on the white trousers jackets and shoes of smart shopkeepers or holiday makers on the white headdresses of nurses and the whitewinged caps of the sisters of st vincentall this grew monotonous to this native of still more monotonous wastes the long black shadows of short blueskirted sabotted women and short bluebloused sabotted men slowly working in the fields with slow oxen or still slower heavy norman horses the same horses gayly bedecked dragging slowly not only heavy wagons but their own apparently more monstrous weight over the white road fretted his nervous western energy and made him impatient to get on  at the close of the second day he found some relief on entering a trackless woodnot the usual formal avenue of equidistant trees leading to nowhere and stopping upon the open fieldbut apparently a genuine forest as wild as one of his own oak bottoms gnarled roots and twisted branches flung themselves across his path his mustangs hoofs sank in deep pits of moss and last years withered leaves trailing vines caught his heavystirruped feet or brushed his broad sombrero the vista before him seemed only to endlessly repeat the same sylvan glade he was in fancy once more in the primeval western forest and encompassed by its vast dim silences he did not know that he had in fact only penetrated an ancient park which in former days resounded to the winding fanfare of the chase and was still on stated occasions swept over by accurately greencoated parisians and greenplumed dianes who had come down by train to him it meant only unfettered and unlimited freedom  he rose in his stirrups and sent a characteristic yell ringing down the dim aisles before him but alas at the same moment his mustang accustomed to the firmer grip of the prairie in lashing out stepped upon a slimy root and fell heavily rolling over his clinging and still unlodged rider for a few moments both lay still then dick extricated himself with an oath rose giddily dragged up his horsewho after the fashion of his race was meekly succumbing to his reclining positionand then became aware that the unfortunate beast was badly sprained in the shoulder and temporarily lame the sudden recollection that he was some miles from the road and that the sun was sinking concentrated his scattered faculties the prospect of sleeping out in that summer woodland was nothing to the pioneerbred dick he could make his horse and himself comfortable anywherebut he was delaying his arrival at havre he must regain the high roador some wayside inn he glanced around him the westering sun was a guide for his general direction the road must follow it north or south he would find a clearing somewhere but here dick was mistaken there seemed no interruption of no encroachment upon this sylvan tract as in his western woods there was no track or trail to be found he missed even the ordinary woodland signs that denoted the path of animals to water for the park from the time a northern duke had first alienated it from the virgin forest had been rigidly preserved  suddenly rising apparently from the ground before him he saw the high roofridges and tourelles of a long irregular gloomy building a few steps further showed him that it lay in a cuplike depression of the forest and that it was still a long descent from where he had wandered to where it stood in the gathering darkness his mustang was moving with great difficulty he uncoiled his lariat from the saddlehorn and selecting the most open space tied one end to the trunk of a large treethe forty feet of horsehair rope giving the animal a sufficient degree of grazing freedom  then he strode more quickly down the forest side towards the building which now revealed its austere proportions though dick could see that they were mitigated by a strange formal flowergarden with quaint statues and fountains there were grim black allees of clipped trees a curiously wrought iron gate and twisted iron espaliers on one side the edifice was supported by a great stone terrace which seemed to him as broad as a parisian boulevard yet everywhere it appeared sleeping in the desertion and silence of the summer twilight the evening breeze swayed the lace curtains at the tall windows but nothing else moved to the unsophisticated western man it looked like a scene on the stage  his progress was however presently checked by the first sight of preservation he had met in the foresta thick hedge which interfered between him and a sloping lawn beyond it was up to his waist yet he began to break his way through it when suddenly he was arrested by the sound of voices before him on the lawn a man and woman evidently servants were slowly advancing peering into the shadows of the wood which he had just left he could not understand what they were saying but he was about to speak and indicate by signs his desire to find the road when the woman turning towards her companion caught sight of his face and shoulders above the hedge to his surprise and consternation he saw the color drop out of her fresh cheeks her round eyes fix in their sockets and with a despairing shriek she turned and fled towards the house the man turned at his companions cry gave the same horrified glance at dicks face uttered a hoarse sacre crossed himself violently and fled also  amazed indignant and for the first time in his life humiliated dick gazed speechlessly after them the man of course was a sneaking coward but the woman was rather pretty it had not been dicks experience to have women run from him should he follow them knock the silly fellows head against a tree and demand an explanation alas he knew not the language they had already reached the house and disappeared in one of the offices well let them gofor a mean lowdown pair of country bumpkinshe wanted no favors from them  he turned back angrily into the forest to seek his unlucky beast the gurgle of water fell on his ear hard by was a spring where at least he could water the mustang he stooped to examine it there was yet light enough in the sunset sky to throw back from that little mirror the reflection of his thin oval face his long curling hair and his pointed beard and mustache yes this was his facethe face that many women in paris had agreed was romantic and picturesque had those wretched greenhorns never seen a real man before were they idiots or insane a sudden recollection of the silence and seclusion of the building suggested certainly an asylumbut where were the keepers  it was getting darker in the wood he made haste to recover his horse to drag it to the spring and there bathe its shoulder in the water mixed with whiskey taken from his flask his saddlebag contained enough bread and meat for his own supper he would camp for the night where he was and with the first light of dawn make his way back through the wood whence he came as the light slowly faded from the wood he rolled himself in his saddleblanket and lay down  but not to sleep his strange position the accident to his horse an unusual irritation over the incident of the frightened servantstrivial as it might have been to any other manand above all an increasing childish curiosity kept him awake and restless presently he could see also that it was growing lighter beyond the edge of the wood and that the rays of a young crescent moon while it plunged the forest into darkness and impassable shadow evidently was illuminating the hollow below he threw aside his blanket and made his way to the hedge again he was right he could see the quaint formal lines of the old garden more distinctlythe broad terrace the queer dark bulk of the house with lights now gleaming from a few of its open windows  before one of these windows opening on the terrace was a small white draped table with fruits cups and glasses and two or three chairs as he gazed curiously at these new signs of life and occupation he became aware of a regular and monotonous tap upon the stone flags of the terrace suddenly he saw three figures slowly turn the corner of the terrace at the further end of the building and walk towards the table the central figure was that of an elderly woman yet tall and stately of carriage walking with a stick whose regular tap he had heard supported on the one side by an elderly cure in black soutaine and on the other by a tall and slender girl in white  they walked leisurely to the other end of the terrace as if performing a regular exercise and returned stopping before the open french window where after remaining in conversation a few moments the elderly lady and her ecclesiastical companion entered the young girl sauntered slowly to the steps of the terrace and leaning against a huge vase as she looked over the garden seemed lost in contemplation her face was turned towards the wood but in quite another direction from where he stood  there was something so gentle refined and graceful in her figure yet dominated by a girlish youthfulness of movement and gesture that alkali dick was singularly interested he had probably never seen an ingenue before he had certainly never come in contact with a girl of that caste and seclusion in his brief parisian experience he was sorely tempted to leave his hedge and try to obtain a nearer view of her there was a fringe of lilac bushes running from the garden up the slope if he could gain their shadows he could descend into the garden what he should do after his arrival he had not thought but he had one ideahe knew not whythat if he ventured to speak to her he would not be met with the abrupt rustic terror he had experienced at the hands of the servants she was not of that kind he crept through the hedge reached the lilacs and began the descent softly and securely in the shadow but at the same moment she arose called in a youthful voice towards the open window and began to descend the steps a halfexpostulating reply came from the window but the young girl answered it with the laughing capricious confidence of a spoiled child and continued her way into the garden here she paused a moment and hung over a rosetree from which she gathered a flower afterwards thrust into her belt dick paused too halfcrouching halfleaning over a lichenstained cracked stone pedestal from which the statue had long been overthrown and forgotten  to his surprise however the young girl following the path to the lilacs began leisurely to ascend the hill swaying from side to side with a youthful movement and swinging the long stalk of a lily at her side in another moment he would be discovered dick was frightened his confidence of the moment before had all gone he would flyand yet an exquisite and fearful joy kept him motionless she was approaching him full and clear in the moonlight he could see the grace of her delicate figure in the simple white frock drawn at the waist with broad satin ribbon and its loveknots of pale blue ribbons on her shoulders he could see the coils of her brown hair the pale olive tint of her oval cheek the delicate swelling nostril of her straight clearcut nose he could even smell the lily she carried in her little hand then suddenly she lifted her long lashes and her large gray eyes met his  alas the same look of vacant horror came into her eyes and fixed and dilated their clear pupils but she uttered no outcrythere was something in her blood that checked it something that even gave a dignity to her recoiling figure and made dick flush with admiration she put her hand to her side as if the shock of the exertion of her ascent had set her heart to beating but she did not faint then her fixed look gave way to one of infinite sadness pity and pathetic appeal her lips were parted they seemed to be moving apparently in prayer at last her voice came wonderingly timidly tenderly mon dieu cest donc vous ici cest vous que marie a crue voir que venezvous faire ici armand de fontonelles repondez  alas not a word was comprehensible to dick nor could he think of a word to say in reply he made an uncouth halfirritated halfdespairing gesture towards the wood he had quitted as if to indicate his helpless horse but he knew it was meaningless to the frightened yet exalted girl before him her little hand crept to her breast and clutched a rosary within the folds of her dress as her soft voice again arose low but appealingly  vous souffrez ah mon dieu peuton vous secourir moimememes prieres pourraient elles interceder pour vous je supplierai le ciel de prendre en pitie lame de mon ancetre monsieur le cure est laje lui parlerai lui et ma mere vous viendront en aide  she clasped her hands appealingly before him  dick stood bewildered hopeless mystified he had not understood a word he could not say a word for an instant he had a wild idea of seizing her hand and leading her to his helpless horse and then came what he believed was his salvationa sudden flash of recollection that he had seen the word he wanted the one word that would explain all in a placarded notice at the cirque of a bracelet that had been lostyes the single word perdu he made a step towards her and in a voice almost as faint as her own stammered perdu  with a little cry that was more like a sigh than an outcry the girls arms fell to her side she took a step backwards reeled and fainted away  dick caught her as she fell what had he saidbut more than all what should he do now he could not leave her alone and helplessyet how could he justify another disconcerting intrusion he touched her hands they were cold and lifeless her eyes were half closed her face as pale and drooping as her lily well he must brave the worst now and carry her to the house even at the risk of meeting the others and terrifying them as he had her he caught her uphe scarcely felt her weight against his breast and shoulderand ran hurriedly down the slope to the terrace which was still deserted if he had time to place her on some bench beside the window within their reach he might still fly undiscovered but as he panted up the steps of the terrace with his burden he saw that the french window was still open but the light seemed to have been extinguished it would be safer for her if he could place her inside the houseif he but dared to enter he was desperate and he dared  he found himself alone in a long salon of rich but faded white and gold hangings lit at the further end by two tall candles on either side of the high marble mantel whose rays however scarcely reached the window where he had entered he laid his burden on a highbacked sofa in so doing the rose fell from her belt he picked it up put it in his breast and turned to go but he was arrested by a voice from the terrace  renee  it was the voice of the elderly lady who with the cure at her side had just appeared from the rear of the house and from the further end of the terrace was looking towards the garden in search of the young girl his escape in that way was cut off to add to his dismay the young girl perhaps roused by her mothers voice was beginning to show signs of recovering consciousness dick looked quickly around him there was an open door opposite the window leading to a hall which no doubt offered some exit on the other side of the house it was his only remaining chance he darted through it closed it behind him and found himself at the end of a long hall or picturegallery strangely illuminated through high windows reaching nearly to the roof by the moon which on that side of the building threw nearly level bars of light and shadows across the floor and the quaint portraits on the wall  but to his delight he could see at the other end a narrow lanceshaped open postern door showing the moonlit pavement withoutevidently the door through which the mother and the cure had just passed out he ran rapidly towards it as he did so he heard the hurried ringing of bells and voices in the room he had quittedthe young girl had evidently been discoveredand this would give him time he had nearly reached the door when he stopped suddenlyhis blood chilled with awe it was his turn to be terrifiedhe was standing apparently before himself  his first recovering thought was that it was a mirrorso accurately was every line and detail of his face and figure reflected but a second scrutiny showed some discrepancies of costume and he saw it was a panelled portrait on the wall it was of a man of his own age height beard complexion and features with long curls like his own falling over a lace van dyke collar which however again simulated the appearance of his own huntingshirt the broadbrimmed hat in the picture whose drooping plume was lost in shadow was scarcely different from dicks sombrero but the likeness of the face to dick was marvelousconvincing as he gazed at it the wicked black eyes seemed to flash and kindle at his ownits lip curled with dicks own sardonic humor  he was recalled to himself by a step in the gallery it was the cure who had entered hastily evidently in search of one of the servants partly because it was a man and not a woman partly from a feeling of bravadoand partly from a strange sense excited by the picture that he had some claim to be there he turned and faced the pale priest with a slight dash of impatient devilry that would have done credit to the portrait but he was sorry for it the next moment  the priest looking up suddenly discovered what seemed to him to be the portrait standing before its own frame and glaring at him throwing up his hands with an averted head and an exorcis he wheeled and scuffled away dick seized the opportunity darted through the narrow door on to the rear terrace and ran under cover of the shadow of the house to the steps into the garden luckily for him this new and unexpected diversion occupied the inmates too much with what was going on in the house to give them time to search outside dick reached the lilac hedge tore up the hill and in a few moments threw himself panting on his blanket in the single look he had cast behind he had seen that the halfdark salon was now brilliantly lightedwhere no doubt the whole terrified household was now assembled he had no fear of being followed since his confrontation with his own likeness in the mysterious portrait he understood everything the apparently supernatural character of his visitation was made plain his ruffled vanity was soothedhis vindication was complete he laughed to himself and rolled about until in his suppressed merriment the rose fell from his bosom andhe stopped its freshness and fragrance recalled the innocent young girl he had frightened he remembered her gentle pleading voice and his cheek flushed well he had done the best he could in bringing her back to the houseat the risk of being taken for a burglarand she was safe now if that stupid french parson didnt know the difference between a living man and a dead and painted one it wasnt his fault but he fell asleep with the rose in his fingers  he was awake at the first streak of dawn he again bathed his horses shoulder saddled but did not mount him as the beast although better was still stiff and dick wished to spare him for the journey to still distant havre although he had determined to lie over that night at the first wayside inn luckily for him the disturbance at the chateau had not extended to the forest for dick had to lead his horse slowly and could not have escaped but no suspicion of external intrusion seemed to have been awakened and the woodland was evidently seldom invaded  by dint of laying his course by the sun and the exercise of a little woodcraft in the course of two hours he heard the creaking of a haycart and knew that he was near a traveled road but to his discomfiture he presently came to a high wall which had evidently guarded this portion of the woods from the public time however had made frequent breaches in the stones these had been roughly filled in with a rude abatis of logs and treetops pointing towards the road but as these were mainly designed to prevent intrusion into the park rather than egress from it dick had no difficulty in rolling them aside and emerging at last with his limping steed upon the white highroad the creaking cart had passed it was yet early for traffic and dick presently came upon a wineshop a bakery a blacksmiths shop laundry and a somewhat pretentious cafe and hotel in a broader space which marked the junction of another road  directly before it however to his consternation were the massive but timeworn iron gates of a park which dick did not doubt was the one in which he had spent the previous night but it was impossible to go further in his present plight and he boldly approached the restaurant as he was preparing to make his usual explanatory signs to his great delight he was addressed in a quaint broken english mixed with forgotten american slang by the whitetrousered blackalpaca coated proprietor more than thathe was a social democrat and an enthusiastic lover of americahad he not been to bostown and new york and penetrated as far west as booflo and had much pleasure in that beautiful and free country yes it was a goaed countryyou betyourlif one had reason to say so there was your electricityyour street carsyour steambotsah such steambotsand your rrailrroads ah observe compare your rrailrroads and the buffet of the pullman with the line from paris for exampleand where is one nowhere actually positively without doubt nowhere  later at an appetizing breakfastat which to dicks great satisfaction the good man had permitted and congratulated himself to sit at table with a freeborn americanhe was even more loquacious for what then he would ask was this incompetence this imbecility of france he would tell it was the vile corruption of paris the grasping of capital and companies the fatal influence of the still clinging noblesse and the insidious jesuitical power of the priests as for example monsieur the booflobil had doubtless noticed the great gates of the park before the cafe it was the preservethe huntingpark of one of the old grand seigneurs still kept up by his descendants the comtes de fontonelleshundreds of acres that had never been tilled and kept as wild waste wildernesskept for a days pleasure in a year and look you the peasants starving around its walls in their small garden patches and pinched farms and the present comte de fontonelles cascading gold on his mistresses in paris and the comtesse his mother and her daughter living there to feed and fatten and pension a brood of plotting blackcowled priests ah bah where was your republican france then but a time would come the booflobil had without doubt noticed as he came along the road the breaches in the wall of the park  dick with a slight dry reserve reckoned that he had  they were made by the scythes and pitchforks of the peasants in the revolution of 93 when the count was emigre as one says with reason skedadelle to england let them look the next time that they burn not the chateaubet your lif  the chateau said dick with affected carelessness wots the blamed thing like  it was an old affairwith armor and a picturegalleryand bricabrac he had never seen it not even as a boyit was kept very secluded then as a manyou understandhe could not ask the favor the comtes de fontonelles and himself were not friends the family did not like a cafe near their sacred gateswhere had stood only the huts of their retainers the american would observe that he had not called it cafe de chateau nor cafe de fontonellesthe gold of california would not induce him why did he remain there naturally to goad them it was a principle one understood to goad them and hold them in check one kept a cafewhy not one had ones principlesones convictionthat was another thing that was the kind of airpinwas it notthat he gustav ribaud was like  yet for all his truculent socialism he was quick obliging and charmingly attentive to dick and his needs as to dicks horse he should have the best veterinary surgeonthere was an incomparable one in the person of the blacksmithsee to him and if it were an affair of days and dick must go he himself would be glad to purchase the beast his saddle and accoutrements it was an affair of businessan advertisement for the cafe he would ride the horse himself before the gates of the park it would please his customers ha he had learned a trick or two in free america  dicks first act had been to shave off his characteristic beard and mustache and even to submit his long curls to the village barbers shears while a straw hat which he bought to take the place of his slouched sombrero completed his transformation his host saw in the change only the natural preparation of a voyager but dick had really made the sacrifice not from fear of detection for he had recovered his old swaggering audacity but from a quick distaste he had taken to his resemblance to the portrait he was too genuine a westerner and too vain a man to feel flattered at his resemblance to an aristocratic bully as he believed the ancestral de fontonelles to be even his momentary sensation as he faced the cure in the picturegallery was more from a vague sense that liberties had been taken with his dicks personality than that he had borrowed anything from the portrait  but he was not so clear about the young girl her tender appealing voice although he knew it had been addressed only to a vision still thrilled his fancy the pluck that had made her withstand her fear so longuntil he had uttered that dreadful wordstill excited his admiration his curiosity to know what mistake he had madefor he knew it must have been some frightful blunderwas all the more keen as he had no chance to rectify it what a brute she must have thought himor did she really think him a brute even thenfor her look was one more of despair and pity yet she would remember him only by that last word and never know that he had risked insult and ejection from her friends to carry her to her place of safety he could not bear to go across the seas carrying the pale unsatisfied face of that gentle girl ever before his eyes a sense of delicacynew to dick but always the accompaniment of deep feelingkept him from even hinting his story to his host though he knewperhaps because he knewthat it would gratify his enmity to the family a sudden thought struck dick he knew her house and her name he would write her a note somebody would be sure to translate it for her  he borrowed pen ink and paper and in the clean solitude of his fresh chintz bedroom indited the following letter   dear miss fontonellesplease excuse me for having skeert you i hadnt any call to do it i never reckoned to do itit was all jest my derned luck i only reckoned to tell you i was lostin them blamed woodsdont you rememberlostperdooand then you up and fainted i wouldnt have come into your garden only you see id just skeered by

thought i was the lord knows whatthough i never understood a word you got offnot knowing french but its all the same now say ive got your rose  yours very respectfully  richard fountains   dick folded the epistle and put it in his pocket he would post it himself on the morning before he left when he came downstairs he found his indefatigable host awaiting him with the report of the veterinary blacksmith there was nothing seriously wrong with the mustang but it would be unfit to travel for several days the landlord repeated his former offer dick whose money was pretty well exhausted was fain to accept reflecting that she had never seen the mustang and would not recognize it but he drew the line at the sombrero to which his host had taken a great fancy he had worn it before her  later in the evening dick was sitting on the low veranda of the cafe overlooking the white road a round white table was beside him his feet were on the railing but his eyes were resting beyond on the high mouldy iron gates of the mysterious park what he was thinking of did not matter but he was a little impatient at the sudden appearance of his hostwhom he had evaded during the afternoonat his side the mans manner was full of bursting loquacity and mysterious levity  truly it was a good hour when dick had arrived at fontonellesjust in time he could see now what a world of imbeciles was france what stupid ignorance ruled what low cunning and low tact could achievein effect what jugglers and mountebanks hypocritical priests and licentious and lying noblesse went to make up existing society ah there had been a fine excitement a regular coup dtheatre at fontonellesthe chateau yonder here at the village where the news was brought by frightened grooms and silly women he had been in the thick of it all the afternoon he had examined itinterrogated them like a juge dinstructionwinnowed it sifted it and what was it all an attempt by these wretched priests and noblesse to revive in the nineteenth centurythe age of electricity and pullman carsa miserable mediaeval legend of an apparition a miracle yes one is asked to believe that at the chateau yonder was seen last night three times the apparition of armand de fontonelles  dick started armand de fontonelles he remembered that she had repeated that name  whos he he demanded abruptly  the first comte de fontonelles when monsieur knows that the first comte has been dead three hundred years he will see the imbecility of the affair  wot did he come back for growled dick  ah it was a legend consider its artfulness the comte armand had been a hard liver a dissipated scoundrel a reckless beast but a mighty hunter of the stag it was said that on one of these occasions he had been warned by the apparition of st hubert but he had laughedfor observe he always jeered at the priests too hence this storyand had declared that the flaming cross seen between the horns of the sacred stag was only the torch of a poacher and he would shoot it good the body of the comte dead but without a wound was found in the wood the next day with his discharged arquebus in his hand the archbishop of rouen refused his body the rites of the church until a number of masses were said every year andpaid for one understands one sees their little game the count now appearshe is in purgatory more massesmore money there you are bah one understands too that the affair takes place not in a cafe like thisnot in a public placebut at a chateau of the noblesse and is seen bythe proprietor checked the characters on his fingerstwo retainers one young demoiselle of the noblesse daughter of the chatelaine herself and my faith it goes without saying by a fat priest the cure in effect two interested ones and the priesthis lie is magnificent superb for he saw the comte in the picturegalleryin effect stepping into his frame  oh come off the roof said dick impatiently they must have seen something you know the young lady wouldnt lie  monsieur ribaud leaned over with a mysterious cynical smile and lowering his voice said  you have reason to say so you have hit it my friend there was a something and if we regard the young lady you shall hear the story of mademoiselle de fontonelles is that she has walked by herself alone in the gardenyou observe alonein the moonlight near the edge of the wood you comprehend the mother and the cure are in the housefor the time effaced here at the edge of the woodthough why she continues a young demoiselle to the edge of the wood does not make itself clearshe beholds her ancestor as on a pedestal young pale but very handsome and exaltepardon  nothing said dick hurriedly go on  she beseeches him why he says he is lost she faints away on the instant thereregard meon the edge of the wood she says but her mother and monsieur le cure find her pale agitated distressed on the sofa in the salon one is asked to believe that she is transported through the airlike an angelby the spirit of armand de fontonelles incredible  well wot do you think said dick sharply  the cafe proprietor looked around him carefully and then lowered his voice significantly  a lover  a what said dick with a gasp  a lover repeated ribaud you comprehend mademoiselle has no dotthe property is nothingthe brother has everything a mademoiselle de fontonelles cannot marry out of her class and the noblesse are all poor mademoiselle is youngpretty they say of her kind it is an intolerable life at the old chateau mademoiselle consoles herself  monsieur ribaud never knew how near he was to the white road below the railing at that particular moment luckily dick controlled himself and wisely as monsieur ribauds next sentence showed him  a romancean innocent foolish liaison if you likebut all the same if known of a mademoiselle de fontonelles a compromising a fatal entanglement there you are look for this then all this story of cock and bulls and spirits mademoiselle has been discovered with her lover by some one this pretty story shall stop their mouths  but wot said dick brusquely wot if the girl was really skeert at something shed seen and fainted dead away as she said she didandandhe hesitatedsome stranger came along and picked her up  monsieur ribaud looked at him pityingly  a mademoiselle de fontonelle is picked up by her servants by her family but not by the young man in the woods alone it is even more compromising  do you mean to say said dick furiously that the ragpickers and sneaks that wade around in the slumgallion of this country would dare to spatter that young gal  i mean to say yesassuredly positively yes said ribaud rubbing his hands with a certain satisfaction at dicks fury for you comprehend not the position of la jeune fille in all france ah in america the young lady she go everywhere alone i have seen herpretty charming fascinatingalone with the young man but here no never regard me my friend the french mother she say to her daughters fiance look there is my daughter she has never been alone with a young man for five minutesnot even with you take her for your wife it is monstrous it is impossible it is so  there was a silence of a few minutes and dick looked blankly at the iron gates of the park of fontonelles then he said give me a cigar  monsieur ribaud instantly produced his cigar case dick took a cigar but waved aside the proffered match and entering the cafe took from his pocket the letter to mademoiselle de fontonelles twisted it in a spiral lighted it at a candle lit his cigar with it and returning to the veranda held it in his hand until the last ashes dropped on the floor then he said gravely to ribaud  youve treated me like a white man frenchy and i aint goin back on yerthough your ways aint my waysnohow but i reckon in this yer matter at the shotto youre a little too previous for though i dont as a ginral thing take stock in ghosts i believe every word that them folk said up thar and he added leaning his hand somewhat heavily on ribauds shoulder if youre the man i take you for youll believe it too and if that chap armand de fontonelles hadnt hev picked up that gal at that moment he would hev deserved to roast in hell another three hundred years thats why i believe her story so youll let these yer fontonelles keep their ghosts for all theyre worth and when you next feel inclined to talk about that girls lover youll think of me and shut your head you hear me frenchy im shoutin and dont you forget it  nevertheless early the next morning monsieur ribaud accompanied his guest to the railway station and parted from him with great effusion on his way back an oldfashioned carriage with a postilion passed him at a sign from its occupant the postilion pulled up and monsieur ribaud bowing to the dust approached the window and the pale stern face of a dignified whitehaired woman of sixty that looked from it  has he gone said the lady  assuredly madame i was with him at the station  and you think no one saw him  no one madame but myself  andwhat kind of a man was he  monsieur ribaud lifted his shoulders threw out his hands despairingly yet with a world of significance and said  an american  ah  the carriage drove on and entered the gates of the chateau and monsieur ribaud cafe proprietor and social democrat straightened himself in the dust and shook his fist after it     a night on the divide   with the lulling of the wind towards evening it came on to snowheavily in straight quickly succeeding flakes dropping like white lances from the sky this was followed by the usual sierran phenomenon the deep gorge which as the sun went down had lapsed into darkness presently began to reappear at first the vanished trail came back as a vividly whitening streak before them then the larches and pines that ascended from it like buttresses against the hillsides glimmered in ghostly distinctness until at last the two slopes curved out of the darkness as if hewn in marble for the sudden storm which extended scarcely two miles had left no trace upon the steep granite face of the high cliffs above the snow slipping silently from them left them still hidden in the obscurity of night in the vanished landscape the gorge alone stood out set in a chaos of cloud and storm through which the moonbeams struggled ineffectually  it was this unexpected sight which burst upon the occupants of a large covered station wagon who had chanced upon the lower end of the gorge coming from a still lower altitude they had known nothing of the storm which had momentarily ceased but had left a record of its intensity in nearly two feet of snow for some moments the horses floundered and struggled on in what the travelers believed to be some old forgotten drift or avalanche until the extent and freshness of the fall became apparent to add to their difficulties the storm recommenced and not comprehending its real character and limit they did not dare to attempt to return the way they came to go on however was impossible in this quandary they looked about them in vain for some other exit from the gorge the sides of that gigantic white furrow terminated in darkness hemmed in from the world in all directions it might have been their tomb  but although they could see nothing beyond their prison walls they themselves were perfectly visible from the heights above them and jack tenbrook quartz miner who was sinking a tunnel in the rocky ledge of shelf above the gorge stepping out from his cabin at ten oclock to take a look at the weather before turning in could observe quite distinctly the outline of the black wagon the floundering horses and the crouching figures by their side scarcely larger than pygmies on the white surface of the snow six hundred feet below him jack had courage and strength and the good humor that accompanies them but he contented himself for a few moments with lazily observing the travelers discomfiture he had taken in the situation with a glance he would have helped a brother miner or mountaineer although he knew that it could only have been drink or bravado that brought him into the gorge in a snowstorm but it was very evident that these were greenhorns or eastern tourists and it served their stupidity and arrogance right he remembered also how he having once helped an eastern visitor catch the mustang that had bucked him had been called my man and presented with five dollars he recalled how he had once spread the humble resources of his cabin before some straying members of the san francisco party who were opening the new railroad and heard the audible wonder of a lady that a civilized being could live so coarsely with these recollections in his mind he managed to survey the distant struggling horses with a fine sense of humor not unmixed with selfrighteousness there was no real danger in the situation it meant at the worst a delay and a camping in the snow till morning when he would go down to their assistance they had a spacious traveling equipage and were no doubt well supplied with furs robes and provisions for a several hours journey his own pork barrel was quite empty and his blankets worn he half smiled extended his long arms in a decided yawn and turned back into his cabin to go to bed then he cast a final glance around the interior everything was all right his loaded rifle stood against the wall he had just raked ashes over the embers of his fire to keep it intact till morning only one thing slightly troubled him a grizzly bear twothirds grown but only half tamed which had been given to him by a young lady named miggles when that charming and historic girl had decided to accompany her paralytic lover to the san francisco hospital was missing that evening it had been its regular habit to come to the door every night for some sweet biscuit or sugar before going to its lair in the underbrush behind the cabin everybody knew it along the length and breadth of hemlock ridge as well as the fact of its being a legacy from the fair exile no rifle had ever yet been raised against its lazy bulk or the stupid smalleyed head and ruff of circling hairs made more erect by its wellworn leather collar consoling himself with the thought that the storm had probably delayed its return jack took off his coat and threw it on his bunk but from thinking of the storm his thoughts naturally returned again to the impeded travelers below him and he half mechanically stepped out in his shirtsleeves for a final look at them  but here something occurred that changed his resolution entirely he had previously noticed only the three foreshortened crawling figures around the now stationary wagon bulk they were now apparently making arrangements to camp for the night but another figure had been added to the group and as it stood perched upon a wagon seat laid on the snow jack could see that its outline was not bifurcated like the others but even that general suggestion was not needed the little head the symmetrical curves visible even at that distance were quite enough to indicate that it was a woman the easy smile faded from jacks face and was succeeded by a look of concern and then of resignation he had no choice now he must go there was a woman there and that settled it yet he had arrived at this conclusion from no sense of gallantry nor indeed of chivalrous transport but as a matter of simple duty to the sex he was giving up his sleep was going down six hundred feet of steep trail to offer his services during the rest of the night as much as a matter of course as an eastern man would have offered his seat in an omnibus to a woman and with as little expectation of return for his courtesy  having resumed his coat with a bottle of whiskey thrust into its pocket he put on a pair of indiarubber boots reaching to his thighs and catching the blanket from his bunk started with an axe and shovel on his shoulder on his downward journey when the distance was half completed he shouted to the travelers below the cry was joyously answered by the three men he saw the fourth figure now unmistakably that of a slender youthful woman in a cloak helped back into the wagon as if deliverance was now sure and immediate but jack on arriving speedily dissipated that illusive hope they could only get through the gorge by taking off the wheels of the wagon placing the axle on rude sledgerunners of split saplings which with their assistance he would fashion in a couple of hours at his cabin and bring down to the gorge the only other alternative would be for them to come to his cabin and remain there while he went for assistance to the nearest station but that would take several hours and necessitate a double journey for the sledge if he was lucky enough to find one the party quickly acquiesced in jacks first suggestion  very well said jack then theres no time to be lost unhitch your horses and well dig a hole in that bank for them to stand in out of the snow this was speedily done now continued jack youll just follow me up to my cabin its a pretty tough climb but ill want your help to bring down the runners  here the man who seemed to be the head of the partyof middle age and a superior professional typefor the first time hesitated i forgot to say that there is a lady with usmy daughter he began glancing towards the wagon  i reckoned as much interrupted jack simply and i allowed to carry her up myself the roughest part of the way she kin make herself warm and comfble in the cabin until weve got the runners ready  you hear what our friend says amy suggested the gentleman appealingly to the closed leather curtains of the wagon  there was a pause the curtain was suddenly drawn aside and a charming little head and shoulders furred to the throat and topped with a bewitching velvet cap were thrust out in the obscurity little could be seen of the girls features but there was a certain willfulness and impatience in her attitude being in the shadow she had the advantage of the others particularly of jack as his figure was fully revealed in the moonlight against the snowbank her eyes rested for a moment on his high boots his heavy mustache so long as to mingle with the unkempt locks which fell over his broad shoulders on his huge red hands streaked with black grease from the wagon wheels and some blood stanched with snow drawn from bruises in cutting out brambles in the brush onmore awful than alla monstrous shiny specimen gold ring encircling one of his fingerson the whiskey bottle that shamelessly bulged from his side pocket and thenslowly dropped her dissatisfied eyelids  why cant i stay here she said languidly its quite nice and comfortable  because we cant leave you alone and we must go with this gentleman to help him  miss amy let the tail of her eye again creep shudderingly over this impossible jack i thought thethe gentleman was going to help us she said dryly  nonsense amy you dont understand said her father impatiently this gentleman is kind enough to offer to make some sledgerunners for us at his cabin and we must help him  but i can stay here while you go im not afraid  yes but youre alone here and something might happen  nothing could happen interrupted jack quickly and cheerfully he had flushed at first but he was now considering that the carrying of a lady as expensively attired and apparently as delicate and particular as this one might be somewhat difficult theres nothin that would hurt ye here he continued addressing the velvet cap and furred throat in the darkness and if there was it couldnt get at ye bein so to speak in the same sort o fix as you so youre all right he added positively  inconsistently enough the young lady did not accept this as gratefully as might have been imagined but jack did not see the slight flash of her eye as ignoring him she replied markedly to her father id much rather stop here papa  and continued jack turning also to her father you can keep the wagon and the whole gorge in sight from the trail all the way up so you can see that everythings all right why i saw you from the first he stopped awkwardly and added come along the sooner were off the quicker the jobs over  pray dont delay the gentleman andthe job said miss amy sweetly  reassured by jacks last suggestion her father followed him with the driver and the second man of the party a youngish and somewhat undistinctive individual but to whose gallant anxieties miss amy responded effusively nevertheless the young lady had especially noted jacks confession that he had seen them when they first entered the gorge and i suppose she added to herself mentally that he sat there with his boozing companions laughing and jeering at our struggles  but when the sound of her companions voices died away and their figures were swallowed up in the darkness behind the snow she forgot all this and much else that was mundane and frivolous in the impressive and majestic solitude which seemed to descend upon her from the obscurity above  at first it was accompanied with a slight thrill of vague fear but this passed presently into that profound peace which the mountains alone can give their lonely or perturbed children it seemed to her that nature was never the same on the great plains where men and cities always loomed into such ridiculous proportions as when the great mother raised herself to comfort them with smiling hillsides or encompassed them and drew them closer in the loving arms of her mountains the long white canada stretched before her in a purity that did not seem of the earth the vague bulk of the mountains rose on either side of her in a mystery that was not of this life yet it was not oppressive neither was its restfulness and quiet suggestive of obliviousness and slumber on the contrary the highly rarefied air seemed to give additional keenness to her senses her hearing had become singularly acute her eyesight pierced the uttermost extremity of the gorge lit by the full moon that occasionally shone through slowly drifting clouds her nerves thrilled with a delicious sense of freedom and a strange desire to run or climb it seemed to her in her exalted fancy that these solitudes should be peopled only by a kingly race and not by such gross and material churls as this mountaineer who helped them and i grieve to saywriting of an idealist that was and a heroine that is to beshe was getting outrageously hungry  there were a few biscuits in her travelingbag and she remembered that she had been presented with a small jar of california honey at san jose this she took out and opened on the seat before her and spreading the honey on the biscuits ate them with a keen schoolgirl relish and a pleasant suggestion of a sylvan picnic in spite of the cold it was all very strange quite an experience for her to speak of afterwards people would hardly believe that she had spent an hour or two all alone in a deserted wagon in a mountain snow pass it was an adventure such as one reads of in the magazines only something was lacking which the magazines always suppliedsomething heroic something done by somebody if that awfullooking mountaineerthat man with the long hair and mustache and that horrible gold ringwhy such a ringwas only different but he was probably gorging beefsteak or venison with her father and mr waterhousemen were always such selfish creaturesand had quite forgotten all about her it would have been only decent for them to have brought her down something hot biscuits and honey were certainly cloying and somehow didnt agree with the temperature she was really half starved and much they cared it would just serve them right if something did happen to heror seem to happen to herif only to frighten them and the pretty face that was turned up in the moonlight wore a charming but decided pout  good gracious what was that the horses were either struggling or fighting in their snow shelters then one with a frightened neigh broke from its halter and dashed into the road only to be plunged snorting and helpless into the drifts then the other followed how silly something had frightened them perhaps only a rabbit or a mole horses were such absurdly nervous creatures however it is just as well somebody would see them or hear themthat neigh was quite human and awfuland they would hurry down to see what was the matter she couldnt be expected to get out and look after the horses in the snow anyhow she wouldnt she was a good deal safer where she was it might have been rats or mice about that frightened them goodness  she was still watching with curious wonder the continued fright of the animals when suddenly she felt the wagon half bumped half lifted from behind it was such a lazy deliberate movement that for a moment she thought it came from the party who had returned noiselessly with the runners she scrambled over to the back seat unbuttoned the leather curtain lifted it but nothing was to be seen consequently with feminine quickness she said i see you perfectly mr waterhousedont be silly but at this moment there was another shock to the wagon and from beneath it arose what at first seemed to her to be an uplifting of the drift itself but as the snow was shaken away from its heavy bulk proved to be the enormous head and shoulders of a bear  yet even then she was not wholly frightened for the snout that confronted her had a feeble inoffensiveness the small eyes were bright with an eager almost childish curiosity rather than a savage ardor and the whole attitude of the creature lifted upon its hind legs was circuslike and ludicrous rather than aggressive she was enabled to say with some dignity go away shoo and to wave her luncheon basket at it with exemplary firmness but here the creature laid one paw on the back seat as if to steady itself with the singular effect of collapsing the whole side of the wagon and then opened its mouth as if in some sort of inarticulate reply but the revelation of its red tongue its glistening teeth and above all the hot suggestive fume of its breath brought the first scream from the lips of miss amy it was real and convincing the horses joined in it the three screamed together the bear hesitated for an instant then catching sight of the honeypot on the front seat which the shrinkingback of the young girl had disclosed he slowly reached forward his other paw and attempted to grasp it this exceedingly simple movement however at once doubled up the front seat sent the honeypot a dozen feet into the air and dropped miss amy upon her knees in the bed of the wagon the combined mental and physical shock was too much for her she instantly and sincerely fainted the last thing in her ears amidst this wreck of matter being the wheep of a bullet and the sharp crack of a rifle    she recovered her consciousness in the flickering light of a fire of bark that played upon the rafters of a roof thatched with bark and upon a floor of strewn and shredded bark she even suspected she was lying upon a mattress of bark underneath the heavy bearskin she could feel and touch she had a delicious sense of warmth and mingled with this strange spicing of woodland freedom even a sense of home protection and surely enough looking around she saw her father at her side  he briefly explained the situation they had been at first attracted by the cry of the frightened horses and their plunging which they could see distinctly although they saw nothing else but mr tenbrook  mr who said amy staring at the rafters  the owner of this cabinthe man who helped uscaught up his gun and calling us to follow ran like lightning down the trail at first we followed blindly and unknowingly for we could only see the struggling horses who however seemed to be alone and the wagon from which you did not seem to have stirred then for the first time my dear child we suddenly saw your danger imagine how we felt as that hideous brute rose up in the road and began attacking the wagon we called on tenbrook to fire but for some inconceivable reason he did not although he still kept running at the top of his speed then we heard you shriek  i didnt shriek papa it was the horses  my child i knew your voice  well it was only a very little screambecause i had tumbled the color was coming back rapidly to her pink cheeks  and then at your scream tenbrook firedit was a wonderful shot for the distance so everybody saysand killed the bear though tenbrook says it oughtnt to i believe he wanted to capture the creature alive theyve queer notions those hunters and then as you were unconscious he brought you up here  who brought me  tenbrook hes as strong as a horse slung you up on his shoulders like a feather pillow  oh  and then as the wagon required some repairing from the brutes attack we concluded to take it leisurely and let you rest here for a while  and where iswhere are they  at work on the wagon i determined to stay with you though you are perfectly safe here  i suppose i oughtto thankthis man papa  most certainly though of course i have already done so but he was rather curt in reply these halfsavage men have such singular ideas he said the beast would never have attacked you except for the honeypot which it scented thats absurd  then its all my fault  nonsense how could you know  and ive made all this trouble and frightened the horses and spoilt the wagon and made the man run down and bring me up here when he didnt want to  my dear child dont be idiotic amy well really  for the idiotic one was really wiping two large tears from her lovely blue eyes she subsided into an ominous silence broken by a single sniffle try to go to sleep dear youve had quite a shock to your nerves added her father soothingly she continued silent but not sleeping  i smell coffee  yes dear  youve been having coffee papa  we did have some i think said the wretched man apologetically though why he could not determine  before i came up while the bear was trying to eat me  no after  ive a horrid taste in my mouth its the honey ill never eat honey again never  perhaps its the whiskey  what  the whiskey you were quite faint and chilled you know we gave you some  out ofthatblackbottle  yes  another silence  id like some coffee i dont think hed begrudge me that if he did save my life  i dare say theres some left her father at once bestirred himself and presently brought her some coffee in a tin cup it was part of miss amys rapid convalescence or equally of her debilitated condition that she made no comment on the vessel she lay for some moments looking curiously around the cabin she had no doubt it had a worse look in the daylight but somehow the firelight brought out a wondrous luxury of color in the bark floor and thatching besides it was not smelly as she feared it would be on the contrary the spicy aroma of the woods was always dominant she remembered that it was this that always made a greasy oily picnic tolerable she raised herself on her elbow seeing which her father continued confidently perhaps dear if you sat up for a few moments you might be strong enough presently to walk down with me to the wagon it would save time  amy instantly lay down again i dont know what you can be thinking of papa after this shock really i dont feel as if i could stand alone much less walk but of course with pathetic resignation if you and mr waterhouse supported me perhaps i might crawl a few steps at a time  nonsense amy of course this man tenbrook will carry you down as he brought you up only i thoughtbut there are steps theyre coming now noonly he  the sound of crackling in the underbrush was followed by a momentary darkening of the open door of the cabin it was the tall figure of the mountaineer but he did not even make the pretense of entering standing at the door he delivered his news to the interior generally it was to the effect that everything was ready and the two other men were even then harnessing the horses then he drew back into the darkness  papa said amy in a sudden frightened voice ive lost my bracelet  havent you dropped it somewhere there in the bunk asked her father  no its on the floor of the wagon i remember now it fell off when i tumbled and it will be trodden upon and crushed couldnt you run down ahead of me and warn them papa dear mr tenbrook will have to go so slowly with me she tumbled out of the bunk with singular alacrity shook herself and her skirts into instantaneous gracefulness and fitted the velvet cap on her straying hair then she said hurriedly run quick papa dear and as you go call him in and say i am quite ready  thus adjured the obedient parent disappeared in the darkness with him also disappeared miss amys singular alacrity sitting down carefully again on the edge of the bunk she leaned against the post with a certain indefinable languor that was as touching as it was graceful i need not tell any feminine readers that there was no dissimulation in all thisno coquetry no ostentationand that the young girl was perfectly sincere but the masculine reader might like to know that the simple fact was that since she had regained consciousness she had been filled with remorse for her capricious and ungenerous rejection of tenbrooks proffered service more than that she felt she had periled her life in that moment of folly and that this manthis herohad saved her for hero he was even if he did not fulfill her idealit was only she that was not a heroine perhaps if he had been more like what she wished she would have felt this less keenly love leaves little room for the exercise of moral ethics so miss amy forester being a good girl at bottom and not exactly loving this man felt towards him a frank and tender consideration which a more romantic passion would have shrunk from showing consequently when tenbrook entered a moment later he found amy paler and more thoughtful but as he fancied much prettier than before looking up at him with eyes of the sincerest solicitude  nevertheless he remained standing near the door as if indicating a possible intrusion his face wearing a look of lowering abstraction it struck her that this might be the effect of his long hair and general uncouthness and this only spurred her to a fuller recognition of his other qualities  i am afraid she began with a charming embarrassment that instead of resting satisfied with your kindness in carrying me up here i will have to burden you again with my dreadful weakness and ask you to carry me down also but all this seems so little after what you have just done and for which i can never never hope to thank you she clasped her two little hands together holding her gloves between and brought them down upon her lap in a gesture as prettily helpless as it was unaffected  i have done scarcely anything he said glancing away towards the fire andyour father has thanked me  you have saved my life  no no he said quickly not that you were in no danger except from my rifle had i missed  i see she said eagerly with a little posthumous thrill at having been after all a kind of heroine and it was a wonderful shot for you were so careful not to touch me  please dont say any more he said with a slight movement of half awkwardness half impatience it was a rough job but its over now  he stopped and chafed his red hands abstractedly together she could see that he had evidently just washed themand the glaring ring was more in evidence than ever but the thought gave her an inspiration  youll at least let me shake hands with you she said extending both her own with childish frankness  hold on miss forester he said with sudden desperation it aint the square thing look here i cant play this thing on youi cant let you play it on me any longer you werent in any dangeryou never were that bear was only a halfwild thing i helped to rar myself its taken sugar from my hand night after night at the door of this cabin as it might have taken it from yours here if it was alive now it slept night after night in the brush not fifty yards away the mornings never come yettill now he said hastily to cover an odd break in his voice when it didnt brush along the whole side of this cabin to kinder wake me up and say so long afore it browsed away into the canyon thar aint a man along the whole divide who didnt know it thar aint a man along the whole divide that would have drawn a bead or pulled a trigger on it till now it never had an enemy but the bees it never even knew why horses and cattle were frightened of it it wasnt much of a pet youd say miss forester it wasnt much to meet a ladys eye but we of the woods must take our friends where we find em and of our own kind it aint no fault of yours miss that you didnt know it it aint no fault of yours what happened but when it comes to your thanking me for it whyitsits rather rough you seeand gets me he stopped short as desperately and as abruptly as he had begun and stared blankly at the fire  a wave of pity and shame swept over the young girl and left its high tide on her cheek but even then it was closely followed by the feminine instinct of defence and defiance the real herothe gentlemanshe reasoned bitterly would have spared her all this knowledge  but why she said with knitted brows why if you knew it was so precious and so harmlesswhy did you fire upon it  because he said almost fiercely turning upon her because you screamed and then i knew it had frightened you he stopped instantly as she momentarily recoiled from him but the very brusqueness of his action had dislodged a tear from his dark eyes that fell warm on the back of her hand and seemed to blot out the indignity listen miss he went on hurriedly as if to cover up his momentary unmanliness i knew the bear was missing tonight and when i heard the horses scurrying about i reckoned what was up i knew no harm could come to you for the horses were unharnessed and away from the wagon i pelted down that trail ahead of them all like grim death calkilatin to get there before the bear they wouldnt have understood me i was too high up to call to the creature when he did come out and i kinder hoped you wouldnt see him even when he turned towards the wagon i knew it wasnt you he was after but suthin else and i kinder hoped miss that you being different and quickerminded than the rest would see it too all the while them folks were yellin behind me to fireas if i didnt know my work i was halfway downand then you screamed and then i forgot everythingeverything but standing clear of hitting youand i fired i was that savage that i wanted to believe that hed gone mad and would have touched you till i got down there and found the honeypot lying alongside of him but thereits all over now i wouldnt have let on a word to you only i couldnt bear to take your thanks for it and i couldnt bear to have you thinking me a brute for dodgin them he stopped walked to the fire leaned against the chimney under the shallow pretext of kicking the dull embers into a blaze which however had only the effect of revealing his two glistening eyes as he turned back again and came towards her well he said with an ineffectual laugh its all over now its all in the days work i reckonand now miss if youre ready and will just fix yourself your own way so as to ride easy ill carry you down and slightly bending his strong figure he dropped on one knee beside her with extended arms  now it is one thing to be carried up a hill in temperate unconscious blood and practical business fashion by a tall powerful man with steadfast glowering eyes but quite another thing to be carried down again by the same man who has been crying and when you are conscious that you are going to cry too and your tears may be apt to mingle so miss amy forester said oh wait please sit down a moment oh mr tenbrook i am so very very sorry and clapping her hand to her eyes burst into tears  oh please please dont miss forester said jack sitting down on the end of the bunk with frightened eyes please dont do that it aint worth it im only a brute to have said anything  no no you are so noble so forgiving sobbed miss forester and i have made you go and kill the only thing you cared for that was all your own  no missnot all my own eitherand that makes it so rough for it was only left in trust with me by a friend it was her only companion  her only companion echoed miss forester sharply lifting her bowed head  except said jack hurriedly miscomprehending the emphasis with masculine fatuityexcept the dying man for whom she lived and sacrificed her whole life she gave me this ring to always remind me of my trust i suppose he added ruefully looking down upon it its no use now id better take it off  then amy eyed the monstrous object with angelic simplicity i certainly should she said with infinite sweetness it would only remind you of your loss but she added with a sudden swift imploring look of her blue eyes if you could part with it to me it would be such a reminder and token ofof your forgiveness  jack instantly handed it to her and now he said let me carry you down  i think she said hesitatingly thati had better try to walk and she rose to her feet  then i shall know that you have not forgiven me said jack sadly  but i have no right to trouble  alas she had no time to finish her polite objection for the next moment she felt herself lifted in the air smelled the bark thatch within an inch of her nose saw the firelight vanish behind her and subsiding into his curved arms as in a hammock the two passed forth into the night together  i cant find your bracelet anywhere amy said her father when they reached the wagon  it was on the floor in the lint said amy reproachfully but of course you never thought of that    my pen halts with some diffidence between two conclusions to this veracious chronicle as they agree in result though not in theory or intention i may venture to give them both to one coming from the lips of the charming heroine herself i naturally yield the precedence oh the bear story i dont really remember whether that was before i was engaged to john or after but i had known him for some time father introduced him at the governors ball at sacramento let me seei think it was in the winter of 56 yes it was very amusing i always used to charge john with having trained that bear to attack our carriage so that he might come in as a hero oh of course there are a hundred absurd stories about himthey used to say that he lived all alone in a cabin like a savage and all that sort of thing and was a friend of a dubious woman in the locality whom the common people made a heroine ofmiggles or wiggles or some such preposterous name but look at john there can you conceive it the listener glancing at a very handsome cleanshaven fellow faultlessly attired could not conceive such an absurdity so i therefore simply give the opinion of joshua bixley superintendent of the long divide tunnel company for what it is worth i never took much stock in that bear story and its captivating old foresters daughter old forester knew a thing or two and when he was out here consolidating tunnels he found out that jack tenbrook was about headed for the big lead and brought him out and introduced him to amy you see jack clear grit as he was was mighty rough style and about as simple as they make em and they had to get up something to account for that girls taking a shine to him but they seem to be happy enoughand what are you going to do about it  and i transfer this philosophic query to the reader    the youngest prospector in calaveras   he was scarcely eight when it was believed that he could have reasonably laid claim to the above title but he never did he was a small boy intensely freckled to the roots of his tawny hair with even a suspicion of it in his almondshaped but somewhat full eyes which were the greenish hue of a ripe gooseberry all this was very unlike his parents from whom he diverged in resemblance in that fashion so often seen in the southwest of america as if the youth of the boundless west had struck a new note of independence and originality overriding all conservative and established rules of heredity something of this was also shown in a singular and remarkable reticence and firmness of purpose quite unlike his family or schoolfellows his mother was the wife of a teamster who had apparently once dumped his family consisting of a boy and two girls on the roadside at burnt spring with the canvas roof of his wagon to cover them while he proceeded to deliver other freight not so exclusively his own at other stations along the road returning to them on distant and separate occasions with slight additions to their stock habitation and furniture in this way the canvas roof was finally shingled and the hut enlarged and under the quickening of a smiling california sky and the forcing of a teeming california soil the chancesown seed took root and became known as medlikers ranch or medlikers with its bursting garden patch and its three sheds or leantos  the girls helped their mother in a childish imitative way the boy john bunyan after a more desultory and original fashionwhen he was not going to or ostensibly coming from school for he was seldom actually there something of this fear was in the mind of mrs medliker one morning as she looked up from the kettle she was scrubbing with premonition of more worriting to behold the reverend mr staples the local minister hale john bunyan medliker into the shanty with one hand letting johnny go he placed his back against the door and wiped his face with a red handkerchief johnny dropped into a chair furtively glancing at the arm by which mr staples had dragged him and feeling it with the other hand to see if it was really longer  ive been requested by the schoolmaster said the rev mr staples putting his handkerchief back into his broad felt hat with a gasping smile to bring our young friend before you for a matter of counsel and discipline i have done so sister medliker with some difficultyhe looked down at john bunyan who again felt his arm and was satisfied that it was longerbut we must do our dooty even with difficulty to ourselves and perhaps to others our young friend john bunyan stands on a giddy heighton slippery places and continued mr staples with a lofty disregard to consecutive metaphor his feet are taking fast hold of destruction here the child drew a breath of relief possibly at the prospect of being on firm ground of any kind at last but sister medliker to whom the staples style of exordium had only a sabbath significance turned to her offspring abruptly  and whats these yer doins now john and me a slavin to send ye to school  thus appealed to johnny looked for a reply at his feet at his arm and at the kettle then he said i aint done nothin but heindicating stapleshez been nigh onter pullin off my arm  its now almost a week ago continued mr staples waving aside the interruption with a smile of painful christian tolerance or perhaps ten daysi wont be too surethat the schoolmaster discovered that johnny had in his possession two or three flakes of fine river goldeach of the value of half a dollar or perhaps sixtytwo and one half cents on being questioned where he got them he refused to say although subsequently he alleged that he had found them it being a single instance he was given the benefit of the doubt and nothing more was said about it but a few days after he was found trying to pass off at mr smiths store two other flakes of a different size and a small nugget of the value of four or five dollars at this point i was called in he repeated to me i grieve to say the same untruthfulness and when i suggested to him the obvious fact that he had taken it from one of the miners sluice boxes and committed the grievous sin of theft he wickedly denied itso that we are prevented from carrying out the christian command of restoring it even one fold instead of four or five fold as the mosaic law might have required we were alas unable to ascertain anything from the miners themselves though i grieve to say they one and all agreed that their take that week was not at all what they had expected i even went so far as to admit the possibility of his own statement and besought him at least to show me where he had found it he at first refused with great stubbornness of temper but later consented to accompany me privately this afternoon to the spot mr staples paused and sinking his voice gloomily and with his eyes fixed upon johnny continued slowly when i state that after several times trying to evade me on the way he finally led me to the top of bald hill where there is not a scrap of soil and not the slightest indication and still persisted that he found it there you will understand sister medliker the incorrigibility of his conduct and how he has added the sin of false witness to his breaking the eighth commandment but i leave him to your christian discipline let us hope that if through his stiffnecked obduracy he has haply escaped the vengeance of mans law he will not escape the rod of the domestic tabernacle  ye kin leave him to me said mrs medliker in her anxiety to get rid of the parson assuming a confidence she was far from feeling  so be it sister medliker said staples drawing a long satisfactory breath and let us trust that when you have rastled with his flesh and spirit you will bring us joyful tidings to wednesdays mothers meeting  he clapped his soft hat on his head cast another glance at the wicked johnny opened the door with his hand behind him and backed himself into the road  now johnny said mrs medliker setting her lips together as the door closed look me right in the face and say where you stole that gold  but johnny evidently did not think that his mothers face at that moment offered any moral support for he did not look at her but after gazing at the kettle said slowly i didnt steal no gold  then said mrs medliker triumphantly if ye didnt steal it youd say right off how ye got it  children are often better logicians than their elders to john bunyan the stealing of gold and the mere refusal to say where he got it were two distinct and separate things that the negation of the second proposition meant the affirmation of the first he could not accept but then children are also imitative and fearful of the older intellect it struck johnny that his mother might be right and that to her it really meant the same thing so after a moments silence he replied more confidently i suppose i stoled it  but he was utterly unprepared for the darkening change in his mothers face and her furious accents you stole ityou stole it you limb and you sit there and brazenly tell me who did you steal it from tell me quick afore i wring it out of you  completely astounded and bewildered at this new turn of affairs johnny again fell back upon the dreadful truth and gasped i dont know  you dont know you devil did you take it from frazers  no  from the simmons brothers  no  from the blazing star company  no  from a store  no  then in created goodnesswhere did you get it  johnny raised his browngooseberry eyes for a single instant to his mothers and said i found it  mrs medliker gasped again and stared hopelessly at the ceiling yet she was conscious of a certain relief after all it was possible that he had found itliar as he undoubtedly was  then why dont you say where you awful child  dont want to  johnny would have liked to add that he saw no reason why he should tell other people who found gold were not obliged to tell there was jim brody who had struck a lead and kept the locality secret nobody forced him to tell nobody called him a thief nobody had dragged him about by the arm until he showed it why was it wrong that a little boy should find gold it wasnt agin the commandments mr staples had never got up and said thou shalt not find gold his mother had never made him pray not to find it the schoolmaster had never read him awful stories of boys who found gold and never said anything about it and so came to a horrid end all this crowded his small boys mind and crowding choked his small boys utterance  you jest wait till your father comes home said mrs medliker and hell see whether you want to or not and now get yourself off to bed and stay there  johnny knew that his fatherwhose teams had increased to five wagons and whose route extended forty miles furtherwas not due for a week and that the catastrophe was yet remote his present punishment he had expected he went into the adjoining bedroom which he occupied with his sister and began to undress he lingered for some time over one stocking and finally cautiously removed from it a small piece of flake gold which he had kept concealed all day under his big toe to the great discomfort of that member but this was only a small ordinary selfmartyrdom of boyhood he scratched a boyish hieroglyphic on the metal and when his mothers back was turned scraped a small hole in the adobe wall inserted the gold in it and covered it up with a plaster made of the moistened debris it was safeso was his secretfor it need not perhaps be stated here that johnny had told the truth and had honestly found the gold but whereyes that was his own secret and now johnny with the instinct of all young animals dismissed the whole subject from his mind and reclining comfortably upon his arm fell into an interesting study of the habits of the red ant as exemplified in a crack of the adobe wall and with the aid of a burnt match succeeded in diverting for the rest of the afternoon the attention of a whole laborious colony  the next morning however brought trouble to him in the curiosity of his sisters heightened by their belief that he could at any moment be taken off to prisonwhich was their understanding of their mothers story i grieve to say that to them this invested him with a certain romantic heroism from the gratification of which the hero himself was not exempt nevertheless he successfully evaded their questioning and on broader impersonal grounds as girls it was none of their business he wasnt agoing to tell them his secrets and what did they know about gold anyway they couldnt tell it from brass the attitude of his mother was however still perplexing she was no longer actively indignant but treated him with a mysterious reserve that was the more appalling the fact was that she no longer believed in his theftindeed she had never seriously accepted itbut his strange reticence and secretiveness piqued her curiosity and even made her a little afraid of him the capacity for keeping a secret she believed was manlike and reminded herfor no reason in the worldof jim medliker her husband whom she feared well she would let them fight it out between them more than that she was finally obliged to sink her reserve in employing him in the necessary chores for the house and he was sent on an errand to the country store at the crossroads but he first extracted his goldflake from the wall and put it in his pocket  on arriving at the store it was plain even to his boyish perceptions that the minister had circulated his miserable story two or three of the customers spoke to each other in a whisper and looked at him more than that when he began his homeward journey he saw that two of the loungers were evidently following him half in timidity and half in boyish mischief he once or twice strayed from the direct road and snatched a fearful joy in observing their equal divergence as he passed mr stapless house he saw that reverend gentleman sneak out of his back gate and without seeing the two others join in the inquisitorial procession but the events of the past day had had their quickening effect upon johnnys intellect a brilliantly wicked thought struck him as he was passing a perfectly bare spot on the road he managed without being noticed to cast his glittering flake of gold on the sterile ground at the other side of the road where the ministers path would lie then at a point where the road turned he concealed himself in the brush the reverend mr staples hurried forward as he lost sight of the boy in the sweep of the road but halted suddenly johnnys heart leaped the minister looked around him stooped picked up the piece of gold thrust it hurriedly in his waistcoat pocket and continued his way when he reached the turn of the road before passing it he availed himself of his solitude to pause and again examine the treasure and again return it to his pocket but to johnnys surprise he here turned back walked quickly to the spot where he had found it carefully examined the locality kicking the loose soil and stones around with his feet until he had apparently satisfied himself that there was no more and no goldbearing indications in the soil at this moment however the two other inquisitors came in sight and mr staples turned quickly and hurried on before he had passed the brush where johnny was concealed the two men overtook him and exchanged greetings they both spoke of johnny and his crime of having followed him with a view of finding out where he went to procure his gold and of his having again evaded them mr staples agreed with their purpose but to johnnys intense astonishment said nothing about his own find when they had passed on the boy slipped from his place of concealment and followed them at a distance until his own house came in view here the two men diverged but the minister continued on towards the other store and postoffice on the main road  he would have told his mother what he had seen and his surprise that the minister had not spoken of finding the gold to the other men but he was checked first by his mothers attitude towards him which was clearly the same as the ministers and second by the knowledge that she would have condemned his dropping the gold in the ministers paththough he knew not whyor asked his reason for it which he was equally sure he could not formulate though he also knew not why but that evening as he was returning from the spring with water he heard the ministers voice in the kitchen it had been a day of surprises and revelations to johnny but the climax seemed to be reached as he entered the room and he now stood transfixed and openmouthed as he heard mr staples say  its all very well sister medliker to comfort your heart with vain hopes and delusions a mothers leanins is the souls deceivinsand yer leanin on a broken reed if the boy truly found that gold hed have come to ye and said behold mother i have found gold in the highways and byways rejoice and be exceedin glad and hev poured it inter yer lap yes continued mr staples aggressively to the boy as he saw him stagger back with his pail in hand yes sir that would have been the course of a christian child  for a moment johnny felt the blood boiling in his ears and a thousand words seemed crowding in his throat thenhe gasped and choked thenhe began again and stopped with the suffocation of indignation  but mr staples saw in his agitation only an awakened conscience and nudging mrs medliker leaned eagerly forward for a reply then he repeated with suave encouragement go on johnny speak it out  then said johnny in a high shrill falsetto that startled them then wot for did you pick up that piece o gold in the road this arternoon and say nothin of it to the men who followed ye ye did i seed yer and ye didnt say nothin of it to anybody and ye aint sayin nothin of it now ter maw and yeve got it in yer vest and its mine and i dropped it gimme it  astonishment confusion and rage swelled and empurpled staples face it was his turn to gasp for breath yet in the same moment he made an angry dash at the boy but mrs medliker interfered this was an entirely new feature in the case great is the power of gold a single glance at the ministers confusion had convinced her that johnnys accusation was true and it was johnnys moneyconstructively hersthat the minister was concealing his mere possession of that gold had more effect in straightening out her loose logic than any sense of hypocrisy  you leave the boy be brother staples said mrs medliker sharply i reckon wots his is hisn spite of whar he got it  mr staples saw his mistake and smiled painfully as he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket i believe i did pick up something he said that may or may not have been gold but i have dropped it again or thrown it away and really it is of little concern in our moral lesson for we have only his word that it was really his how do we know it  cos it has my marks on it said johnny quickly it had a crisscross i scratched on it i kin tell it good enuf  mr staples turned suddenly pale and rose of course he said to mrs medliker with painful dignity if you set so much value upon a mere worldly trifle i will endeavor to find it it may be in my other pocket he backed out of the door in his usual fashion but instantly went over to the postoffice where as he afterwards alleged he had changed the ore for coin in a moment of inadvertence but johnnys hieroglyphics were found on it and in some mysterious way the story got about it had two effects that johnny did not dream of it had forced his mother into an attitude of complicity with him it had raised up for him a single friend jake stielitzer quartz miner had declared that burnt spring was playing it low down on johnny that if they really believed that the boy took gold from their sluice boxes it was their duty to watch their claims and not the boy that it was only their excuse for snooping after him and they only wanted to find his strike which was as much his as their claims were their own all this with great proficiency of epithet but also a still more recognized proficiency with the revolver which made the former respected  thats the real nigger in the fence johnny said jake twirling his huge mustache and they only want to know where your lead isand dont yer tell em let em bile over with waitin first and thatll put the fire out does yer pop know  no said johnny  nor yer mar  no  jake whistled then its only you yourself  johnny nodded violently and his brown eyes glistened  its a heap of information to be packed away in a chap of your size johnny makes you feel kinder crowded inside eh must keep it to yourself eh  have to said johnny with a gasp that was a little like a sigh  it caused jake to look at him attentively see here johnny he said now ef ye wanted to tell somebody about itsomebody as was a friend of yoursme fr instance  johnny slowly withdrew the freckled warty little hand that had been resting confidingly in jakes and gently sidled away from him jake burst into a loud laugh  all right johnny boy he said with a hearty slap upon the boys back keep yer head shut ef yer wanter only ef anybody else comes bummin round ye like this jest turn him over to me and ill lift him outer his boots  jake kept his word and his distance thereafter indeed it was after this first and last conversation with him that the influence of his powerful protection was so strong that all active criticisms of johnny ceased and only a respectful surveillance of his movements lingered in the settlement i do not know that this was altogether distasteful to the child it would have been strange indeed if he had not felt at times exalted by this mysterious influence that he seemed to have acquired over his fellow creatures if he were merely hunting blackberries in the brush he was always sure sooner or later to find a ready hand offered to help and accompany him if he trapped a squirrel or tracked down a wild bees hoard he generally found a smiling face watching him prospectors sometimes stopped him with well johnny as a chipper and farminded boy now whar would you advise us to dig i grieve to say that johnny was not above giving his adviceand that it was invariably of not the smallest use to the recipient  and so the days passed mr medlikers absence was protracted and the hour of retribution and punishment still seemed far away the blackberries ripened and dried upon the hillside and the squirrels had gathered their hoards the bees no longer came and went through the thicket but johnny was still in daily mysterious possession of his grains of gold and then one dayafter the fate of all heroic humanityhis secret was imperilled by the blandishments and machinations of the allpowerful sex  florry fraser was a little playmate of johnnys why with his doubts of his elder sisters intelligence and integrity he should have selected a child two years younger and of singular simplicity was like his other secret his own what she saw in him to attract her was equally strange possibly it may have been his browngooseberry eyes or his warts but she was quite content to trot after him like a young squaw carrying his bowarrow or his trap supremely satisfied to share his woodland knowledge or his scanter confidences for nobody who knew johnny suspected that she was privy to his great secret howbeit wherever his ragged straw hat thatched with his tawny hair was detected in the brush the little nankeen sunbonnet of florry was sure to be discerned not far behind for two weeks they had not seen each other a fell disease nurtured in ignorance dirt and carelessness was striking right and left through the valleys of the foothills and florry whose sister had just recovered from an attack had been sequestered with her but one morning as johnny was bringing his wood from the stack behind the house he saw to his intense delight a picket of the road fence slipped aside by a small red hand and a moment after florry squeezed herself through the narrow opening her round cheeks were slightly flushed and there was a scrap of red flannel around her plump throat that heightened the whiteness of her skin  my said johnny with halfreal halfaffected admiration how splendiferous  sore froat said florry in a whisper trying to insert her two chubby fingers between the bandage and her chin i mussent go outer the garden patch i mussent play in the woods for ill be seed i mussent stay long for theyll ketch me outer bed  outer bed repeated johnny with intense admiration as he perceived for the first time that florry was in a flannel nightgown with bare legs and feet  ess  whereupon these two delightful imps chuckled and wagged their heads with a sincere enjoyment that this mere world could not give johnny slipped off his shoes and stockings and hurriedly put them on the infant florry securing them from falling off with a thick cord this added to their enjoyment  we can play cubby house in the stone heap whispered florry  hol on till i tote in this wood said johnny you hide till i come back  johnny swiftly delivered his load with an alacrity he had never shown before then they played cubby housenot fifty feet from the cabin with a hushed but guilty satisfaction but presently it palled their domain was too circumscribed for variety robinson crusoe up the tree was impossible as being visible from the house windows johnny was at his wits end florry was fretful and fastidious then a great thought struck him and left him cold if i show you a show you wont tell he said suddenly  no  wish yermadie  ess  got any penny  no  got any slate pencil  no  aint got any pins nor nuthin you kin go in for a pin  but florry had none of childhoods fluctuating currency with her having so to speak no pockets  well said johnny brightening up ye kin go in for luv  the child clipped him with her small arms and smiled and johnny leading the way they crept on all fours through the thick ferns until they paused before a deep fissure in the soil half overgrown with bramble in its depths they could hear the monotonous trickle of water it was really the source of the spring that afterwards reappeared fifty yards nearer the road and trickled into an unfailing pool known as the burnt spring from the brown color of the surrounding bracken it was the water supply of the ranch and the reason for mr medlikers original selection of that site johnny lingered for an instant looked carefully around and then lowered himself into the fissure a moment later he reached up his arms to florry lowered her also and both disappeared from view yet from time to time their voices came faintly from belowwith the gurgle of wateras of festive gnomes at play  at the end of ten minutes they reappeared a little muddy a little bedraggled but flushed and happy there were two pink spots on florrys cheeks and she clasped something tightly in her little red fist  there said johnny when they were seated in the straw again now mind you dont tell  but here suddenly florrys lips began to quiver and she gave vent to a small howl of anguish  you aint bit by a trantler nor nuthin said johnny anxiously hush up  noo but  but what said johnny  mar said i must tell mar said i was to fin out where you get the truly gold mar said i was to get you to take me howled florry in an agony of remorse  johnny gasped you injin he began  but i wontjohnny said florry clutching his leg frantically i wont and i shant i aint no injin  then between her sobs she told him how her mother and mr staples had said that she was to ask johnny the next time they met to take her where they found the truly gold and she was to remember where it was and to tell them and they were going to give her a new dolly and a hunk of gingerbread but i wontand i shant she said passionately she was quite pale again  johnny was convinced but thoughtful tell em he said hoarsely tell em a big whopper they wont know no better theyll never guess where and he briefly recounted the wildgoose chase he had given the minister  and get the dolly and the cake said florry her eyes shining through her tears  in course said johnny theyll get the dolly back but you kin have eated the cake first they looked at each other and their eyes danced together over this heavensent inspiration then johnny took off her shoes and stockings rubbed her cold feet with his dirty handkerchief and said now you trot over to your mar  he helped her through the loose picket of the fence and was turning away when her faint voice again called him  johnny  he turned back she was standing on the other side of the fence holding out her arms to him he went to her with shining eyes lifted her up and from her hot but loving little lips took a fatal kiss  for only an hour later mrs fraser found florry in her bed tossing with a high fever and a light head she was talking of johnny and gold and had a flake of the metal in her tiny fist when mr staples was sent for and with the mother and father hung anxiously above her bed to their eager questioning they could only find out that florry had been to a high mountain ever so far away and on the top of it there was gold lying around and a shining figure was giving it away to the people  and who were the people florry dear said mr staples persuasively anybody ye know here  they woz angels said florry with a frightened glance over her shoulder  i grieve to say that mr staples did not look as pleased at the celestial vision as he might have and poor mrs fraser probably saw that in her childs face which drove other things from her mind yet mr staples persisted  and who led you to this beautiful mountain was it johnny  no  who then  florry opened her eyes on the speaker i fink it was dod she said and closed them again  but here dr duchesne hurried in and after a single glance at the child hustled mr staples from the room for there were grave complications that puzzled him florry seemed easier and quieter under his kindly voice and touch but did not speak againand so slowly sinking passed away that night in a dreamless sleep this was followed by a mad panic at burnt spring the next day and mrs medliker fled with her two girls to sacramento leaving johnny ostensibly strong and active to keep house until his fathers return but mr medlikers return was again delayed and in the epidemic which had now taken a fast hold of the settlement johnnys secretand indeed the boy himselfwas quite forgotten it was only on mr medlikers arrival it was known that he had been lying dangerously ill alone in the abandoned house in his strange reticence and firmness of purpose he had kept his sufferings to himselfas he had his other secretand they were revealed only in the wasted hollow figure that feebly opened the door to his father  on which intelligence mr staples was as usual promptly on the spot with his story of johnnys secret to the father and his usual eager questioning to the fastsinking boy and now johnny he said leaning over the bed tell us all there is one from whom no secrets are hid remember too that dear florry who is now with the angels has already confessed  perhaps it was because johnny even at that moment hated the man perhaps it was because at that moment he loved and believed in florry or perhaps it was only that because at that moment he was nearer the greater truth than his questioner but he said in a husky voice you lie  staples drew back with a flushed face but lips that writhed in a pained and still persistent eagerness but johnny at least tell us wherewhwowwow  i am obliged to admit that these undignified accents came from mr staples own lips and were due to the sudden pressure of mr medlikers arm around his throat the teamster was irascible and prompt through much muledriving and his arm was from the same reason strong and sinewy mr staples felt himself garroted and dragged from the room and only came to under the stars outside with the hoarse voice of mr medliker in his ears  youre a minister of the gospel i know but ef ye say another word to my johnny ill knock the gospel stuffin out of ye ye hear me ive driven mules afore  he then strode back into the room ye neednt answer johnny hes gone  but so too had johnny for he never answered the question in this world nor please god was he required to in the next he lay still and dead the community was scandalized the next day when mr medliker sent for a minister from sacramento to officiate at his childs funeral in place of mr staples and then the subject was dropped    but the influence of johnnys hidden treasure still remained as a superstition in the locality prospecting parties were continually made up to discover the unknown claim but always from evidence and data altogether apocryphal it was even alleged that a miner had one night seen the little figures of johnny and florry walking over the hilltop hand in hand but that they had vanished among the stars at the very moment he thought he had discovered their secret and then it was forgotten the prosperous mr medliker now the proprietor of a stagecoach route moved away to sacramento medlikers ranch became a station for changing horses and as the new railway in time superseded even that sank into a blacksmiths shop on the outskirts of the new town of burnt spring and then one day six years after news fell as a bolt from the blue  it was thus recorded in the county paper a piece of rare good fortune involving it is said the development of a lead of extraordinary value has lately fallen to the lot of mr john silsbee the popular blacksmith on the site of the old medliker ranch in clearing out the failing watercourse known as burnt spring mr silsbee came upon a rich ledge or pocket at the actual source of the springa fissure in the ground a few rods from the road the present yield has been estimated to be from eight to ten thousand dollars but the event is considered as one of the most remarkable instances of the vagaries of prospecting ever known as this valuable pothole existed undisturbed for eight years not fifty yards from the old cabin that was in former times the residence of j medliker esq and the station of the pioneer stage company and was utterly unknown and unsuspected by the previous inhabitants verily truth is stranger than fiction     a tale of three truants   the schoolmaster at hemlock hill was troubled that morning three of his boys were missing this was not only a notable deficit in a rollcall of twenty but the absentees were his three most original and distinctive scholars he had received no preliminary warning or excuse nor could he attribute their absence to any common local detention or difficulty of travel they lived widely apart and in different directions neither were they generally known as chums or comrades who might have entered into an unhallowed combination to play hookey  he looked at the vacant places before him with a concern which his other scholars little shared having after their first lively curiosity not unmixed with some envy of the derelicts apparently forgotten them he missed the cropped head and inquisitive glances of jackson tribbs on the third bench the red hair and brown eyes of providence smith in the corner and there was a blank space in the first bench where julian fleming a lanky giant of seventeen had sat still it would not do to show his concern openly and as became a man who was at least three years the senior of the eldest julian fleming he reflected that they were only boys and that their friends were probably ignorant of the good he was doing them and so dismissed the subject nevertheless it struck him as wonderful how the little world beneath him got on without them hanky rogers bully who had been kept in wholesome check by julian fleming was lively and exuberant and his conduct was quietly accepted by the whole school johnny stebbins tribbss bosom friend consorted openly with tribbss particular enemy some of the girls were singularly gay and conceited it was evident that some superior masculine oppression had been removed  he was particularly struck by this last fact when the next morning no news coming of the absentees he was impelled to question his flock somewhat precisely concerning them there was the usual shy silence which follows a general inquiry from the teachers desk the children looked at one another giggled nervously and said nothing  can you give me any idea as to what might have kept them away said the master  hanky rogers looked quickly around began playin hook in a loud voice but stopped suddenly without finishing the word and became inaudible the master saw fit to ignore him  beehuntin said annie roker vivaciously  who is asked the master  provy smith of course allers beehuntin gets lots o honey got two full combs in his desk last week hes awful on bees and honey aint he jinny this in a high voice to her sister  the younger miss roker thus appealed to was heard to murmur that of all the sneakin beehunters she had ever seed provy smith was the worst and squirrelsfor nuts she added  the master became attentivea clue seemed probable here would tribbs and fleming be likely to go with him he asked  a significant silence followed the master felt that the children recognized a doubt of this knowing the boys were not chums possibly they also recognized something incriminating to them and with characteristic freemasonry looked at one another and were dumb  he asked no further questions but when school was dismissed mounted his horse and started for the dwelling of the nearest culprit jackson tribbs four miles distant he had often admired the endurance of the boy who had accomplished the distance including the usual meanderings of a country youth twice a day on foot in all weathers with no diminution of spirits or energy he was still more surprised when he found it a mountain road and that the house lay well up on the ascent of the pass autumn was visible only in a few flaming sumacs set among the climbing pines and here in a little clearing to the right appeared the dwelling he was seeking  tribbses or tribbss run was devoted to the work of cutting down the pines midway on a long regularly sloping mountainside which allowed the trunks after they were trimmed and cut into suitable lengths to be slid down through rude runs or artificial channels into the valley below where they were collected by teams and conveyed to the nearest mills the business was simple in the extreme and was carried on by tribbs senior two men with saws and axes and the natural laws of gravitation the house was a long log cabin several sheds roofed with bark or canvas seemed consistent with the still lingering summer and the heated odors of the pines but were strangely incongruous to those white patches on the tableland and the white tongue stretching from the ridge to the valley but the master was familiar with those sierran contrasts and as he had never ascended the trail before it might be only the usual prospect of the dwellers there at this moment mr tribbs appeared from the cabin with his axe on his shoulder nodding carelessly to the master he was moving away when the latter stopped him  is jackson here he asked  no said the father half impatiently still moving on haint seen him since yesterday  nor has he been at school said the master either yesterday or today  mr tribbs looked puzzled and grieved now i reckoned you had kep him in for some devilment of hisn or lessons  not all night said the master somewhat indignant at this presumption of his arbitrary functions  humph said mr tribbs mariar mrs tribbs made her appearance in the doorway the schoolmaster allows that jackson aint bin to school at all then turning to the master he added thar you settle it between ye and quietly walked away  mrs tribbs looked by no means satisfied with or interested in the proposed teteatete hev ye looked in the bresh i e brush or underwood for him she said querulously  no said the master i came here first there are two other boys missingprovidence smith and julian fleming did either of them  but mrs tribbs had interrupted him with a gesture of impatient relief oh thats all is it playin hookey together in course scuse me i must go back to my bakin she turned away but stopped suddenly touched as the master fondly believed by some tardy maternal solicitude but she only said when he does come back you just give him a whalin will ye and vanished into her kitchen  the master rode away half ashamed of his foolish concern for the derelicts but he determined to try smiths father who owned a small rancho lower down on a spur of the same ridge but the spur was really nearer hemlock hill and could have been reached more directly by a road from there he however kept along the ridge and after half an hours ride was convinced that jackson tribbs could have communicated with provy smith without coming nearer hemlock hill and this revived his former belief that they were together he found the paternal smith engaged in hoeing potatoes in a stony field the look of languid curiosity with which he had regarded the approach of the master changed to one of equally languid aggression as he learned the object of his visit  wot are ye comin to me for i aint runnin your school he said slowly and aggressively i started providence all right for it mornin afore last since when i never set eyes on him that lets me out my business young feller is lookin arter the ranch yours i reckon is lookin arter your scholars  i thought it my business to tell you your son was absent from school said the master coldly turning away if you are satisfied i have nothing more to say nevertheless for the moment he was so startled by this remarkable theory of his own responsibility in the case that he quite accepted the fathers callousnessor rather it seemed to him that his unfortunate charges more than ever needed his protection there was still the chance of his hearing some news from julian flemings father he lived at some distance in the valley on the opposite side of hemlock hill and thither the master made his way luckily he had not gone far before he met mr fleming who was a teamster en route like the fathers of the other truants he was also engaged in his vocation but unlike the others fleming senior was jovial and talkative he pulled up his long team promptly received the masters news with amused interest and an invitation to spirituous refreshment from a demijohn in his wagon  me and the ole woman kind o spekilated that jule might hev been over with aunt marthy but dont you worry mr schoolmaster theyre limbs every one o them but theyll fetch up somewhere all square just you put two fingers o that corn juice inside ye and let em slide ye didnt hear what the lekshun news was when ye was at smiths did ye  the master had not inquired he confessed he had been worried about the boys he had even thought that julian might have met with an accident  mr fleming wiped his mouth with a humorous affectation of concern met with an accident yes i reckon not one accident but two of em these yer accidents jules met with had two legs and were mighty lively accidents you bet and took him off with em or mebbe they had four legs and hes huntin em yet accidents now i never thought o that well when you come across him and them accidents you just whale em all three and ye wont take another drink well so long then gee up he rolled away with a laugh in the heavy dust kicked up by his plunging mules and the master made his way back to the schoolhouse his quest for that day was ended  but the next morning he was both astounded and relieved at the assembling of school to find the three truants back in their places his urgent questioning of them brought only the one and same response from each got lost on the ridge he further gathered that they had slept out for two nights and were together all the time but nothing further and no details were given the master was puzzled they evidently expected punishment that was no doubt also the wish of their parents but if their story was true it was a serious question if he ought to inflict it there was no means of testing their statement there was equally none by which he could controvert it it was evident that the whole school accepted it without doubt whether they were in possession of details gained from the truants themselves which they had withheld from him or whether from some larger complicity with the culprits he could not say he told them gravely that he should withhold equally their punishment and their pardon until he could satisfy himself of their veracity and that there had been no premeditation in their act they seemed relieved but here again he could not tell whether it sprang from confidence in their own integrity or merely from youthful hopefulness that delayed retribution never arrived  it was a month before their secret was fully disclosed it was slowly evolved from corroborating circumstances but always with a shy reluctance from the boys themselves and a surprise that any one should think it of importance it was gathered partly from details picked up at recess or on the playground from the voluntary testimony of teamsters and packers from a record in the county newspaper but always shaping itself into a consecutive and harmonious narrative  it was a story so replete with marvelous escape and adventure that the master hesitated to accept it in its entirety until after it had long become a familiar history and was even forgotten by the actors themselves and even now he transcribes it more from the circumstances that surrounded it than from a hope that the story will be believed   what happened  master provy smith had started out that eventful morning with the intention of fighting master jackson tribbs for the kingship of table ridgea trifling territory of ten leagues squaretribbs having infringed on his boundaries and claimed absolute sovereignty over the whole mountain range julian fleming was present as referee and bottleholder the battle ground selected was the highest part of the ridge the hour was six oclock which would allow them time to reach school before its opening with all traces of their conflict removed the air was crisp and colda trifle colder than usualand there was a singular thickening of the suns rays on the ridge which made the distant peaks indistinct and ghostlike however the two combatants stripped to the buff and fleming patronizingly took position at the corner leaning upon a rifle which by reason of his superior years and the wilderness he was obliged to traverse in going to school his father had lent him to carry it was that day a providential weapon  suddenly fleming uttered the word sho the two combatants paused in their first squaring off to see to their surprise that their referee had faced round with his gun in his hand and was staring in another direction  bar shouted the three voices together a huge bear followed by its cubs was seen stumbling awkwardly away to the right making for the timber below in an instant the boys had hurried into their jackets again and the glory of fight was forgotten in the fever of the chase why should they pound each other when there was something to really kill they started in instant pursuit julian leading  but the wind was now keen and bitter in their faces and that peculiar thickening of the air which they had noticed had become first a dark blue and then a whitening pall in which the bear was lost they still kept on suddenly julian felt himself struck between the eyes by what seemed a snowball and his companions were as quickly spattered by gouts of monstrous clinging snowflakes others as quickly followedit was not snowing it was snowballing they at first laughed affecting to retaliate with these whirling flying masses shaken like clinging feathers from a pillow but in a few seconds they were covered from head to foot by snow their limbs impeded or pinioned against them by its weight their breath gone they stopped blindly breathlessly then with a common instinct they turned back but the next moment they heard julian cry look out coming towards them out of the storm was the bear who had evidently turned back by the same instinct an ungovernable instinct seized the younger boys and they fled but julian stopped with leveled rifle the bear stopped too with sullen staring eyes but the eyes that glanced along the rifle were young true and steady julian fired the hot smoke was swept back by the gale into his face but the bear turned and disappeared in the storm again julian ran on to where his companions had halted at the report a little ashamed of their cowardice keep on that way he shouted hoarsely no use tryin to go where the bar couldnt keep on  keep onwhar there aint no trailno nuthin said jackson querulously to hold down a rising fear it was true the trail had long since disappeared even their footprints of a moment before were filled up by the piling snow they were isolated in this stony upland high in air without a rock or tree to guide them across its vast white level they were bitterly cold and benumbed the stimulus of the storm and chase had passed but julian kept driving them before him himself driven along by the furious blast yet trying to keep some vague course along the waste so an hour passed then the wind seemed to have changed or else they had traveled in a circlethey knew not which but the snow was in their faces now but worst of all the snow had changed too it no longer fell in huge blue flakes but in millions of stinging gray granules julians face grew hard and his eyes bright he knew it was no longer a snowsquall but a lasting storm he stopped the boys tumbled against him he looked at them with a strange smile  hev you two made up he said  noo  make up then  what  shake hands  they clasped each others red benumbed fingers and laughed albeit a little frightened at julian go on he said curtly  they went on dazedly stupidly for another hour  suddenly provy smiths keen eyes sparkled he pointed to a singular irregular mound of snow before them plainly seen above the dreary level julian ran to it with a cry and began wildly digging i knew i hit him he cried as he brushed the snow from a huge and hairy leg it was the beardead but not yet cold he had succumbed with his huge back to the blast the snow piling a bulwark behind him where it had slowly roofed him in the halffrozen lads threw themselves fearlessly against his furry coat and crept between his legs nestling themselves beneath his still warm body with screams of joy the snow they had thrown back increased the bulwark and drifting over it in a few moments inclosed them in a thin shell of snow thoroughly exhausted after a few grunts of satisfaction a deep sleep fell upon them from which they were awakened only by the pangs of hunger alas their dinnersthe school dinnershad been left on the inglorious battlefield nevertheless they talked of eating the bear if it came to the worst they would have tried it even then but they were far above the belt of timber they had matcheswhat boy has notbut no wood still they were reassured and even delighted with this prospect and so fell asleep again stewing with the dead bear in the halfimpervious snow and woke up in the morning ravenous yet to see the sun shining in their faces through the melted snow and for jackson tribbs to quickly discover four miles away as the crow flies the cabin of his father among the flaming sumacs  they started up in the glare of the sun which at first almost blinded them they then discovered that they were in a depression of the tableland that sloped before them to a deep gully in the mountainside which again dropped into the canyon below the trail they had lost they now remembered must be near this edge but it was still hidden and in seeking it there was danger of some fatal misstep in the treacherous snow nevertheless they sallied out bravely although they would fain have stopped to skin the bear but julians mandate was peremptory they spread themselves along the ridge at times scraping the loose snow away in their search for the lost trail  suddenly they all slipped and fell but rose again quickly laughing then they slipped and fell again but this time with the startling consciousness that it was not they who had slipped but the snow as they regained their feet they could plainly see now that a large crack on the white field some twenty feet in width extended between them and the carcass of the bear showing the glistening rock below again they were thrown down with a sharp shock jackson tribbs who had been showing a strange excitement suddenly gave a cry of warning lie flat fellers but keep acrawlin and jumpin were goin down a slide and the next moment they were sliding and tossing apparently with the whole snowfield down towards the gullied precipice  what happened after this and how long it lasted they never knew for hurried along with increasing momentum but always mechanically clutching at the snow and bounding from it as they swept on they sometimes lost breath and even consciousness at times they were half suffocated in rolling masses of drift and again free and skimming over its arrested surface but always falling as it seemed to them almost perpendicularly in one of these shocks they seemed to be going through a thicket of underbrush but provy smith knew that they were the tops of pinetrees at last there was one shock longer and lasting followed by a deepening thunder below them the avalanche had struck a ledge in the mountain side and precipitated its lower part into the valley  then everything was still until provy heard julians voice calling he answered but there was no response from tribbs had he gone over into the valley they set up a despairing shout a voicea smothered onethat might be his came apparently from the snow beneath them they shouted again the voice vague and hollow responded but it was now surely his  where are you screamed provy  down the chimbley  there was a black square of adobe sticking out of the snow near them they ran to it there was a hole they peered down but could see nothing at first but a faint glimmer  come down fellows it aint far said tribbss voice  wot yer got there asked julian cautiously  suthin to eat  that was enough in another instant julian and provy went down the chimney what was a matter of fifteen feet after a thousand tribbs had already lit a candle by which they could see that they were in the cabin of some tunnelman at work on the ridge he had probably been in the tunnel when the avalanche fell and escaped though his cabin was buried the three discoverers helped themselves to his larder they laughed and ate as at a picnic played cards pretended it was a robbers cave and finally wrapping themselves in the miners blankets slept soundly knowing where they were and confident also that they could find the trail early the next morning they did so and without going to their homes came directly to schoolhaving been absent about fifty hours they were in high spirits except for the thought of approaching punishment never dreaming to evade it by anything miraculous in their adventures   such was briefly their story its truth was corroborated by the discovery of the bears carcass by the testimony of the tunnelman who found his larder mysteriously ransacked in his buried cabin and above all by the long white tongue that for many months hung from the ledge into the valley nobody thought the lanky julian a heroleast of all himself nobody suspected that jackson tribbss treatment of a slide had been gathered from experiments in his fathers runsand he was glad they did not the masters pardon obtained the three truants cared little for the opinion of hemlock hill they knew themselves that was enough
