12579224	lothair  by benjamin disraeli      chapter 1   i remember him a little boy said the duchess a pretty little boy but very shy his mother brought him to us one day she was a dear friend of mine you know she was one of my bridesmaids  and you have never seen him since mamma inquired a married daughter who looked like the younger sister of her mother  never he was an orphan shortly after i have often reproached myself but it is so difficult to see boys then he never went to school but was brought up in the highlands with a rather savage uncle and if he and bertram had not become friends at christchurch i do not well see how we ever could have known him  these remarks were made in the morningroom of brentham where the mistress of the mansion sat surrounded by her daughters all occupied with various works one knitted a purse another adorned a slipper a third emblazoned a page beautiful forms in counsel leaned over frames embroidery while two fair sisters more remote occasionally burst into melody as they tried the passages of a new air which had been dedicated to them in the manuscript of some devoted friend  the duchess one of the greatest heiresses of britain singularly beautify and gifted with native grace had married in her teens one of the wealthiest and most powerful of our nobles and scarcely order than herself her husband was as distinguished for his appearance and his manners as his bride and those who speculate on race were interested in watching the development of their progeny who in form and color and voice and manner and mind were a reproduction of their parents who seemed only the elder brother and sister of a gifted circle the daughters with one exception came first and all met the same fate after seventeen years of a delicious home they were presented and immediately married and all to personages of high consideration after the first conquest this fate seemed as regular as the order of nature then came a son who was now at christchurch and then several others some at school and some scarcely out of the nursery there was one daughter unmarried and she was to be presented next season though the family likeness was still apparent in lady corisande in general expression she differed from her sisters they were all alike with their delicate aquiline noses bright complexions short upper lips and eyes of sunny light the beauty of lady corisande was even more distinguished and more regular but whether it were the effect of her darkbrown hair and darker eyes her countenance had not the lustre of the res and its expression was grave and perhaps pensive  the duke though still young and naturally of a gay and joyous temperament had a high sense of duty and strong domestic feelings he was never wanting in his public place and he was fond of his wife and his children still more proud of them every day when he looked into the glass and gave the last touch to his consummate toilet he offered his grateful thanks to providence that his family was not unworthy of him  his grace was accustomed to say that he had only one misfortune and it was a great one he had no home his family had married so many heiresses and he consequently possessed so many halls and castles at all of which periodically he wished from a right feeling to reside that there was no sacred spot identified with his life in which his heart in the bustle and tumult of existence could take refuge brentham was the original seat of his family and he was even passionately fond of it but it was remarkable how very short a period of his yearly life was passed under its stately roof so it was his custom always to repair to brentham the moment the season was over and he would exact from his children that however short might be the time they would be his companions under those circumstances the daughters loved brentham and they loved to please their father but the sonsinlaw though they were what is called devoted to their wives and unusual as it may seem scarcely less attached to their legal parents did not fall very easily into this arrangement the country in august without sport was unquestionably to them a severe trial nevertheless they rarely omitted making their appearance and if they did occasionally vanish sometimes to cowes sometimes to switzerland sometimes to norway they always wrote to their wives and always alluded to their immediate or approaching return and their letters gracefully contributed to the fund of domestic amusement  and yet it would be difficult to find a fairer scene than brentham offered especially in the lustrous effulgence of a glorious english summer it was an italian palace of freestone vast ornate and in scrupulous condition its spacious and graceful chambers filled with treasures of art and rising itself from statued and stately terraces at their foot spread a gardened domain of considerable extent bright with flowers dim with coverts of rare shrubs and musical with fountains its limit reached a park with timber such as the midland counties only can produce the fallow deer trooped among its ferny solitudes and gigantic oaks but beyond the waters of the broad and winding lake the scene became more savage and the eye caught the dark forms of the red deer on some jutting mount shrinking with scorn from communion with his gentler brethren    chapter 2   lothair was the little boy whom the duchess remembered he was a posthumous child and soon lost a devoted mother his only relation was one of his two guardians a scotch noblea presbyterian and a whig this uncle was a widower with some children but they were girls and though lothair was attached to them too young to be his companions their father was a keen hard man honorable and just but with no softness of heart or manner he guarded with precise knowledge and with unceasing vigilance over lothairs vast inheritance which was in many counties and in more than one kingdom but he educated him in a highland home and when he had reached boyhood thought fit to send him to the high school of edinburgh lothair passed a monotonous if not a dull life but he found occasional solace in the scenes of a wild and beautiful nature and delight in all the sports of the field and forest in which he was early initiated and completely indulged although an englishman he was fifteen before he revisited his country and then his glimpses of england were brief and to him scarcely satisfactory he was hurried sometimes to vast domains which he heard were his own and sometimes whisked to the huge metropolis where he was shown st pauls and the britishmuseum these visits left a vague impression of bustle without kindness and exhaustion without excitement and he was glad to get back to his glens to the moor and the mountainstreams  his father in the selection of his guardians had not contemplated this system of education while he secured by the appointment of his brotherinlaw the most competent and trustworthy steward of his sons fortune he had depended on another for that influence which should mould the character guide the opinions and form the tastes of his child the other guardian was a clergyman his fathers private tutor and heartfriend scarcely his parents senior but exercising over him irresistible influence for he was a man of shining talents and abounding knowledge brilliant and profound but unhappily shortly after lothair became an orphan this distinguished man seceded from the anglican communion and entered the church of rome from this moment there was war between the guardians the uncle endeavored to drive his colleague from the trust in this he failed for the priest would not renounce his office the scotch noble succeeded however in making it a fruitless one he thwarted every suggestion that emanated from the obnoxious quarter and indeed the secret reason of the almost constant residence of lothair in scotland and of his harsh education was the fear of his relative that the moment he crossed the border he might by some mysterious process fall under the influence that his guardian so much dreaded and detested  there was however a limit to these severe precautions even before lothair should reach his majority his father had expressed in his will that his son should be educated at the university of oxford and at the same college of which he had been a member his uncle was of opinion he complied with the spirit of this instruction by sending lothair to the university of edinburgh which would give the last tonic to his moral system and then commenced a celebrated chancerysuit instituted by the roman catholic guardian in order to enforce a literal compliance with the educational condition of the will the uncle looked upon this movement as a popish plot and had recourse to every available allegation and argument to baffle it but ultimately in vain with every precaution to secure his protestant principles and to guard against the influence or even personal interference of his roman catholic guardian the lordchancellor decided that lothair should be sent to christchurch  here lothair who had never been favored with a companion of his own age and station soon found a congenial one in the heir of brentham inseparable in pastime not dissociated even in study sympathizing companionship soon ripened into fervent friendship they lived so much together that the idea of separation became not only painful but impossible and when vacation arrived and brentham was to be visited by its future lord what more natural than that it should be arranged that lothair should be a visitor to his domain    chapter 3   although lothair was the possessor of as many palaces and castles as the duke himself it is curious that his first dinner at brentham was almost his introduction into refined society he had been a guest at the occasional banquets of his uncle but these were festivals of the picts and scots rude plenty and coarse splendor with noise instead of conversation and a tumult of obstructive defendants who impeded by their want of skill the very convenience which they were purposed to facilitate how different the surrounding scene a table covered with flowers bright with fanciful crystal and porcelain that had belonged to sovereigns who had given a name to its color or its form as for those present all seemed grace and gentleness from the radiant daughters of the house to the noiseless attendants that anticipated all his wants and sometimes seemed to suggest his wishes  lothair sat between two of the married daughters they addressed him with so much sympathy that he was quite enchanted when they asked their pretty questions and made their sparkling remarks roses seemed to drop from their lips and sometimes diamonds it was a rather large party for the brentham family were so numerous that they themselves made a festival there were four married daughters the duke and two sonsinlaw a clergyman or two and some ladies and gentlemen who were seldom absent from this circle and who by their useful talents and various accomplishments alleviated the toil or cares of life from which even princes are not exempt  when the ladies had retired to the duchesss drawingroom all the married daughters clustered round their mother  do you know mamma we all think him very goodlooking said the youngest married daughter the wife of the listless and handsome st aldegonde  and not at all shy said lady montairy though reserved  i admire deepblue eyes with dark lashes said the duchess  notwithstanding the decision of lady montairy lothair was scarcely free from embarrassment when he rejoined the ladies and was so afraid of standing alone or talking only to men that he was almost on the point of finding refuge in his dinnercompanions had not he instinctively felt that this would have been a social blunder but the duchess relieved him her gracious glance caught his at the right moment and she rose and met him some way as he advanced the friends had arrived so late that lothair had had only time to make a reverence of ceremony before dinner  it is not our first meeting said her grace but that you cannot remember  indeed i do said lothair and your grace gave me a golden heart  how can you remember such things exclaimed the duchess which i had myself forgotten  i have rather a good memory replied lothair and it is not wonderful that i should remember this for it is the only present that ever was made me  the evenings at brentham were short but they were sweet it was a musical family without being fanatical on the subject there was always music but it was not permitted that the guests should be deprived of other amusements but music was the basis of the evenings campaigns the duke himself sometimes took a second the four married daughters warbled sweetly but the great performer was lady corisande when her impassioned tones sounded there was a hushed silence in every chamber otherwise many things were said and done amid accompanying melodies that animated without distracting even a whistplayer the duke himself rather preferred a game of piquet or cart with captain mildmay and sometimes retired with a troop to a distant but still visible apartment where they played with billiardballs games which were not billiards  the ladies had retired the duke had taken his glass of seltzerwater and had disappeared the gentry lingered and looked at each other as if they were an assembly of poachers gathering for an expedition and then lord st aldegonde tall fair and languid said to lothair do you smoke  no  i should have thought bertram would have seduced you by this time then let us try montairy will give you one of his cigarettes so mild that his wife never finds him out    chapter 4   the breakfastroom at brentham was very bright it opened on a garden of its own which at this season was so glowing and cultured into patterns so fanciful and finished that it had the resemblance of a vast mosaic the walls of the chamber were covered with bright drawings and sketches of our modern masters and frames of interesting miniatures and the meal was served on half a dozen or more round tables which vied with each other in grace and merriment brilliant as a cluster of greek or italian republics instead of a great metropolitan table like a central government absorbing all the genius and resources of the society  every scene in this life at brentham charmed lothair who though not conscious of being of a particularly gloomy temper often felt that he had somehow or other hitherto passed through life rarely with pleasure and never with joy  after breakfast the ladies retired to their morningroom and the gentlemen strolled to the stables lord st aldegonde lighting a manilla cheroot of enormous length as lothair was very fond of horses this delighted him the stables at brentham were rather too far from the house but they were magnificent and the stud worthy of them it was numerous and choice and above all it was useful it could supply a readier number of capital ridinghorses than any stable in england brentham was a great riding family in the summer season the duke delighted to head a numerous troop penetrate far into the country and scamper home to a nineoclock dinner all the ladies of the house were fond and fine horsewomen the mount of one of these ridingparties was magical the dames and damsels vaulted on their barbs and genets and thoroughbred hacks with such airy majesty they were absolutely overwhelming with their bewildering habits and their bewitching hats  every thing was so new in this life at brentham to lothair as well as so agreeable that the first days passed by no means rapidly for though it sounds strange time moves with equal slowness whether we experience many impressions or none in a new circle every character is a study and every incident an adventure and the multiplicity of the images and emotions restrains the hours but after a few days though lothair was not less delighted for he was more so he was astonished at the rapidity of time the life was exactly the same but equally pleasant the same charming companions the same refined festivity the same fascinating amusements but to his dismay lothair recollected that nearly a fortnight had elapsed since his arrival lord st aldegonde also was on the wing he was obliged to go to cowes to see a sick friend though he considerately left bertha behind him the other soninlaw remained for he could not tear himself away from his wife he was so distractedly fond of lady montairy that he would only smoke cigarettes lothair felt it was time to go and he broke the circumstance to his friend bertram  these two old fellows as they mutually described each other could not at all agree as to the course to be pursued bertram looked upon lothairs suggestion as an act of desertion from himself at their time of life the claims of friendship are paramount and where could lothair go to and what was there to do nowhere and nothing whereas if he would remain a little longer as the duke expected and also the duchess bertram would go with him anywhere he liked and do any thing he chose so lothair remained  in the evening seated by lady montairy lothair observed on her sisters singing and said i never heard any of our great singers but i cannot believe there is a finer voice in existence  corisandes is a fine voice said lady montairy but i admire her expression more than her tone for there are certainly many finer voices and some day you will hear them  but i prefer expression said lothair very decidedly  ah yes doubtless said lady montairy who was working a purse and thats what we all want i believe at least we married daughters they say my brother granville st aldegonde says we are all too much alike and that bertha st aldegonde would be parallel if she had no sisters  i dont at all agree with lord st aldegonde said lothair with energy i do not think it is possible to have too many relatives like you and your sisters  lady montairy looked up with a smile but she did not meet a smiling countenance he seemed what is called an earnest young man this friend of her brother bertram  at this moment the duke sent swift messengers for all to come even the duchess to partake in a new game just arrived from russia some miraculous combination of billiardballs some rose directly some lingering a moment arranging their work but all were in motion corisande was at the piano and disencumbering herself of some music lothair went up to her rather abruptly  your singing he said is the finest thing i ever heard i am so happy that i am not going to leave brentham tomorrow there is no place in the world that i think equal to brentham  and i love it too and no other place she replied and i should be quite happy if i never left it    chapter 5   lord montairy was passionately devoted to croquet he flattered himself that he was the most accomplished male performer existing he would have thought absolutely the most accomplished were it not for the unrivalled feats of lady montairy she was the queen of croquet her sisters also used the mallet with admirable skill but not like georgina lord montairy always looked forward to his summer croquet at brentham it was a great croquet family the brentham family even listless lord st aldegonde would sometimes play with a cigar never out of his mouth they did not object to his smoking in the air on the contrary they rather liked it captain mildmay too was a brilliant hand and had written a treatise on croquetthe best going  there was a great croquetparty one morning at brentham some neighbors had been invited who loved the sport mr blenkinsop a grave young gentleman whose countenance never relaxed while he played and who was understood to give his mind entirely up to croquet he was the owner of the largest estate in the county and it was thought would have very much liked to have allied himself with one of the young ladies of the house of brentham but these flowers were always plucked so quickly that his relations with the distinguished circle never grew more intimate than croquet he drove over with some fine horses and several cases and bags containing instruments and weapons for the fray his sister came with him who had forty thousand pounds but they said in some mysterious manner dependent on his consent to her marriage and it was added that mr blenkinsop would not allow his sister to marry because he would miss her so much in his favorite pastime there were some other morning visitors and one or two young curates in cassocks  it seemed to lothair a game of great deliberation and of more interest than gayety though sometimes a cordial cheer and sometimes a ringing laugh of amiable derision notified a signal triumph or a disastrous failure but the scene was brilliant a marvellous lawn the duchesss turkish tent with its rich hangings and the players themselves the prettiest of all the spectacle with their coquettish hats and their halfveiled and halfrevealed underraiment scarlet and silver or blue and gold made up a sparkling and modish scene  lothair who had left the players for a while and was regaining the lawn met the duchess  your grace is not going to leave us i hope he said rather anxiously  for a moment i have long promised to visit the new dairy and i think this a good opportunity  i wish i might be your companion said lothair and invited he was by her graces side  they turned into a winding walk of thick and fragrant shrubs and after a while they approached a dell surrounded with high trees that environed it with perpetual shade in the centre of the dell was apparently a gothic shrine fair in design and finished in execution and this was the duchesss new dairy a pretty sight is a firstrate dairy with its flooring of fanciful tiles and its cool and shrouded chambers its stained windows and its marble slabs and porcelain pans of cream and plenteous platters of fantasticallyformed butter  mrs woods and her dairymaids look like a dutch picture said the duchess were you ever in holland  i have never been anywhere said lothair  you should travel said the duchess  i have no wish said lothair  the duke has given me some coreean fowls said the duchess to mrs woods when they had concluded their visit do you think you could take care of them for me  well grace i am sure i will do my best but then they are very troublesome and i was not fortunate with my cochin i had rather they were sent to the aviary grace if it were all the same  i should so like to see the aviary said lothair  well we will go  and this rather extended their walk and withdrew them more from the great amusement of the day  i wish your grace would do me a great favor said lothair abruptly breaking a rather prolonged silence  and what is that said the duchess  it is a very great favor repeated lothair  if it be in my power to grant it its magnitude would only be an additional recommendation  well said lothair blushing deeply and speaking with much agitation i would ask your graces permission to offer my hand to your daughter  the duchess i looked amazed corisande she exclaimed  yes to lady corisande  corisande replied the duchess after a pause has absolutely not yet entered the world corisande is a child and youyou my dear friendi am sure you will pardon me if i say soyou are not very much older than corisande  i have no wish to enter the world said lothair with much decision  i am not an enemy to youthful marriages said the duchess i married early myself and my children married early and i am very happy and i hope they are but some experience of society before we settle is most desirable and is one of the conditions i cannot but believe of that felicity which we all seek  i hate society said lothair i would never go out of my domestic circle if it were the circle i contemplate  my dear young friend said the duchess you could hardly have seen enough of society to speak with so much decision  i have seen quite enough of it said lothair i went to an evening party last seasoni came up from christchurch on purpose for itand if ever they catch me at another they shall inflict any penalty they please  i fear it was a stupid party said the duchess smiling and glad to turn if possible the conversation into a lighter vein  no it was a very grand party i believe and not exactly stupidit was not that but i was disgusted with all i saw and all i heard it seemed to me a mass of affectation falsehood and malignity  oh dear said the duchess how very dreadful but i did not mean merely going to parties for society i meant knowledge of the world and that experience which enables us to form sound opinions on the affairs of life  oh as for that said lothair my opinions are already formed on every subject that is to say every subject of importance and what is more they will never change  i could not say that of corisande said the duchess  i think we agree on all the great things said lothair musingly her church views may be a little higher than mine but i do not anticipate any permanent difficulty on that head although my uncle made me go to kirk i always hated it and always considered myself a churchman then as to churches themselves she is in favor of building churches and so am i and schoolsthere is no quantity of schools i would not establish my opinion is you cannot have too much education provided it be founded on a religious basis i would sooner renounce the whole of my inheritance than consent to secular education  i should be sorry to see any education but a religious education remarked the duchess  well then said lothair that is our life or a great part of it to complete it here is that to which i really wish to devote my existence and in which i instinctively feel lady corisande would sympathize with methe extinction of pauperism  that is a vast subject said the duchess  it is the terror of europe and the disgrace of britain said lothair and i am resolved to grapple with it it seems to me that pauperism is not an affair so much of wages as of dwellings if the workingclasses were properly lodged at their present rate of wages they would be richer they would be healthier and happier at the same cost i am so convinced of this that the moment i am master i shall build two thousand cottages on any estates i have the designs already  i am much in favor of improved dwellings for the poor said the duchess but then you must take care that your dwellings are cottages and not villas like my cousins the duke of luton  i do not think i shall make that mistake replied lothair it constantly engages my thought i am wearied of hearing of my wealth and i am conscious it has never brought me any happiness i have lived a great deal alone dearest duchess and thought much of these things but i feel now i should be hardly equal to the effort unless i had a happy home to fall back upon  and you will have a happy home in due time said the duchess and with such good and great thoughts you deserve one but take the advice of one who loved your mother and who would extend to you the same affection as to her own children before you take a step which cannot be recalled see a little more of the world  lothair shook his head no he said after a pause my idea of perfect society is being married as i propose and paying visits to brentham and when the visits to brentham ceased then i should like you and the duke to pay visits to us  but that would be a fairytale said the duchess  so they walked on in silence  suddenly and abruptly lothair turned to the duchess and said does your grace see objection to my speaking to your daughter  dear friend indeed yes what you would say would only agitate and disturb corisande her character is not yet formed and its future is perplexing at least to me murmured the mother she has not the simple nature of her sisters it is a deeper and more complicated mind and i watch its development with fond but anxious interest then in a lighter tone she added you do not know very much of us try to know more everybody under this roof views you with regard and you are the brother friend of our eldest son wherever we are you will always find a home but do not touch again upon this subject at least at present for it distresses me and then she took his arm and pressed it and by this time they had gained the croquetground    chapter 6   one of the least known squares in london is hexham square though it is one of the oldest not that it is very remote from the throng of existence but it is isolated in a dingy district of silent and decaying streets once it was a favored residence of opulence and power and its architecture still indicates its former and prouder destiny but its noble mansions are now divided and broken up into separate dwellings or have been converted into chambers and offices lawyers and architects and agents dwell in apartments where the richlysculptured chimneypieces the carved and gilded pediments over the doors and sometimes even the painted ceilings tell a tale of vanished stateliness and splendor  a considerable portion of the north side of the square is occupied by one house standing in a courtyard with iron gates to the thoroughfare this is hexham house and where lord hexham lived in the days of the first georges it is reduced in size since his time two considerable wings having been pulled down about sixty years ago and their materials employed in building some residences of less pretension but the body of the dwellinghouse remains and the courtyard though reduced in size has been retained  hexham house has an old oak entrancehall panelled with delicacy and which has escaped the rifling of speculators in furniture and out of it rises a staircase of the same material of a noble character adorned occasionally with figures armorial animals holding shields and sometimes a grotesque form rising from fruits and flowers all doubtless the work of some famous carver the staircase led to a corridor on which several doors open and through one of these at the moment of our history a man dressed in a dark cassock and holding a card in his hand was entering a spacious chamber meagrely but not shabbily furnished there was a rich cabinet and a fine picture in the next room not less spacious but which had a more inhabited look a cheerful fire tables covered with books and papers and two individuals busily at work with their pens he gave the card to a gentleman who wore also the cassock and who stood before the fire with a book in his hand and apparently dictating to one of the writers  impossible said the gentleman shaking his head i could not even go in as monsignore berwick is with his eminence  but what shall i do said the attendant his eminence said that when mr giles called he never was to be denied  the monsignore has been here a long time you must beg mr giles to wait make him comfortable give him a newspaper not the tablet the times men like mr giles love reading the advertisements or stop give him this his eminences lecture on geology it will show him the church has no fear of science ah theres my bell mr giles will not have to wait long so saying the gentleman put down his volume and disappeared through an antechamber into a farther apartment  it was a library of moderate dimensions and yet its wellfilled shelves contained all the weapons of learning and controversy which the deepest and the most active of ecclesiastical champions could require it was unlike modern libraries for it was one in which folios greatly predominated and they stood in solemn and sometimes magnificent array for they bore many of them on their ancient though costly bindings the proofs that they had belonged to many a prince and even sovereign of the church over the mantelpiece hung a portrait of his holiness pius ix and on the table in the midst of many papers was an ivory crucifix  the master of the library had risen from his seat when the chief secretary entered and was receiving an obeisance above the middle height his stature seemed magnified by the attenuation of his form it seemed that the soul never had so frail and fragile a tenement he was dressed in a dark cassock with a red border and wore scarlet stockings and over his cassock a purple tippet and on his breast a small golden cross his countenance was naturally of an extreme pallor though at this moment slightly flushed with the animation of a deeplyinteresting conference his cheeks were hollow and his gray eyes seemed sunk into his clear and noble brow but they flashed with irresistible penetration such was cardinal grandison  all that i can do is said his eminence when his visitor was ushered out and slightly shrugging his shoulders is to get it postponed until i go to rome and even then i must not delay my visit this crossing the alps in winter is a trialbut we must never repine and there is nothing which we must not encounter to prevent incalculable mischief the publication of the scotch hierarchy at this moment will destroy the labors of years and yet they will not see it i cannot conceive who is urging them for i am sure they must have some authority from homeyou have something for me chidioch he added inquiringly for his keen eye caught the card  i regret to trouble your eminence when you need repose but the bearer of this card seems to have been importunate and to have appealed to your name and personal orders and he gave the cardinal the card  yes said the cardinal looking at the card with much interest this is a person i must always see  and so in due course they ushered into the library a gentleman with a crimson and wellstuffed bag of a composed yet cheerful aspect who addressed the cardinal with respect but without embarrassment saying i am ashamed to trouble your eminence with only matters of formabsolutely mere matters of form but i obey sir your own instructions  it is not for me to depreciate form replied the cardinal and in business there are no mere matters of form  merely the wood accounts continued the visitor they must be approved by both the guardians or the money cannot be received by the bankers your eminence you see has sanctioned the felling and authorized the sales and these are the final accounts which must be signed before we pay in  give them to me said the cardinal stretching out both his hands as he received a mass of paper folios his eminence resumed his chair and hastily examined the sheets ah he said no ordinary fellingit reaches over seven counties bytheby bracewood forestwhat about the enclosure i have heard no more of it then murmuring to himselfgrentham woodhow well i remember grentham wood with his dear father  if we could sign today said the visitor in a tone of professional cajolery time is important  and if shall not be wasted replied the cardinal but i must look over the accounts i doubt not all is quite regular but i wish to make myself a little familiar with the scene of action perhaps to recall the past he added you shall have them tomorrow mr giles  your eminence will have very different accounts to settle in a short time said mr giles smiling we are hard at work it takes three of our clerks constantly occupied  but you have yet got time  i dont know that said mr giles the affairs are very large and the minesthey give us the greatest trouble our mr james roundell was two months in wales last year about them it took up the whole of his vacation and your eminence must remember that time flies in less than eight months he will be of age  very true said the cardinal time indeed flies and so much to be done bytheby mr giles have you by any chance heard any thing lately of my child  i have heard of him a good deal of late for a client of ours lord montairy met him at brentham this summer and was a long time there with him after that i hear he went deerstalking with some of his young friends but he is not very fond of scotland had rather too much of it i suspect but the truth is sir i saw him this very day  indeed  some affairs have brought him up to town and i rather doubt whether he will return to oxfordat least so he talks  ah i have never seen him since he was an infant i might say said the cardinal i suppose i shall see him again if only when i resign my trust but i know not and yet few things would be more interesting to me than to meet him  mr giles seemed moved for him almost a little embarrassed he seemed to blush and then he cleared his throat it would be too great a liberty said mr giles i feel that very muchand yet if your eminence would condescend though i hardly suppose it possible his lordship is really going to do us the honor of dining with us today only a few friends and if your eminence could make the sacrifice and it were not an act of too great presumption to ask your eminence to join our party  i never eat and i never drink said the cardinal i am sorry to say i cannot i like dinner society very much you see the world and you hear things which you do not hear otherwise for a time i presumed to accept invitations though i sat with an empty plate but though the world was indulgent to me i felt that my habits were an embarrassment to the happier feasters it was not fair and so i gave it up but i tell you what mr giles i shall be in your quarter this evening perhaps you would permit me to drop in and pay my respects to mrs gilesi have wished to do so before    chapter 7   mr giles was a leading partner in the firm of roundells giles and roundell among the most eminent solicitors of lincolns inn he in those days of prolonged maturity might be described as still a young man he had inherited from his father not only a large share in a firstrate business but no inconsiderable fortune and though he had in her circles a celebrated wife he had no children he was opulent and prosperous with no cares and anxieties of his own and loved his profession for which he was peculiarly qualified being a man of uncommon sagacity very difficult to deceive and yet one who sympathized with his clients who were all personally attached to him and many of whom were among the distinguished personages of the realm  during an important professional visit to ireland mr giles had made the acquaintance of miss apollonia smylie the niece of an irish peer and though the lady was much admired and courted had succeeded after a time in inducing her to become the partner of his life  mrs giles or as she described herself mrs putney giles taking advantage of a second and territorial christian name of her husband was a showy woman decidedly handsome unquestionably accomplished and gifted with energy and enthusiasm which far exceeded even her physical advantages her principal mission was to destroy the papacy and to secure italian unity her lesser impulses were to become acquainted with the aristocracy and to be herself surrounded by celebrities having a fine house in tyburnia almost as showy as herself and a husband who was never so happy as when gratifying her wishes she did not find it difficult in a considerable degree to pursue and even accomplish her objects the putney giles gave a great many dinners and mrs putney received her world frequently if not periodically as they entertained with profusion her welllighted saloons were considerably attended these assemblies were never dull the materials not being ordinary often startling sometimes even brilliant occasionally rather heterogeneous for though being a violent protestant and of extreme conservative opinions her antipapal antipathies and her italian predilections frequently involved her with acquaintances not so distinguished as she deemed herself for devotion to the cause of order and orthodoxy it was rumored that the brooding brow of mazzini had been observed in her rooms and there was no sort of question that she had thrown herself in ecstatic idolatry at the feet of the hero of caprera  on the morning of the day on which he intended to visit cardinal grandison mr giles in his chambers at lincolns inn was suddenly apprised by a clerk that an interview with him was sought by a client no less distinguished than lothair  although mr giles sat opposite two rows of tin boxes each of which was numbered and duly inscribed with the name of lothair and that of the particular estate to which it referred mr giles though he had had occasional communications with his client was personally unacquainted with him he viewed therefore with no ordinary curiosity the young man who was ushered into his room a shapely youth slightly above the middle height of simple but distinguished mien with a countenance naturally pale though somewhat bronzed by a life of air and exercise and a profusion of darkauburn hair  and for what could lothair be calling on mr giles  it seems that one of lothairs intimate companions had got into a scrape and under these circumstances had what is styled made a friend of lothair that is to say confided to him his trouble and asked his advice with a view when given of its being followed by an offer of assistance  lothair though inexperienced and very ingenuous was not devoid of a certain instinctive perception of men and things which rendered it difficult for him to be an easy prey his natural disposition and his comparatively solitary education had made him a keen observer and he was one who meditated over his observations but he was naturally generous and sensible of kindness and this was a favorite companionnext to bertram his most intimate  lothair was quite happy in the opportunity of soothing a perturbed spirit whose society had been to him a source of so much gratification  it was not until lothair had promised to extricate his friend from his whelming difficulties that upon examination he found the act on his part was not so simple and so easy as he had assumed it to be his guardians had apportioned to him an allowance in every sense adequate to his position and there was no doubt had he wished to exceed it for any legitimate purpose not the slightest difficulty on their part would have been experienced  such a conjuncture had never occurred lothair was profuse but he was not prodigal he gratified all his fancies but they were not ignoble ones and he was not only sentimentally but systematically charitable he had a great number of fine horses and he had just paid for an expensive yacht in a word he spent a great deal of money and until he called at his bankers to learn what sums were at his disposition he was not aware that he had overdrawn his account  this was rather awkward lothair wanted a considerable sum and he wanted it at once irrespective of the consequent delay he shrunk from any communication with his guardians from his uncle he had become almost insensibly estranged and with his other guardian he had never had the slightest communication under these circumstances he recalled the name of the solicitor of the trustees between whom and himself there had been occasional correspondence and being of a somewhat impetuous disposition he rode off at once from his hotel to lincolns inn  mr giles listened to the narrative with unbroken interest and unswerving patience with his eyes fixed on his client and occasionally giving a sympathetic nod  and so concluded lothair i thought i would come to you  we are honored said mr giles and certainly it is quite absurd that your lordship should want money and for a worthy purpose and not be able to command it why the balance in the name of the trustees never was so great as at this moment and this very day or tomorrow at farthest i shall pay no less than eightandthirty thousand pounds timbermoney to the account  well i dont want a fifth of that said lothair  your lordship has an objection to apply to the trustees inquired mr giles  that is the point of the whole of my statement said lothair somewhat impatiently  and yet it is the right and regular thing said mr giles  it may be right and it may be regular but it is out of the question  then we will say no more about it what i want to prevent said mr giles musingly is any thing absurd happening there is no doubt if your lordship went into the street and said you wanted ten thousand pounds or a hundred thousand fifty people would supply you immediatelybut you would have to pay for it some enormous usury that would be bad but the absurdity of the thing would be greater than the mischief roundells giles and roundell could not help you in that manner that is not our business we are glad to find money for our clients at a legal rate of interest and the most moderate rate feasible but then there must be security and the best security but here we must not conceal it from ourselves my lord we have no security whatever at this moment your lordship has no property an insuranceoffice might do it with a policy they might consider that they had a moral security but still it would be absurd there is something absurd in your lordship having to raise money dont you think i could see these people said mr giles and talk to them and gain a little time we only want a little time  no said lothair in a peremptory tone i said i would do it and it must be done and at once sooner than there should be delay i would rather go into the street as you suggest and ask the first man i met to lend me the money my word has been given and i do not care what i pay to fulfil my word  we must not think of such things said mr giles shaking his head all i want your lordship to understand is the exact position in this case we have no security roundells giles and roundell cannot move without security it would be against our articles of partnership but mr giles as a private individual may do what he likes i will let your lordship have the money and i will take no security whatevernot even a note of hand all that i ask for is that your lordship should write me a letter saying you have urgent need for a sum of money mentioning amount for an honorable purpose in which your feelings are deeply interestedand that will do if any thing happens to your lordship before this time next year why i think the trustees could hardly refuse repaying the money and if they did why then added mr giles i suppose it will be all the same a hundred years hence  you have conferred on me the greatest obligation said lothair with much earnestness language cannot express what i feel i am not too much used to kindness and i only hope that i may live to show my sense of yours  it is really no great affair my lord said mr giles i did not wish to make difficulties but it was my duty to put the matter clearly before you what i propose i could to do is really nothing i could do no less i should have felt quite absurd if your lordship had gone into the moneymarket  i only hope repeated lothair rising and offering mr giles his hand that life may give me some occasion to prove my gratitude  well my lord replied mr giles if your lordship wish to repay me for any little interest i have shown in your affairs you can do that over and over again and at once  how so  by a very great favor by which mrs giles and myself would be deeply gratified we have a few friends who honor us by dining with us today in hyde park gardens if your lordship would add the great distinction your presence  i should only be too much honored exclaimed lothair i suppose about eight and he left the room and mr giles telegraphed instantly the impending event to apollonia    chapter 8   it was a great day for apollonia not only to have lothair at her right hand at dinner but the prospect of receiving a cardinal in the evening but she was equal to it though so engrossed indeed in the immediate gratification of her hopes and wishes that she could scarcely dwell sufficiently on the coming scene of triumph and social excitement  the repast was sumptuous lothair thought the dinner would never end there were so many dishes and apparently all of the highest pretension but if his simple tastes had permitted him to take an interest in these details which they did not he would have been assisted by a gorgeous menu of gold and white typography that was by the side of each guest the table seemed literally to groan under vases and gigantic flagons and in its midst rose a mountain of silver on which apparently all the cardinal virtues several of the pagan deities and britannia herself illustrated with many lights a glowing inscription which described the fervent feelings of a grateful client  there were many gueststhe dowager of farringford a lady of quality apollonias great lady who exercised under this roof much social tyranny in short was rather fine but who on this occasion was somewhat cowed by the undreamtof presence of lothair she had not yet met him and probably never would have met him had she not had the good fortune of dining at his lawyers however lady farringford was placed a long way from lothair having been taken down to dinner by mr giles and so by the end of the first course lady farringford had nearly resumed her customary despotic vein and was beginning to indulge in several kind observations cheapening to her host and hostess and indirectly exalting herself upon which mr giles took an early easy opportunity of apprising lady farringford that she had nearly met cardinal grandison at dinner and that his eminence would certainly pay his respects to mrs putney giles in the evening as lady farringford was at present a high ritualist and had even been talked of as going to rome this intelligence was stunning and it was observed that her ladyship was unusually subdued during the whole of the second course  on the right of lothair sat the wife of a vicechancellor a quiet and pleasing lady to whom lothair with natural good breeding paid snatches of happy attention when he could for a moment with propriety withdraw himself from the blaze of apollonias coruscating conversation then there was a rather fiercelooking red ribbon medalled as well as bestarred and the red ribbons wife with a blushing daughter in spite of her parentage not yet accustomed to stand fire a partner and his unusually numerous family had the pleasure also of seeing lothair for the first time and there were no less than four mps one of whom was even in office  apollonia was stating to lothair with perspicuity the reasons which quite induced her to believe that the gulfstream had changed its course and the political and social consequences that might accrue  the religious sentiment of the southern races must be wonderfully affected by a more rigorous climate said apollonia i cannot doubt she continued that a series of severe winters at rome might put an end to romanism  but is there any fear that a reciprocal influence might be exercised on the northern nations inquired lothair would there be any apprehension of our protestantism becoming proportionately relaxed  of course not said apollonia truth cannot be affected by climate truth is truth alike in palestine and scandinavia  i wonder what the cardinal would think of this said lothair who you tell me is coming to you this evening  yes i am most interested to see him though he is the most puissant of our foes of course he would take refuge in sophistry and science you know they deny  cardinal grandison is giving some lectures on science said the vicechancellors lady quietly  it is remorse said apollonia their clever men can never forget that unfortunate affair of galileo and think they can divert the indignation of the ninteenth century by mock zeal about red sandstone or the origin of species  and are you afraid of the gulfstream inquired lothair of his calmer neighbor  i think we want more evidence of a change the vicechancellor and myself went down to a place we have near town on saturday where there is a very nice piece of water indeed some people call it a lake but it was quite frozen and my boys wanted to skate but that i would not permit  you believe in the gulfstream to that extent said lothairno skating  the cardinal came early the ladies had not long left the diningroom they were agitated when his name was announced even apollonias heart beat but then that might be accounted for by the inopportune recollection of an occasional correspondence with caprera  nothing could exceed the simple suavity with which the cardinal appeared approached and greeted them he thanked apollonia for her permission to pay his respects to her which he had long wished to do and then they were all presented and he said exactly the right thing to every one he must have heard of them all before or read their characters in their countenances in a few minutes they were all listening to his eminence with enchanted ease as sitting on the sofa by his hostess he described to them the ambassadors who had just arrived from japan and with whom he had relations of interesting affairs the japanese government had exhibited enlightened kindness to some of his poor people who had barely escaped martyrdom much might be expected from the mikado evidently a man of singular penetration and elevated views and his eminence looked as if the mission of yokohama would speedily end in an episcopal see but he knew where he was and studiously avoided all controversial matter  after all the mikado himself was not more remarkable than this prince of the church in a tyburnian drawingroom habited in his pink cassock and cape and waving as he spoke with careless grace his pink barrette  the ladies thought the gentlemen rejoined them too soon but mr giles when he was apprised of the arrival of the cardinal thought it right to precipitate the symposium with great tact when the cardinal rose to greet him mr giles withdrew his eminence from those surrounding and after a brief interchange of whispered words quitted him and then brought forward and presented lothair to the cardinal and left them  this is not the first time that we should have met said the cardinal but my happiness is so great at this moment that though i deplore i will not dwell on the past  i am nevertheless grateful to you sir for many services and have more than once contemplated taking the liberty of personally assuring your a eminence of my gratitude  i think we might sit down said the cardinal looking around and then he led lothair into an open but interior saloon where none were yet present and where they seated themselves on a sofa and were soon engaged in apparently interesting converse  in the mean time the world gradually filled the principal saloon of apollonia and when it approached overflowing occasionally some persons passed the line and entered the room in which the cardinal and his ward were seated and then as if conscious of violating some sacred place drew back others on the contrary with coarser curiosity were induced to invade the chamber from the mere fact that the cardinal was to be seen there  my geographical instinct said the cardinal to lothair assures me that i can regain the staircase through these rooms without rejoining the busy world so i shall bid you goodnight and even presume to give you my blessing and his eminence glided away  when lothair returned to the saloon it was so crowded that he was not observed exactly what he liked and he stood against the wall watching all that passed not without amusement a lively social parasite who had dined there and had thanked his stars at dinner that fortune had decreed he should meet lothair had been cruising for his prize all the time that lothair had been conversing with the cardinal and was soon at his side  a strange scene this said the parasite  is it unusual inquired lothair  such a medley how can they can be got together i marvelpriests and philosophers legitimists and carbonari wonderful woman mrs putney giles  she is very entertaining said lothair and seems to me clever  remarkably so said the parasite who had been on the point of satirizing his hostess but observing the quarter of the wind with rapidity went in for praise an extraordinary woman your lordship had a long talk with the cardinal  i had the honor of some conversation with cardinal grandison said lothair drawing up  i wonder what the cardinal would have said if he had met mazzini here  mazzini is he here  not now but i have seen him here said the parasite and our host such a tory that makes the thing so amusing and then the parasite went on making small personal observations on the surrounding scene and every now and then telling little tales of great people with whom it appeared he was intimateall concerted fire to gain the very great social fortress he was now besieging the parasite was so full of himself and so anxious to display himself to advantage that with all his practice it was some time before he perceived he did not make all the way he could wish with lothair who was courteous but somewhat monosyllabic and absent  your lordship is struck by that face said the parasite  was lothair struck by that face and what was it  he had exchanged glances with that face during the last ten minutes and the mutual expression was not one of sympathy but curiosity blended on the part of the face with an expression if not of disdain of extreme reserve  it was the face of a matron apparently of not many summers for her shapely figure was still slender though her mien was stately but it was the countenance that had commanded the attention of lothair pale but perfectly attic in outline with the short upper lip and the round chin and a profusion of darkchestnut hair bound by a grecian fillet and on her brow a star  yes i am struck by that face who is it  if your lordship could only get a fivefranc piece of the last french republic 1850 you would know i dare say the moneychangers could get you one all the artists of paris painters and sculptors and medallists were competing to produce a face worthy of representing la r publique fran aise nobody was satisfied when oudine caught a girl of not seventeen and with a literal reproduction of nature gained the prize with unanimity  ah  and though years have passed the countenance has not changed perhaps improved  it is a countenance that will bear perhaps even would require maturity said lothair but she is no longer la r publique fran aise what is she now  she is called theodora though married i believe to an englishman a friend of garibaldi her birth unknown some say an italian some a pole all sorts of stories but she speaks every language is ultracosmopolitan and has invented a new religion  a new religion  would your lordship care to be introduced to her i know her enough for that shall we go up to her  i have made so many now acquaintances today said lothair as it were starting from a reverie and indeed heard so many new things that i think i had better say goodnight and he graciously retired    chapter 9   about the same time that lothair had repaired to the residence of mr giles monsignore berwick whose audience of the cardinal in the morning had preceded that of the legal adviser of the trustees made his way toward one of the noblest mansions in st jamess square where resided lord st jerome  it was a mild winter evening a little fog still hanging about but vanquished by the cheerful lamps and the voice of the muffinbell was just heard at intervals a genial sound that calls up visions of trim and happy hearths if we could only so contrive our lives as to go into the country for the first note of the nightingale and return to town for the first note of the muffinbell existence it is humbly presumed might be more enjoyable  monsignore berwick was a young man but looking younger from a countenance almost of childhood fair with lightblue eyes and flaxen hair and delicate features he was the last person you would have fixed upon as a born roman but nature in one of the freaks of race had resolved that his old scottish blood should be reasserted though his ancestors had sedulously blended it for many generations with that of the princely houses of the eternal city the monsignore was the greatest statesman of rome formed and favored by antonelli and probably his successor  the mansion of lord st jerome was a real family mansion built by his ancestors a century and a half ago when they believed that from its central position its happy contiguity to the court the senate and the seats of government they at last in st jamess square had discovered a site which could defy the vicissitudes of fashion and not share the fate of the river palaces which they had been obliged in turn to relinquish and in a considerable degree they were right in their anticipation for although they have somewhat unwisely permitted the clubs to invade too successfully their territory st jamess square may be looked upon as our faubourg st germain and a great patrician residing there dwells in the heart of that free and noble life of which he ought to be a part  a marble hall and a marble staircase lofty chambers with silk or tapestried hangings gilded cornices and painted ceilings gave a glimpse of almost venetian splendor and rare in our metropolitan houses of this age but the first dwellers in st jamess square had tender and inspiring recollections of the adrian bride had frolicked in st marks and glided in adventurous gondolas the monsignore was ushered into a chamber bright with lights and a blazing fire and welcomed with extreme cordiality by his hostess who was then alone lady st jerome was still the young wife of a nobleman not old she was the daughter of a protestant house but during a residence at rome after her marriage she had reverted to the ancient faith which she professed with the enthusiastic convictions of a convert her whole life was dedicated to the triumph of the catholic cause and being a woman of considerable intelligence and of an ardent mind she had become a recognized power in the great confederacy which has so much influenced the human race and which has yet to play perhaps a mighty part in the fortunes of the world  i was in great hopes that the cardinal would have met you at dinner said lady st jerome but he wrote only this afternoon to say unexpected business would prevent him but he would be here in the evening though late  it must be something sudden for i was with his eminence this morning and he then contemplated our meeting here  nothing from abroad  i should think not or it would be known to me there is nothing new from abroad this afternoon my time has been spent in writing not receiving dispatches  and all well i hope  this scotch business plagues us so far as scotland is concerned it is quite ripe but the cardinal counsels delay on account of this country and he has such a consummate knowledge of england that  at this moment lord st jerome entered the rooma grave but gracious personage polished but looking silent though he immediately turned the conversation to the weather the monsignore began denouncing english fogs but lord st jerome maintained that on the whole there were not more fogs in england than in any other country and as for the french he added i like their audacity for when they revolutionized the calendar they called one of their months brumaire  then came in one of his lordships chaplains who saluted the monsignore with reverence and immediately afterward a beautiful young lady his niece clare arundel  the family were living in a convenient suite of small rooms on the groundfloor called the winterrooms so dinner was announced by the doors of an adjoining chamber being thrown open and there they saw in the midst of a chamber hung with green silk and adorned with some fine cabinetpictures a small round table bright and glowing  it was a lively dinner lord st jerome loved conversation though he never conversed there must be an audience he would say and i am the audience the partner of his life whom he never ceased admiring had originally fascinated him by her conversational talents and even if nature had not impelled her lady st jerome was too wise a woman to relinquish the spell the monsignore could always when necessary sparkle with anecdote or blaze with repartee and all the chaplains who abounded in this house were men of bright abilities not merely men of reading but of the world learned in the worlds ways and trained to govern mankind by versatility of their sympathies it was a dinner where there could not be two conversations going on and where even the silent take their share in the talk by their sympathy  and among the silent as silent even as lord st jerome was miss arundel and yet her large violet eyes darker even than her darkbrown hair and gleaming with intelligence and her rich face mantling with emotion proved she was not insensible to the witty passages and the bright and interesting narratives that were sparkling and flowing about her  the gentlemen left the diningroom with the ladies in the continental manner lady st jerome who was leaning on the arm of the monsignore guided him into a saloon farther than the one they had reentered and then seating herself said you were telling me about scotland that you yourself thought it ripe  unquestionably the original plan was to have established our hierarchy when the kirk split up but that would have been a mistake it was not then ripe there would have been a fanatical reaction there is always a tendency that way in scotland as it is at this moment the establishment and the free kirk are mutually sighing for some compromise which may bring them together and if the proprietors would give up their petty patronage some flatter themselves it might be arranged but we are thoroughly well informed and have provided for all this we sent two of our best men into scotland some time ago and they have invented a new church called the united presbyterians john knox himself was never more violent or more mischievous the united presbyterians will do the business they will render scotland simply impossible to live in and then when the crisis arrives the distracted and despairing millions will find refuge in the bosom of their only mother that is why at home we wanted no delay in the publication of the bull and the establishment of the hierarchy  but the cardinal says no  and must be followed for these islands he has no equal he wishes great reserve at present affairs here are progressing gradually but surely but it is ireland where matters are critical or will be soon  ireland i thought there was a sort of understanding thereat least for the present  the monsignore shook his head what do you think of an american invasion of ireland  an american invasion  even so nothing more probable and nothing more to be deprecated by us now that the civil war in america is over the irish soldiery are resolved to employ their experience and their weapons in their own land but they have no thought for the interest of the holy see or the welfare of our holy religion their secret organization is tampering with the people and tampering with the priests the difficulty of ireland is that the priests and the people will consider every thing in a purely irish point of view to gain some local object they will encourage the principles of the most lawless liberalism which naturally land them in fenianism and atheism and the danger is not foreseen because the irish political object of the moment is alone looked to  but surely they can be guided  we want a statesman in ireland we have never been able to find one we want a man like the cardinal but the irish will have a native for their chief we caught churchill young and educated him in the propaganda but he has disappointed us at first all seemed well he was reserved and austere and we heard with satisfaction that he was unpopular but now that critical times are arriving his peasantblood cannot resist the contagion he proclaims the absolute equality of all religious and of the power of the state to confiscate ecclesiastical property and not restore it to us but alienate it forever for the chance of subverting the anglican establishment he is favoring a policy which will subvert religion itself in his eagerness he cannot see that the anglicans have only a lease of our property a lease which is rapidly expiring  this is sad  it is perilous and difficult to deal with but it must be dealt with the problem is to suppress fenianism and not to strengthen the protestant confederacy  and you left rome for this we understood you were coming for something else said lady st jerome in a significant tone  yes yes i have been there and i have seen him  and have you succeeded  no and no one willat least at present  is all lost then is the malta scheme again on the carpet  our holy church in built upon a rock said the monsignore but not upon the rock of malta nothing is lost antonelli is calm and sanguine though rest assured there is no doubt about what i tell you france has washed her hands of us  where then are we to look for aid exclaimed lady st jerome against the assassins and atheists austria the alternative ally is no longer near you and if she werethat i should ever live to say iteven austria is our foe  poor austria said the monsignore with an unctuous sneer two things made her a nation she was german and she was catholic and now she is neither  but you alarm me my dear lord with your terrible news we once thought that spain would be our protector but we hear bad news from spain  yes said the monsignore i think it highly probable that before a few years have elapsed every government in europe will be atheistical except france vanity will always keep france the eldest son of the church even if she wear a bonnet rouge but if the holy father keep rome these strange changes will only make the occupier of the chair of st peter more powerful his subjects will be in every clime and every country and then they will be only his subjects we shall get rid of the difficulty of the divided allegiance lady st jerome which plagued our poor forefathers so much  if we keep rome said lady st jerome  and we shall let christendom give us her prayers for the next few years and pio nono will become the most powerful monarch in europe and perhaps the only one  i hear a sound exclaimed lady st jerome yes the cardinal has come let us greet him  but as they were approaching the saloon the cardinal met them and waved them back we will return he said to our friends immediately but i want to say one word to you both  he made them sit down i am a little restless he said and stood before the fire something interesting has happened nothing to do with public affairs do not pitch your expectations too highbut still of importance and certainly of great interestat least to me i have seen my childmy ward  indeed an event said lady st jerome evidently much interested  and what is he like inquired the monsignore  all that one could wish extremely goodlooking highly bred and most ingenuous a considerable intelligence and not untrained but the most absolutely unaffected person i ever encountered  ah if he had been trained by your eminence sighed lady st jerome is it too late  tis an immense position murmured berwick  what good might he not do said lady st jerome and if he be so ingenuous it seems impossible that he can resist the truth  your ladyship is a sort of cousin of his said the cardinal musingly  yes but very remote i dare say he would not acknowledge the tie but we are kin we have the same blood in our veins  you should make his acquaintance said the cardinal  i more than desire it i hear he has been terribly neglected brought up among the most dreadful people entirely infidels and fanatics  he has been nearly two years at oxford said the cardinal that may have mitigated the evil  ah but you my lord cardinal you must interfere now that you at last know him you must undertake the great task you must save him  we must all pray as i pray every morn and every night said the cardinal for the conversion of england  or the conquest murmured berwick    chapter 10   as the cardinal was regaining his carriage on leaving mrs giless party there was about the entrance of the house the usual gathering under such circumstances some zealous linkboys marvellously familiar with london life and some midnight loungers who thus take their humble share of the social excitement and their happy chance of becoming acquainted with some of the notables of the wondrous world of which they form the base this little gathering ranged at the instant into stricter order by the police to facilitate the passage of his eminence prevented the progress of a passenger who exclaimed in an audible but not noisy voice as if he were ejaculating to himself a bas les pretres  this exclamation unintelligible to the populace was noticed only by the only person who understood it the cardinal astonished at the unusual soundfor hitherto he had always found the outer world of london civil or at least indifferentthrew his penetrating glance at the passenger and caught clearly the visage on which the lamplight fully shone it was a square sinewy face closely shaven with the exception of a small but thick mustache brown as the wellcropped hair and blending with the hazel eye a calm but determined countenance clearly not that of an englishman for he wore earrings  the carriage drove off and the passenger somewhat forcing his way through the clustering group continued his course until he reached the cabstand near the marble arch when he engaged a vehicle and ordered to be driven to leicester square that quarter of the town exhibits an animated scene toward the witching hour many lights and much population illuminated coffeehouses the stir of a large theatre bands of music in the open air and other sounds most of them gay and some festive the stranger whose compact figure was shrouded by a long fur cape had not the appearance of being influenced by the temptation of amusement as he stopped in the square and looked around him the expression of his countenance was moody perhaps even anxious he seemed to be making observations on the locality and after a few minutes crossed the open space and turned up into a small street which opened into the square in this street was a coffeehouse of some pretension connected indeed with an hotel which had been formed out of two houses and therefore possessed no inconsiderable accommodation  the coffeeroom was capacious and adorned in a manner which intimated it was not kept by an englishman or much used by englishmen the walls were painted in frescoed arabesques there were many guests principally seated at small tables of marble and on benches and chairs covered with a coarse crimson velvet some were sipping coffee some were drinking wine others were smoking or playing dominoes or doing both while many were engaged in reading the foreign journals which abounded  an evervigilant waiter was at the side of the stranger the instant he entered and wished to know his pleasure the stranger was examining with his keen eye every individual in the room while this question was asked and repeated  what would i wish said the stranger having concluded his inspection and as it were summoning back his recollection i would wish to see and at once one mr perroni who i believe lives here  why tis the master exclaimed the waiter  well then go and tell the master that i want him  but the master is much engaged said the waiter particularly  i dare say but you will go and tell him that i particularly want to see him  the waiter though prepared to be impertinent to any one else felt that one was speaking to him who must be obeyed and with a subdued but hesitating manner said there is a meeting tonight upstairs where the master is secretary and it is difficult to see him but if i could see him what name am i to give  you will go to him instantly said the stranger and you will tell him that he is wanted by captain bruges  the waiter was not long absent and returning with an obsequious bow he invited the stranger to follow him to a private room where he was alone only for a few seconds for the door opened and he was joined by perroni  ah my general exclaimed the master of the coffeehouse and he kissed the strangers hand you received my telegram  i am here now what is your business  there is business and great business if you will do it business for you  well i am a soldier and soldiering is my trade and i do not much care what i do in that way provided it is not against the good cause but i must tell you at once friend perroni i am not a man who will take a leap in the dark i must form my own staff and i must have my commissariat secure  my general you will be master of your own terms the standing committee of the holy alliance of peoples are sitting upstairs at this moment they were unanimous in sending for you see them judge for yourself and rest assured you will be satisfied  i do not much like having to do with committees said the general however let it be as you likei will see them  i had better just announce your arrival said perroni and will you not take something my general after your travel you must be wearied  a glass of sugarandwater you know i am not easily tired and i agree with you it is better to come to business at once so prepare them    chapter 11   the standing committee of the holy alliance of peoples all rose although they were extreme republicans when the general entered such is the magical influence of a man of action over men of the pen an the tongue had it been instead of a successful military leader an orator that had inspired europe or a journalist who had rights of the human race the standing committee would have only seen men of their own kidney who having been favored with happier opportunities than themselves had reaped a harvest which equally favored they might here have garnered  general said felix drolin the president who was looked upon by the brotherhood as a statesman for he had been in his time a member of a provisional government this seat is for you and he pointed to one on his right hand you are ever welcome and i hope you bring good tidings and good fortune  i am glad to be among my friends and i may say looking around my comrades i hope i may bring you better fortune than my tidings  but now they have left rome said the president every day we expect good news  ay ay he has left rome but he has not left rome with the door open i hope it is not on such gossip you have sent for me you have something on hand what is it  you shall hear it from the fountainhead said the president fresh from new york and he pointed to an individual seated in the centre of the table  ah colonel finucane said the general i have not forgotten james river you did that well what is the trick now  whereupon a tall lean man with a decided brogue but speaking through his nose rose from his seat and informed the general that the irish people were organized and ready to rise that they had sent their deputies to new york all they wanted were arms and officers that the american brethren had agreed to supply them with both and amply and that considerable subscriptions were raising for other purposes what they now required was a commanderinchief equal to the occasion and in whom all would have confidence and therefore they had telegraphed for the general  i doubt not our friends over the water would send us plenty of rifles said the general if we could only manage to land them and i think i know men now in the states from whom i could form a good staff but how about the people of ireland what evidence have we that they will rise if we land  the best said the president we have a headcentre here citizen desmond who will give you the most recent and the most authentic intelligence on that head  the whole country is organized said the headcentre we could put three hundred thousand men in the field at any time in a fortnight the movement is not sectarian it pervades all classes and all creeds all that we want are officers and arms  hem said the general and as to your other supplies any scheme of commissariat  there will be no lack of means replied the headcentre there is no country where so much money is hoarded as in ireland but depend upon it so far as the commissariat is concerned the movement will be selfsupporting  well we shall see said the general i am sorry it is an irish affair though to be sure what else could it be i am not fond of irish affairs whatever may be said and however plausible things may look in an irish business there is always a priest at the bottom of it i hate priests bytheby i was stopped on my way here by a cardinal getting into his carriage i thought i had burnt all those vehicles when i was at rome with garibaldi in 48 a cardinal in his carriage i had no idea you permitted that sort of cattle in london  london is a roost for every bird said felix drolin  very few of the priests favor this movement said desmond  then you have a great power against you said the general in addition to england  they are not exactly against the bulk of them are too national for that but rome does not sanctionyou understand  i understand enough said the general to see that we must not act with precipitation an irish business is a thing to be turned over several times  but yet said a pole what hope for humanity except from the rising of an oppressed nationality we have offered ourselves on the altar and in vain greece is too small and roumaniathough both of them are ready to do any thing but they would be the mere tools of russia ireland alone remains and she is at our feet  the peoples will never succeed until they have a fleet said a german then you could land as many rifles as you like or any thing else to have a fleet we rose against denmark in my country but we have been betrayed nevertheless germany will yet be united and she can only be united as a republic then she will be the mistress of the seas  that is the mission of italy said perroni italywith the traditions of genoa venice pisaitaly is plainly indicated as the future mistress of the seas  i beg your pardon said the german the future mistress of the sees is the land of the viking it is the forests of the baltic that will build the best of the future you have no timber in italy  timber is no longer wanted said perroni nor do i know of what will be formed the fleets of the future but the sovereignty of the seas depends upon seamen and the nautical genius of the italians  comrades said the general we have discussed tonight a great subject for my part i have travelled rather briskly as you wished it i should like to sleep on this affair  tis most reasonable said the president our refreshment at council is very spare he continued and he pointed to a vase of water and some glasses ranged round it in the middle of the table but we always drink one toast general before we separate it is to one whom you love and whom you have served well fill glasses brethren and now to maryanne  if they had been inspired by the grape nothing could be more animated and even excited than all their countenances suddenly became the cheer might have been heard in the coffeeroom as they expressed in the phrases of many languages the neverfailing and neverflagging enthusiasm invoked by the toast of their mistress    chapter 12   did you read that paragraph mamma inquired lady corisande of the duchess in a tone of some seriousness  i did  and what did you think of it  it filled me with so much amazement that i have hardly begun to think  and bertram never gave a hint of such things  let us believe they are quite untrue  i hope bertram is in no danger said his sister  heaven forbid exclaimed the mother with unaffected alarm  i know not how it is said lady corisande but i frequently feel that some great woe is hanging over our country  you must dismiss such thoughts my child they are fanciful  but they will come and when least expectedfrequently in church but also in the sunshine and when i am riding too when once every thing seemed gay but now i often think of strife and struggle and warcivil war the stir of our cavalcade seems like the tramp of cavalry  you indulge your imagination too much dear corisande when you return to london and enter the world these anxious thoughts will fly  is it imagination i should rather have doubted my being of an imaginative nature it seems to me that i am rather literal but i cannot help hearing and reading things and observing things and they fill me with disquietude all seems doubt and change when it would appear that we require both faith and firmness  the duke is not alarmed about affairs said his wife  and if all did their duty like papa there might be less or no cause said corisande but when i hear of young nobles the natural leaders of the land going over to the roman catholic church i confess i lose heart and patience it seems so unpatriotic so effeminate  it may not be true said the duchess  it may not be true of him but it is true of others said lady corisande and why should he escape he is very young rather friendless and surrounded by wily persons i am disappointed about bertram too he ought to have prevented this if it be true bertram seemed to me to have such excellent principles and so completely to feel that he was born to maintain the great country which his ancestors created that i indulged in dreams i suppose you are right mamma i suppose i am imaginative without knowing it but i have always thought and hoped that when the troubles came the country might perhaps rally round bertram  i wish to see bertram in parliament said the duchess that will be the best thing for him the duke has some plans  this conversation had been occasioned by a paragraph in the morning post circulating a rumor that a young noble obviously lothair on the impending completion of his minority was about to enter the roman church the duchess and her daughter were sitting in a chamber of their northern castle and speculating on their return to london which was to take place after the easter which had just arrived it was an important social season for corisande for she was to be formally introduced into the great world and to be presented at court  in the mean while was there any truth in the report about lothair  after their meeting at their lawyers a certain intimacy had occurred between the cardinal and his ward they met again immediately and frequently and their mutual feelings were cordial the manners of his eminence were refined and affectionate his conversational powers were distinguished there was not a subject on which his mind did not teem with interesting suggestions his easy knowledge seemed always ready and always full and whether it were art or letters or manners or even political affairs lothair seemed to listen to one of the wisest most enlightened and most agreeable of men there was only one subject on which his eminence seemed scrupulous never to touch and that was religion or so indirectly that it was only when alone that lothair frequently found himself musing over the happy influence on the arts and morals and happiness of mankindof the church  in due time not too soon but when he was attuned to the initiation the cardinal presented lothair to lady st jerome the impassioned eloquence of that lady germinated the seed which the cardinal had seemed so carelessly to scatter she was a woman to inspire crusaders not that she ever condescended to vindicate her own particular faith or spoke as if she were conscious that lothair did not possess it assuming that religion was true for otherwise man would be in a more degraded position than the beasts of the field which are not aware of their own wretchedness then religion should be the principal occupation of man to which all other pursuits should be subservient the doom of eternity and the fortunes of life cannot be placed in competition our days should be pure and holy and heroicfull of noble thoughts and solemn sacrifice providence in its wisdom had decreed that the world should be divided between the faithful and atheists the latter even seemed to predominate there was no doubt that if they prevailed all that elevated man would become extinct it was a great trial but happy was the man who was privileged even to endure the awful test it might develop the highest qualities and the most sublime conduct if he were equal to the occasion and could control and even subdue these sons of korah he would rank with michael the archangel  this was the text on which frequent discourses were delivered to lothair and to which he listened at first with eager and soon with enraptured attention the priestess was worthy of the shrine few persons were ever gifted with more natural eloquence a command of language choice without being pedantic beautiful hands that fluttered with irresistible grace flashing eyes and a voice of melody  lothair began to examine himself and to ascertain whether he possessed the necessary qualities and was capable of sublime conduct his natural modesty and his strong religious feeling struggled together he feared he was not an archangel and yet he longed to struggle with the powers of darkness  one day he ventured to express to miss arundel a somewhat hopeful view of the future but miss arundel shook her head  i do not agree with my aunt at least as regards this country said miss arundel i think our sins are too great we left his church and god is now leaving us  lothair looked grave but was silent  weeks had passed since his introduction to the family of lord st jerome and it was remarkable how large a portion of his subsequent time had passed under that roof at first there were few persons in town and really of these lothair knew none and then the house in st jamess square was not only an interesting but it was an agreeable house all lady st jeromes family connections were persons of much fashion so there was more variety and entertainment than sometimes are to be found under a roman catholic roof lady st jerome was at home every evening before easter few dames can venture successfully on so decided a step but her saloons were always attended and by nice people occasionally the cardinal stepped in and to a certain degree the saloon was the rendezvous of the catholic party but it was also generally social and distinguished many bright dames and damsels and many influential men were there who little deemed that deep and daring thoughts were there masked by many a gracious countenance the social atmosphere infinitely pleased lothair the mixture of solemn duty and graceful diversion high purposes and charming manners seemed to realize some youthful dreams of elegant existence all too was enhanced by the historic character of the roof and by the recollection that their mutual ancestors as clare arundel more than once intimated to him had created england having had so many pleasant dinners in st jamess square and spent there so many evening hours it was not wonderful that lothair had accepted an invitation from lord st jerome to pass easter at his countryseat    chapter 13   vauxe the seat of the st jeromes was the finest specimen of the old english residence extant it was the perfection of the style which had gradually arisen after the wars of the roses had alike destroyed all the castles and the purpose of those stern erections people said vauxe looked like a college the truth is colleges looked like vauxe for when those fair and civil buildings rose the wise and liberal spirits who endowed them intended that they should resemble as much as possible the residence of a great noble  there were two quadrangles at vauxe of graystone the outer one of larger dimensions and much covered with ivy the inner one not so extensive but more ornate with a lofty tower a hall and a chapel the house was full of galleries and they were full of portraits indeed there was scarcely a chamber in this vast edifice of which the walls were not breathing with english history in this interesting form sometimes more ideal art asserted a triumphant claimtranscendental holy families seraphic saints and gorgeous scenes by tintoret and paul of verona  the furniture of the house seemed never to have been changed it was very old somewhat scanty but very richtapestry and velvet hangings marvellous cabinets and crystal girandoles here and there a group of ancient plate ewers and flagons and tall saltcellars a foot high and richly chiselled sometimes a state bed shadowed with a huge pomp of stiff brocade and borne by silver poles  vauxe stood in a large park studded with stately trees here and there an avenue of spanish chestnuts or a grove of oaks sometimes a gorsy dell and sometimes a so great spread of antlered fern taller than the tallest man  it was only twenty miles from town and lord st jerome drove lothair down the last ten miles through a pretty land which at the right season would have been bright with orchards oakwoods and hopgardens lord st jerome loved horses and was an eminent whip he had driven fourinhand when a boy and he went on driving fourinhand not because it was the fashion but because he loved it toward the close of lent lady st jerome and clare arundel had been at a convent in retreat but they always passed holy week at home and they were to welcome lord st jerome again at vauxe  the day was bright the mode of movement exhilarating all the anticipated incidents delightful and lothair felt the happiness of health and youth  there is vauxe said lord st jerome in a tone of proud humility as a turn in the road first displayed the stately pile  how beautiful said lothair ah our ancestors understood the country  i used to think when i was a boy said lord st jerome that i lived in the prettiest village in the world but these railroads have so changed every thing that vauxe seems to me now only a second townhouse  the ladies were in a garden where they were consulting with the gardener and father coleman about the shape of some new beds for the critical hour of filling them was approaching the gardener like all headgardeners was opinionated living always at vauxe he had come to believe that the gardens belonged to him and that the family were only occasional visitors and he treated them accordingly the lively and impetuous lady st jerome had a thousand bright fancies but her morose attendant never indulged them she used to deplore his tyranny with piteous playfulness i suppose she would say it is useless to resist for i observe tis the same everywhere lady roehampton says she never has her way with her gardens it is no use speaking to lord st jerome for though he is afraid of nothing else i am sure he is afraid of hawkins  the only way that lady st jerome could manage hawkins was through father coleman father coleman who knew every thing knew a great deal about gardens from the days of le notre to those of the fine gentlemen who now travel about and when disengaged deign to give us advice  father coleman had only just entered middleage was imperturbable and mild in his manner he passed his life very much at vauxe and imparted a great deal of knowledge to mr hawkins without apparently being conscious of so doing at the bottom of his mind mr hawkins felt assured that he had gained several distinguished prizes mainly through the hints and guidance of father coleman and thus though on the surface a little surly he was ruled by father coleman under the combined influence of selfinterest and superior knowledge  you find us in a garden without flowers said lady st jerome but the sun i think alway loves these golden yews  these are for you dear uncle said clare arundel as she gave him a rich cluster of violets just now the woods are more fragrant than the gardens and these are the produce of our morning walk i could have brought you some primroses but i do not like to mix violets with any thing  they say primroses make a capital salad said lord st jerome  barbarian exclaimed lady st jerome i see you want luncheon it must be ready and she took lothairs arm i will show you a portrait of one of your ancestors she said he married an arundel    chapter 14   now you know said lady st jerome to lothair in a hushed voice as they sat together in the evening you are to be quite free here to do exactly what you like and we shall follow our ways if you like to have a clergyman of your own church visit you while you are with us pray say so without the slightest scruple we have an excellent gentleman in this parish he often dines here and i am sure he would be most happy to attend you i know that holy week is not wholly disregarded by some of the anglicans  it is the anniversary of the greatest event of time said lothair and i should be sorry if any of my church did not entirely regard it though they may show that regard in a way different from your own  yes yes murmured lady st jerome there should be no difference between our churches if things were only properly understood i would accept all who really bow to the name of christ they will come to the church at last they must it is the atheists alone i fear who are now carrying every thing before them and against whom there is no comfort except the rock of st peter  miss arundel crossed the room whispered something to her aunt and touched her forehead with her lips and then left the apartment  we must soon separate i fear said lady st jerome we have an office tonight of great moment the tenebrae commence tonight you have i think nothing like it but you have services throughout this week  i am sorry to say i have not attended them said lothair i did at oxford but i dont know how it is but in london there seems no religion and yet as you sometimes say religion is the great business of life i sometimes begin to think the only business  yes yes said lady st jerome with much interest if you believe that you are safe i wish you had a clergyman near you while you are here see mr claughton if you like i would and if you do not there is father coleman i cannot convey to you how satisfactory conversation is with him on religious matters he is the holiest of men and yet he is a man of the world he will not invite you into any controversies he will speak with you only on points on which we agree you know there are many points on which we agree  happily said lothair and now about the office tonight tell me about these tenebrae is there any thing in the tenebrae why i ought not to be present  no reason whatever not a dogma which you do not believe not a ceremony of which you cannot approve there are psalms at the end of which a light on the altar is extinguished there is the song of moses the canticle of zachary the misererewhich is the 50th psalm you read and chant regularly in your churchthe lords prayer in silence and then all is darkness and distresswhat the church was when our lord suffered what the whole world is now except his church  if you will permit me said lothair i will accompany you to the tenebrae  although the chapel at vauxe was of course a private chapel it was open to the surrounding public who eagerly availed themselves of a permission alike politic and gracious  nor was that remarkable manifold art had combined to create this exquisite temple and to guide all its ministrations but tonight it was not the radiant altar and the splendor of stately priests the processions and the incense the divine choir and the celestial harmonies resounding lingering in arched roofs that attracted many a neighbor the altar was desolate the choir was dumb and while the services proceeded in hushed tones of subdued sorrow and sometimes even of suppressed anguish gradually with each psalm and canticle a light of the altar was extinguished till at length the miserere was muttered and all became darkness a sound as of a distant and rising wind was heard and a crash as it were the fall of trees in a storm the earth is covered with darkness and the veil of the temple is rent but just at this moment of extreme woe when all human voices are silent and when it is forbidden even to breathe amenwhen every thing is symbolical of the confusion and despair of the church at the loss of her expiring lorda priest brings forth a concealed light of silvery flame from a corner of the altar this is the light of the world and announced the resurrection and then all rise up and depart in silence  as lothair rose miss arundel passed him with streaming eyes  there is nothing in this holy office said father coleman to lothair to which every real christian might not give his assent  nothing said lothair with great decision    chapter 15   there were tenebrae on the following days maundy thursday and good friday and lothair was present on both occasions  there is also a great office on friday said father coleman to lothair which perhaps you would not like to attendthe mass of the presanctified we bring back the blessed sacrament to the desolate altar and unveil the cross it is one of our highest ceremonies the adoration of the cross which the protestants persist in calling idolatry though i presume they will give us leave to know the meaning of our own words and actions and hope they will believe us when we tell them that our genuflexions and kissing of the cross are no more than exterior expressions of that love which we bear in our hearts to jesus crucified and that the words adoration and adore as applied to the cross only signify that respect and veneration due to things immediately relating to god and his service  i see no idolatry in it said lothair musingly  no impartial person could rejoined father coleman but unfortunately all these prejudices were imbibed when the world was not so well informed as at present a good deal of mischief has been done too by the protestant versions of the holy scriptures made in a hurry and by men imperfectly acquainted with the eastern tongues and quite ignorant of eastern manners all the accumulated research and investigation of modern times have only illustrated and justified the offices of the church  that is very interesting said lothair  now this question of idolatry said father coleman that is a fertile subject of misconception the house of israel was raised up to destroy idolatry because idolatry thou meant dark images of moloch opening their arms by machinery and flinging the beauteous firstborn of the land into their huge forms which were furnaces of fire or ashtaroth throned in moonlit groves and surrounded by orgies of ineffable demoralization it required the declared will of god to redeem man from such fatal iniquity which would have sapped the human race but to confound such deeds with the commemoration of gods saints who are only pictured because their lives are perpetual incentives to purity and holiness and to declare that the queen of heaven and the mother of god should be to human feeling only as a sister of charity or a gleaner in the fields is to abuse reason and to outrage the heart  we live in dark times said lothair with an air of distress  not darker than before the deluge exclaimed father coleman not darker than before the nativity not darker even than when the saints became martyrs there is a pharos in the world and its light will never be extinguished however black the clouds and wild the waves man is on his trial now not the church but in the service of the church his highest energies may be developed and his noblest qualities proved  lothair seemed plunged in thought and father coleman glided away as lady st jerome entered the gallery shawled and bonneted accompanied by another priest monsignore catesby  catesby was a youthful member of an ancient english house which for many generations had without a murmur rather in a spirit of triumph made every worldly sacrifice for the church and court of rome for that cause they had forfeited their lives broad estates and all the honors of a lofty station in their own land reginald catesby with considerable abilities trained with consummate skill inherited their determined will and the traditionary beauty of their form and countenance his manners were winning and he was as well informed in the ways of the world as he was in the works of the great casuists  my lord has ordered the charbanc and is going to drive us all to chart where we will lunch said lady st jerome tis a curious place and was planted only seventy years ago by my lords grandfather entirely with sprucefirs but with so much care and skill giving each plant and tree ample distance that they have risen to the noblest proportions with all their green branches farspreading on the ground like huge fans  it was only a drive of three or four miles entirely in the park this was a district that had been added to the ancient enclosurea striking scene it was a forest of firs but quite unlike such as might be met with in the north of europe or of america every tree was perfecthuge and complete and full of massy grace nothing else was permitted to grow there except juniper of which there were abounding and wondrous groups green and spiral the whole contrasting with the tall brown fern of which there were quantities about cut for the deer  the turf was dry and mossy and the air pleasant it was a balmy day they sat down by the great trees the servants opened the luncheonbaskets which were a present from balmoral lady st jerome was seldom seen to greater advantage than distributing her viands under such circumstances never was such gay and graceful hospitality lothair was quite fascinated as she playfully thrust a paper of lobstersandwiches into his hand and enjoined monsignore catesby to fill his tumbler with chablis  i wish father coleman were here said lothair to miss arundel  why said miss arundel  because we were in the midst of a very interesting conversation on idolatry and on worship in groves when lady st jerome summoned us to our drive this seems a grove where one might worship  father coleman ought to be at rome said miss arundel he was to have passed holy week there i know not why he changed his plans  are you angry with him for it  no not angry but surprised surprised that any one might be at rome and yet be absent from it  you like rome  i have never been there it is the wish of my life  may i say to you what you said to me just nowwhy  naturally because i would wish to witness the ceremonies of the church in their most perfect form  but they are fulfilled in this country i have heard with much splendor and precision  miss arundel shook her head  oh no she said in this country we are only just emerging from the catacombs if the ceremonies of the church were adequately fulfilled in england we should hear very little of english infidelity  that is saying a great deal observed lothair inquiringly  had i that command of wealth of which we hear so much in the present day and with which the possessors seem to know so little what to do i would purchase some of those squalid streets in westminster which are the shame of the metropolis and clear a great space and build a real cathedral where the worship of heaven should be perpetually conducted in the full spirit of the ordinances of the church i believe were this done even this country might be saved    chapter 16   lothair began to meditate on two great ideasthe reconciliation of christendom and the influence of architecture on religion if the differences between the roman and anglican churches and between the papacy and protestantism generally arose as father coleman assured him and seemed to prove in mere misconception reconciliation though difficult did not seem impossible and appeared to be one of the most efficient modes of defeating the atheists it was a result which of course mainly depended on the authority of reason but the power of the imagination might also be enlisted in the good cause through the influence of the fine arts of which the great mission is to excite and at the same time elevate the feelings of the human family lothair found himself frequently in a reverie over miss arundels ideal fane and feeling that he had the power of buying up a district in forlorn westminster and raising there a temple to the living god which might influence the future welfare of millions and even effect the salvation of his country he began to ask himself whether he could incur the responsibility of shrinking from the fulfilment of this great duty  lothair could not have a better adviser on the subject of the influence of architecture on religion than monsignore catesby monsignore catesby had been a pupil of pugin his knowledge of ecclesiastical architecture was only equalled by his exquisite taste to hear him expound the mysteries of symbolical art and expatiate on the hidden revelations of its beauteous forms reached even to ecstasy lothair hung upon his accents like a neophyte conferences with father coleman on those points of faith on which they did not differ followed up by desultory remarks on those points of faith on which they ought not to differcritical discussions with monsignore catesby on cathedrals their forms their purposes and the instances in several countries in which those forms were most perfect and those purposes best securedoccupied a good deal of time and yet these engaging pursuits were secondary in real emotion to his frequent conversations with miss arundel in whose society every day he took a strange and deeper interest  she did not extend to him that ready sympathy which was supplied by the two priests on the contrary when he was apt to indulge in those speculations which they always encouraged and rewarded by adroit applause she was often silent throwing on him only the scrutiny of those violet yes whose glance was rather fascinating than apt to captivate and yet he was irresistibly drawn to her and once recalling the portrait in the gallery he ventured to murmur that they were kinsfolk  oh i have no kin no country said miss arundel these are not times for kin and country i have given up all these things for my master  but are our times so trying as that inquired lothair  they are times for new crusades said miss arundel with energy though it may be of a different character from the old if i were a man i would draw my sword for christ there are as great deeds to be done as the siege of ascalon or even as the freeing of the holy sepulchre  in the midst of a profound discussion with father coleman on mariolatry lothair rapt in reverie suddenly introduced the subject of miss arundel i wonder what will be her lot he exclaimed  it seems to me to be settled said father coleman she will be the bride of the church  indeed and he started and even changed color  she deems it her vocation said father coleman  and yet with such gifts to be immured in a convent said lothair  that would not necessarily follow replied father coleman miss arundel may occupy a position in which she may exercise much influence for the great cause which absorbs her being  there is a divine energy about her said lothair almost speaking to himself it could not have been given for little ends  if miss arundel could meet with a spirit as and as energetic as her own said father coleman her fate might be different she has no thoughts which are not great and no purposes which are not sublime but for the companion of her life she would require no less than a godfrey de bouillon  lothair began to find the time pass very rapidly at vauxe easter week had nearly vanished vauxe had been gay during the last few days every day some visitors came down from london sometimes they returned in the evening sometimes they passed the night at vauxe and returned to town in the morning with large bouquets lothair felt it was time for him to interfere and he broke his intention to lady st jerome but lady st jerome would not hear of it so he muttered something about business  exactly she said everybody has business and i dare say you have a great deal but vauxe is exactly the place for persons who have business you go up to town by an early train and then you return exactly in time for dinner and bring us all the news from the clubs  lothair was beginning to say something but lady st jerome who when necessary had the rare art of not listening without offending the speaker told him that they did not intend themselves to return to town for a week or so and that she knew lord st jerome would be greatly annoyed if lothair did not remain  lothair remained and he went up to town one or two mornings to transact business that is to say to see a celebrated architect and to order plans for a cathedral in which all the purposes of those sublime and exquisite structures were to be realized the drawings would take a considerable time to prepare and these must be deeply considered so lothair became quite domiciliated at vauxe he went up to town in the morning and returned as it were to his home everybody delighted to welcome him and yet he seemed not expected his rooms were called after his name and the household treated him as one of the family    chapter 17   a few days before lothairs visit was to terminate the cardinal and monsignore berwick arrived at vauxe his eminence was received with much ceremony the marshalled household ranged in lines fell on their knees at his approach and lady st jerome miss arundel and some other ladies scarcely less choice and fair with the lowest obeisance touched with their honored lips his princely hand  the monsignore had made another visit to paris on his intended return to rome but in consequence of some secret intelligence which he had acquired in the french capital had thought fit to return to england to consult with the cardinal there seemed to be no doubt that the revolutionary party in italy assured by the withdrawal of the french troops from rome were again stirring there seemed also little doubt that london was the centre of preparation though the project and the projectors were involved in much mystery they want money said the monsignore that we know and that is now our best chance the aspromonte expedition drained their private resources and as for further aid that is out of the question the galantuomo is bankrupt but the atheists are desperate and we must prepare for events  on the morning after their arrival the cardinal invited lothair to a stroll in the park there is the feeling of spring this morning said his eminence though scarcely yet its vision it was truly a day of balm and sweetness and quickening life a delicate mist hung about the huge trees and the masses of more distant woods and seemed to clothe them with that fulness of foliage which was not yet theirs the cardinal discoursed much on foresttrees and happily he recommended lothair to read evelyns sylva mr evelyn had a most accomplished mind indeed a character in every respect that approached perfection he was also a most religious man  i wonder said lothair how any man who is religious can think of any thing but religion  true said the cardinal and looking at him earnestly most true but all things that are good and beautiful make us more religious they tend to the development of the religious principle in us which is our divine nature and my dear young friend and here his eminence put his arm easily and affectionately into that of lothair it is a most happy thing for you that you live so much with a really religious family it is a great boon for a young man and a rare one  i feel it so said lothair his face kindling  ah said the cardinal when we remember that this country once consisted only of such families and then with a sigh and as if speaking to himself and they made it so great and so beautiful  it is still great and beautiful said lothair but rather in a tone of inquiry than decision  but the cause of its greatness and its beauty no longer exists it became great and beautiful because it believed in god  but faith is not extinct said lothair  it exists in the church replied the cardinal with decision all without that pale is practical atheism  it seems to me that a sense of duty is natural to man said lothair and that there can be no satisfaction in life without attempting to fulfil it  noble words my dear young friend noble and true and the highest duty of man especially in this age is to vindicate the principles of religion without which the world must soon become a scene of universal desolation  i wonder if england will ever again be a religious country said lothair musingly  i pray for that daily said the cardinal and he invited his companion to seat himself on the trunk of an oak that had been lying there since the autumn fall a slight hectic flame played over the pale and attenuated countenance of the cardinal he seemed for a moment in deep thought and then in a voice distinct yet somewhat hushed and at first rather faltering he said i know not a grander or a nobler career for a young man of talents and position in this age than to be the champion and asserter of divine truth it is not probable that there could be another conqueror in out time the world is wearied of statesmen whom democracy has degraded into politicians and of orators who have become what they call debaters i do not believe there could be another dante even another milton the world is devoted to physical science because it believes these discoveries will increase its capacity of luxury and selfindulgence but the pursuit of science leads only to the insoluble when we arrive at that barren term the divine voice summons man as it summoned samuel all the poetry and passion and sentiment of human nature are taking refuge in religion and he whose deeds and words most nobly represent divine thoughts will be the man of this century  but who could be equal to such a task murmured lothair  yourself exclaimed the cardinal and he threw his glittering eye upon his companion any one with the necessary gifts who had implicit faith in the divine purpose  but the church is perplexed it is ambiguous contradictory  no no said the cardinal not the church of christ it is never perplexed never ambiguous never contradictory why should it be how could it be the divine persons are ever with it strengthening and guiding it with perpetual miracles perplexed churches are churches made by act of parliament not by god  lothair seemed to start and looked at his guardian with a scrutinizing glance and then he said but not without hesitation i experience at times great despondency  naturally replied the cardinal every man must be despondent who is not a christian  but i am a christian said lothair  a christian estranged said the cardinal a christian without the consolations of christianity  there is something in that said lothair i require the consolations of christianity and yet i feel i have them not why is this  because what you call your religion is a thing apart from your life and it ought to be your life religion should be the rule of life not a casual incident of it there is not a duty of existence not a joy or sorrow which the services of the church do not assert or with which they do not sympathize tell me now you have i was glad to hear attended the services of the church of late since you have been under this admirable roof have you not then found some consolation  yes without doubt i have been often solaced and lothair sighed  what the soul is to man the church is to the world said the cardinal it is the link between us and the divine nature it came from heaven complete it has never changed and it can never alter its ceremonies are types of celestial truths its services are suited to all the moods of man they strengthen him in his wisdom and his purity and control and save him in the hour of passion and temptation taken as a whole with all its ministrations its orders its offices and the divine splendor of its ritual it secures us on earth some adumbration of that ineffable glory which awaits the faithful in heaven where the blessed mother of god and ten thousand saints perpetually guard over no with divine intercession  i was not taught these things in my boyhood said lothair  and you might reproach me and reasonably as your guardian for my neglect said the cardinal but my power was very limited and when my duties commenced you must remember that i was myself estranged from the church i was myself a parliamentary christian till despondency and study and ceaseless thought and prayer and the divine will brought me to light and rest but i at least saved you from a presbyterian university i at least secured oxford for you and i can assure you of my many struggles that was not the least  it gave the turn to my mind said lothair and i am grateful to you for it what it will all end in god only knows  it will end in his glory and in yours said the cardinal i have spoken perhaps too much and too freely but you greatly interest me not merely because you are my charge and the son of my beloved friend but because i perceive in you great qualitiesqualities so great continued the cardinal with earnestness that properly guided they may considerably affect the history of this country and perhaps even have a wider range  lothair shook his head  well well continued the cardinal in a lighter tone we will pursue our ramble at any rate i am not wrong in this that you have no objection to join in my daily prayer for the conversion of this kingdom toreligious truth his eminence added after a pause  yes religious truth said lothair we must all pray for that    chapter 18   lothair returned to town excited and agitated he felt that he was on the eve of some great event in his existence but its precise character was not defined one conclusion however was indubitable life must be religion when we consider what is at stake and that our eternal welfare depends on our due preparation for the future it was folly to spare a single hour from the consideration of the best means to secure our readiness such a subject does not admit of half measures or of halting opinions it seemed to lothair that nothing could interest him in life that was not symbolical of divine truths and an adumbration of the celestial hereafter  could truth have descended from heaven ever to be distorted to be corrupted misapprehended misunderstood impossible such a belief would confound and contradict all the attributes of the allwise and the allmighty there must be truth on earth now as fresh and complete is it was at bethlehem and how could it be preserved but by the influence of the paraclete acting on an ordained class on this head his tutor at oxford had fortified him by a conviction of the apostolical succession of the english bishops which no act of parliament could alter or affect but lothair was haunted by a feeling that the relations of his communion with the blessed virgin were not satisfactory they could not content either his heart or his intellect was it becoming that a christian should live as regards the hallowed mother of his god in a condition of harsh estrangement what mediatorial influence more awfully appropriate than the consecrated agent of the mighty mystery nor could he even in his early days accept without a scruple the frigid system that would class the holy actors in the divine drama of the redemption as mere units in the categories of vanished generations human beings who had been in personal relation with the godhead must be different from other human beings there must be some transcendent quality in their lives and careers in their very organization which marks them out from all secular heroes what was alexander the great or even caius julius compared with that apostle whom jesus loved  restless and disquieted lothair paced the long and lofty rooms which had been secured for him in a london hotel which rivalled the colossal convenience of paris and the american cities their tawdry ornaments and their terrible new furniture would not do after the galleries and portraits of vauxe lothair sighed  why did that visit ever end why did the world consist of any thing else but tudor palaces in ferny parks or time be other than a perpetual holy week he never sighed at vauxe why he supposed it was because their religion was his life and hereand he looked around him with a shudder the cardinal was right it was a most happy thing for him to be living so much with so truly a religious family  the door opened and servants came in bearing a large and magnificent portfolio it was of morocco and of prelatial purple with broad bands of gold and alternate ornaments of a cross and a coronet a servant handed to lothair a letter which enclosed the key that opened its lock the portfolio contained the plans and drawings of the cathedral  lothair was lost in admiration of these designs and their execution but after the first fever of investigation was over he required sympathy and also information in a truly religious family there would always be a father coleman or a monsignore catesby to guide and to instruct but a protestant if he wants aid or advice on any matter can only go to his solicitor but as he proceeded in his researches he sensibly felt that the business was one above even an oratorian or a monsignore it required a finer and a more intimate sympathy a taste at the same time more inspired and more inspiring some one who blended with divine convictions the graceful energy of human feeling and who would not only animate him to effort but fascinate him to its fulfilment the counsellor he required was miss arundel  lothair had quitted vauxe one week and it seemed to him a year during the first fourandtwenty hours he felt like a child who had returned to school and the day after like a man on a desert island various other forms of misery and misfortune were suggested by his succeeding experience town brought no distractions to him he knew very few people and these be had not yet encountered he had once ventured to whites but found only a group of graybeaded men who evidently did not know him and who seemed to scan him with cynical nonchalance these were not the golden youth whom he had been assured by bertram would greet him so after reading a newspaper for a moment upside downward he got away but he had no harbor of refuge and was obliged to ride down to richmond and dine alone and meditate on symbols and celestial adumbrations every day he felt how inferior was this existence to that of a life in a truly religious family  but of all the members of the family to which his memory recurred with such unflagging interest none more frequently engaged his thoughts than miss arundel her conversation which stimulated his intelligence while it rather piqued his selflove exercised a great influence over him and he had omitted no opportunity of enjoying her society that society and its animating power he sadly missed and now that he had before him the very drawings about which they had frequently talked and she was not by his side to suggest and sympathize and criticism and praise he felt unusually depressed  lothair corresponded with lady st jerome and was aware of her intended movements but the return the family to london had been somewhat delayed when this disappointment was first made known to him his impulse was to ride down to vauxe but the tact in which he was not deficient assured him that he ought not to reappear on a stage where he had already figured for perhaps too considerable a time and so another week had to be passed softened however by visits from the father of the oratory and the chamberlain of his holiness who came to look after lothair with much friendliness and with whom it was consolatory and even delightful for him to converse on sacred art still holier things and also miss arundel  at length though it seemed impossible this second week elapsed and tomorrow lothair was to lunch with lady st jerome in st jamess square and to meet all his friends he thought of it all day and he passed a restless night he took an early canter to rally his energies and his fancy was active in the splendor of the spring the chestnuts were in silver bloom and the pink may had flushed the thorns and banks of sloping turf were radiant with plots of gorgeous flowers the waters glittered in the sun and the air was fragrant with that spell which only can be found in metropolitan mignonette it was the hour and the season when heroic youth comes to great decisions achieves exploits or perpetrates scrapes  nothing could be more cordial nothing more winning than the reception of lothair by lady st jerome she did not conceal her joy at their being again together even miss arundel though still calm even a little demure seemed glad to see him her eyes looked kind and pleased and she gave him her hand with graceful heartiness it was the sacred hour of two when lothair arrived and they were summoned to luncheon almost immediately then they were not alone lord st jerome was not there but the priests were present and some others lothair however sat next to miss arundel  i have been thinking of you very often since i left vauxe said lothair to his neighbor  charitably i am sure  i have been thinking of you every day he continued for i wanted your advice  ah but that is not a popular thing to give  but it is preciousat least yours is to meand i want it now very much  father coleman told me you had got the plans for the cathedral said miss arundel  and i want to show them to you  i fear i am only a critic said miss arundel and i do not admire mere critics i was very free in my comments to you on several subjects at vauxe and i must now say i thought you bore it very kindly  i was enchanted said lothair and desire nothing but to be ever subject to such remarks but this affair of the cathedral it is your own thoughti would fain hope your own wish for unless it were your own wish i do not think i ever should be able to accomplish it  and when the cathedral is built said miss arundel what then  do you not remember telling me at vauxe that all sacred buildings should be respected for that in the longrun they generally fell to the professors of the true faith  but when they built st peters they dedicated it to a saint in heaven said miss arundel to whom is yours to be inscribed  to a saint in heaven and in earth said lothair blushing to st clare  but lady st jerome and her guests rose at this moment and it is impossible to say with precision whether this last remark of lothair absolutely reached the ear of miss arundel she looked as if it had not the priests and the other guests dispersed lothair accompanied the ladies to the drawingroom he lingered and he was meditating if the occasion served to say more  lady st jerome was writing a note mss arundel was arranging some work lothair was affecting an interest in her employment in order that he might be seated by her and ask her questions when the groom of the chambers entered and inquired whether her ladyship was at home and being answered in the affirmative retired and announced and ushered in the duchess and lady corisande    chapter 19   it seemed that the duchess and lady st jerome were intimate for they called each other by their christian names and kissed each other the young ladies also were cordial her grace greeted lothair with heartiness lady corisande with some reserve lothair thought she looked very radiant and very proud  it was some time since they had all metnot since the end of the last seasonso there was a great deal to talk about there had been deaths and births and marriages which required a flying commentall important events deaths which solved many difficulties heirs to estates which were not expected and weddings which surprised everybody  and have you seen selina inquired lady st jerome  not yet except mamma this is our first visit replied the duchess  ah that is real friendship she came down to vauxe the other day but i did not think she was looking well she frets herself too much about her boys she does not know what to do with them they will not go into the church and they have no fortune for the guards  i understood that lord plantagenet was to be a civil engineer said lady corisande  and lord albert victor to have a sheepwalk in australia continued lady st jerome  they say that a lord must not go to the bar said miss arundel it seems to me very unjust  alfred beaufort went the circuit said lady corisande but i believe they drove him into parliament  you will miss your friend bertram at oxford said the duchess addressing lothair  indeed said lothair rather confused for he was himself a defaulter in collegiate attendance i was just going to write to him to see whether one could not keep half a term  oh nothing will prevent his taking his degree said the duchess but i fear there must be some delay there is a vacancy for our countymr sandstone is dead and they insist upon returning bertram i hope he will be of age before the nomination the duke is much opposed to it he wishes him to wait but in these days it is not so easy for young men to get into parliament it is not as it used to be we cannot choose  this is an important event said lothair to lady corisande  i think it is nor do i believe bertram is too young for public life these are not times to be laggard  there is no doubt they are very serious times said lothair  i have every confidence in bertramin his ability and his principles  the ladies began to talk about the approaching drawingroom and lady corisandes presentation and lothair thought it right to make his obeisance and withdraw he met in the hall father coleman who was in fact looking after him and would have induced him to repair to the fathers room and hold some interesting conversation but lothair was not so congenial as usual he was even abrupt and the father who never pressed any thing assuming that lothair had some engagement relinquished with a serene brow but not without chagrin what he had deemed might have proved a golden opportunity  and yet lothair had no engagement and did not know where to go or what to do with himself but he wanted to be alone and of all persons in the world at that moment he had a sort of instinct that the one he wished least to converse with was father coleman  she has every confidence in his principles said lothair to himself as he mounted his horse and his principles were mine six months ago when i was at brentham delicious brentham it seems like a dream but every thing seems like a dream i hardly know whether life is agony or bliss    chapter 20  the duke was one of the few gentlemen in london who lived in a palace one of the halfdozen of those stately structures that our capital boasts had fallen to his lot  an heirapparent to the throne in the earlier days of the present dynasty had resolved to be lodged as became a prince and had raised amid gardens which he had diverted from one of the royal parks an edifice not unworthy of vicenza in its best days though on a far more extensive scale than any pile that favored city boasts before the palace was finished the prince died and irretrievably in debt his executors were glad to sell to the trustees of the ancestors of the chief of the house of brentham the incomplete palace which ought never to have been commenced the ancestor of the duke was by no means so strong a man as the duke himself and prudent people rather murmured at the exploit but it was what is called a lucky familythat is to say a family with a charm that always attracted and absorbed heiresses and perhaps the splendor of crecy housefor it always retained its original titlemight have in some degree contributed to fascinate the taste or imagination of the beautiful women who generation after generation brought their bright castles and their broad manors to swell the state and rentrolls of the family who were so kind to lothair  the centre of crecy house consisted of a hall of vast proportion and reaching to the roof its walls commemorated in paintings by the most celebrated artists of the age the exploits of the black prince and its coved ceiling in panels resplendent with venetian gold contained the forms and portraits of english heroes a corridor round this hall contained the most celebrated private collection of pictures in england and opened into a series of sumptuous saloons  it was a rather early hour when lothair the morning after his meeting the duchess at lady st jeromes called at crecy house but it was only to leave his card he would not delay for a moment paying his respects there and yet he shrank from thrusting himself immediately into the circle the dukes brougham was in the courtyard lothair was holding his grooms horse who had dismounted when the halldoor opened and his grace and bertram came forth  halloa old fellow exclaimed bertram only think of your being here it seems an age since we met the duchess was telling us about you at breakfast  go in and see them said the duke there is a large party at luncheon augusta montairy is there bertram and i are obliged to go to lincolns inn something about his election  but lothair murmured thanks and declined  what are you going to do with yourself today said the duke and lothair hesitating his grace continued well then come and dine with us  of course you will come old fellow i have not seen you since you left oxford at the beginning of the year and then we can settle about your term and lothair assenting they drove away  it was nine oclock before they dined the days were getting very long and soft and sweet the ridingparties lingered amid the pink may and the tender twilight breeze the montairys dined today at crecy house and a charming married daughter without her husband and lord and lady clanmorne who were near kin to the duchess and themselves so goodlooking and agreeable that they were as good at a dinnerparty as a couple of firstrate entr es there was also lord carisbrooke a young man of distinguished air and appearance his own master with a large estate and three years or so older than lothair  they dined in the chinese saloon which was of moderate dimensions but bright with fantastic forms and colors brilliantly lit up it was the privilege of lothair to hand the duchess to her seat he observed that lord carisbrooke was placed next to lady corisande though he had not taken her out  this dinner reminds me of my visit to brentham said lothair  almost the same party said the duchess  the visit to brentham was the happiest time of my life said lothair moodily  but you have seen a great deal since said the duchess  i am not a sure it is of any use seeing things said lothair  when the ladies retired there was some talk about horses lord carisbrooke was breeding lothair thought it was a duty to breed but not to go on the turf lord carisbrooke thought there could be no good breeding without racing lothair was of opinion that races might be confined to ones own parks with no legs admitted and immense prizes which must cause emulation then they joined the ladies and then in a short time there was music lothair hovered about lady corisande and at last seized a happy opportunity of addressing her  i shall never forget your singing at brentham he said at first i thought it might be as lady montairy said because i was not used to fine singing but i heard the venusina the other day and i prefer your voice and style  have you heard the venusina said lady corisande with animation i know nothing that i look forward to with more interest but i was told she was not to open her mouth until she appeared at the opera where did you hear her  oh i heard her said lothair at the roman catholic cathedral  i am sure i shall never hear her there said lady corisande looking very grave  do not you think music a powerful accessory to religion said lothair but a little embarrassed  within certain limits said lady corisandethe limits i am used to but i should prefer to hear operasingers at the opera  ah if all amateurs could sing like you said lothair that would be unnecessary but a fine mass by mozartit requires great skill as well as power to render it i admire no one so much as mozart and especially his masses i have been hearing a great many of them lately  so we understood said lady corisande rather dryly and looking about her as if she were not much interested or at any rate not much gratified by the conversation  lothair felt he was not getting on and he wished to get on but he was socially inexperienced and his resources not much in hand there was a pauseit seemed to him an awkward pause and then lady corisande walked away and addressed lady clanmorne  some very fine singing began at this moment the room was hushed no one moved and lothair undisturbed had the opportunity of watching his late companion there was something in lady corisande that to him was irresistibly captivating and as he was always thinking and analyzing he employed himself in discovering the cause she is not particularly gracious he said to himself at least not to me she is beautiful but so are others and others like her are cleverperhaps more clever but there is something in her brow her glance her carriage which intimate what they call character which interests me six months ago i was in love with her because i thought she was like her sisters i love her sisters but she is not the least like them  the music ceased lothair moved away and he approached the duke  i have a favor to ask your grace he said i have made up my mind that i shall not go back to oxford this term would your grace do me the great favor of presenting me at the next lev e    chapter 21   ones life changes in a moment half a month ago lothair without an acquaintance was meditating his return to oxford now he seemed to know everybody who was anybody his table was overflowing with invitations to all the fine houses in town first came the routs and the balls then when he had been presented to the husbands came the dinners his kind friends the duchess and lady st jerome were the fairies who had worked this sudden scene of enchantment a single word from them and london was at lothairs feet  he liked it amazingly he quite forgot the conclusion at which he had arrived respecting society a year ago drawn from his vast experience of the single party which he had then attended feelings are different when you know a great many persons and every person is trying to please you above all when there are individuals whom you want to meet and whom if you do not meet you become restless  town was beginning to blaze broughams whirled and bright barouches glanced troops of social cavalry cantered and caracolled in morning rides and the bells of prancing ponies lashed by delicate hands gingled in the laughing air there were stoppages in bond street which seems to cap the climax of civilisation after crowded clubs and swarming parks  but the great event of the season was the presentation of lady corisande truly our bright maiden of brenthani woke and found herself famous there are families whom everybody praises and families who are treated in a different way either will do all the sons and daughters of the first succeed all the sons and daughters of the last are encouraged in perverseness by the prophetic determination of society half a dozen married sisters who were the delight and ornament of their circles in the case of lady corisande were good precursors of popularity but the world would not be content with that they credited her with all their charms and winning qualities but also with something grander and beyond comparison and from the moment her fair cheek was sealed by the gracious approbation of majesty all the critics of the court at once recognised her as the cynosure of the empyrean  monsignore catesby who looked after lothair and was always breakfasting with him without the necessity of an invitation a fascinating man and who talked upon all subjects except high mass knew everything that took place at court without being present there himself he led the conversation to the majestic theme and while he seemed to be busied in breaking an egg with delicate precision and hardly listening to the frank expression of opinions which he carelessly encouraged obtained a not insufficient share of lothairs views and impressions of human beings and affairs in general during the last few days which had witnessed a levée and a drawingroom  ah then you were so fortunate as to know the beauty before her début said the monsignore  intimately her brother is my friend i was at brentham last summer delicious place and the most agreeable visit i ever made in my life at least one of the most agreeable  ah ah said the monsignore let me ring for some toast  on the night of the drawingroom a great ball was given at crecy house to celebrate the entrance of corisande into the world it was a sumptuous festival the palace resonant with fantastic music blazed amid illumined gardens rich with summer warmth  a prince of the blood was dancing with lady corisande lothair was there visàvis with miss arundel  i delight in this hall she said to lothair but how superior the pictured scene to the reality  what would you like then to be in a battle  i should like to be with heroes wherever they might be what a fine character was the black prince and they call those days the days of superstition  the silver horns sounded a brave flourish lothair had to advance and meet lady corisande her approaching mien was full of grace and majesty but lothair thought there was a kind expression in her glance which seemed to remember brentham and that he was her brothers mend  a little later in the evening he was her partner he could not refrain from congratulating her on the beauty and the success of the festival  i am glad you are pleased and i am glad you think it successful but you know i am no judge for this is my first ball  ah to be sure and yet it seems impossible he continued in a tone of murmuring admiration  oh i have been at little dances at my sisters half behind the door she added with a slight smile but tonight i am present at a scene of which i have only read  and how do you like balls said lothair  i think i shall like them very much said lady corisande but tonight i will confess i am a little nervous  you do not look so  i am glad of that  why  is it not a sign of weakness  can feeling be weakness  feeling without sufficient cause is i should think and then and in a tone of some archness she said and how do you like balls  well i like them amazingly said lothair they seem to me to have every quality which can render an entertainment agreeable music light flowers beautiful faces graceful forms and occasionally charming conversation  yes and that never lingers said lady corisande for see i am wanted  when they were again undisturbed lothair regretted the absence of bertram who was kept at the house  it is a great disappointment said lady corisande but he will yet arrive though late i should be most unhappy though if he were absent from his post on such an occasion i am sure if he were here i could not dance  you are a most ardent politician said lothair  oh i do not care in the least about common politics parties and office and all that i neither regard nor understand them replied lady corisande but when wicked men try to destroy the country then i like my family to be in the front  as the destruction of the country meditated this night by wicked men was some change in the status of the church of england which monsignore catesby in the morning had suggested to lothair as both just and expedient and highly conciliatory lothair did not pursue the theme for he had a greater degree of tact than usually falls to the lot of the ingenuous  the bright moments flew on suddenly there was a mysterious silence in the hall followed by a kind of suppressed stir everyone seemed to be speaking with bated breath or if moving walking on tiptoe it was the supper hour  soft hour which wakes the wish and melts the heart  royalty followed by the imperial presence of ambassadors and escorted by a group of dazzling duchesses and paladins of high degree was ushered with courteous pomp by the host and hostess into a choice saloon hung with rosecoloured tapestry and illumined by chandeliers of crystal where they were served from gold plate but the thousand less favoured were not badly off when they found themselves in the more capacious chambers into which they rushed with an eagerness hardly in keeping with the splendid nonchalance of the preceding hours  what a perfect family exclaimed hugo bohun as he extracted a couple of fat little birds from their bed of aspic jelly everything they do in such perfect taste how safe you were here to have ortolans for supper  all the little round tables though their number was infinite were full male groups hung about some in attendance on fair dames some foraging for themselves some thoughtful and more patient and awaiting a satisfactory future never was such an elegant clatter  i wonder where carisbrooke is said hugo bohun they say he is wonderfully taken with the beauteous daughter of the house  i will back the duke of brecon against him said one of his companions he raved about her at whites yesterday  hem  the end is not so near as all that said a third wassailer  i do not know that said hugo bohun it is a family that marries off quickly if a fellow is obliged to marry he always likes to marry one of them  what of this new star said his friend and he mentioned lothair  oh he is too young not launched besides he is going to turn catholic and i doubt whether that would do in that quarter  but he has a greater fortune than any of them  immense a man i know who knows another man and then he began a long statistical story about lothairs resources  have you got any room here hugo drawled out lord st aldegonde  plenty and here is my chair  on no account half of it and some soup will satisfy me  i should have thought you would have been with the swells said hugo bohun  that does not exactly suit me said st aldegonde i was ticketed to the duchess of salop but i got a firstrate substitute with the charm of novelty for her grace and sent her in with lothair  st aldegonde was the heir apparent of the wealthiest if not the most ancient dukedom in the united kingdom he was spoiled but he knew it had he been an ordinary being he would have merely subsided into selfishness and caprice but having good abilities and a good disposition he was eccentric adventurous and sentimental notwithstanding the apathy which had been engendered by premature experience st aldegonde held extreme opinions especially on political affairs being a republican of the reddest dye he was opposed to all privilege and indeed to all orders of men except dukes who were a necessity he was also strongly in favour of the equal division of all property except land liberty depended on land and the greater the landowners the greater the liberty of a country he would hold forth on this topic even with energy amazed at anyone differing from him as if a fellow could have too much land he would urge with a voice and glance which defied contradiction st aldegonde had married for love and he loved his wife but he was strongly in favour of womans rights and their extremest consequences it was thought that he had originally adopted these latter views with the amiable intention of piquing lady st aldegonde but if so he had not succeeded beaming with brightness with the voice and airiness of a bird and a cloudless temper albertha st aldegonde had from the first hour of her marriage concentrated her intelligence which was not mean on one object and that was never to cross her husband on any conceivable topic they had been married several years and she treated him as a darling spoiled child when he cried for the moon it was promised him immediately however irrational his proposition she always assented to it though generally by tact and vigilance she guided him in the right direction nevertheless st aldegonde was sometimes in scrapes but then he always went and told his best friend whose greatest delight was to extricate him from his perplexities and embarrassments     chapter 22   although lothair was not in the slightest degree shaken in his conviction that life should be entirely religious he was perplexed by the inevitable obstacles which seemed perpetually to oppose themselves to the practice of his opinions it was not merely pleasure in its multiform appearances that he had to contend against but business began imperiously to solicit his attention every month brought him nearer to his majority and the frequent letters from mr putney giles now began to assume the pressing shape of solicitations for personal interviews he had a long conversation one morning with father coleman on this subject who greatly relieved him by the assurance that a perfectly religious life was one of which the sovereign purpose was to uphold the interests of the church of christ the father added after a momentary pause business and even amusement were not only compatible with such a purpose but might even be conducive to its fulfilment  mr putney giles reminded lothair that the attainment of his majority must be celebrated and in a becoming manner preparation and even considerable preparation was necessary there were several scenes of actionsome very distant it was not too early to contemplate arrangements lothair really must confer with his guardians they were both now in town the scotch uncle having come up to attend parliament could they be brought together was it indeed impossible if so who was to give the necessary instructions  it was much more than a year since lothair had met his uncle and he did not anticipate much satisfaction from the renewal of their intimacy but every feeling of propriety demanded that it should be recognized and to a certain degree revived lord culloden was a black scotchman tall and lean with good features a hard red face and irongray hair he was a man who shrank from scenes and he greeted lothair as if they had only parted yesterday looking at him with his keen unsentimental but not unkind eye he said well sir i thought you would have been at oxford  yes my dear uncle but circumstances  well well i dont want to hear the cause i am very glad you are not there i believe you might as well be at rome  and then in due course and after some talk of the past and old times lothair referred to the suggestions of mr giles and hinted at a meeting of his guardians to confer and advise together  no no said the scotch peer shaking his head i will have nothing to do with the scarlet lady mr giles is an able and worthy man he may well be trusted to draw up a programme for our consideration and indeed it is an affair in which yourself should be most consulted let all be done liberally for you have a great inheritance and i would be no curmudgeon in these matters  well my dear uncle whatever is arranged i hope you and my cousins will honor and gratify me with your presence throughout the proceedings  well well it is not much in my way you will be having balls and fine ladies there is no fool like an old fool they say but i think from what i hear the young fools will beat us in the present day only think of young persons going over to the church of rome why they are just naturals  the organizing genius of mr putney giles had rarely encountered a more fitting theme than the celebration of the impending majority there was place for all his energy and talent and resources a great central inauguration sympathetical festivals and gatherings in half a dozen other counties the troth as it were of a sister kingdom to be pledged a vista of balls and banquets and illuminations and addresses of ceaseless sports and speeches and processions alike endless  what i wish to effect said mr giles as he was giving his multifarious orders is to produce among all classes an impression adequate to the occasion i wish the lord and the tenantry alike to feel they have a duty to perform  in the mean time monsignore catesby was pressing lothair to become one of the patrons of a roman catholic bazaar where lady st jerome and miss arundel were to preside over a stall it was of importance to show that charity was not the privilege of any particular creed  between his lawyers and his monsignores and his architects lothair began to get a little harassed he was disturbed in his own mind too on greater matters and seemed to feel every day that it was more necessary to take a decided step and more impossible to decide upon what it should be he frequently saw the cardinal who was very kind to him but who had become more reserved on religious subjects he had dined more than once with his eminence and had met some distinguished prelates and some of his fellownobles who had been weaned from the errors of their cradle the cardinal perhaps thought that the presence of these eminent converts would facilitate the progress perhaps the decision of his ward but something seemed always to happen to divert lothair in his course it mightbe sometimes apparently a very slight cause but yet for the time sufficient a phrase of lady corisande for example who though she never directly addressed him on the subject was nevertheless deeply interested in his spiritual condition  you ought to speak to him bertram she said one day to her brother very indignantly as she read a fresh paragraph alluding to an impending conversion you are his friend what is the use of friendship if not in such a crisis as this  i see no use in speaking to a man about love or religion said bertram they are both stronger than friendship if there be any foundation for the paragraph my interference would be of no avail if there be none i should only make myself ridiculous  nevertheless bertram looked a little more after his friend and disturbing the monsignore who was at breakfast with lothair one morning bertram obstinately outstayed the priest and then said i tell you what old fellow you are rather hippish i wish you were in the house of commons  so do i said lothair with a sigh but i have come into every thing readymade i begin to think it very unfortunate  what are you going to do with yourself today if you be disengaged i vote we dine together at whites and then we will go down to the house i will take you to the smokingroom and introduce you to bright and we will trot him out on primogeniture  at this moment the servant brought lothair two letters one was an epistle from father coleman meeting lothairs objections to becoming a patron of the roman catholic bazaar in a very unctuous and exhaustive manner and the other from his studgroom at oxford detailing some of those disagreeable things which will happen with absent masters who will not answer letters lothair loved his stable and felt particularly anxious to avoid the threatened visit of father coleman on the morrow his decision was rapid i must go down this afternoon to oxford my dear fellow my stable is in confusion i shall positively return tomorrow and i will dine with you at whites and we will go to the house of commons together or go to the play    chapter 23   lothairs stables were about three miles from oxford they were a rather considerable establishment in which he had taken much interest and having always intended to return to oxford in the early part of the year although he had occasionally sent for a hack or two to london his stud had been generally maintained  the morning after his arrival he rode over to the stables where he had ordered his drag to be ready about a quarter of a mile before he reached his place of destination he observed at some little distance a crowd in the road and hastening on perceived as he drew nearer a number of men clustered round a dismantled vehicle and vainly endeavoring to extricate and raise a fallen horse its companion panting and foaming with broken harness but apparently uninjured standing aside and held by a boy somewhat apart stood a lady alone lothair immediately dismounted and approached her saying i fear you are in trouble madam perhaps i may be of service  the lady was rather tall and of a singularly distinguished presence her air and her costume alike intimated high breeding and fashion she seemed quite serene amid the tumult and confusion and apparently the recent danger as lothair spoke she turned her head to him which had been at first a little averted and he beheld a striking countenance but one which he instantly felt he did not see for the first time  she bowed with dignity to lothair and said in a low but distinct voice you are most courteous sir we have had a sad accident but a great escape our horses ran away with us and had it not been for that heap of stones i do not see how we could have been saved  fortunately my stables are at hand said lothair and i have a carriage waiting for me at this moment not a quarter of a mile away it is at your service and i will send for it and his groom to whom he gave directions galloped off  there was a shout as the fallen horse was on his legs again much cut and the carriage shattered and useless a gentleman came from the crowd and approached the lady he was tall and fair and not illfavored with fine dark eyes and high cheekbones and still young though an enormous beard at the first glance gave him an impression of years the burden of which he really did not bear his dress though not vulgar was richer and more showy than is usual in this country and altogether there was something in his manner which though calm and full of selfrespect was different from the conventional refinement of england yet he was apparently an englishman as he said to the lady it is a bad business but we must be thankful it is no worse what troubles me is how you are to get back it will be a terrible walk over these stony roads and i can hear of no conveyance  my husband said the lady as with dignity she presented the person to lothair this gentleman she continued has most kindly offered us the use of his carriage which is almost at hand  sir you are a friend said the gentleman i thought there were no horses that i could not master but it seems i am mistaken i bought these only yesterday took a fancy to them as we were driving about and bought them of a dealer in the road  that seems a clever animal said lothair pointing to the one uninjured  ah you like horses said the gentleman  well i have some taste that way  we are visitors to oxford said the lady colonel campian like all americans is very interested in the ancient parts of england  today we were going to blenheim said the colonel but i thought i would try these new tits a bit on a byroad first  alls well that ends well said lothair and there is no reason why you should not fulfil your intention of going to blenheim for here is my carriage and it is entirely at your service for the whole day and indeed as long as you stay at oxford  sir there requires no coronet on your carriage to tell me you are a nobleman said the colonel i like frank manners and i like your team i know few things that would please me more than to try them  they were four roans highly bred with black manes and tails they had the arab eye with arched neck and seemed proud of themselves and their master  i do not see why we should not go to blenheim said the colonel  well not today said the lady i think we have had an escape but one feels these things a little more afterward than at the time i would rather go back to oxford and be quiet and there is more than one college which you have not yet seen  my team is entirely at your service wherever you go said lothair but i cannot venture to drive you to oxford for i am there in statu pupillari and a proctor might arrest us all but perhaps and he approached the lady you will permit me to call on you tomorrow when i hope i may find you have not suffered by this misadventure  we have got a professor dining with us today at seven oclock said the colonel at our hotel and if you be disengaged and would join the party you would add to the favors which you know so well how to confer  lothair handed the lady into the carriage the colonel mounted the box and took the ribbons like a master and the four roans trotted away with their precious charge and their two grooms behind with folded arms and imperturbable countenances  lothair watched the equipage until it vanished in the distance  it is impossible to forget that countenance he said and i fancy i did hear at the time that she had married an american well i shall meet her at dinnerthat is something and he sprang into his saddle    chapter 24   the oxford professor who was the guest of the american colonel was quite a young man of advanced opinions on all subjects religious social and political he was clever extremely wellinformed so far as books can make a man knowing but unable to profit even by his limited experience of life from a restless vanity and overflowing conceit which prevented him from ever observing or thinking of any thing but himself he was gifted with a great command of words which took the form of endless exposition varied by sarcasm and passages of ornate jargon he was the last person one would have expected to recognize in an oxford professor but we live in times of transition  a parisian man of science who had passed his life in alternately fighting at barricades and discovering planets had given colonel campian who had lived much in the french capital a letter of introduction to the professor whose invectives against the principles of english society were hailed by foreigners as representative of the sentiments of venerable oxford the professor who was not satisfied with his home career and like many men of his order of mind had dreams of wild vanity which the new world they think can alone realize was very glad to make the colonels acquaintance which might facilitate his future movements so he had lionized the distinguished visitors during the last few days over the university and had availed himself of plenteous opportunities for exhibiting to them his celebrated powers of exposition his talent for sarcasm which he deemed peerless and several highlyfinished picturesque passages which were introduced with contemporary art  the professor was very much surprised when he saw lothair enter the saloon at the hotel he was the last person in oxford whom he expected to encounter like sedentary men of extreme opinions he was a social parasite and instead of indulging in his usual invectives against peers and princes finding himself unexpectedly about to dine with one of that class he was content only to dazzle and amuse him  mrs campian only entered the room when dinner was announced she greeted lothair with calmness but amenity and took his offered arm  you have not suffered i hope said lothair  very little and through your kindness  it was a peculiar voice low and musical too subdued to call thrilling but a penetrating voice so that however ordinary the observation it attracted and impressed attention but it was in harmony with all her appearance and manner lothair thought he had never seen any one or any thing so serene the serenity however not of humbleness nor of merely conscious innocence it was not devoid of a degree of majesty what one pictures of olympian repose and the countenance was olympian a phidian face with large gray eyes and dark lashes wonderful hair abounding without art and gathered together by grecian fillets  the talk was of oxford and was at first chiefly maintained by the colonel and the professor  and do you share colonel campians feeling about old england inquired lothair of his hostess  the present interests me more than the past said the lady and the future more than the present  the present seems to me as unintelligible as the future said lothair  i think it is intelligible said the lady with a faint smile it has many faults but not i think the want of clearness  i am not a destructive said the professor addressing the colonel but speaking loudly i would maintain oxford under any circumstances with the necessary changes  and what are those might i ask inquired lothair  in reality not much i would get rid of the religion  get rid of the religion said lothair  you have got rid of it once said the professor  you have altered you have what people call reformed it said lothair but you have not abolished or banished it from the university  the shock would not be greater nor so great as the change from the papal to the reformed faith besides universities have nothing to do with religion  i thought universities were universal said lothair and had something to do with every thing  i cannot conceive any society of any kind without religion said the lady  lothair glanced at her beautiful brow with devotion as she uttered these words  colonel campian began to talk about horses after that the professor proved to him that he was related to edmund campian the jesuit and then he got to the gunpowder plot which he was not sure if successful might not have beneficially influenced the course of our history probably the irish difficulty would not then have existed  i dislike plots said the lady they always fail  and whatever their object are they not essentially immoral said lothair  i have more faith in ideas than in persons said the lady when a truth is uttered it will sooner or later be recognized it is only an affair of time it is better that it should mature and naturally germinate than be forced  you would reduce us to lotuseaters exclaimed the professor action is natural to man and what after all are conspiracies and revolutions but great principles in violent action  i think you must be an admirer of repose said lothair to the lady in a low voice  because i have seen something of action in my life said the lady and it is an experience of wasted energies and baffled thoughts  when they returned to the saloon the colonel and the professor became interested in the constitution and discipline of the american universities lothair hung about the lady who was examining some views of oxford and who was ascertaining what she had seen and what she had omitted to visit they were thinking of returning home on the morrow  without seeing blenheim said lothair  without seeing blenheim said the lady i confess to a pang but i shall always associate with that name your great kindness to us  but cannot we for once enter into a conspiracy together said lothair and join in a happy plot and contrive to go besides i could take you to the private gardens for the duke has given me a perpetual order and they are really exquisite  the lady seemed to smile  theodora said the colonel speaking from the end of the room what have you settled about your train tomorrow  we want to stay another day here said theodora and go to blenheim    chapter 25   they were in the private gardens at blenheim the sun was brilliant over the ornate and yet picturesque scene  beautiful is it not exclaimed lothair  yes certainly beautiful said theodora but do you know i do not feel altogether content in these fine gardens the principle of exclusion on which they are all founded is to me depressing i require in all things sympathy you would not agree with me in this the manners of your country are founded on exclusion  but surely there are times and places when one would like to be alone  without doubt said the lady only i do not like artificial loneliness even your parks which all the world praises do not quite satisfy me i prefer a forest where all may goeven the wild beasts  but forests are not at command said lothair  so you make a solitude and call it peace said the lady with a slight smile for my part my perfect life would be a large and beautiful village i admire nature but i require the presence of humanity life in great cities is too exhausting but in my village there should be air streams and beautiful trees a picturesque scene but enough of my fellowcreatures to insure constant duty  but the fulfilment of duty and society founded on what you call the principle of exclusion are not incompatible said lothair  no but difficult what should be natural becomes an art and in every art it is only the few who can be first rate  i have an ambition to be a firstrate artist in that respect said lothair thoughtfully  that does you much honor she replied for you necessarily embark in a most painful enterprise the toiling multitude have their sorrows which i believe will some day be softened and obstacles hard to overcome but i have always thought that the feeling of satiety almost inseparable from large possessions is a surer cause of misery than ungratified desires  it seems to me that there is a great deal to do said lothair  i think so said the lady  theodora said the colonel who was a little in advance with the professor and turning round his head this reminds me of mirabel and he pointed to the undulating banks covered with rare shrubs and touching the waters of the lake  and where is mirabel said lothair  it was a green island in the adriatic said the lady which belonged to colonel campian we lost it in the troubles colonel campian was very fond of it i try to persuade him that our home was of volcanic origin and has only vanished and subsided into its native bed  and were not you fond of it  i never think of the past said the lady  oxford is not the first place where i had the pleasure of meeting you lothair ventured at length to observe  yes we have met before in hyde park gardens our hostess is a clever woman and has been very kind to some friends of mine  and have you seen her lately  she comes to see us sometimes we do not live in london but in the vicinity we only go to london for the opera of which we are devotees we do not at all enter general society colonel campian only likes people who interest or amuse him and he is fortunate in having rather a numerous acquaintance of that kind  rare fortune said lothair  colonel campian lived a great deal at paris before we marred said the lady and in a circle of considerable culture and excitement he is social but not conventional  and youare you conventional  well i live only for climate and the affections said the lady i am fond of society that pleases me that is accomplished and natural and ingenious otherwise i prefer being alone as for atmosphere as i look upon it as the main source of felicity you may be surprised that i should reside in your country i should myself like to go to america but that would not suit colonel campian and if we are to live in europe we must live in england it is not pleasant to reside in a country where if you happen to shelter or succor a friend you may be subject to a domiciliary visit  the professor stopped to deliver a lecture or address on the villa of hadrian nothing could be more minute or picturesque than his description of that celebrated pleasaunce it was varied by portraits of the emperor and some of his companions and after a rapid glance at the fortunes of the imperial patriciate wound up with some conclusions favorable to communism it was really very clever and would have made the fortune of a literary society  i wonder if they had gravelwalks in the villa of hadrian said the colonel what i admire most in your country my lord are your gravelwalks though that lady would not agree with me that matter  you are against gravelwalks said lothair  well i cannot bring myself to believe that they had gravelwalks in the garden of eden said the lady  they had a repast at woodstock too late for luncheon too early for dinner but which it was agreed should serve as the latter meal  that suits me exactly said the lady i am a great foe to dinners and indeed to all meals i think when the good time comes we shall give up eating in public except perhaps fruit on a green bank with music  it was a rich twilight as they drove home the lady leaning back in the carriage silent lothair sat opposite to her and gazed upon a countenance on which the moon began to glisten and which seemed unconscious of all human observation  he had read of such countenances in grecian dreams in corinthian temples in fanes of ephesus in the radiant shadow of divine groves    chapter 26   when they had arrived at the hotel colonel campian proposed that they should come in and have some coffee but theodora did not enforce this suggestion and lothair feeling that she might be wearied gracefully though unwillingly waived the proposal remembering that on the noon of the morrow they were to depart with a happy inspiration as he said farewell he asked permission to accompany them to the station  lothair walked away with the professor who seemed in a conservative vein and graciously disposed to make several concessions to the customs of an ancient country though opposed to the land laws he would operate gradually and gave lothair more than one receipt how to save the aristocracy lothair would have preferred talking about the lady they had just quitted but as he soon found the professor could really give him no information about her he let the subject drop  but not out of his own mind he was glad to be alone and brood over the last two days they were among the most interesting of his life he had encountered a character different from any he had yet met had listened to new views and his intelligence had been stimulated by remarks made casually in easy conversation and yet to him pregnant with novel and sometimes serious meaning the voice too lingered in his ear so hushed and deep and yet so clear and sweet he leaned over his mantelpiece in teeming reverie  and she is profoundly religious he said to himself she can conceive no kind of society without religion she has arrived at the same conclusion as myself what a privilege it would be to speak to her on such subjects  after a restless night the morrow came about eleven oclock lothair ventured to call on his new friends the lady was alone she was standing by the window reading an italian newspaper which she folded up and placed aside when lothair was announced  we propose to walk to the station said theodora the servants have gone on colonel campian has a particular aversion to moving with any luggage he restricts me to this she said pointing to her satchel in which she had placed the foreign newspaper and for that he will not be responsible  it was most kind of you to permit me to accompany you this morning said lothair i should have been grieved to have parted abruptly last night  i could not refuse such a request said the lady but do you know i never like to say farewell even for fourandtwenty hours one should vanish like a spirit  then i have erred said lothair against your rules and principles  say my fancies said the lady my humors my whims besides this is not a farewell you will come and see us colonel campian tells me you have promised to give us that pleasure  it will be the greatest pleasure to me said lothair i can conceive nothing greater and then hesitating a little and a little blushing he added when do you think i might come  whenever you like said the lady you will always find me at home my life is this i ride every day very early and far into the country so i return tamed some two or three hours after noon and devote myself to my friends we are at home every evening except opera nights and let me tell you because it is not the custom generally among your compatriots we are always at home on sundays  colonel campian entered the room the moment of departure was at hand lothair felt the consolation of being their companion to the station he had once hoped it might be possible to be their companion in the train but he was not encouraged  railways have elevated and softened the lot of man said theodora and colonel campian views them with almost a religious sentiment but i cannot read in a railroad and the human voice is distressing to me amid the whirl and the whistling and the wild panting of the loosened megatheria who drag us and then those terrible grottosit is quite a descent of proserpine so i have no resources but my thoughts  and surely that is sufficient murmured lothair  not when the past is expelled said the lady  but the future said lothair  yes that is ever interesting but so vague that it sometimes induces slumber  the bell sounded lothair handed the lady to her compartment  our oxford visit she said has been a great success and mainly through you  the colonel was profuse in his cordial farewells and it seemed they would never have ended had not the train moved  lothair remained upon the platform until it was out of sight and then exclaimed is it a dream or shall i ever see her again    chapter 27   lothair reached london late in the afternoon among the notes and cards and letters on his table was a long and pressing dispatch from mr putney giles awaiting his judgment and decision on many points  the central inauguration if i may use the term said mr putney giles is comparatively easy it is an affair of expense and of laborgreat labor i may say unremitting labor but your lordship will observe the other points are not mere points of expense and labor we have to consult the feelings of several counties where your lordship cannot be present at least certainly not on this occasion and yet where an adequate recognition of those sentiments which ought to exist between the proprietor and all classes connected with him ought to be secured then scotland scotland is a very difficult business to manage it is astonishing how the sentiment lingers in that country connected with its old independence i really am quite surprised at it one of your lordships most important tenants wrote to me only a few days back that great dissatisfaction would prevail among your lordships friends and tenantry in scotland if that country on this occasion were placed on the same level as a mere english county it must be recognized as a kingdom i almost think it would be better if we could persuade lord culloden not to attend the english inauguration but remain in the kingdom of scotland and take the chair and the lead throughout the festal ceremonies a peer of the realm and your lordships guardian would impart something of national character to the proceedings and this with a judicious emblazoning on some of the banners of the royal arms of scotland might have a conciliatory effect one should always conciliate but your lordship upon all these points and especially with reference to lord culloden must be a much better judge than i am  lothair nearly gave a groan i almost wish he thought my minority would never end i am quite satisfied with things as they are what is the kingdom of scotland to me and all these counties i almost begin to feel that satiety which she said was inseparable from vast possessions  a letter from bertram reminding him that he had not dined at whites as he had promised and suggesting some new arrangement and another from monsignore catesby earnestly urging him to attend a most peculiar and solemn function of the church next sunday evening where the cardinal would officiate and preach and in which lady st jerome and miss arundel were particularly interested did not restore his equanimity  a dinner at whites he did not think he could stand a dinner at whites indeed he was not sure that he could stand any dinner anywhere especially in this hot weather there was a good deal in what she said one ought to eat alone  the ecclesiastical function was a graver matter it had been long contemplated often talked about and on occasions looked forward to by him even with a certain degree of eagerness he wished he had had an opportunity of speaking with her on these matters she was eminently religious that she had voluntarily avowed and he felt persuaded that no light or thoughtless remark could fall from those lips he wondered to what church she belonged protestant or papal her husband being an american was probably a protestant but he was a gentleman of the south and with nothing puritanical about him she was a european and probably of a latin race in all likelihood she was a roman catholic  it was wednesday evening and his valet reminded him that he was engaged to dine with lord and lady montairy  lothair sighed he was so absorbed by his new feelings that he shrunk from society with a certain degree of aversion he felt it quite out of his power to fulfil his engagement he sent an excuse it was lothairs first excuse in short he threw over the montairys to whom he was so much attached whom he so much admired and whose society he had hitherto so highly prized  to throw over a host is the most heinous of social crimes it ought never to be pardoned it disjoints a party often defeats the combinations which might affect the results of a season and generally renders the society incoherent and unsatisfactory if the outrage could ever be condoned it might be in the instance of a young man very inexperienced the victim of some unexpected condition of nervous feelings over which the defaulter has really no control  it was evening and the restless lothair walked forth without a purpose and in a direction which he rarely visited it is a wonderful place said he this london a nation not a city with a population greater than some kingdoms and districts as different as if they were under different governments and spoke different languages and what do i know of it i have been living here six months and my life has been passed in a park two or three squares and half a dozen streets  so he walked on and soon crossed oxford street like the rhine a natural boundary and then got into portland place and then found himself in the new road and then he hailed a cruising hansom which he had previously observed was well horsed  tis the gondola of london said lothair as he sprang in  drive on till i tell you to stop  and the hansom drove on through endless boulevards some bustling some dingy some tawdry and flaring some melancholy and mean rows of garden gods planted on the walls of yards full of vases and divinities of concrete huge railway halls monster hotels dissenting chapels in the form of gothic churches quaint ancient almshouses that were once built in the fields and teagardens and stingohouses and knackers yards they were in a district far beyond the experience of lothair which indeed had been exhausted when he had passed eustonia and from that he had been long separated the way was broad but illlit with houses of irregular size but generally of low elevation and sometimes detached in smokedried gardens the road was becoming a bridge which crossed a canal with barges and wharves and timberyards when their progress was arrested by a crowd it seemed a sort of procession there was a banner and the lamplight fell upon a religious emblem lothair was interested and desired the driver not to endeavor to advance the procession was crossing the road and entering a building  its a roman catholic chapel said a bystander in answer to lothair i believe it is a meeting about one of their schools they always have banners  i think i will get out said lothair to his driver this i suppose will pay your fare  the man stared with delight at the sovereign in his astonished palm and in gratitude suggested that he should remain and wait for the gentleman but the restless lothair declined the proposal  sir sir said the man leaning down his head as low as possible from his elevated seat and speaking in a hushed voice you are a real gentleman do you know what all this is  yes yes some meeting about a roman catholic school  the man shook his head you are a real gentleman and i will tell you the truth they meet about the schools of the order of st josephover the leftit is a fenian meeting  a fenian meeting  ay ay and you cannot enter that place without a ticket just you try however if a gentleman like you wants to go you shall have my ticket said the cabdriver and here it is and may i drive tomorrows as true a gentleman as i have driven today  so saying he took a packet from his breastpocket and opening it offered to lothair a green slip of paper which was willingly accepted i should like above all things to go he said and he blended with the rear of those who were entering the building the collector of the tickets stared at lothair and scrutinized his pass but all was in order and lothair was admitted  he passed through a house and a yard at the bottom of which was a rather spacious building when he entered it he saw in an instant it was not a chapel it was what is called a temperancehall a room to be hired for public assemblies with a raised platform at the end on which were half a dozen men the hall was tolerably full and lothair came in among the last there were some children sitting on a form placed against the wall of the room each with a bun which kept them quiet the banner belonged to this school and was the banner of st joseph  a man dressed like a pries and known as father omolloy came forward he was received with signs of much sympathy succeeded by complete silence he addressed them in a popular and animated style on the advantages of education they knew what that was and then they cheered education taught them to know their rights but what was the use of knowing their rights unless they enforced them that was not to be done by prayerbooks but by something else and something else wanted a subscription  this was the object of the meeting and the burden of all the speeches which followed and which were progressively more outspoken than the adroit introductory discourse the saxon was denounced sometimes with coarseness but sometimes in terms of picturesque passion the vast and extending organization of the brotherhood was enlarged on the great results at hand intimated the necessity of immediate exertion on the part of every individual pressed with emphasis all these views and remarks received from the audience an encouraging response and when lothair observed men going round with boxes and heard the clink of coin he felt very embarrassed as to what he should do when asked to contribute to a fund raised to stimulate and support rebellion against his sovereign he regretted the rash restlessness which had involved him in such a position  the collectors approached lothair who was standing at the end of the room opposite to the platform where the space was not crowded  i should like to speak to father omolloy said lothair he is a priest and will understand my views  he is a priest here said one of the collectors with a sardonic laugh but i am glad to say you will not find his name in the directory father omolloy is on the platform and engaged  if you want to speak to the father speak from where you are said the other collector here silence a gentleman wants to address the meeting  and there was silence and lothair felt extremely embarrassed but he was not wanting though it was the first time in his life that he had addressed a public meeting  gentlemen said lothair i really had no wish to intrude upon you all i desired was to speak to father omolloy i wished to tell him that it would have given me pleasure to subscribe to these schools i am not a roman catholic but i respect the roman catholic religion but i can do nothing that will imply the slightest sanction of the opinions i have heard expressed this evening for your own sakes but here a yell arose which forever drowned his voice  a spy a spy was the general exclamation we are betrayed seize him knock him over and the whole meeting seemed to have turned their backs on the platform and to be advancing on the unfortunate lothair two of the leaders on the platform at the same time leaped down from it to direct as it were the enraged populace  but at this moment a man who had been in the lower part of the hall in the vicinity of lothair and standing alone pushed forward and by his gestures and general mien arrested somewhat the crowd so that the two leaders who leaped from the platform and bustled through the crowd came in contact with him  the stranger was evidently not of the class or country of the rest assembled he had a military appearance and spoke with a foreign accent when he said this is no spy keep your people off  and who are you inquired the leader thus addressed  one accustomed to be obeyed said the stranger  you may be a spy yourself said the leader  i will not undertake to say that there are no spies in this room said the stranger but this person is not one and anybody who touches this person will touch this person at his peril stand off men and they stood off the wave retreated backward leaving the two leaders in front a couple of hundred men a moment before apparently full of furious passion and ready to take refuge in the violence of fear were cowed by a single human being  why you are not afraid of one man said the leaders ashamed of their following whatever betides no one unknown shall leave this room or it will be bow street tomorrow morning  nevertheless said the stranger two unknown men will leave this room and with general assent if any one touches this person or myself i will shoot him dead and he drew out his revolver and as for the rest look at that he added giving a paper to the leader of the fenian lodge and then give it me back again  the leader of the fenian lodge glanced at the paper he grew pale then scarlet folded the paper with great care and returned it reverentially to the stranger then looking round to the assembly and waving his hand he said all right the gentlemen are to go  well you have got out of a scrape young air said the stranger to lothair when they had escaped from the hall  and how can i express my gratitude to you lothair replied  poh said the stranger a mere affair of common duty but what surprises me is how you got your passticket  lothair told him all  they manage their affairs in general wonderfully close said the stranger but i have no opinion of them i have just returned from ireland where i thought i would go and see what they really are after no real business in them their treason is a fairy tale and their sedition a child talking in its sleep  they walked together about half a mile and then the stranger said at the end of this we shall get into the city road and the land again of omnibus and public conveyances and i shall wish you good night  but it is distressing to me to part thus said lothair pray let me call and pay my respects to my benefactor  no claim to any such title said the stranger i am always glad to be of use i will not trouble you to call on me for frankly i have no wish to increase the circle of my acquaintance so goodnight and as you seem to be fond of a little life take my advice and never go about unarmed    chapter 28   the fenian adventure furnished the distraction which lothair required it broke that absorbing spell of sentiment which is the delicious but enervating privilege of the youthful heart yet when lothair woke in the morning from his wellearned slumbers the charm returned and he fell at once into a reverie of belmont and a speculation when he might really pay his first visit there not todaythat was clearly out of the question they had separated only yesterday and yet it seemed an age and the adventure of another world there are moods of feeling which defy alike time and space  but on the morrow friday he might venture to go but then would tomorrow ever come it seemed impossible how were the intervening hours to pass the world however was not so devoid of resources as himself and had already appropriated his whole day and first monsignore catesby came to breakfast with him talking of every thing that was agreeable or interesting but in reality bent on securing his presence at the impending ecclesiastical ceremony of high import where his guardian was to officiate and where the foundation was to be laid of the reconciliation of all churches in the bosom of the true one then in the afternoon lothair had been long engaged to a match of pigeonshooting in which pastime bertram excelled it seemed there was to be a most exciting sweepstakes today in which the flower of england were to compete lothair among them and for the first time  this great exploit of arms was to be accomplished at the castle in the air a fantastic villa near the banks of the thames belonging to the duke of brecon his grace had been offended by the conduct or the comments of the outer world which in his pastime had thwarted or displeased him in the free life of battersea the duke of brecon was a gentleman easily offended but not one of those who ever confined their sense of injury to mere words he prided himself on putting down any individual or body of men who chose to come into collision with him and so in the present instance he formed a club of pigeonshooters and lent them his villa for their rendezvous and enjoyment the society was exquisite exclusive and greatly sought after and the fine ladies tempted of course by the beauty of the scene honored and inspired the competing confederates by their presence  the castle in the air was a colossal thatched cottage built by a favorite of king george iv it was full of mandarins and pagodas and green dragons and papered with birds of many colors and with vast tails the gardens were pretty and the grounds parklike with some noble cedars and some huge walnuttrees  the duke of brecon was rather below the middle size but he had a singularly athletic frame not devoid of symmetry his head was well placed on his broad shoulders and his mien was commanding he was narrowminded and prejudiced but acute and endowed with an unbending will he was an eminent sportsman and brave even to brutality his boast was that he had succeeded in every thing he had attempted and he would not admit the possibility of future failure though still a very young man he had won the derby training his own horse and he successfully managed a fine stud in defiance of the ring whom it was one of the secret objects of his life to extirpate though his manner to men was peremptory cold and hard he might be described as popular for there existed a superstitious belief in his judgment and it was known that in some instances when he had been consulted he had given more than advice it could not be said that he was beloved but he was feared and highly considered parasites were necessary to him though he despised them  the duke of brecon was an avowed admirer of lady corisande and was intimate with her family the duchess liked him much and was often seen at ball or assembly on his arm he had such excellent principles she said was so straightforward so true and firm it was whispered that even lady corisande had remarked that the duke of brecon was the only young man of the time who had character the truth is the duke though absolute and hard to men could be soft and deferential to women and such an exception to a general disposition has a charm it was said also that he had when requisite a bewitching smile  if there were any thing or any person in the world that st aldegonde hated more than another it was the duke of brecon why st aldegonde hated him was not very clear for they had never crossed each other nor were the reasons for his detestation which he occasionally gave entirely satisfactory sometimes it was because the duke drove piebalds sometimes because he had a large sum in the funds which st aldegonde thought disgraceful for a duke sometimes because he wore a particular hat though with respect to this last allegation it does not follow that st aldegonde was justified in his criticism for in all these matters st aldegonde was himself very deficient and had once strolled up st jamess street with his dishevelled looks crowned with a wideawake whatever might be the cause st aldegonde generally wound upi tell you what bertha if corisande marries that follow i have made up my mind to go to the indian ocean it is a country i never have seen and pinto tells me you cannot do it well under five years  i hope you will take me grenville with you said lady st aldegonde because it is highly probable corisande will marry the duke mamma you know likes him so much  why cannot corisande marry carisbrooke said st aldegonde pouting he is a really good fellow much betterlooking and so far as land is concerned which after all is the only thing has as large an estate as the duke  well these things depend a little upon taste said lady st aldegonde  no no said st aldegonde corisande must marry carisbrooke your father would not like my going to the indian archipelago and not returning for five years perhaps never returning why should corisande break up our societywhy are people so selfish i never could go to brentham again if the duke of brecon is always to be there giving his opinion and being what your mother calls straightforwardi hate a straightforward fellow as pinto says if every man were straightforward in his opinions there would be no conversation the fun of talk is to find out what a man really thinks then contrast it with the enormous lies he has been telling all dinner and perhaps all his life  it was a favorable day for the castle in the air enough but not too much sun and a gentle breeze some pretty feet not alone were sauntering in the gardens some pretty lips lingered in the rooms sipping tea but the mass of the fair visitors marvellously attired were assembled at the scene of action seated on chairs and in groups which assumed something of the form of an amphitheatre there were many gentlemen in attendance on them or independent spectators of the sport the field was large not less than forty competitors and comprising many of the best shots in england the struggle therefore was long and ably maintained but as the end approached it was evident that the contest would be between bertram lothair and the duke of brecon  lady st aldegonde and lady montairy were there and their unmarried sister the married sisters were highly excited in favor of their brother but lady corisande said nothing at last bertram missed a bird or rather his bird which he had hit escaped and fell beyond the enclosure lothair was more successful and it seemed that it might be a tie between him and the duke his grace when called advanced with confident composure and apparently killed both his birds when at this moment a dog rushed forward and chased one of the mortallystruck pigeons the bluerock which was content to die by the hand of a duke would not deign to be worried by a dog and it frantically moved its expiring wings scaled the paling and died so lothair won the prize  well said lady montairy to lothair as bertram was not to win i am glad it was you  and you will not congratulate me said lothair to lady corisande  she rather shook her head a tournament of doves she said i would rather see you all in the lists of ashby  lothair had to dine this day with one of the vanquished this was mr brancepeth celebrated for his dinners still more for his guests mr brancepeth was a grave young man it was supposed that he was always meditating over the arrangement of his menus or the skilful means by which he could assemble together the right persons to partake of them mr brancepeth had attained the highest celebrity in his peculiar career to dine with mr brancepeth was a social incident that was mentioned royalty had consecrated his banquets and a youth of note was scarcely a graduate of society who had not been his guest there was one person however who in this respect had not taken his degree and as always happens under such circumstances he was the individual on whom mr brancepeth was most desirous to confer it and this was st aldegonde in vain mr brancepeth had approached him with vast cards of invitation to hecatombs and with insinuating little notes to dinners sans fa on proposals which the presence of princes might almost construe into a command or the presence of some one even more attractive than princes must invest with irresistible charm it was all in vain not that i dislike brancepeth said st aldegonde i rather like him i like a man who can do only one thing but does that well but then i hate dinners  but the determined and the persevering need never despair of gaining their object in this world and this very day riding home from the castle in the air mr brancepeth overtook st aldegonde who was lounging about on a rough scandinavian cob as dishevelled as himself listless and groomless after riding together for twenty minutes st aldegonde informed mr brancepeth as was his general custom with his companions that he was bored to very extinction and that he did not know what he should do with himself for the rest of the day if i could only get pinto to go with me i think i would run down to the star and garter or perhaps to hampton court  you will not be able to get pinto today said mr brancepeth for he dines with me  what an unlucky fellow i am exclaimed st aldegonde entirely to himself i had made up my mind to dine with pinto today  and why should you not why not meet pinto at my house  well that is not my way said st aldegonde but not in a decided tone you know i do not like strangers and crowds of wineglasses and what is called all the delicacies of the season  you will meet no one that you do not know and like it is a little dinner i made for and he mentioned lothair  i like lothair said st aldegonde dreamily he is a nice boy  well you will have him and pinto to yourself  the large fish languidly rose and swallowed the bait and the exulting mr brancepeth cantered off to hill street to give the necessary instructions  mr pinto was one of the marvels of english society the most sought after of all its members though no one could tell you exactly why he was a little oily portuguese middleaged corpulent and somewhat bald with dark eyes of sympathy not unmixed with humor no one knew who he was and in a country the most scrutinizing as to personal details no one inquired or cared to know a quarter of a century ago an english noble had caught him in his travels and brought him young to england where he had always remained from the favorite of an individual he had become the oracle of a circle and then the idol of society all this time his manner remained unchanged he was never at any time either humble or pretentious instead of being a parasite everybody flattered him and instead of being a hangeron of society society hung on pinto  it must have been the combination of many pleasing qualities rather than the possession of any commanding one that created his influence he certainly was not a wit yet he was always gay and always said things that made other people merry his conversation was sparkling interesting and fluent yet it was observed he never gave an opinion on any subject and never told an anecdote indeed he would sometimes remark when a man fell into his anecdotage it was a sign for him to retire from the world and yet pinto rarely opened his mouth without everybody being stricken with mirth he had the art of viewing common things in a fanciful light and the rare gift of raillery which flattered the selflove of those whom it seemed sportively not to spare sometimes those who had passed a fascinating evening with pinto would try to remember on the morrow what he had said and could recall nothing he was not an intellectual croesus but his pockets were full of sixpences  one of the ingredients of his social spell was no doubt his manner which was tranquil even when he was droll he never laughed except with his eyes and delivered himself of his most eccentric fancies in an unctuous style he had a rare gift of mimicry which he used with extreme reserve and therefore was proportionately effective when displayed add to all this a sweet voice a soft hand and a disposition both soft and sweet like his own azores it was understood that pinto was easy in his circumstances though no one know where these circumstances were his equipage was worthy of his position and in his little house in may fair he sometimes gave a dinner to a fine lady who was as proud of the event as the queen of sheba of her visit to solomon the great  when st aldegonde arrived in hill street and slouched into the saloon with as uncouth and graceless a general mien as a handsome and naturally graceful man could contrive to present his keen though listless glance at once revealed to him that he was as he described it at dinner to hugo bohun in a social jungle in which there was a great herd of animals that he particularly disliked namely what he entitled swells the scowl on his distressed countenance at first intimated a retreat but after a survey courteous to his host and speaking kindly to lothair as he passed on he made a rush to mr pinto and cordially embracing him said mind we sit together  the dinner was not a failure though an exception to the polished ceremony of the normal brancepeth banquet the host headed his table with the duke of brecon on his right and lothair on his left hand and swells of calibre in their vicinity but st aldegonde sat far away next to mr pinto and hugo bohun on the other side of that gentleman hugo bohun loved swells but he loved st aldegonde more the general conversation in the neighborhood of mr brancepeth did not flag they talked of the sport of the morning and then by association of ideas of every other sport and then from the sports of england they ranged to the sports of every other country there were several there who had caught salmon in norway and killed tigers in bengal and visited those countries only for that purpose and then they talked of horses and then they talked of women  lothair was rather silent for in this society of ancients the youngest of whom was perhaps not less than fiveandtwenty and some with nearly a lustre added to that mature period he felt the awkward modesty of a freshman the duke of brecon talked much but never at length he decided every thing at least to his own satisfaction and if his opinion were challenged remained unshaken and did not conceal it  all this time a different scene was enacting at the other end of the table st aldegonde with his back turned to his other neighbor hung upon the accents of mr pinto and hugo bohun imitated st aldegonde what mr pinto said or was saying was quite inaudible for he always spoke low and in the present case he was invisible like an ortolan smothered in vineleaves but every now and then st aldegonde broke into a frightful shout and hugo bohun tittered immensely then st aldegonde throwing himself back in his chair and talking to himself or the ceiling would exclaim best thing i ever heard while hugo nodded sympathy with a beaming smile  the swells now and then paused in their conversation and glanced at the scene of disturbance  they seem highly amused there said mr brancepeth i wish they would pass it on  i think st aldegonde said the duke of brecon is the least conventional man of my acquaintance  notwithstanding this stern sneer a practiced general like mr brancepeth felt he had won the day all his guests would disperse and tell the world that they had dined with him and met st aldegonde and tomorrow there would be a blazoned paragraph in the journals commemorating the event and written as if by a herald what did a little disturb his hospitable mind was that st aldegonde literally tasted nothing he did not care so much for his occasionally leaning on the table with both his elbows but that he should pass by every dish was distressing so mr brancepeth whispered to his own valeta fine gentleman who stood by his masters chair and attended on no one else except when requisite his masters immediate neighborand desired him to suggest to st aldegonde whether the sidetable might not provide under the difficulties some sustenance st aldegonde seemed quite gratified by the attention and said he should like to have some cold meat now that was the only thing the sidetable bounteous as was its disposition could not provide all the joints of the season were named in vain and pies and preparations of many climes but nothing would satisfy st aldegonde but cold meat  well now i shall begin my dinner he said to pinto when he was at length served what surprises me most in you is your english there is not a man who speaks such good english as you do  english is an expressive language said mr pinto but not difficult to master its range is limited it consists as far as i can observe of four words nice jolly charming and bore and some grammarians add fond  when the guests rose and returned to the saloon st aldegonde was in high spirits and talked to every one even to the duke of brecon whom he considerately reminded of his defeat in the morning adding that from what he had seen of his graces guns he had no opinion of them and that he did not believe that breechloaders suited pigeonshooting  finally when he bade farewell to his host st aldegonde assured him that he never in his life made so good a dinner and that pinto had never been so rich  when the party broke up the majority of the guests went sooner or later to a ball that was given this evening by lady st jerome others who never went to balls looked forward with refined satisfaction to a night of unbroken tobacco st aldegonde went to play whist at the house of a lady who lived out of town i like the drive home he said the morning air is so refreshing when one has lost ones money  a ball at st jerome house was a rare event but one highly appreciated it was a grand mansion with a real suite of state apartments including a genuine ballroom in the venetian style and lighted with chandeliers of rockcrystal lady st jerome was a woman of taste and splendor and romance who could do justice to the scene and occasion even lord st jerome quiet as he seemed in these matters was popular with young men it was known that lord st jerome gave at his ball suppers the same champagne that he gave at his dinners and that was of the highest class in short a patriot we talk with wondering execration of the great poisoners of past ages the borgias the inventor of aqua tofana and the amiable marchioness de brinvilliers but pinto was of opinion that there were more social poisoners about in the present day than in the darkest and the most demoralized periods and then none of them are punished which is so strange he would add as they are all found out  lady st jerome received lothair as pinto said with extreme unction she looked in his eyes she retained his hand she said that what she had heard had made her so happy and then when he was retiring she beckoned him back and said she must have some tea and taking his arm they walked away together i have so much to tell you she said and every thing is so interesting i think we are on the eve of great events the monsignore told me your heart was with us it must be they are your own thoughts your own wishes we are realizing your own ideal i think next sunday will be remembered as a great day in english history the commencement of a movement that may save every thing the monsignore i know has told you all  not exactly the oxford visit had deranged a little the plans of the monsignore but he had partially communicated the vast scheme it seems there was a new society to be instituted for the restoration of christendom the change of name from christendom to europe had proved a failure and a disastrous one and what wonder said lady st jerome europe is not even a quarter of the globe as the philosophers pretended it was there is already a fifth division and probably there will be many more as the philosophers announce it impossible the cardinal was to inaugurate the institution on sunday next at the jesuits church by one of his celebrated sermons it was to be a function of the highest class all the faithful of consideration were to attend but the attendance was not to be limited to the faithful every sincere adherent of church principles who was in a state of prayer and preparation was solicited to be present and join in the holy and common work of restoring to the divine master his kingdom upon earth with its rightful name  it was a brilliant ball all the nice people in london were there all the young men who now will never go to balls were present this was from respect to the high character of lord st jerome clare arundel looked divine dressed in a wondrous white robe garlanded with violets just arrived from paris a present from her godmother the duchess of lorrainsehulenbourg on her head a violetwreath deep and radiant as her eyes and which admirably contrasted with her dark goldenbrown hair  lothair danced with her and never admired her more her manner toward him was changed it was attractive even alluring she smiled on him she addressed him in tones of sympathy even of tenderness she seemed interested in all he was doing she flattered him by a mode which is said to be irresistible to a man by talking only of himself when the dance had finished he offered to attend her to the tearoom she accepted the invitation even with cordiality  i think i must have some tea she said and i like to go with my kinsman  just before supper was announced lady st jerome told lothair to his surprise that he was to attend miss arundel to the great ceremony it is clares ball said lady st jerome given in her honor and you are to take care of her  i am more than honored said lothair but does miss arundel wish it for to tell you the truth i thought i had rather abused her indulgence this evening  of course she wishes it said lady st jerome who should lead her out on such an occasionher own ballthan the nearest and dearest relation she has in the world except ourselves  lothair made no reply to this unanswerable logic but was as surprised as he was gratified he recalled the hour when the kinship was at the best but coldly recognized the inscrutable haughtiness even distrust with which miss arundel listened to the exposition of his views and feelings and the contrast which her past mood presented to her present brilliant sympathy and cordial greeting but he yielded to the magic of the flowing hour miss arundel seemed indeed quite a changed being tonight full of vivacity fancy feelingalmost fun she was witty and humorous and joyous and fascinating as he fed her with cates as delicate as her lips and manufactured for her dainty beverages which would not outrage their purity lothair at last could not refrain from intimating his sense of her unusual but charming joyousness  no she said turning round with animation my natural disposition always repressed because i have felt overwhelmed by the desolation of the world but now i have hope i have more than hope i have joy i feel sure this idea of the restoration of christendom comes from heaven it has restored me to myself and has given me a sense of happiness in this life which i never could contemplate but what is the climax of my joy is that you after all my own blood and one in whose career i have ever felt the deepest interest should be ordained to lay as it were the first stone of this temple of divine love  it was break of day when lothair jumped into his brougham thank heaves he exclaimed it is at last friday    chapter 29   there is something very pleasant in a summer suburban ride in the valley of the thames london transforms itself into bustling knightsbridge and airy brompton brightly and gracefully lingers cheerfully in the long miscellaneous wellwatered kingsroad and only says farewell when you come to an abounding river and a picturesque bridge the boats were bright upon the waters when lothair crossed it and his dark chestnut barb proud of its resplendent form curveted with joy when it reached a green common studded occasionally with a group of pines and well bedecked with gorse after this he pursued the public road for a couple of miles until he observed on his left hand a gate on which was written private road and here he stopped the gate was locked but when lothair assured the keeper that he was about to visit belmont he was permitted to enter  he entered a green and winding lane fringed with tall elms and dim with fragrant shade and after proceeding about half a mile came to a long lowbuilt lodge with a thatched and shelving roof and surrounded by a rustic colonnade covered with honeysuckle passing through the gate at hand he found himself in a road winding through gentlyundulating banks of exquisite turf studded with rare shrubs and occasionally rarer trees suddenly the confined scene expanded wide lawns spread out before him shadowed with the dark forms of many huge cedars and blazing with flowerbeds of every hue the house was also apparent a stately mansion of hewn stone with wings and a portico of corinthian columns and backed by deep woods  this was belmont built by a favorite minister of state to whom a grateful and gracious sovereign had granted a slice of a royal park whereon to raise a palace and a garden and find occasionally tusculan repose  the lady of the mansion was at home and though lothair was quite prepared for this his heart beat the inner hall was of noble proportion and there were ranged in it many roman busts and some ancient slabs and altars of marble these had been collected some century ago by the minister but what immediately struck the eye of lothair were two statues by an american artist and both of fame the sybil and the cleopatra he had heard of these but had never seen them and could not refrain from lingering a moment to gaze upon their mystical and fascinating beauty  he proceeded through two spacious and lofty chambers of which it was evident the furniture was new it was luxurious and rich and full of taste but there was no attempt to recall the past in the details no cabinets and clocks of french kings or tables of french queens no chairs of venetian senators no candelabra that had illumined doges of genoa no ancient porcelain of rare schools and ivory carvings and choice enamels the walls were hung with masterpieces of modern art chiefly of the french school ingres and delaroche and scheffer  the last saloon led into a room of smaller dimensions opening on the garden and which lothair at first thought must be a fernery it seemed so full of choice and expanding specimens of that beautiful and multiform plant but when his eye had become a little accustomed to the scene and to the order of the groups he perceived they were only the refreshing and profuse ornaments of a regularly furnished and inhabited apartment in its centre was a table covered with writingmaterials and books and some music there was a chair before the table so placed as if some one had only recently quitted it a book was open but turned upon its face with an ivory cutter by its side it would seem that the dweller in the chamber might not be far distant the servant invited lothair to be seated and saying that mrs campian must be in the garden proceeded to inform his mistress of the arrival of a guest  the room opened on a terrace adorned with statues and orangetrees and descending gently into a garden in the italian style in the centre of which was a marble fountain of many figures the grounds were not extensive but they were only separated from the royal park by a wire fence so that the scene seemed alike rich and illimitable on the boundary was a summerhouse in the shape of a classic temple one of those pavilions of pleasure which nobles loved to raise in the last century  as lothair beheld the scene with gratification the servant reappeared on the step of the terrace and invited him to descend guiding him through the garden the servant retired as lothair recognized mrs campian approaching them  she gave her hand to lothair and welcomed him cordially but with serenity they mutually exchanged hopes that their return to town had been agreeable lothair could not refrain from expressing how pleased he was with belmont  i am glad you approve of our hired home said theodora i think we were fortunate in finding one that suits our tastes and habits we love pictures and statues and trees and flowers and yet we love our friends and our friends are people who live in cities  i think i saw two statues today of which i have often heard said lothair  the sibyl and cleopatra yes colonel campian is rather proud of possessing them he collects only modern art for which i believe there is a great future though some of our friends think it is yet in its cradle  i am very sorry to say said lothair that i know very little about art or indeed any thing else but i admire what is beautiful i know something about architecture at least church architecture  well religion has produced some of our finest buildings said theodora there is no question of that and as long as they are adapted to what takes place in them they are admirable the fault i find in modern churches in this country is that there is little relation between the ceremonies and the structure nobody seems now conscious that every true architectural form has a purpose but i think the climax of confused ideas is capped when dissenting chapels are built like cathedrals  ah to build a cathedral exclaimed lothair that is a great enterprise i wish i might show you some day some drawings i have of a projected cathedral  a projected cathedral said theodora well i must confess to you i never could comprehend the idea of a protestant cathedral  but i am not quite sure said lothair blushing and agitated that it will be a protestant cathedral i have not made up my mind about that  theodora glanced at him unobserved with her wonderful gray eyes a sort of supernatural light seemed to shoot from beneath their long dark lashes and read his inmost nature they were all this time returning as she had suggested to the house rather suddenly she said bytheby as you are so fond of art i ought to have asked you whether you would like to see a work by the sculptor of cleopatra which arrived when we were at oxford we have placed it on a pedestal in the temple it is the genius of freedom i may say i was assisting at its inauguration when your name was announced to me  lothair caught at this proposal and they turned and approached the temple some workmen were leaving the building as they entered and one or two lingered  upon a pedestal of porphyry rose the statue of a female in marble though veiled with drapery which might have become the goddess of modesty admirable art permitted the contour of the perfect form to be traced the feet were without sandals and the undulating breadth of one shoulder where the drapery was festooned remained uncovered one expected with such a shape some divine visage that was not wanting but humanity was asserted in the transcendent brow which beamed with sublime thought and profound enthusiasm  some would have sighed that such beings could only be pictured in a poets or an artists dream but lothair felt that what he beheld with rapture was no ideal creation and that he was in the presence of the inspiring original  it is too like he murmured  it is the most successful recurrence to the true principles of art in modern sculpture said a gentleman on his right hand  this person was a young man though more than ten years older than lothair his appearance was striking above the middle height his form athletic though lithe and symmetrical was crowned by a countenance aquiline but delicate and from many circumstances of a remarkable radiancy the lustre of his complexion the fire of his eye and his chestnut hair in profuse curls contributed much to this dazzling effect a thick but small mustache did not conceal his curved lip or the scornful pride of his distended nostril and his beard close but not long did not veil the singular beauty of his mouth it was an arrogant face daring and vivacious yet weighted with an expression of deep and haughty thought  the costume of this gentleman was rich and picturesque such extravagance of form and color is sometimes encountered in the adventurous toilet of a country house but rarely experienced in what might still be looked upon as a morning visit in the metropolis  you know mr phoebus asked a low clear voice and turning round lothair was presented to a person so famous that even lothair had heard of him  mr phoebus was the most successful not to say the most eminent painter of the age he was the descendant of a noble family of gascony that had emigrated to england from france in the reign of louis xiv unquestionably they had mixed their blood frequently during the interval and the vicissitudes of their various life but in gaston phoebus nature as is sometimes her wont had chosen to reproduce exactly the original type he was the gascon noble of the sixteenth century with all his brilliancy bravery and boastfulness equally vain arrogant and eccentric accomplished in all the daring or the graceful pursuits of man yet nursed in the philosophy of our times  it is presumption in my talking about such things said lothair but might i venture to ask what you may consider the true principles of art  aryan principles said mr phoebus not merely the study of nature but of beautiful nature the art of design in a country inhabited by a firstrate race and where the laws the manners the customs are calculated to maintain the health and beauty of a firstrate race in a greater or less degree these conditions obtained from the age of pericles to the age of hadrian in pure aryan communities but semitism began then to prevail and ultimately triumphed semitism has destroyed art it taught man to despise his own body and the essence of art is to honor the human frame  i am afraid i ought not to talk about such things said lothair but if by semitism you mean religion surely the italian painters inspired by semitism did something  great things said mr phoebussome of the greatest semitism gave them subjects but the renaissance gave them aryan art and it gave that art to a purely aryan race but semitism rallied in the shape of the reformation and swept all away when leo the tenth was pope popery was pagan popery is now christian and art is extinct  i cannot enter into such controversies said lothair every day i feel more and more i am extremely ignorant  do not regret it said mr phoebus what you call ignorance is your strength by ignorance you mean a want of knowledge of books books are fatal they are the curse of the human race ninetenths of existing books are nonsense and the clever books are the refutation of that nonsense the greatest misfortune that ever befell man was the invention of printing printing has destroyed education art is a great thing and science is a great thing but all that art and science can reveal can be taught by man and by his attributeshis voice his hand his eye the essence of education is the education of the body beauty and health are the chief sources of happiness men should live in the air their exercises should be regular varied scientific to render his body strong and supple is the first duty of man he should develop and completely master the whole muscular system what i admire in the order to which you belong is that they do live in the air that they excel in athletic sports that they can only speak one language and that they never read this is not a complete education but it is the highest education since the greek  what you say i feel encouraging said lothair repressing a smile for i myself live very much in the air and am fond of all sports but i confess i am often ashamed of being so poor a linguist and was seriously thinking that i ought to read  no doubt every man should combine an intellectual with a physical training replied mr phoebus but the popular conception of the means is radically wrong youth should attend lectures on art and science by the most illustrious professors and should converse together afterward on what they have heard they should learn to talk it is a rare accomplishment and extremely healthy they should have music always at their meals the theatre entirely remodelled and reformed and under a minister of state should be an important element of education i should not object to the recitation of lyric poetry that is enough i would not have a book in the house or even see a newspaper  these are aryan principles said lothair  they are said mr phoebus and of such principles i believe a great revival is at hand we shall both live to see another renaissance  and our artist here said lothair pointing to the statue you are of opinion that he is asserting these principles  yes because he has produced the aryan form by studying the aryan form phidias never had a finer model and he has not been unequal to it  i fancied said lothair in a lower and inquiring tone though mrs campian had some time before glided out of the pavilion and was giving directions to the workmeni fancied i had heard that mrs campian was a roman  the romans were greeks said mr phoebus and in this instance the phidian type came out it has not been thrown away i believe theodora has inspired as many painters and sculptors as any aryan goddess i look upon her as such for i know nothing more divine  i fear the phidian type is very rare said lothair  in nature and in art there must always be surpassing instances said mr phoebus it is a law and a wise one but depend upon it so strong and perfect a type as the original aryan must be yet abundant among the millions and may be developed but for this you want great changes in your laws it is the first duty of a state to attend to the frame and health of the subject the spartans understood this they permitted no marriage the probable consequences of which might be a feeble progeny they even took measures to secure a vigorous one the romans doomed the deformed to immediate destruction the union of the races concerns the welfare of the commonwealth much too nearly to be intrusted to individual arrangement the fate of a nation will ultimately depend upon the strength and health of the population both france and england should look to this they have cause as for our mighty engines of war in the hands of a puny race it will be the old story of the lower empire and the greek fire laws should be passed to secure all this and some day they will be but nothing can be done until the aryan races are extricated from semitism    chapter 30   lothair returned to town in a not altogether satisfactory state of mind he was not serene or content on the contrary he was rather agitated and perplexed he could not say he regretted his visit he had seen her and he had seen her to great advantage he had seen much too that was pleasing and had heard also many things that if not pleasing were certainly full of interest and yet when he cantered back over the common the world somehow did not seem to him so bright and exhilarating as in the ambling morn was it because she was not alone and yet why should he expect she should be alone she had many friends and she was as accessible to them as to himself and yet a conversation with her as in the gardens of blenheim would have been delightful and he had rather counted on it nevertheless it was a great thing to know men like mr phoebus and hear their views on the nature of things lothair was very young and was more thoughtful than studious his education hitherto had been according to mr phoebus on the right principle and chiefly in the open air but he was intelligent and susceptible and in the atmosphere of oxford now stirred with many thoughts he had imbibed some particles of knowledge respecting the primeval races which had permitted him to follow the conversation of mr phoebus not absolutely in a state of hopeless perplexity he determined to confer with father coleman on the aryan race and the genius of semitism as he returned through the park he observed the duchess and lady corisande in their barouche resting for a moment in the shade with lord carisbrooke on one side and the duke of brecon on the other  as he was dressing for dinner constantly brooding on one thought the cause of his feeling of disappointment occurred to him he had hoped in this visit to have established some basis of intimacy and to have ascertained his prospect and his means of occasionally seeing her but he had done nothing of the kind he could not well call again at belmont under a week but even then mr phoebus or some one else might be there the world seemed dark he wished he had never gone to oxford however a man may plan his life he is the creature of circumstances the unforeseen happens and upsets every thing we are mere puppets  he sat next to an agreeable woman at dinner who gave him an interesting account of a new singer she had heard the night before at the operaa fair scandinavian fresh as a lily and sweet as a nightingale  i was resolved to go and hear her said the lady my sister feodore at paris had written to me so much about her do you know i have never been to the opera for an age that alone was quite a treat to me i never go to the opera nor to the play nor to any thing else society has become so large and so exacting that i have found out one never gets any amusement  do you know i never was at the opera said lothair  i am not at all surprised and when you gowhich i suppose you will some daywhat will most strike you is that you will not see a single person you ever saw in your life  strange  yes it shows what a mass of wealth and taste and refinement there is in this wonderful metropolis of ours quite irrespective of the circles in which we move and which we once thought entirely engrossed them  after the ladies had retired bertram who dined at the same house moved up to him and hugo bohun came over and took the vacant seat on his other side  what have you been doing with yourself said hugo we have not seen you for a week  i went down to oxford about some horses said lothair  fancy going down to oxford about some horses in the heart of the season said hugo i believe you are selling us and that as the scorpion announces you are going to be married  to whom said lothair  ah that is the point it is a dark horse at present and we want you to tell us  why do not you marry hugo said bertram  i respect the institution said hugo which is admitting something in these days and i have always thought that every woman should marry and no man  it makes a woman and it mars a man you think said lothair  but i do not exactly see how your view would work practically said bertram  well my view is a social problem said hugo and social problems are the fashion at present it would be solved through the exceptions which prove the principle in the first place there are your swells who cannot avoid the halteryou are booked when you are born and then there are moderate men like myself who have their weak moments i would not answer for myself if i could find an affectionate family with good shooting and firstrate claret  there must be many families with such conditions said lothair  hugo shook his head you try sometimes the wine is good and the shooting bad sometimes the reverse sometimes both are excellent but then the tempers and the manners are equally bad  i vote we three do something tomorrow said bertram  what shall it be said hugo  i vote we row down to richmond at sunset and dine and then drive our teams up by moonlight what say you lothair  i cannot i am engaged i am engaged to go to the opera  fancy going to the opera in this sweltering weather exclaimed bertram  he must be going to be married said hugo  and yet on the following evening though the weather was quite as sultry and he was not going to be married to the opera lothair went while the agreeable lady the day before was dilating at dinner on this once famous entertainment lothair remembered that a certain person went there every saturday evening and he resolved that he should at least have the satisfaction of seeing her  it was altogether a new scene for lothair and being much affected by music he found the general influence so fascinating that some little time elapsed before he was sufficiently master of himself to recur to the principal purpose of his presence his box was on the first tier where he could observe very generally and yet himself be sufficiently screened as an astronomer surveys the starry heavens until his searching sight reaches the desired planet so lothairs scrutinizing vision wandered till his eye at length lighted on the wishedfor orb in the circle above his own opposite to him but nearer the stage he recognized the campians she had a star upon her forehead as when he first met her some six months ago it seemed an age  now what should he do he was quite unlearned in the social habits of an operahouse he was not aware that he had the privilege of paying the lady a visit in her box and had he been so he was really so shy in little things that he never could have summoned resolution to open the door of his own box and request an attendant to show him that of mrs campian he had contrived to get to the opera for the first time in his life and the effort seemed to have exhausted his social enterprise so h remained still with his glass fixed very constantly on mrs campian and occasionally giving himself up to the scene the performance did not sustain the first impression there were rival primadonnas and they indulged in competitive screams the choruses were coarse and the orchestra much too noisy but the audience were absorbed or enthusiastic we may be a musical nation but our taste would seem to require some refinement  there was a stir in mrs campians box a gentleman entered and seated himself lothair concluded he was an invited guest and envied him in about a quarter of an hour the gentleman bowed and retired and another person came in and one whom lothair recognized as a young man who had been sitting during the first act in a stall beneath him the system of paying visits at the opera then flashed upon his intelligence as some discovery in science upon a painful observer why should he not pay a visit too but how to do it at last he was bold enough to open the door of his own box and go forth but he could find no attendant and some persons passing his open door and nearly appropriating his lodge in a fit of that nervous embarrassment which attends inexperience in little things he secured his rights by returning baffled to his post  there had been a change in mrs campians box in the interval colonel campian had quitted it and mr phoebus occupied his place whether it were disappointment at his own failure or some other cause lothair felt annoyed he was hot and cold by turns felt awkward and blundering fancied people were looking at him that in some inexplicable sense he was ridiculous wished he had never gone to the opera  as time and considerable time elapsed he became even miserable mr phoebus never moved and mrs campian frequently conversed with him more than one visitor had in the interval paid their respects to the lady but mr phoebus never moved they did not stay perhaps because mr phoebus never moved  lothair never liked that fellow from the first sympathy and antipathy share our being as day and darkness share our lives lothair had felt an antipathy for mr phoebus the moment he saw him he had arrived at belmont yesterday before lothair and he had outstayed him these might be arian principles but they were not the principles of goodbreeding  lothair determined to go home and never to come to the opera again he opened the door of his box with firmness and slammed it with courage he had quite lost his shyness was indeed ready to run a muck with any one who crossed him the slamming of the door summoned a scudding attendant from a distant post who with breathless devotion inquired whether lothair wanted any thing  yes i want you to show me the way to mrs campians box  tier above no 22 said the boxkeeper  ay ay but conduct me to it said lothair and he presented the man with an overpowering honorarium  certainly my lord said the attendant  he knows me thought lothair but it was not so when the british nation is at once grateful and enthusiastic they always call you my lord  but in his progress to no 22 tier above all his valor evaporated and when the boxdoor was opened he felt very much like a convict on the verge of execution he changed color his legs tottered his heart beat and he made his bow with a confused vision the serenity of theodora somewhat reassured him and he seated himself and even saluted mr phoebus  the conversation was vapid and conventionalremarks about the opera and its performerseven the heat of the weather was mentioned lothair had come and he had nothing to say mrs campian seemed much interested in the performance so if he had had any thing to say there was no opportunity of expressing it she had not appeared to be so engrossed with the music before his arrival in the mean time that phoebus would not move a quarter of an hour elapsed and that phoebus would not move lothair could not stand it any longer he rose and bowed  are you going said theodora colonel campian will be here in a moment he will be quite grieved not to see you  but lothair was inflexible perhaps she added we may see you tomorrow night  never said lothair to himself as he clinched his teeth my visit to belmont was my first and my last the dream is over  he hurried to a club in which he had been recently initiated and of which the chief purpose is to prove to mankind that night to a wise man has its resources as well as gaudy day here striplings mature their minds in the mysteries of whist and stimulate their intelligence by playing at stakes which would make their seniors look pale here matches are made and odds are settled and the cares or enterprises of life are soothed or stimulated by fragrant cheroots or beakers of badminton here in the society of the listless and freakish st aldegonde and hugo bohun and bertram and other congenial spirits lothair consigned to oblivion the rival churches of christendom the aryan race and the genius of semitism  it was an hour past dawn when he strolled home london is often beautiful in summer at that hour the architectural lines clear and defined in the smokeless atmosphere and ever and anon a fragrant gale from gardened balconies wafted in the blue air nothing is stirring except wagons of strawberries and asparagus and no one visible except a policeman or a member of parliament returning from a late division where they have settled some great question that need never have been asked eve has its spell of calmness and consolation but dawn brings hope and joy  but not to lothair young sanguine and susceptible he had for a moment yielded to the excitement of the recent scene but with his senses stilled by the morning air and free from the influence of bertrams ready sympathy and hugo bohuns gay comments on human life and all the wild and amusing caprice and daring wilfulness and grand affectation that distinguish and inspire a circle of patrician youth there came over him the consciousness that to him something dark had occurred something bitter and disappointing and humiliating and that the breaking morn would not bring to him a day so bright and hopeful as his former ones  at first he fell into profound slumber it was the inevitable result of the badminton and the late hour there was a certain degree of physical exhaustion which commanded repose but the slumber was not long and his first feeling for it could not be called thought was that some great misfortune had occurred to him and then the thought following the feeling brought up the form of the hated phoebus after that he had no real sleep but a sort of occasional and feverish doze with intervals of infinite distress waking always to a consciousness of inexpressible mortification and despair  about one oclock relinquishing all hope of real and refreshing slumber he rang his bell and his valet appearing informed him that father coleman had called and the monsignore had called and that now the cardinals secretary had just called but the valet had announced that his lord was indisposed there was also a letter from lady st jerome this news brought a new train of feeling lothair remembered that this was the day of the great ecclesiastical function under the personal auspices of the cardinal at which indeed lothair hid never positively promised to assist his presence at which he had sometimes thought they pressed unreasonably not to say even indelicately but at which he had perhaps led them not without cause to believe that he would be present of late the monsignore had assumed that lothair had promised to attend it  why should he not the world was all vanity never did he feel more convinced than at this moment of the truth of his conclusion that if religion were a real thing man should live for it alone but then came the question of the churches he could not bring himself without a pang to contemplate a secession from the church of his fathers he took refuge in the wild but beautiful thought of a reconciliation between rome and england if the consecration of the whole of his fortune to that end could assist in effecting the purpose he would cheerfully make the sacrifice he would then go on a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre and probably conclude his days in a hermitage on mount athos  in the mean time he rose and invigorated by his bath his thoughts became in a slight degree more mundane they recurred to the events of the last few days of his life but in a spirit of selfreproach and of conscious vanity and weakness why he had not known her a week this was sunday morning and last sunday he had attended st marys and offered up his earnest supplications for the unity of christendom that was then his sovereign hope and thought singular that a casual acquaintance with a stranger a look a glance a word a nothing should have so disturbed his spirit and distracted his mind  and yet  and then he fell into an easychair with a hairbrush in either hand and conjured up in reverie all that had passed since that wondrous morn when he addressed her by the roadside until the last dark hour when they partedand forever there was not a word she had uttered to him or to any one else that he did not recall not a glance not a gestureher dress her countenance her voice her hair and what scenes had all this passed in what refined and stately loveliness blenheim and oxford and belmont they became her ah why could not life consist of the perpetual society of such delightful people in such delightful places  his valet entered and informed him that the monsignore had returned and would not be denied lothair roused himself from his delicious reverie and his countenance became anxious and disquieted he would have struggled against the intrusion and was murmuring resistance to his hopeless attendant who shook his head when the monsignore glided into the room without permission as the valet disappeared  it was a wonderful performance the monsignore had at the same time to make a reconnoissance and to take up a positionto find out what lothair intended to do and yet to act and speak as if he was acquainted with those intentions and was not only aware of but approved them he seemed hurried and yet tranquil almost breathless with solicitude and yet conscious of some satisfactory consummation his tones were at all times hushed but today he spoke in a whisper though a whisper of emphasis and the dark eyes of his delicate aristocratic visage peered into lothair even when he was making a remark which seemed to require no scrutiny  it is one of the most important days for england that have happened in our time said the monsignore lady st jerome thinks of nothing else all our nobility will be therethe best blood in englandand some others who sympathize with the unity of the church the real question nothing has ever gratified the cardinal more than your intended presence he sent to you this morning he would have called himself bat he has much to go through today his eminence said to me it is exactly what i want whatever way be our differences and they are really slight what i want is to show to the world that the sons of the church will unite for the cause of divine truth it is the only course that can save society when lady st jerome told him that you were coming this evening his eminence was so affected that  but i never said i was coming this evening said lothair rather dryly and resolved to struggle either to lady st jerome or to any one else i said i would think of it  but for a christian to think of duty is to perform it said the monsignore to be ignorant of a duty is a sin but to be aware of duty and not to fulfil it is heinous  but is it a duty said lothair rather doggedly  what to serve god and save society do you doubt it have you read the declaration of geneva they have declared war against the church the state and the domestic principle all the great truths and laws on which the family reposes are denounced have you seen garibaldis letter when it was read and spoke of the religion of god being propagated throughout the world there was a universal cry of no no no religion but the religion of god was soon so explained as to allay all their fears it is the religion of science instead of adam our ancestry is traced to the most grotesque of creatures thought is phosphorus the soul complex nerves and our moral sense a secretion of sugar do you want these views in england rest assured they are coming and how are we to contend against them only by divine truth and where is divine truth in the church of christin the gospel of order peace and purity  lothair rose and paced the room with his eyes on the ground  i wish i had been born in the middle ages he exclaimed or on the shores of the sea of galilee or in some other planet anywhere or at any time but in this country and in this age  that thought is not worthy of you my lord said catesby it is a great privilege to live in this country and in this age it is a great privilege in the mighty contest between the good and the evil principle to combat for the righteous they stand face to face now as they have stood before there is christianity which by revealing the truth has limited the license of human reason there is that human reason which resists revelation as a bondagewhich insists upon being atheistical or polytheistical or pantheisticalwhich looks upon the requirements of obedience justice truth and purity as limitations of human freedom it is to the church that god has committed the custody and execution of his truth and law the church as witness teacher and judge contradicts and offends the spirit of license to the quick this is why it is hated this is why it is to be destroyed and why they are preparing a future of rebellion tyranny falsehood and degrading debauchery the church alone can save us and you are asked to supplicate the almighty tonight under circumstances of deep hope to favor the union of churchmen and save the human race from the impending deluge  lothair threw himself again into his seat and sighed i am rather indisposed today my dear monsignore which is unusual with me and scarcely equal to such a theme doubtless of the deepest interest to me and to all i myself wish as you well know that all mankind were praying under the same roof i shall continue in seclusion this morning perhaps you will permit me to think over what you have said with so much beauty and force  i had forgotten that i had a letter to deliver to you said catesby and he drew from his breastpocket a note which he handed to lothair who opened it quite unconscious of the piercing and even excited observation of his companion  lothair read the letter with a changing countenance and then he read it again and blushed deeply the letter was from miss arundel after a slight pause without looking up he said nine oclock is the hour i believe  yes said the monsignore rather eagerly but were i you i would be earlier than that i would order my carnage at eight if you will permit me i will order it for you you are not quite well it will save you some little trouble people coming into the room and all that and the cardinal will be there by eight oclock  thank you said lothair have the kindness then my dear monsignore to order my brougham for me at halfpast eight and just say that i can see no one adieu  and the priest glided away  lothair remained the whole morning in a most troubled state pacing his rooms leaning sometimes with his arm upon the mantelpiece and his face buried in his arm and often he sighed about halfpast five he rang for his valet and dressed and in another hour he broke his fasta little soup a cutlet and a glass or two of claret and then he looked at his watch and he looked at his watch every five minutes for the next hour  he was in deep reverie when the servant announced that his carriage was ready he started as from a dream then pressed his hand to his eyes and kept it there for some moments and then exclaiming jacta est alea he descended the stairs  where to my lord inquired the servant when he had entered the carriage  lothair seemed to hesitate and then he said to belmont    chapter 31   belmont is the only house i know that is properly lighted said mr phoebus and he looked with complacent criticism round the brilliant saloons i would not visit any one who had gas in his house but even in palaces i find lampsit is too dreadful when they came here first there was an immense chandelier suspended in each of these rooms pulling down the ceilings dwarfing the apartments leaving the guests all in darkness and throwing all the light on the roof the chandelier is the great abomination of furniture it makes a noble apartment look small and then they say you cannot light rooms without chandeliers look at theseneed any thing be more brilliant and all the light in the right placeon those who are in the chamber all light should come from the side of a room and if you choose to have candelabra like these you can always secure sufficient  theodora was seated on a sofa in conversation with a lady of distinguished mien and with the countenance of a roman empress there were various groups in the room standing or seated colonel campian was attending a lady to the piano where a celebrity presided a gentleman with cropped head and a long black beard the lady was of extraordinary beautyone of those faces one encounters in asia minor rich glowing with dark fringed eyes of tremulous lustre a figure scarcely less striking of voluptuous symmetry her toilet was exquisiteperhaps a little too splendid for the occasion but abstractedly of fine tasteand she held as she sang a vast bouquet entirely of white stoveflowers the voice was as sweet as the stephanopolis and the execution faultless it seemed the perfection of chambersingingno shrieks and no screams none of those agonizing experiments which result from the fatal competition of rival primadonnas  she was singing when lothair was ushered in theodora rose and greeted him with friendliness her glance was that of gratification at his arrival but the performance prevented any conversation save a few kind remarks interchanged in a hashed tone colonel campian came up he seemed quite delighted at renewing his acquaintance with lothair and began to talk rather too loudly which made some of the gentlemen near the piano turn round with glances of wondering reproach this embarrassed his newlyarrived guest who in his distress caught the bow of a lady who recognized him and whom he instantly remembered as mrs putney giles there was a vacant chair by her side and he was glad to occupy it  who is that lady inquired lothair of his companion when the singing ceased  that is madame phoebus said mrs giles  madame phoebus exclaimed lothair with an unconscious feeling of some relief she is a very beautiful woman who was she  she is a cantacuzene a daughter of the famous greek merchant the cantcuzenes you know are great people descendants of the greek emperors her uncle is prince of samos mr cantacuzene was very much opposed to the match but i think quite wrong mr phoebus is a most distinguished man and the alliance is of the happiest never was such mutual devotion  i am not surprised said lothair wonderfully relieved  her sister euphrosyne is in the room continued mrs giles the most extraordinary resemblance to her there is just the difference between the matron and the maiden that is all they are nearly of the same age and before the marriage might have been mistaken for each other the most charming thing in the world is to hear the two sisters sing together i hope they may tonight i know the family very well it was mrs cantacuzene who introduced me to theodora you know it is quite en r gle to call her theodora all the men call her theodora the divine theodora is i believe the right thing  and do you call her theodora asked lothair rather dryly  why no said mrs giles a little confused we are not intimate at least not very ms campian has been at my house and i have been here two et three times not so often as i could wish for mr giles you see does not like servants and horses to be used on sundaysand no more do iand on weekdays he is too much engaged or too tired to come out this distance so you see  the singing had ceased and theodora approached them addressing lothair she said the princess of tivoli wishes that you should be presented to her  the princess of tivoli was a roman dame of one of the most illustrious houses but who now lived at paris she had in her time taken an active part in italian politics and had sacrificed to the cause to which she was devoted the larger part of a large fortune what had been spared however permitted her to live in the french capital with elegance if not with splendor and her saloon was the gathering roof in paris of almost every one who was celebrated for genius or accomplishments though reputed to be haughty and capricious she entertained for theodora an even passionate friendship and now visited england only to see her  madame campian has been telling me of all the kind things you did for her at oxford said the princess some day you must show me oxford but it must be next year i very much admire the free university life tell me now at oxford you still have the protestant religion  lothair ventured to bow assent  ah that is well continued the princess i advise you to keep it if we had only had the protestant religion in italy things would have been very different you are fortunate in this country in having the protestant religion and a real nobility tell me now in your constitution if the father sits in the upper chamber the son sits in the lower housethat i know but is there any majorat at attached to his seat  not at present  you sit in the lower house of course  i am not old enough to sit in either house said lothair but when i am of age which i shall be when i have the honor of showing oxford to your highness i must sit in the upper house for i have not the blessing of a living father  ah that is a great thing in your country exclaimed the princess a man being his own master at so early an age  i thought it was a heritage of woe said lothair  no no said the princess the only tolerable thing in life is action and action is feeble without youth what if you do not obtain your immediate objectyou always think you will and the detail of the adventure is full of rapture and thus it is the blunders of youth are preferable to the triumphs of manhood or the successes of old age  well it will be a consolation for me to remember this when i am in a scrape said lothair  oh you have many many scrapes awaiting you said the princess you may look forward to at least ten years of blundersthat is illusionsthat is happiness fortunate young man  theodora had without appearing to intend it relinquished her seat to lothair who continued his conversation with the princess whom he liked but who he was sorry to hear was about to leave england and immediatelythat very night yes she said it is my last act of devotion you know in my country we have saints and shrines all italians they say are fond are superstitious my pilgrimage is to theodora i must come and worship her once a year  a gentleman bowed lowly to the princess who returned his salute with pleased alacrity do you know who that is said the princess to lothair that is baron gozelius one of our great reputations he must have just arrived ii will present you to him it is always agreeable to know a great man she addedat least goethe says so  the philosopher at her invitation took a chair opposite the sofa though a profound man he had all the vivacity and passion which are generally supposed to be peculiar to the superficial he had remarkable conversational power which he never spared lothair was captivated by his eloquence his striking observations his warmth and the flashing of his southern eye  baron gozelius agrees with your celebrated pastor dr cumming said theodora with a tinge of demure sarcasm and believes that the end of the world is at hand  and for the same reasons inquired lothair  not exactly said theodora but in this instance science and revelation have arrived at the same result and that is what all desire  all that i said was said gozelius that the action of the sun had become so irregular that i thought the chances were in favor of the destruction of our planet at least if i were a public office i would not insure it  yet the risk would not be very great under those circumstances said theodora  the destruction of this worlds foretold said lothair the stars are to fall from the sky but while i credit i cannot bring my mind to comprehend such a catastrophe  i have seen a world created and a world destroyed said gozelius the last was flickering ten years and it went out as i was watching it  and the first inquired lothair anxiously  disturbed space for half a centurya great pregnancy william herschel told me it would come when i was a boy and i cruised for it through twothirds of my life it came at last and it repaid me  there was a stir euphrosyne was going to sing with her sister they swept by lothair in their progress to the instrument like the passage of sultanas to some kiosk on the bosporus it seemed to him that he had never beheld any thing so resplendent the air was perfumed by their movement and the rustling of their wondrous robes they must be of the aryan race thought lothair though not of the phidian type they sang a greek air and their sweet and touching voices blended with exquisite harmony every one was silent in the room because every one was entranced then they gave their friends some patriotic lay which required chorus the sisters in turn singing a stanza mr phoebus arranged the chorus in a moment and there clustered round the piano al number of gentlemen almost as goodlooking and as picturesque as himself then while madame phoebus was singing euphrosyne suddenly and with quickness moved away and approached theodora and whispered something to her but theodora slightly shook her head and seemed to decline  euphrosyne regained the piano whispered something to colonel campian who was one of the chorus and then commenced her own part colonel campian crossed the room and spoke to theodora who instantly without the slightest demur joined her friends lothair felt agitated as he could not doubt theodora was going to sing and so it was when euphrosyne had finished and the chorus she had inspired had died away there rose a deep contralto sound which though without effort seemed to lothair the most thrilling tone he had ever listened to deeper and richer and richer and deeper it seemed to become as it wound with exquisite facility through a symphony of delicious sound until it ended in a passionate burst which made lothairs heart beat so tumultuously that for a moment he thought he should be overpowered  i never heard any thing so fine in my life said lothair to the french philosopher  ah if you had heard that woman sing the marseillaise as i did once to three thousand people then you would know what was fine not one of us who would not have died on the spot for her  the concert was over the princess of tivoli had risen to say farewell she stood apart with theodora holding both her hands and speaking with earnestness then she pressed her lips to theodoras forehead and said adieu my best beloved the spring will return  the princess had disappeared and madame phoebus came up to say goodnight to her hostess  it is such a delicious night said theodora that i have ordered our strawberriesandcream on the terrace you must not go  and so she invited them all to the terrace there was not a breath of air the garden was flooded with moonlight in which the fountain glittered and the atmosphere was as sweet as it was warm  i think the moon will melt the ice tonight said theodora as she led madame phoebus to a table covered with that innocent refreshment in many forms and pyramids of strawberries and gentle drinks which the fancy of america could alone devise  i wonder we did not pass the whole evening on the terrace said lothair  one must sing in a room said euphrosyne or the nightingales would eclipse us  lothair looked quickly at the speaker and caught the glance of a peculiar countenancemockery blended with ionian splendor  i think strawberriesandcream the most popular of all food said madame phoebus as some touched her beautiful lips  yes and one is not ashamed of eating it said theodora  soon there was that stir which precedes the breaking up of an assembly mrs giles and some others had to return to town madame phoebus and euphrosyne were near neighbors at roehampton but their carriage had been for some time waiting mr phoebus did not accompany them he chose to walk home on such a night and descended into the garden with his remaining friends  they are going to smoke said theodora is it your habit  not yet  i do not dislike it in the air and at a distance but i banish them the terrace i think smoking must be a great consolation to a soldier and as she spoke she moved and without formally inviting him he found himself walking by her side  rather abruptly he said you wore last night at the opera the same ornament as on the first time i had the pleasure meeting you  she looked at him with a smile and a little surprised my solitary trinket i fear you will never see any other  but you do not despise trinkets said lothair  oh no they are very well once i was decked with jewels and ropes of pearls like titians queen of cyprus i sometimes regret my pearls there is a reserve about pearls which i likesomething soft and dim but they are all gone and i ought not to regret them for they went in a good cause i kept the star because it was given to me by a hero and once we flattered ourselves it was a symbol  i wish i were a hero said lothair  you may yet prove one  and if i do may i give you a star  if it be symbolical  but of what  of an heroic purpose  but what is an heroic purpose exclaimed lothair instead of being here tonight i ought perhaps to have been present at a religious function of the highest and deepest import which might have influenced my destiny and led to something heroic but my mind is uncertain and unsettled i speak to you without reserve for my heart always entirely opens to you and i have a sort of unlimited confidence in your judgment besides i have never forgotten what you said at oxford about religionthat you could not conceive society without religion it is what i feel myself and most strongly and yet there never was a period when religion was so assailed there is no doubt the atheists are bolder are more completely organized both as to intellectual and even physical force than ever was known i have heard that from the highest authority for my own part i think i am prepared to die for divine truth i have examined myself severely but i do not think i should falter indeed can there be for man a nobler duty than to be the champion of god but then the question of the churches interferes if there were only one church i could see my way without a church there can be no true religion because otherwise you have no security for the truth i am a member of the church of england and when i was at oxford i thought the anglican view might be sustained but of late i have given ray mind deeply to these matters for after all they are the only matters a man should think of and i confess to you the claim of rome to orthodoxy seems to me irresistible  you make no distinction then between religion and orthodoxy said theodora  certainly i make no difference  and yet what is orthodox at dover is not orthodox at calais or ostend i should be sorry to think that because there was no orthodoxy in belgium or france there was no religion  yes said lothair i think i see what you mean  then again if we go further continued theodora there is the whole of the east that certainly is not orthodox according to your views you may not agree with all or any of their opinions but you could scarcely maintain that as communities they are irreligious  well you could not certainly said lothair  so you see said theodora what is called orthodoxy has very little to do with religion and a person may be very religious without holding the same dogmas as yourself or as some think without holding any  according to you then said lothair the anglican view might be maintained  i do not know what the anglican view is said theodora i do not belong to the roman or to the anglican church  and yet you are very religious said lothair  i hope so i try to be so and when i fail in any duty it is not the fault of my religion i never deceive myself into that i know it is my own fault  there was a pause but they walked on the soft splendor of the scene and all its accessories the moonlight and the fragrance and the falling waters wonderfully bewitched the spirit of the young lothair  there is nothing i would not tell you he suddenly exclaimed turning to theodora and sometimes i think there is nothing you would not tell me tell me then i entreat you what is your religion  the true religion i think said theodora i worship in a church where i believe god dwells and dwells for my guidance and my goodmy conscience  your conscience may be divine said lothair and i believe it is but the consciences of other persons are not divine and what is to guide them and what is to prevent or to mitigate the evil they would perpetrate  i have never heard from priests said theodora any truth which my conscience had not revealed to me they use different language from what i use but i find after a time that we mean the thing what i call time they call eternity when they describe heaven they give a picture of earth and beings whom they style divine they invest with all the attributes of humanity  and yet is it not true said lothair that  but at this moment there were the sounds of merriment and of approaching footsteps the form of mr phoebus appeared ascending the steps of the terrace followed by others the smokers had fulfilled their task there were farewells and bows and goodnights lothair had to retire with the others and as he threw himself into his brougham he exclaimed i perceive that life is not so simple an affair as i once supposed    chapter 32   when the stranger who had proved so opportune an ally to lothair at the fenian meeting separated from his companion he proceeded in the direction of pentonville and after pursuing his way through a number of obscure streets but quiet decent and monotonous he stopped at a small house in a row of many residences yet all of them in form size color and general character so identical that the number on the door could alone assure the visitor that he was not in error when he sounded the knocker  ah is it you captain bruges said the smiling and blushing maiden who answered to his summons we have not seen you for a long time  well you look as kind and as pretty as ever jenny said the captain and how is my friend  well said the damsel and she shrugged her shoulders he mopes im very glad you have come back captain for he sees very few now and is always writing i cannot bear that writing if he would only go and take a good walk i am sure he would be better  there is something in that said captain bruges and is he at home and will he see me  oh he is always at home to you captain but i will just run up and tell him you are here you know it is long since we have seen you captaincoming on half a year i think  time flies jenny go my good girl and i will wait below  in the parlor if you please captain bruges it is to let now it is more than a mouth since the doctor left us that was a loss for as long as the doctor was here he always had some one to speak with  so captain bruges entered the little diningroom with its mahogany table and half a dozen chairs and cellaret and over the fireplace a portrait of garibaldi which had been left as a legacy to the landlady by her late lodger dr tresorio  the captain threw a quick glance at the print and then falling into reverie with his hands crossed behind him paced the little chamber and was soon lost in thoughts which made him unconscious how long had elapsed when the maiden summoned him  following her and ascending the staircase he was ushered into the front room of the first floor and there came forward to meet him a man rather below the middle height but of a symmetrical and imposing mien his face was grave not to say sad thought not time had partially silvered the clustering of his raven hair but intellectual power reigned in his wide brow while determination was the character of the rest of his countenance under great control yet apparently from the dark flashing of his eye not incompatible with fanaticism  general he exclaimed your presence always reanimates me i shall at least have some news on which i rely your visit is suddensudden things are often happy ones is there any thing stirring in the promised land speak speak you have a thousand things to say and i have a thousand ears  my dear mirandola replied the visitor i will take leave to call into council a friend whose presence is always profitable  so saying he took out a cigarcase and offered it to his companion  we have smoked together in palaces said mirandola accepting the proffer with a delicate white hand  but not these cigars replied the general they are superb my only reward for all my transatlantic work and sometimes i think a sufficient one  and jenny shall give us a capital cup of coffee said mirandola it is the only hospitality that i can offer my friends give me a light my general and now how are things  well at the first glance very bad the french have left rome and we are not in it  well that is an infamy not of today or yesterday replied mirandola though not less an infamy we talked over this six months ago when you were over here about something else and from that moment unto the present i have with unceasing effort labored to erase this stigma from the human consciousness but with no success men are changed public spirit is extinct the deeds of 48 are to the present generations as incomprehensible as the punic wars or the feats of marius against the cimbri what we want are the most natural things in the world and easy of attainment because they are natural we want our metropolis our native frontiers and true liberty instead of these we have compromises conventions provincial jealousies and french prefects it is disgusting heartrending sometimes i fear my own energies are waning my health is wretched writing and speaking are decidedly bad for me and i pass my life in writing and speaking toward evening i feel utterly exhausted and am sometimes which i thought i never could be the victim of despondency the loss of the doctor was a severe blow but they hurried him out of the place the man of paris would never rest till he was gone i was myself thinking of once more trying switzerland but the obstacles are great and in truth i was at the darkest moment when jenny brought me the light of your name  the general who had bivouacked on a group of small chairs his leg on one his elbow on another took his cigar from his mouth and delivered himself of a volume of smoke and then said dryly things may not be so bad as they seem comrade your efforts have not been without fruit i have traced them in many quarters and indeed it is about their possible consequences that i have come over to consult with you  idle words i know never escape those lips said mirandola speak on  well said the general you see that people are a little exhausted by the efforts of last year and it must be confessed that no slight results were accomplished the freedom of venice  a french intrigue exclaimed mirandola the freedom of venice is the price of the slavery of rome i heard of it with disgust  well we do not differ much on that head said the general i am not a roman as you are but i view rome with reference to the object of my life with feelings not less ardent and absorbing than yourself who would wish to see it again the empress of the world i am a soldier and love war and left to myself would care little perhaps for what form of government i combated provided the army was constituted on the principles of fraternity and equality but the passion of my life to which i have sacrificed military position and perhaps he added in a lower tone perhaps even military fame has been to destroy priestcraft and so long as the pope rules in rome it will be supreme  we have struck him down once said mirandola  and i hope we shall again and forever said the general and it is about that i would speak you are in error in supposing that your friends do not sympathize with you or that their answers are dilatory or evasive there is much astir the old spirit is not extinct but the difficulties are greater than in former days when we had only the austrians to encounter and we cannot afford to make another failure  there could be no failure if we were clear and determined there must be a hundred thousand men who would die for our metropolis our natural frontiers and true liberty the mass of the pseudoitalian army must be with us as for foreign interference its repetition seems to me impossible the brotherhood in the different countries if well guided could alone prevent it there should be at once a manifesto addressed to the peoples they have become absorbed in moneygrubbing and what they call industry the external life of a nation is its most important one a nation as an individual has duties to fulfil appointed by god and his moral law the individual toward his family his town his country the nation toward the country of countries humanitythe outward world i firmly believe that we fail and renounce the religious and divine element of our life whenever we betray or neglect those duties the internal activity of a nation is important and sacred because it prepares the instrument for its appointed task it is mere egotism if it converges toward itself degrading and doomed to expiationas will be the fate of this country in which we now dwell added mirandola in a hushed voice england had a mission it had belief and it had power it announced itself the representative of religious commercial and political freedom and yet when it came to action it allowed denmark to be crushed by austria and prussia and in the most nefarious transaction of modern times uttered the approving shriek of perish savoy  my dear mirandola said the general trimming his cigar there is no living man who appreciates your genius and your worth more than myself perhaps i might say there is no living man who has had equal opportunities of estimating them you formed the mind of our country you kindled and kept alive the sacred flame when all was gloom and all were without heart such prodigious devotion so much resource and pertinacity and patience such unbroken spirit were never before exhibited by man and whatever may be said by your enemies i know that in the greatest hour of action you proved equal to it and yet at this moment when your friends are again stirring and there is a hope of spring i am bound to tell you that there are only two persons in the world who can effect the revolution and you are not one of them  i am ardent my general perhaps too sanguine but i have no selflove at least none when the interests of the great cause are at stake tell me then their names and count if required on my cooperation  garibaldi and maryanne  a polchinello and a bayadere exclaimed mirandola and springing from his seat he impatiently paced the room  and yet continued the general calmly there is no manner of doubt that garibaldi is the only name that could collect ten thousand men at any given point in italy while in france though her influence is mythical the name of maryanne is a name of magic though never mentioned it is never forgotten and the slightest allusion to it among the initiated will open every heart there are more secret societies in france at this moment than at any period since 85 though you hear nothing of them and they believe in maryanne and in nothing else  you have been at caprera said mirandola  i have been at caprera  and what did he say  he will do nothing without the sanction of the savoyard  he wants to get wounded in his other foot said mirandola with savage sarcasm will he never weary of being betrayed  i found him calm and sanguine said the general  what of the woman  garibaldi will not move without the savoyard and maryanne will not move without garibaldi that is the situation  have you seen her  not yet i have been to caprera and i have come over to see her and you italy is ready for the move and is only waiting for the great man he will not act without the savoyard he believes in him i will not be skeptical there are difficulties enough without imagining any we have no money and all our sources of supply are drained but we have the inspiration of a sacred cause we have youwe may gain othersand at any rate the french are no longer at rome    chapter 33   the goodwood cup my lordthe doncaster this pair of flagons for his highness the khedivesomething quite newyes parcelgilt the only style nowit gives relief to designyes by monti a great man hardly inferior to flaxman if at all flaxman worked for rundell and bridge in the old daysone of the principal causes of their success your lordships gold service was supplied by rundell and bridge very fine service indeed much by flaxmannothing of that kind seen now  i never did see it said lothair he was replying to mr ruby a celebrated jeweller and goldsmith in a celebrated street who had saluted him when he had entered the shop and called the attention of lothair to a group of treasures of art  strange said mr ruby smiling it is in the next room if your lordship would like to see it i think your lordship should see your gold service mr putney giles ordered it here to be examined and put in order  i should like to see it very much said lothair though i came to speak to you about something else  and so lothair following mr ruby into an inner apartment had the gratification for the first time of seeing his own service of gold plate laid out in completeness and which had been for some time exhibited to the daily admiration of that favored portion of the english people who frequent the brilliant and glowing counters of mr ruby  not that lothair was embarrassed by their presence at this moment the hour of their arrival had not yet come business had not long commenced when lothair entered the shop somewhat to the surprise of its master those who know bond street only in the blaze of fashionable hours can form but an imperfect conception of its matutinal charm when it is still shady and freshwhen there are no carriages rarely a cart and passersby gliding about on real business one feels as in some continental city then there are time and opportunity to look at the shops and there is no street in the world that can furnish such a collection filled with so many objects of beauty curiosity and interest the jewellers and goldsmiths and dealers in rare furniture porcelain and cabinets and french pictures have long fixed upon bond street as their favorite quarter and are not chary of displaying their treasures though it may be a question whether some of the magazines of fancy fooddelicacies culled from all the climes and regions of the globeparticularly at the matin hour may not in their picturesque variety be the most attractive the palm perhaps would be given to the fishmongers with their exuberant exhibitions grouped with skill startling often with strange forms dazzling with prismatic tints and breathing the invigorating redolence of the sea  well i like the service said lothair and am glad as you tell me that its fashion has come round again because there will now be no necessity for ordering a new one i do not myself much care for plate i like flowers and porcelain on a table and i like to see the guests however i suppose it is all right and i must use it it was not about plate that i called i wanted to speak to you about pearls  ah said mr ruby and his face brightened and ushering lothair to some glass cases he at the same time provided his customer with a seat  something like that said mr ruby who by this time had slid into his proper side of the counter and was unlocking the glass cases something like that and he placed before lothair a string of pretty pearls with a diamond clasp with the earrings twentyfive hundred he added and then observing that lothair did not seem enchanted he said this is something quite new and he carelessly pushed toward lothair a magnificent necklace of turquoises and brilliants  it was impossible not to admire itthe arrangement was so novel and yet of such good taste but though its price was double that of the pearl necklace mr ruby did not seem to wish to force attention to it for he put in lothairs hands almost immediately the finest emerald necklace in the world and set in a style that was perfectly ravishing  the setting is from the campana collection said mr ruby they certainly understood things in those days but i can say that so far as mere workmanship is concerned this quite equals them i have made one for the empress here is a black pearl very rare pearshape and set in golconda diamondstwo thousand guineasit might be suspended to a necklace or worn as a locket this is pretty and he offered to lothair a gigantic sapphire in brilliants and in the form of a bracelet  the finest sapphire i know is in this ring added mr ruby and he introduced his visitor to a tray of precious rings i have a pearl bracelet here that your lordship might like to see and he placed before lothair a case of fifty bracelets vying with each other in splendor  but what i want said lothair are pearls  i understand said mr ruby this is a curious thing and he took out a paper packet there he said opening it and throwing it before lothair so carelessly that some of the stones ran over the glass covering of the counter there that is a thing not to be seen every daypacket of diamonds bought of an indian prince and sent by us to be cut and polished at amsterdamnothing can be done in that way except thereand just returnednothing very remarkable as to size but all of high qualitysome fine stonesthat for example and he touched one with the long nail of his little finger that is worth seven hundred guineas the whole packet worth perhaps ten thousand pounds  very interesting said lothair but what i want are pearls that necklace which you have shown me is like the necklace of a doll i want pearls such as you see them in italian picturestitians and giorgionessuch as a queen of cyprus would wear i want ropes of pearls  ah said mr ruby i know what your lordship means lady bideford had something of that kind she very much deceived usalways told us her necklace must be sold at her death and she had very bad health we waited but when she went poor lady it was claimed by the heir and is in chancery at this very moment the justinianis have ropes of pearlsmadame justiniani of paris i have been told gives a rope to every one of her children when they marrybut there is no expectation of a justiniani parting with any thing pearls are troublesome property my lord they require great care they want both air and exercise they must be worn frequently you cannot lock them up the duchess of havant has the finest pearls in this country and i told her grace wear them whenever you can wear them at breakfast and her grace follows my adviceshe does wear them at breakfast i go down to havant castle every year to see her graces pearls and i wipe every one of them myself and let them lie on a sunny bank in the garden in a westerly wind for hours and days together their complexion would have been ruined had it not been for this treatment pearls are like girls my lordthey require quite as much attention  then you cannot give me what i want said lothair  well i can and i cannot said mr ruby i am in a difficulty i have in this house exactly what your lordship requires but i have offered them to lord topaz and i have not received his answer we have instructions to inform his lordship of every very precious jewel that we obtain and give him the preference as a purchaser nevertheless there is no one i could more desire to oblige than your lordshipyour lordship has every claim upon us and i should be truly glad to find these pearls in your lordships possession if i could only see my way perhaps your lordship would like to look at them  certainly but pray do not leave me here alone with all these treasures said lothair as mr ruby was quitting the apartment  oh my lord with you  yes that is all very well but if any thing is missed hereafter it will always be remembered that these jewels were in my possession and i was alone i highly object to it but mr ruby had vanished and did not immediately reappear in the mean time it was impossible for lothair to move he was alone and surrounded with precious necklaces and glittering rings and gorgeous bracelets with loose diamonds running over the counter it was not a kind or an amount of property that lothair relinquishing the trust could satisfactorily deliver to a shopman the shopman however honest might be suddenly tempted by satan and take the next train to liverpool he felt therefore relieved when mr ruby reentered the room breathless with a velvet casket i beg pardon my lord a thousand pardons but i thought i would just run over to lord topaz only in the square close by his lordship is at madrid the only city one cannot depend on communications with by telegraph spaniards strange people very prejudiced take all sorts of fancies in their head besides lord topaz has more pearls than he can know what to do with and i should like your lordship to see these and he opened the casket  exactly what i want exclaimed lothair these must be the very pearls the queen of cyprus wore what is their price  they are from genoa and belonged to a doge said mr ruby your lordship shall have them for the sum we gave for them there shall be no profit on the transaction and we shall be proud of it we gave for them four thousand guineas  i will take them with me said lothair who was afraid if lie left them behind lord topaz might arrive in the interval    chapter 34   lothair had returned home from his last visit to belmont agitated by many thoughts but generally speaking deeply musing over its mistress considerable speculation on religion the churches the solar system the cosmical order the purpose of creation and the destiny of man was maintained in his too rapid progress from roehampton to his belgravian hotel but the association of ideas always terminated the consideration of every topic by a wondering and deeply interesting inquiry when he should see her again and here in order to simplify this narrative we will at once chronicle the solution of this grave question on the afternoon of the next day lothair mounted his horse with the intention of calling on lady st jerome and perhaps some other persons but it is curious to observe that he soon found himself on the road to roehampton where he was in due time paying a visit to theodora but what is more remarkable is that the same result occurred every day afterward regularly every day he paid a visit to belmont nor was this all very often he paid two visits for he remembered that in the evening theodora was always at home lothair used to hurry to town from his morning visit dine at some great house which satisfied the demands of society and then drive down to roehampton the guests of the evening saloon when they witnessed the high ceremony of lothairs manner which was natural to him when he entered and the welcome of theodora could hardly believe that a few hours only had elapsed since their separation  and what was the manner of theodora to him when they were alone precisely as before she never seemed in the least surprised that he called on her every day or even twice a day sometimes she was alone frequently she had companions but she was always the same always appeared gratified at his arrival and always extended to him the same welcome graceful and genial but without a spark of coquetry yet she did not affect to conceal that she took a certain interest in him because she was careful to introduce him to distinguished men and would say you should know him he is master of such a subject you will hear things that you ought to know but all this in a sincere and straightforward manner theodora had not the slightest affectation she was always natural though a little reserved but this reserve appeared to be the result of modesty rather than of any desire of concealment when they were alone though always calm she would talk with freedom and vivacity but in the presence of others she rather led to their display and encouraged them often with a certain degree of adroit simplicity to descant on topics which interested theme or of which they were competent to treat alone with lothair and they were often alone though she herself never obtruded the serious subjects round which he was always fluttering she never avoided them and without involving herself in elaborate arguments or degenerating into conversational controversy she had a habit of asking a question or expressing a sentiment which greatly affected his feelings or perplexed his opinions  had not the season been long waning this change in the life of lothair must have been noticed and its cause ultimately discovered but the social critics cease to be observant toward the end of july all the world then are thinking of themselves and have no time to speculate on the fate and fortunes of their neighbors the campaign is too near its close the balance of the season must soon be struck the great book of society made in a few weeks even in a few days what long and subtle plans shattered or triumphantwhat prizes gained or missedwhat baffled hopes and what broken hearts the baffled hopes must go to cowes and the broken hearts to baden there were some great ladies who did remark that lothair was seldom seen at balls and hugo bohun who had been staying at his aunt lady gertrudes villa for change of air did say to bertram that he had met lothair twice on barnes common and asked bertram if he knew the reason why but the fact that lothair was cruising in waters which their craft never entered combined with the lateness of the season to baffle all the ingenuity of hugo bohun though he generally found out every thing  the great difficulty which lothair had to apprehend was with his roman catholic friends the system of the monsignori was never to let him be out of sight and his absence from the critical function had not only disappointed but alarmed them but the jesuits are wise men they never lose their temper they know when to avoid scenes as well as when to make them monsignore catesby called on lothair as frequently as before and never made the slightest allusion to the miscarriage of their expectations strange to say the innocent lothair naturally so straightforward and so honorable found himself instinctively almost it might be said unconsciously defending himself against his invaders with some of their own weapons he still talked about building his cathedral of which not contented with more plans he even gave orders that a model should be made and he still received statements on points of faith from father coleman on which he made marginal notes and queries monsignore catesby was not altogether satisfied he was suspicious of some disturbing cause but at present it baffled him their hopes however were high and they had cause to be sanguine in a months time or so lothair would be in the country to celebrate his majority his guardian the cardinal was to be his guest the st jeromes were invited monsignore catesby himself here would be opportunity and actors to avail themselves of it  it was a very few days after the first evening visit of lothair to belmont that he found himself one morning alone with theodora she was in her bowery boudoir copying some music for madame phoebus at least in the intervals of conversation that had not been of a grave character but the contrary when lothair rather abruptly said do you agree mrs campian with what mr phoebus said the other night that the greatest pain must be the sense of death  then mankind is generally spared the greatest pain she replied for i apprehend few people are sensible of deathunless indeed she added it be on the field of battle and there i am sure it cannot be painful  not on the field of battle asked lothair inducing her to proceed  well i should think for all on the field of battle there must be a degree of excitement and of sympathetic excitement scarcely compatible with overwhelming suffering but if death were encountered there for a great cause i should rather associate it with rapture than pain  but still a good number of persons must die in their beds and be conscious said lothair  it may be though i should doubt it the witnesses of such a demise are never impartial all i have loved and lost have died upon the field of battle and those who have suffered pain have been those whom they have left behind and that pain she added with some emotion may perhaps deserve the description of mr phoebus  lothair would not pursue the subject and there was rather an awkward pause theodora herself broke it and in a lighter vein though recurring to the same theme she said with a slight smile i am scarcely a competent person to consult upon this subject for to be candid with you i do not myself believe in death there is a change and doubtless a great one painful it may be certainly very perplexing but i have a profound conviction of my immortality and i do not believe that i shall rest in my grave in saecula saeculorum only to be convinced of it by the last trump  i hope you will not leave this world before i do said lothair but if that sorrow be reserved for me promise that to me if only once you will reappear  i doubt whether the departed have that power said theodora or else i think my heroes would have revisited me i lost a father more magnificent than jove and two brothers brighter than apollo and all of them passionately loved meand yet they have not come but i shall see themand perhaps soon so you see my dear lord speaking more briskly and rising rather suddenly from her seat that for my part i think it best to arrange all that concerns one in this world while one inhabits it and this reminds me that i have a little business to fulfil in which you can help me and she opened a cabinet and took out a flat antique case and then said resuming her seat at her table some one and anonymously has made me a magnificent present some strings of costly pearls i am greatly embarrassed with them for i never wear pearls or anything else and i never wish to accept presents to return them to an unknown is out of my power but it is not impossible that i may some day become acquainted with the donor i wish them to be kept in safety and therefore not by myself for my life is subject to too great vicissitudes i have therefore placed them in this case which i shall now seal and intrust them to your care as a friend in whom i have entire confidence see she said lighting a match and opening the case here are the pearlsare they not superband here is a note which will tell you what to do with them in case of my absence when you open the case which will not be for a year from this day there it is locked i have directed it to you and i will seal it with my fathers seal  lothair wag about to speak do not say a word she said this seal is a religious ceremony with me she was some little time fulfilling it so that the impression might be deep and clear she looked at it earnestly while the wax was cooling and then she said i deliver the custody of this to a friend whom i entirely trust adieu and she disappeared  the amazed lothair glanced at the seal it was a single word roma and then utterly mystified he returned to town with his own present    chapter 35   mr phoebus had just finished a picture which he had painted for the emperor of russia it was to depart immediately from england for its northern home except that his imperial majesty had consented that it should be exhibited for a brief space to the people of england this was a condition which mr phoebus had made in the interests of art and as a due homage alike to his own patriotism and celebrity  there was to be a private inspection of the picture at the studio of the artist and mr phoebus had invited lothair to attend it our friend had accordingly on the appointed day driven down to belmont and then walked to the residence of mr phoebus with colonel campian and his wife it was a short and pretty walk entirely through the royal park which the occupiers of belmont had the traditionary privilege thus to use  the residence of mr phoebus was convenient and agreeable and in situation not unlike that of belmont being sylvan and sequestered he had himself erected a fine studio and added it to the original building the flowergarden was bright and curious and on the lawn was a tent of many colors designed by himself and which might have suited some splendid field of chivalry upon gilt and painted perches also there were paroquets and macaws  lothair on his arrival found many guests assembled chiefly on the lawn mr phoebus was highly esteemed and had distinguished and eminent friends whose constant courtesies the present occasion allowed him elegantly to acknowledge there was a polished and grayheaded noble who was the head of the patrons of art in england whose nod of approbation sometimes made the fortune of a young artist and whose purchase of pictures for the nation even the furious cognoscenti of the house of commons dared not question some of the finest works of mr phoebus were to be found in his gallery but his lordship admired madame phoebus even more than her husbands works and euphrosyne as much as her sister it was sometimes thought among their friends that this young lady had only to decide in order to share the widowed coronet but euphrosyne laughed at every thing even her adorers and while her witching mockery only rendered them more fascinated it often prevented critical declarations  and lady beatrice was there herself an artist and full of aesthetical enthusiasm her hands were beautiful and she passed her life in modelling them and cecrops was there a rich old bachelor with it was supposed the finest collection of modern pictures extant his theory was that a man could not do a wiser thing than invest the whole of his fortune in such securities and it led him to tell his numerous nephews and nieces that he should in all probability leave his collection to the nation  clorinda whose palace was always open to genius and who delighted in the society of men who had discovered planets excavated primeval mounds painted pictures on new principles or composed immortal poems which no human being could either scan or construe but which she delighted in as subtle and full of secret melody came leaning on the arms of a celebrated plenipotentiary and beaming with sympathy on every subject and with the consciousness of her universal charms  and the accomplished sir francis was there and several r a s of eminence for phoebus was a true artist and loved the brotherhood and always placed them in the post of honor  no language can describe the fascinating costume of madame phoebus and her glittering sister they are habited as sylvans the great artist deigned to observe if any of his guests could not refrain from admiring the dresses which he had himself devised as for the venerable patron of art in britain he smiled when he met the lady of the house and sighed when he glanced at euphrosyne but the first gave him a beautiful flower and the other fastened it in his buttonhole he looked like a victim bedecked by the priestesses of some old fane of hellenic loveliness and proud of his impending fate what could the psalmist mean in the immortal passage threescoreandten at the present day is the period of romantic passions as for our enamoured sexagenarians they avenge the theories of our coldhearted youth  mr phoebus was an eminent host it delighted him to see people pleased and pleased under his influence he had a belief not without foundation that every thing was done better under his roof than under that of any other person the banquet in the air on the present occasion could only be done justice to by the courtly painters of the reign of louis xv vanloo and watteau and lancres would have caught the graceful group and the wellarranged colors and the faces some pretty some a little affected the ladies on fantastic chairs of wickerwork gilt and curiously painted the gentlemen reclining on the turf or bending behind them with watchful care the little tables all different the soups in delicate cups of sevres the wines in golden glass of venice the ortolans the italian confectionery the endless bouquets were worthy of the soft and invisible music that resounded from the pavilion only varied by the coquettish scream of some macaw jealous amid all this novelty and excitement of not being noticed  it is a scene of enchantment whispered the chief patron of british art to madame phoebus  i always think luncheon in the air rather jolly said madame phoebus  it is perfect romance murmured the chief patron of british art to euphrosyne  with a due admixture of reality she said helping him to an enormous truffle which she extracted from its napkin you know you must eat it with butter  lothair was glad to observe that though in refined society none were present with whom he had any previous acquaintance for he had an instinctive feeling that if hugo bohun had been there or bertram or the duke of brecon or any ladies with whom he was familiarly acquainted he would scarcely have been able to avail himself of the society of theodora with the perfect freedom which he now enjoyed they would all have been asking who she was where she came from how long lothair had known her all those questions kind and neighborly which under such circumstances occur he was in a distinguished circle but one different from that in which he lived he sat next to theodora and mr phoebus constantly hovered about them ever doing something very graceful or saying something very bright then he would whisper a word to the great clorinda who flashed intelligence from her celebrated eyes and then he made a suggestion to the aesthetical lady beatrice who immediately fell into enthusiasm and eloquence and took the opportunity of displaying her celebrated hands  the time had now arrived when they were to repair to the studio and view the picture a curtain was over it and then a silken rope across the chamber and then some chairs the subject of the picture was hero and leander chosen by the heir of all the russias himself during a late visit to england  a fascinating subject said old cecrops to mr phoebus but not a very original one  the originality of a subject is in its treatment was the reply  the theme in the present instance was certainly not conventionally treated when the curtain was withdrawn they beheld a figure of lifelike size exhibiting in undisguised completeness the perfection of the female form and yet the painter had so skilfully availed himself of the shadowy and mystic hour and of some gauzelike drapery which veiled without concealing his design that the chastest eye might gaze on his heroine with impunity the splendor of her upstretched arms held high the beaconlight which thew a glare upon the sublime anxiety of her countenance while all the tumult of the hellespont the waves the scudding sky the opposite shore revealed by a bloodred flash were touched by the hand of a master who had never failed  the applause was a genuine verdict and the company after a time began to disperse about the house and gardens a small circle remained and passing the silken rope approached and narrowly scrutinized the picture among these were theodora and lothair the chief patron of british art an r a or two clorinda and lady beatrice  mr phoebus who left the studio but had now returned did not disturb them after a while he approached the group his air was elate and was redeemed only from arrogance by the intellect of his brow the circle started a little as they heard his voice for they had been unaware of his presence  tomorrow he said the critics will commence you know who the critics are the men who have failed in literature and art    chapter 36   the lodgegate of belmont was opening as lothair one morning approached it a hansom cab came forth and in it was a person whose countenance was strongly marked on the memory of lothair it was that of his unknown friend at the fenian meeting lothair instantly recognized and cordially saluted him and his greeting though hurriedly was not ungraciously returned but the vehicle did not stop lothair called to the driver to halt but the driver on the contrary stimulated his steed and in the winding lane was soon out of sight  theodora was not immediately visible she was neither in her usual apartment nor in her garden but it was only perhaps because lothair was so full of his own impressions from his recent encounter at the lodge that he did not observe that the demeanor of mrs campian when she appeared was hardly marked by her habitual serenity she entered the room hurriedly and spoke with quickness  pray exclaimed lothair rather eagerly do tell me the name of the gentleman who has just called here  theodora changed color looked distressed and was silent unobserved however by lothair who absorbed by his own highlyexcited curiosity proceeded to explain why he presumed to press for the information i am under great obligations to that person i am not sure i may not say i owe him my life but certainly an extrication from great dander and very embarrassing danger too i never saw him but once and he would not give me his name and scarcely would accept my thanks i wanted to stop his cab today but it was impossible he literally galloped off  he is a foreigner said mrs campian who had recovered herself he was a particular friend of my dear father and when he visits england which he does occasionally he calls to see us  ah said lothair i hope i shall soon have an opportunity of expressing to him my gratitude  it was so like him not to give his name and to shrink from thanks said mrs campian he never enters society and makes no acquaintances  i am sorry for that said lothair for it is not only that he served me but i was much taken with him and felt that he was a person i should like to cultivate  yes captain bruges is a remarkable man said theodora he is not one to be forgotten  captain bruges that then is his name  he is known by the name of captain bruges said theodora and she hesitated and then speaking more quickly she added i cannot sanction i cannot bear any deception between you and this roof bruges is not his real name nor is the title he assumes his real rank he is not to be known and not to be spoken of he is one and one of the most eminent of the great family of sufferers in this world but sufferers for a divine cause i myself have been direly stricken in this struggle when i remember the departed it is not always easy to bear the thought i keep it at the bottom of my heart but this visit today has too terribly revived every thing it is well that you only are here to witness my suffering but you will not have to witness it again for we will never again speak of these matters  lothair was much touched his good heart and his good taste alike dissuaded him from attempting commonplace consolation he ventured to take her hand and pressed it to his lips dear lady he murmured and he led her to a seat i fear my foolish tattle has added to pain which i would gladly bear for you  they talked about nothings about a new horse which colonel campian had just purchased and which he wanted to show to lothair an old opera revived but which sounded rather flat something amusing that somebody had said and something absurd which somebody had done and then when the ruffled feeling had been quite composed and all had been brought back to the tenor of their usual pleasant life lothair said suddenly and rather gayly and now dearest lady i have a favor to ask you know my majority is to be achieved and to be celebrated next month i hope that yourself and colonel campian will honor me by being my guests  theodora did not at all look like a lady who had received a social attention of the most distinguished class she looked embarrassed and began to murmur something about colonel campian and their never going into society  colonel campian is going to scotland and you are going with him said lothair i know it for he told me so and said he could manage the visit to me if you approved it quite well in fact it will fit in with this scotch visit  there was some talk once about scotland said theodora but that was a long time ago many things have happened since then i do not think the scotch visit is by any means so settled as you think  but however that may be decided said lothair there can be no reason why you should not come to me  it is presumptuous in me a foreigner to speak of such matters said theodora but i fancy that in such celebrations as you contemplate there is or there should be some qualification of blood or family connection for becoming your guests we should be there quite strangers and in everybodys way checking the local and domestic abandon which i should suppose is one of the charms of such meetings  i have few relations and scarcely a connection said lothair rather moodily i can only ask friends to celebrate my majority and there are no friends whom i so much regard as those who live at belmont  it is very kind of you to say that and to feel it and i know that you would not say it if you did not feel it replied theodora but still i think it would be better that we should come to see you at a time when you are less engaged perhaps you will take colonel campian down some day and give him some shooting  all i can say is that if you do not come it will be the darkest instead of the brightest week in my life said lothair in short i feel i could not get through the business i should be so mortified i cannot restrain my feelings or arrange my countenance unless you come the whole affair will be a complete failure and worse than a failure  well i will speak to colonel campian about it said theodora but with little animation  we will both speak to him about it now said lothair for the colonel at that moment entered the room and greeted lothair as was his custom cordially  we are settling the visit to muriel said lothair i want to induce mrs campian to come down a day or two before the rest so that we may have the benefit of her counsel    chapter 37   muriel tower crowned a wooded steep part of a wild and winding and sylvan valley at the bottom of which rushed a foaming stream on the other side of the castle the scene though extensive was not less striking and was essentially romantic a vast park spread in all directions beyond the limit of the eye and with much variety of characterornate near the mansion and choicely timbered in other parts glens and spreading dolls masses of black pines and savage woods everywhere sometimes glittering and sometimes sullen glimpses of the largest natural late that inland england boasts muriel mere and in the extreme distance moors and the first crest of mountains the park too was full of life for there were not only herds of red and fallow deer but in its more secret haunts wandered a race of wildcattle extremely savage white and dovecolored and said to be of the time of the romans  it was not without emotion that lothair beheld the chief seat of his race it was not the first time he had visited it he had a clear and painful recollection of a brief hurried unkind glimpse caught of it in his very earliest boyhood his uncle had taken him there by some inconvenient crossrailroad to avail themselves of which they had risen in the dark on a march morning and in an east wind when they arrived at their station they had hired an open fly drawn by a single horse and when they had thus at last reached the uninhabited towers they entered by the offices where lothair was placed in the stewards room by a smoky fire given something to eat and told that he might walk about and amuse himself provided he did not go out of sight of the castle while his uncle and the steward mounted their horses and rode over the estate leaving lothair for hours without companions and returning just in time in a shivering twilight to clutch him up as it were by the nape of the neck twist him back again into the onehorse fly and regain the railroad his uncle praising himself the whole time for the satisfactory and businesslike manner in which he had planned and completed the edition  what a contrast to present circumstances although lothair had wished and thought he had secured that his arrival at muriel should be quite private and even unknown and that all ceremonies and celebrations should be postponed for a few days during which he hoped to become a little more familiar with his home the secret could not be kept and the county would not tolerate this reserve he was met at the station by five hundred horsemen all well mounted and some of them gentlemen of high degree who insisted upon accompanying him to his gates his carriage passed under triumphal arches and choirs of enthusiastic children waving parochial banners hymned his auspicious approach  at the park gates his cavalcade quitted him with that delicacy of feeling which always distinguishes englishmen however rough their habit as their attendance was selfinvited they would not intrude upon his home  your lordship will have enough to do today without being troubled with us said their leader as he shook hands with lothair  but lothair would not part with them thus with the inspiring recollection of his speech at the fenian meeting lothair was not afraid of rising in his barouche and addressing them what he said was said very well and it was addressed to a people who though the shyest in the world have a passion for public speaking than which no achievement more tests reserve it was something to be a great peer and a great proprietor and to be young and singularly wellfavored but to be able to make a speech and such a good one such cordial words in so strong and musical a voiceall felt at once they were in the presence of the natural leader of the county the enthusiasm of the huntingfield burst forth they gave him three ringing cheers and jostled their horses forward that they might grasp his hand  the park gates were open and the postillions dashed along through scenes of loveliness on which lothair would fain have lingered but be consoled himself with the recollection that he should probably have an opportunity of seeing them again sometimes his carriage seemed in the heart of an ancient forest sometimes the deer startled at his approach were scudding over expanding lawns then his course wound by the margin of a sinuous lake with green islands and golden gondolas and then after advancing through stately avenues he arrived at mighty gates of wondrous workmanship that once had been the boast of a celebrated convent on the danube but which in the days of revolutions had reached england and had been obtained by the grandfather of lothair to guard the choice demesne that was the vicinage of his castle  when we remember that lothair notwithstanding his rank and vast wealth had never from the nature of things been the master of an establishment it must be admitted that the present occasion was a little trying for his nerves the whole household of the towers were arrayed and arranged in groups on the steps of the chief entrance the steward of the estate who had been one of the cavalcade had galloped on before and he was of course the leading spirit and extended his arm to his lord as lothair descended from his carriage the housesteward the chief butler the headgardener the chief of the kitchen the headkeeper the headforester and grooms of the stud and of the chambers formed one group behind the housekeeper a grave and distinguishedlooking female who courtesied like the old court half a dozen powdered gentlemen glowing in crimson liveries indicated the presence of my lords footmen while the rest of the household considerable in numbers were arranged in two groups according to their sex and at a respectful distance  what struck lothairwho was always thinking and who had no inconsiderable fund of humor in his sweet and innocent naturewas the wonderful circumstance that after so long an interval of neglect and abeyance he should find himself the master of so complete and consummate a household  castles and parks he thought i had a right to count on and perhaps even pictures but how i came to possess such a work of art as my groom of the chambers who seems as respectfully haughty and as calmly grateful as if he were at brentham itself and whose coat must have been made in saville row quite bewilders me  but lothair though he appreciated putney giles had not yet formed a full conception of the resource and allaccomplished providence of that wondrous man acting under the inspiration of the consummate apollonia  passing through the entrancehall a lofty chamber though otherwise of moderate dimensions lothair was ushered into his armory a gallery two hundred feet long with suits of complete mail ranged on each side and the walls otherwise covered with rare and curious weapons it was impossible even for the master of this collection to suppress the delight and the surprise with which he beheld the scene we must remember in his excuse that he beheld it for the first time  the armory led to a large and lofty octagonal chamber highly decorated in the centre of which was the tomb of lothairs grandfather he had raised it in his lifetime the tomb was of alabaster surrounded by a railing of pure gold and crowned with a recumbent figure of the deceased in his coroneta fanciful man who lived in solitude building castles and making gardens  what charmed lothair most as he proceeded were the number of courts and quadrangles in the castle all of bright and fantastic architecture and each of which was a garden glowing with brilliant colors and gay with the voice of fountains or the forms of gorgeous birds our young friend did not soon weary in his progress even the suggestions of the steward that his lordships luncheon was at command did not restrain him ballrooms and baronial halls and long libraries with curiouslystained windows and suites of dazzling saloons where he beheld the original portraits of his parents of which he had miniatureshe saw them all and was pleased and interested but what most struck and even astonished him was the habitable air which pervaded the whole of this enormous structure too rare even when families habitually reside in such dwellings but almost inconceivable when it was to be remembered that more than a generation had passed without a human being living in these splendid chambers scarcely a human word being spoken in them there was not a refinement of modern furniture that was wanting even the tables were covered with the choicest publications of the day  mr putney giles proposes to arrive here tomorrow said the steward he thought your lordship would like to be a day or two alone  he is the most sensible man i know said lothair he always does the right thing i think i will have my luncheon now mr harvey and i will go ever the cellars tomorrow    chapter 38   yes lothair wished to be alone he had naturally a love of solitude but the events of the last few hours lent an additional inducement to meditation he was impressed in a manner and degree not before experienced with the greatness of his inheritance his worldly position until today had been an abstraction after all he had only been one of a crowd which he resembled but the sight of this proud and abounding territory and the unexpected encounter with his neighbors brought to him a sense of power and of responsibility he shrank from neither the world seemed opening to him with all its delights and with him duty was one he was also sensible of the beautiful and the surrounding forms of nature and art charmed him let us not forget that extreme youth and perfect health were ingredients not wanting in the spell any more than power or wealth was it then complete not without the influence of woman  to that gentle yet mystical sway the spirit of lothair had yielded what was the precise character of his feelings to theodorawhat were his hopes or viewshe had hitherto had neither the time nor the inclination to make certain the present was so delightful and the enjoyment of her society had been so constant and complete that he had ever driven the future from his consideration had the conduct of theodora been different had she deigned to practise on his affections appealed to his sensibility stimulated or piqued his vanity it might have been otherwise in the distraction of his heart or the disturbance of his temper he might have arrived at conclusions and even expressed them incompatible with the exquisite and even sublime friendship which had so strangely and beautifully arisen like a palace in a dream and absorbed his being although their acquaintance could hardly be numbered by months there was no living person of whom he had seen so much or to whom he had opened his heart and mind with such profuse ingenuousness nor on her part though apparently shrinking from egotism had there ever been any intellectual reserve on the contrary although never authoritative and even when touching on her convictions suggesting rather than dictating them lothair could not but feel that during the happy period he had passed in her society not only his taste had refined but his mind had considerably opened his views had become larger his sympathies had expanded he considered with charity things and even persons from whom a year ago he would have recoiled with alarm or aversion  the time during which theodora had been his companion was the happiest period of his life it was more than that he could conceive no felicity greater and all that he desired was that it should endure since they first met scarcely fourandtwenty hours had passed without his being in her presence and now notwithstanding the novelty and the variety of the objects around him and the vast and urgent and personal interest which they involve he felt a want which meeting her or the daily prospect of meeting her could alone supply her voice lingered in his ear he gazed upon a countenance invisible to others and he scarcely saw or did any thing without almost unconsciously associating with it her opinion or approbation  well then the spell was complete the fitfulness or melancholy which so often is the doom of youth however otherwise favored who do not love was not the condition capricious or desponding of lothair in him combined all the accidents and feelings which enchant existence  he had been rambling in the solitudes of his park and had thrown himself on the green shadow of a stately tree his cheek resting on his arm and lost in reverie amid the deep and sultry silence wealthy and young noble and full of noble thoughts with the inspiration of health surrounded by the beautiful and his heart softened by feelings as exquisite lothair nevertheless could not refrain from pondering over the mystery of that life which seemed destined to bring to him only delight  life would be perfect he at length exclaimed if it would only last but it will not last and what then he could not reconcile interest in this life with the conviction of another and an eternal one it seemed to him that with such a conviction man could have only one thought and one occupationthe future and preparation for it with such a conviction what they called reality appeared to him more vain and nebulous than the scones and sights of sleep and he had that conviction at least he had it once had he it now yes he had it now but modified perhaps in detail he was not so confident as he was a few months ago that he could be ushered by a jesuit from his deathbed to the society of st michael and all the angels there might be long processes of initiationintermediate states of higher probation and refinement there might be a horrible and apathetic pause when millions of ages appeared to be necessary to mature the crust of a rather insignificant planet it might be presumption in man to assume that his soul though immortal was to reach its final destination regardless of all the influences of space and time  and the philosophers and distinguished men of science with whom of late he had frequently enjoyed the opportunity of becoming acquainted what were their views they differed among themselves did any of them agree with him how they accounted for every thing except the only point on which man requires revelation chance necessity atomic theories nebular hypotheses development evolution the origin of worlds human ancestryhere were high topics on none of which was there lack of argument and in a certain sense of evidence and what then there must be design the reasoning and the research of all philosophy could not be valid against that conviction if there were no design why it would all be nonsense and he could not believe in nonsense and if there were design there must be intelligence and if intelligence pure intelligence and pure intelligence was inconsistent with any disposition but perfect good but between the allwise and the allbenevolent and man according to the new philosophers no relations were to be any longer acknowledged they renounce in despair the possibility of bringing man into connection with that first cause which they can neither explain nor deny but man requires that there shall be direct relations between the created and the creator and that in those relations he should find a solution of the perplexities of existence the brain that teems with illimitable thought will never recognize as his creator any power of nature however irresistible that is not gifted with consciousness atheism may be consistent with fine taste and fine taste under certain conditions may for a time regulate a polished society but ethics with atheism are impossible and without ethics no human order can be strong or permanent  the church comes forward and without equivocation offers to establish direct relations between god and man philosophy denies its title and disputes its power why because they are founded on the supernatural what is the supernatural can there be any thing more miraculous than the existence of man and the worldany thing more literally supernatural than the origin of things the church explains what no one else pretends to explain and which every one agrees it is of first moment should be made clear  the clouds of a summer eve were glowing in the creative and flickering blaze of the vanished sun that had passed like a monarch from the admiring sight yet left his pomp behind the golden and amber vapors fell into forms that to the eye of the musing lothair depicted the objects of his frequent meditation there seemed to rise in the horizon the dome and campaniles and lofty aisles of some celestial fane such as he had often more than dreamed of raising to the revealed author of life and death altars arose and sacred shrines and delicate chantries and fretted spires now the flashing phantom of heavenly choirs and then the dim response of cowled and earthly cenobites  these are black vespers pageants    chapter 39   lothair was quite glad to see mr putney giles that gentleman indeed was a universal favorite he was intelligent acquainted with every thing except theology and metaphysics to oblige a little to patronize never made difficulties and always overcame them his bright blue eyes open forehead and sunny face indicated a man fall of resources and with a temper of natural sweetness  the lawyer and his noble client had a great deal of business to transact lothair was to know his position in detail preparatory to releasing his guardians from their responsibilities and assuming the management of his own affairs mr putney giles was a firstrate man of business with all his pleasant easy manner he was precise and methodical and was not content that his client should be less master of his own affairs than his lawyer the mornings passed over a table covered with dispatch boxes and piles of ticketed and banded papers and then they looked after the workmen who were preparing for the impending festivals or rode over the estate  that is our weak point said mr putney giles pointing to a distant part of the valley we ought to have both sides of the valley your lordship will have to consider whether you can devote the two hundred thousand pounds of the second and extinct trust to a better purpose than in obtaining that estate  lothair had always destined that particular sum for the cathedral the raising of which was to have been the first achievement of his majority but he did not reply  in a few days the guests began to arrive but gradually the duke and duchess and lady corisande came the first and were one day alone with lothair for mr putney giles had departed to fetch apollonia  lothair was unaffectedly gratified at not only receiving his friends at his own castle but under these circumstances of intimacy they had been the first persons who had been kind to him and he really loved the whole family they arrived rather late but he would show them to their roomsand they were choice oneshimself and then they dined together in the small green diningroom nothing could be more graceful or more cordial than the whole affair the duchess seemed to beam with affectionate pleasure as lothair fulfilled his duties as their host the duke praised the claret and he seldom praised any thing while lady corisande only regretted that the impending twilight had prevented her from seeing the beautiful country and expressed lively interest in the morrows inspection of the castle and domain sometimes her eyes met those of lothair and she was so happy that she unconsciously smiled  andtomorrow said lothair i am delighted to say we shall have to ourselves at least all the morning we will see the castle first and then after luncheon we will drive about everywhere  everywhere said corisande  it was very nice your asking us first and alone said the duchess  it was very nice in your coming dear duchess said lothair and most kindas you ever are to me  duke of brecon is coming to you on thursday said the duke he told me so at whites  perhaps you would like to know duchess whom you are going to meet said lothair  i should much like to hear pray tell us  it is a rather formidable array said lothair and he took out a paper first there are all the notables of the county i do not know any of them personally so i wrote to each of them a letter as well as sending them a formal invitation i thought that was right  quite right said the duchess nothing could be more proper  well the first person of course is the lordlieutenant he is coming  bytheby let me see who is your lordlieutenant said the duke  lord agramont  to be sure i was at college with him a very good fellow but i have never met him since except once at boodles and i never saw a man so red and gray and i remember him such a goodlooking fellow he must have lived immensely in the country and never thought of his person said the duke in a tone of pity and playing with his mustache  is there a lady agramont inquired the duchess  oh yes and she also honors me with her presence said lothair  and who was lady agramont  oh his cousin said the duke the agramonts always marry their cousins his father did the same thing they are so shy it is a family that never was in society and never will be i was at agramont castle once when i was at college and i never shall forget it we used to sit down forty or fifty every day to dinner entirely maiden aunts and clergymen and that sort of thing however i shall be truly glad to see agramont again for notwithstanding all these disadvantages he is a thoroughly good fellow  then there is the highsheriff continued lothair and both the county members and their wives and mrs highsheriff too i believe there is some tremendous question respecting the precedency of this lady there is no doubt that in the county the highsheriff takes precedence of every one even of the lordlieutenant but how about his wife perhaps your grace could aid me mr putney giles said he would write about it to the heralds college  i should give her the benefit of any doubt said the duchess  and then our bishop is coming said lothair  oh i am so glad you have asked the bishop said lady corisande  there could be no doubt about it said lothair  i do not know how his lordship will get on with one of my guardians the cardinal but his eminence is not here in a priestly character and as for that there is less chance of his differing with the cardinal than with my other guardian lord culloden who is a member of the free kirk  is lord culloden coming said the duchess  yes and with two daughters flora and grizell i remember my cousins goodnatured little girls but mr putney giles tells me that the shortest is six feet high  i think we shall have a very amusing party said the duchess  you know all the others said lothair no bytheby there is the dean of my college coming and monsignore catesby a great friend of the st jeromes  lady corisande looked grave  the st jeromes will be here tomorrow continued lothair and the montairys and the st aldegondes i have half an idea that bertram and carisbrooke and hugo bohun will be here tonightduke of brecon on thursday and that i think is all except an american lady and gentleman whom i think you will likegreat friends of mine i knew them this year at oxford and the were very kind to me he is a man of considerable fortune they have lived at paris a good deal  i have known americans who lived at paris said the duke very good sort of people and no end of money some of them  i believe colonel campian has large estates in the south said lothair but though really i have no right to speak of his affairs he must have suffered very much  well he has the consolation of suffering in a good cause said the duke i shall be happy to make his acquaintance i look upon an american gentleman with large estates in the south as a real aristocrat and whether he gets his rents or whatever his returns may be or not i should always treat him with respect  i have heard the american women are very pretty said lady corisande  mrs campian is very distinguished said lothair but i think she was an italian  they promise to be an interesting addition to our party said the duchess and she rose    chapter 40   there never was any thing so successful as the arrangements of the next day after breakfast they inspected the castle and in the easiest manner without form and without hurry resting occasionally in a gallery or a saloon never examining a cabinet and only looking at a picture now and then generally speaking nothing is more fatiguing than the survey of a great house but this enterprise was conducted with so much tact and consideration and much which they had to see was so beautiful and novel that every one was interested and remained quite fresh for their subsequent exertions and then the duke is so much amused said the duchess to her daughter delighted at the unusual excitement of the handsome but somewhat too serene partner of her life  after luncheon they visited the gardens which had been formed in a sylvan valley enclosed with gilded gates the creator of this paradise had been favored by nature and had availed himself of this opportunity the contrast between the parterres blazing with color and the sylvan background the undulating paths over romantic heights the fanes and the fountains the glittering statues and the babylonian terraces formed a whole much of which was beautiful and all of which was striking and singular  perhaps too many temples said lothair but this ancestor of mine had some imagination  a carriage met them on the other side of the valley and then they soon entered the park  i am almost as much a stranger here as yourself dear duchess said lothair but i have seen some parts which i think will please you and they commenced a drive of varying but unceasing beauty  i hope i see the wildcattle said lady corisande  lady corisande saw the wildcattle and many other things which gratified and charmed her it was a long drive even of hours and yet no one was for a moment wearied  what a delightful day lady corisande exclaimed in her mothers dressingroom i have never seen any place so beautiful  i agree with you said the duchess but what pleases me most are his manners they were always kind and natural but they are so polishedso exactly what they ought to be and he always says the right thing i never knew any one who had so matured  yes it is very little more than a year since he came to us at brentham said lady corisande thoughtfully certainly he has greatly changed i remember he could hardly open his lips and now i think him very agreeable  he is more than that said the duchess he is interesting  yes said lady corisande he is interesting  what delights me said the duchess is to see his enjoyment of his position he seems to take such an interest in every thing it makes me happy to see him so happy  well i hardly know said lady corisande about that there is something occasionally about his expression which i should hardly describe as indicative of happiness or content it would be ungrateful to describe one as distrait who seems to watch all one wants and hangs on every word and yetespecially as we returned and when we were all of us a little silentthere was a remarkable abstraction about him i caught it once or twice before earlier in the day his mind seemed in another place and anxiously  he has a great deal to think of said the duchess  i fear it is that dreadful monsignore catesby said lady corisande with a sigh    chapter 41   the arrival of the guests was arranged with judgment the personal friends came first the formal visitors were invited only for the day before the public ceremonies commenced no more dinners in small green diningrooms while the duchess was dressing bertha st aldegonde and victoria montairy who had just arrived came in to give her a rapid embrace while their own toilets were unpacking  granville has come mamma i did not think that he would till the last moment he said he was so afraid of being bored there is a large party by this train the st jeromes bertram mr bohun lord carisbrooke and some others we do not know  the cardinal had been expected today but he had telegraphed that his arrival must be postponed in consequence of business until the morrow which day had been previously fixed for the arrival of his fellow guardian and trustee the earl of culloden and his daughters the ladies flora and grizell falkirk monsignore catesby had however arrived by this train and the persons whom they did not know the campians  lothair waited on colonel campian immediately and welcomed him but he did not see theodora still he had inquired after her and left her a message and hoped that she would take some tea and thus as he flattered himself broken a little the strangeness of their meeting under his roof but notwithstanding all this when she really entered the drawingroom he was seized with such a palpitation of the heart that for a moment he thought he should be unequal to the situation but the serenity of theodora reassured him the campians came in late and all eyes were upon them lothair presented theodora to the duchess who being prepared for the occasion said exactly the right thing in the best manner and invited mrs campian to sit by her and then theodora being launched lothair whispered something to the duke who nodded and the colonel was introduced to his grace the duke always polite but generally cold was more than courteoushe was cordial he seemed to enjoy the opportunity of expressing his high consideration for a gentleman of the southern states  so the first step was over lothair recovered himself the palpitation subsided and the world still went on the campians had made a good start and the favorable impression hourly increased at dinner theodora sat between lord st jerome and bertram and talked more to the middleaged peer than to the distinguished youth who would willingly have engrossed her attention all mothers admire such discretion especially in a young and beautiful married woman so the verdict of the evening among the great ladies was that theodora was distinguished and that all she said or did was in good taste on the plea of her being a foreigner she was at once admitted into a certain degree of social intimacy had she had the misfortune of being nativeborn and had flirted with bertram she would probably particularly with so much beauty have been looked upon as a horrid woman and have been relegated for amusement during her visit to the attentions of the dark sex but strange to say the social success of colonel campian was not less eminent than that of his distinguished wife the character which the duke gave of him commanded universal sympathy you know he is a gentleman said the duke he is not a yankee people make the greatest mistakes about these things he is a gentleman of the south they have no property but land and i am told his territory was immense he always lived at paris and in the highest styledisgusted of course with his own country it is not unlikely he may have lost his estates now but that makes no difference to me i shall treat him and all southern gentlemen as our fathers treated the emigrant nobility of france  hugo said st aldegonde to mr bohun i wish you would tell bertha to come to me i want her she is talking to a lot of women at the other end of the room and if i go to her i am afraid they will get hold of me  the future duchess who lived only to humor her lord was at his side in an instant you wanted me granville  yes you know i was afraid bertha i should be bored here i am not bored i like this american fellow he understands the only two subjects which interest me horses and tobacco  i am charmed granville that you are not bored i told mamma that you were very much afraid you would be  yes but i tell you what bertha i cannot stand any of the ceremonies i shall go before they begin why cannot lothair be content with receiving his friends in a quiet way it is all humbug about the county if he wants to do something for the county he can build a wing to the infirmary or something of that sort and not bore us with speeches and fireworks it is a sort of thing i cannot stand  and you shall not dear granville the moment you are bored you shall go only you are not bored at present  not at present but i expected to be  yes so i told mamma but that makes the present more delightful  the st jeromes were going to italy and immediately their departure had only been postponed in order that they might be present at the majority of lothair miss arundel had at length succeeded in her great object they were to pass the winter at rome lord st jerome was quite pleased at having made the acquaintance at dinner of a roman lady who spoke english so perfectly and lady st jerome who in consequence fastened upon theodora was getting into ecstasies which would have been embarrassing had not her new acquaintance skilfully checked her  we must be satisfied that we both admire rome said mrs campian though we admire it for different reasons although a roman i am not a roman catholic and colonel campians views on italian affairs generally would i fear not entirely agree with lord st jeromes  naturally said lady st jerome gracefully dropping the subject and remembering that colonel campian was a citizen of the united states which accounted in her apprehension for his peculiar opinions  lothair who had been watching his opportunity the whole evening approached theodora he meant to have expressed his hope that she was not wearied by her journey but instead of that he said your presence here makes me inexpressibly happy  i think everybody seems happy to be your guest she replied parrying as was her custom with a slight kind smile and a low sweet unembarrassed voice any personal allusion from lothair of unusual energy or ardor  i wanted to meet you at the station today he continued but there were so many people coming that and he hesitated  it would really have been more embarrassing to us than to yourself she said nothing could be better than all the arrangements  i sent my own brougham to you said lothair i hope there was no mistake about it  none your servant gave us your kind message and as for the carriage it was too delightful colonel campian was so pleased with it that he has promised to give me one with your permission exactly the same  i wish you would accept the one you used today  you are too magnificent you really must try to forget with us that you are the lord of muriel towers but i will willingly use your carriages as much as you please for i caught glimpses of beauty today in our progress from the station that made me anxious to explore your delightful domain  there was a slight burst of merriment from a distant part of the room and everybody looked around colonel campian had been telling a story to a group formed of the duke st aldegonde and mr bohun  best story i ever heard in my life exclaimed st aldegonde who prided himself when he did laugh which was rare on laughing loud but even the duke tittered and hugo bohun smiled  i am glad to see the colonel get on so well with every one said lothair i was afraid he might have been bored  he does not know what that means said theodora and he is so natural and so sweettempered and so intelligent that it seems to me he always is popular  do you think that will be a match said monsignore catesby to miss arundel  well i rather believe in the duke of brecon she replied they were referring to lord carisbrooke who appeared to be devoted to lady corisande do you admire the american lady  who is an italian they tell me though she does not look like one what do you think of her said the monsignore evading as was his custom a direct reply  well i think she is very distinguished unusual i wonder where our host became acquainted with them do you know  not yet but i dare say mr bohun can tell us and he addressed that gentleman accordingly as he was passing by  not the most remote idea said mr bohun you know the colonel is not a yankee he is a tremendous swell the duke says with more land than he has  he seems an agreeable person said miss arundel  well he tell anecdotes he has just been telling one granville likes anecdotes they amuse him and he likes to be amused that is all he cares about i hate anecdotes and i always get away when conversation falls into what pinto calls its anecdotage  you do not like to be amused  not too much i like to be interested  well said miss arundel so long as a person can talk agreeably i am satisfied i think to talk well a rare gift quite as rare as singing and yet you expect every one to be able to talk and very few to be able to sing  there are amusing people who do not interest said the monsignore and interesting people who do not amuse what i like is an agreeable person  my idea of an agreeable person said hugo bohun is a person who agrees with me  talking of singing something is going to happen said miss arundel  a note was heard a celebrated professor had entered the room and was seated at the piano which he had just touched there was a general and unconscious hush and the countenance of lord st aldegonde wore a rueful expression but affairs turned out better than could be anticipated a young and pretty girl dressed in white with a gigantic sash of dazzling beauty played upon the violin with a grace and sentimental and marvellous skill and passionate expression worthy of st cecilia she was a hungarian lady and this was her english debut everybody praised her and every body was pleased and lord st aldegonde instead of being bored took a wondrous rose out of his buttonhole and presented it to her  the performance only lasted half an hour and then the ladies began to think of their bowers lady st aldegonde before she quit the room was in earnest conversation with her lord  i have arranged all that you wished granville she said speaking rapidly and holding a candlestick we are to see the castle tomorrow and the gardens and the parks and every thing else but you are not to be bored at all and not to lose your shooting the moors are sixteen miles off but our host says with an omnibus and a good teamand he will give you a firstrate oneyou can do it in an hour and ten minutes certainly an hour and a quarter and you are to make your own party in the smokingroom tonight and take a capital luncheon with you  all right i shall ask the yankee and i should like to take that hungarian girl too if she would only fiddle to us at luncheon    chapter 42   next day the cardinal with his secretary and his chaplain arrived monsignore catesby received his eminence at the station and knelt and kissed his hand as he stepped from the carriage the monsignore had wonderfully manoeuvred that the whole of the household should have been marshalled to receive this prince of the church and perhaps have performed the same ceremony no religious recognition he assured them in the least degree involved only an act of not unusual respect to a foreign prince but considering that the bishop of the diocese and his suite were that day expected to say nothing of the presbyterian guardian probably arriving by the same train lothair would not be persuaded to sanction any ceremony whatever lady st jerome and miss arundel however did their best to compensate for this omission with reverences which a posturemaster might have envied and certainly would not have surpassed they seemed to sink into the earth and then slowly and supernaturally to emerge the bishop had been at college with the cardinal and intimate with him though they now met for the first time since his secessiona not uninteresting rencounter the bishop was highchurch and would not himself have made a bad cardinal being polished and plausible welllettered yet quite a man of the world he was fond of society and justified his taste in this respect by the flattering belief that by his presence he was extending the power of the church certainly favoring an ambition which could not be described as being moderate the bishop had no abstract prejudice against gentlemen who wore red hats and under ordinary circumstances would have welcomed his brother churchman with unaffected cordiality not to say sympathy but in the present instance however gracious his mien and honeyed his expressions he only looked upon the cardinal as a dangerous rival intent upon clutching from his fold the most precious of his flock and he had long looked to this occasion as the one which might decide the spiritual welfare and career of lothair the odds were not to be despised there were two monsignores in the room besides the cardinal but the bishop was a man of contrivance and resolution not easily disheartened or defeated nor was he without allies he did not count much on the university don who was to arrive on the morrow in the shape of the head of an oxford house though he was a don of magnitude this eminent personage had already let lothair slip from his influence but the bishop had a subtle counsellor in his chaplain who wore as good a cassock as any monsignore and he brought with him also a trusty archdeacon in a purple coat whose countenance was quite entitled to a place in the acta sanctorum  it was amusing to observe the elaborate courtesy and more than christian kindness which the rival prelates and their official followers extended to each other but under all this unction on both sides were unceasing observation and a vigilance that never flagged and on both sides there was an uneasy but irresistible conviction that they were on the eve of one of the decisive battles of the social world lord culloden also at length appeared with his daughters ladies flora and grizell they were quite as tall as mr putney giles had reported but very pretty with radiant complexions sunny blue eyes and flaxen looks their dimples and white shoulders and small feet and hands were much admired mr giles also returned with apollonia and at length also appeared the rival of lord carisbrooke his grace of brecon  lothair had passed a happy morning for he had contrived without difficulty to be the companion of theodora during the greater part of it as the duchess and lady corisande had already inspected the castle they disappeared after breakfast to write letters and when the afterluncheon expedition took place lothair allotted them to the care of lord carisbrooke and himself became the companion of lady st jerome and theodora  notwithstanding all his efforts in the smokingroom st aldegonde had only been able to induce colonel campian to be his companion in the shooting expedition and the colonel fell into the lure only through his carelessness and goodnature he much doubted the discretion of his decision as he listened to lord st aldegondes reasons for the expedition in their rapid journey to the moors  i do not suppose he said we shall have any good sport but when you are in scotland and come to me as i hope you will i will give you something you will like but it is a great thing to get off seeing the towers and the gardens and all that sort of thing nothing bores me so much as going over a mans house besides we get rid of the women  the meeting between the two guardians did not promise to be as pleasant as that between the bishop and the cardinal but the crusty lord culloden was scarcely a match for the social dexterity of his eminence the cardinal crossing the room with winning ceremony approached and addressed his colleague  we can have no more controversies my lord for our reign is over and he extended a delicate hand which the surprised peer touched with a huge finger  yes it all depends on himself now replied lord culloden with a grim smile and i hope he will not make a fool of himself  what have you got for us tonight inquired lothair of mr giles as the gentlemen rose from the diningtable  mr giles said he would consult his wife but lothair observing he would himself undertake that office when he entered the saloon addressed apollonia nothing could be more skilful than the manner in which mrs giles in this party assumed precisely the position which equally became her and suited her own views at the same time the somewhat humble friend but the trusted counsellor of the towers she disarmed envy and conciliated consideration never obtrusive yet always prompt and prepared with unfailing resource and gifted apparently with universal talents she soon became the recognized medium by which every thing was suggested or arranged and before eightandforty hours had passed she was described by duchesses and their daughters as that dear mrs giles  monsieur raphael and his sister came down in the train with us said mrs giles to lothair the rest of the troupe will not be here until tomorrow but they told me they could give you a perfect proverbe if your lordship would like it and the spanish conjuror is here but i rather think from what i gather that the young ladies would like a dance  i do not much fancy acting the moment these great churchmen have arrived and with cardinals and bishops i would rather not have dances the firstnight i almost wish we had kept the hungarian lady for this evening  shall i send for her she is ready  the repetition would be too soon and would show a great poverty of resources said lothair smiling what we want is some singing  mardoni ought to have been here today said mrs giles but he never keeps his engagements  i think our amateur materials are rather rich said lothair  there is mrs campian said apollonia in a low voice but lothair shook his head  but perhaps if others set her the example he added after a pause lady corisande is first rate and all her sisters sing i will go and consult the duchess  there was soon a stir in the room lady st aldegonde and her sisters approached the piano at which was seated the eminent professor a note was heard and there was silence the execution was exquisite and indeed there are few things more dainty than the blended voices of three women no one seemed to appreciate the performance more than mrs campian who greatly attracted by what was taking place turned a careless ear even to the honeyed sentences of no less a personage than the lordbishop  after an interval lady corisande was handed to the piano by lothair she was in fine voice and sang with wonderful effect mrs campian who seemed much interested softly rose and stole to the outward circle of the group which had gathered round the instrument when the sounds had ceased amid the general applause her voice of admiration was heard the duchess approached her evidently prompted by the general wish and expressed her hope that mrs campian would now favor them it was not becoming to refuse when others had contributed so freely to the general entertainment but theodora was anxious not to place herself in competition with those who had preceded her looking over a volume of music she suggested to lady corisande a duet in which the peculiarities of their two voices which in character were quite different one being a soprano and the other a contralto might be displayed and very seldom in a private chamber had any thing of so high a class been heard not a lip moved except those of the singers so complete was the fascination till the conclusion elicited a burst of irresistible applause  in imagination i am throwing endless bouquets said hugo bohun  i wish we could induce her to give us a recitation from alfieri said mrs putney giles in a whisper to lady st aldegonde i heard it once it was the finest thing i ever listened to  but cannot we said lady st aldegonde  apollonia shook her head she is extremely reserved i am quite surprised that she sang but she could not well refuse after your ladyship and your sisters had been so kind  but if the lord of the towers asks her suggested lady st aldegonde  no no said mrs giles that would not do nor would he he knows she dislikes it a word from colonel campian and the thing would be settled but it is rather absurd to invoke the authority of a husband for so light a matter  i should like so much to hear her said lady st aldegonde i think i will ask her myself i will go and speak to mamma  there was much whispering and consulting in the room but unnoticed as general conversation had now been resumed the duchess sent for lothair and conferred with him but lothair seemed to shake his head then her grace rose and approached colonel campian who was talking to lord culloden and then the duchess and lady st aldegonde went to mrs campian then after a short time lady st aldegonde rose and fetched lothair  her grace tells me said theodora that colonel campian wishes me to give a recitation i cannot believe that such a performance can ever be generally interesting especially in a foreign language and i confess that i would rather not exhibit but i do not like to be churlish when all are so amiable and compliant and her grace tells me that it cannot well be postponed for this is the last quiet night we shall have what i want is a screen and i must be a moment alone before i venture on these enterprises i require it to create the ideal presence  lothair and bertram arranged the screen the duchess and lady st aldegonde glided about and tranquilly intimated what was going to occur so that without effort there was in a moment complete silence and general expectation almost unnoticed mrs campian had disappeared whispering a word as she passed to the eminent conductor who was still seated at the piano the company had almost unconsciously grouped themselves in the form of a theatre the gentlemen generally standing behind the ladies who were seated there were some bars of solemn music and then to an audience not less nervous than herself theodora came forward as electra in that beautiful appeal to clytemnestra where she veils her mothers guilt even while she intimates her more than terrible suspicion of its existence and makes one last desperate appeal of pathetic duty in order to save her parent and her fated house       o amata madre       che fai  non credo io no che ardente fiamma       il cor ti avvampi  the ineffable grace of her action simple without redundancy her exquisite elocution her deep yet controlled passion and the magic of a voice thrilling even in a whisperthis form of phidias with the genius of sophoclesentirely enraptured a fastidious audience when she ceased there was an outburst of profound and unaffected appreciation and lord st aldegonde who had listened in a sort of ecstasy rushed forward with a countenance as serious as the theme to offer his thanks and express his admiration  and then they gathered round herall these charming women and some of these admiring menas she would have resumed her seat and entreated her once moreonly once moreto favor them she caught the adoring glance of the lord of the towers and her eyes seemed to inquire what she should do there will be many strangers here tomorrow said lothair and next week all the world this is a delight only for the initiated and he entreated her to gratify them  it shall be alfieris ode to america then said theodora if you please  she is a roman i believe said lady st jerome to his eminence but not alas a child of the church indeed i fear her views generally are advanced and she shook her head  at present said the cardinal this roof and this visit may influence her i should like to see such powers engaged in the cause of god  the cardinal was an entire believer in female influence and a considerable believer in his influence over females and he had good cause for his convictions the catalogue of his proselytes was numerous and distinguished he had not only converted a duchess and several countesses but he had gathered into his fold a real mary magdalen in the height of her beauty and her fame the most distinguished member of the demimonde had suddenly thrown up her golden whip and jingling reins and cast herself at the feet of the cardinal he had a right therefore to be confident and while his exquisite taste and consummate cultivation rendered it impossible that he should not have been deeply gratified by the performance of theodora he was really the whole time considering the best means by which such charms and powers could be enlisted in the cause of the church  after the ladies had retired the gentlemen talked for a few minutes over the interesting occurrence of the evening  do you know said the bishop to the duke and some surrounding auditors fine as was the electra i preferred the ode to the tragedy there was a tumult of her brow especially in the address to liberty that was sublimequite a moenad look  what do you think of it carry said st aldegonde to lord carisbrooke  brecon says she puts him in mind of ristori  she is not in the least like ristori or any one else said st aldegonde i never heard i never saw any one like her ill tell you whatyou must take care what you say about her in the smokingroom for her husband will be there and an excellent fellow too we went together to the moors this morning and he did not bore me in the least only if i had known as much about his wife as i do now i would have stayed at home and passed my morning with the women    chapter 43   st aldegonde loved to preside over the mysteries of the smokingroom there enveloped in his egyptian robe occasionally blurting out some careless or headstrong paradox to provoke discussion among others which would amuse himself rioting in a rabelaisan anecdote and listening with critical delight to endless memoirs of horses and primadonnas st aldegonde was never bored sometimes too when he could get hold of an eminent traveller or some individual distinguished for special knowledge st aldegonde would draw him out with skill himself displaying an acquaintance with the particular topic which often surprised his habitual companions for st aldegonde professed never to read but he had no ordinary abilities and an original turn of mind and habit of life which threw him in the way of unusual persons of all classes from whom he imbibed or extracted a vast variety of queer always amusing and not altogether useless information  lothair has only one weakness he said to colonel campian as the ladies disappeared he does not smoke carry you will come  well i do not think i shall tonight said lord carisbrooke lady corisande it appears particularly disapproved of smoking  hum said st aldegonde duke of brecon i know will come and hugo and bertram my brother montairy would give his ears to come but is afraid of his wife and then there is the monsignore a most capital fellow who knows every thing  there were other gatherings before the midnight bell struck at the towers which discussed important affairs though they might not sit so late as the smokingparty lady st aldegonde had a reception in her room as well as her lord there the silent observation of the evening found avenging expression in sparkling criticism and the summer lightning though it generally blazed with harmless brilliancy occasionally assumed a more arrowy character the gentlemen of the smokingroom have it not all their own way quite as much as they think if indeed a new school of athens were to be pictured the sages and the students might be represented in exquisite dressinggowns with slippers rarer than the lost one of cinderella and brandishing beautiful brushes over tresses still more fair then is the time when characters are never more finely drawn or difficult social questions more accurately solved knowledge without reasoning and truth without logicthe triumph of intuition but we must not profane the mysteries of bona dea  the archdeacon and the chaplain had also been in council with the bishop in his dressingroom who while he dismissed them with his benison repeated his apparently satisfactory assurance that something would happen the first thing after breakfast  lothair did not smoke but he did not sleep he was absorbed by the thought of theodora he could not but be conscious and so far he was pleased by the consciousness that she was as fascinating to others as to himself what then even with the splendid novelty of his majestic home and all the excitement of such an incident in his life and the immediate prospect of their again meeting he had felt and even acutely their separation whether it were the admiration of her by others which proved his own just appreciation or whether it were the unobtrusive display of exquisite accomplishments which with all their intimacy she had never forced on his noticewhatever the cause her hold upon his heart and life powerful as it was before had strengthened lothair could not conceive existence tolerable without her constant presence and with her constant presence existence would be rapture it had come to that all his musings all his profound investigation and high resolve all his sublime speculations on god and man and life and immortality and the origin of things and religious truth ended in an engrossing state of feeling which could be denoted in that form and in no other  what then was his future it seemed dark and distressing her constant presence his only happiness her constant presence impossible he seemed on an abyss  in eightandforty hours or so one of the chief provinces of england would be blazing with the celebration of his legal accession to his high estate if any one in the queens dominions had to be fixed upon as the most fortunate and happiest of her subjects it might well be lothair if happiness depend on lofty station his ancient and hereditary rank was of the highest if as there seems no doubt the chief source of felicity in this country is wealth his vast possessions and accumulated treasure could not easily be rivalled while he had a matchless advantage over those who pass or waste their gray and withered lives in acquiring millions in his consummate and healthy youth he had bright abilities and a brighter heart and yet the unknown truth was that this favored being on the eve of this critical event was pacing his chamber agitated and infinitely disquieted and struggling with circumstances and feelings over which alike he seemed to have no control and which seemed to have been evoked without the exercise of his own will or that of any other person  i do not think i can blame myself he said and i am sure i cannot blame her and yet  he opened his window and looked upon the moonlit garden which filled the fanciful quadrangle the light of the fountain seemed to fascinate his eye and the music of its fall soothed him into reverie the distressful images that had gathered round his heart gradually vanished and all that remained to him was the reality of his happiness her beauty and her grace the sweet stillness of her searching intellect and the refined pathos of her disposition only occurred to him and he dwelt on them with spellbound joy  the great clock of the towers sounded two  ah said lothair i must try to sleep i have got to see the bishop tomorrow morning i wonder what he wants    chapter 44   the bishop was particularly playful on the morrow at breakfast though his face beamed with christian kindness there was a twinkle in his eye which seemed not entirely superior to mundane selfcomplacency even to a sense of earthly merriment his seraphic raillery elicited sympathetic applause from the ladies especially from the daughters of the house of brentham who laughed occasionally even before his angelic jokes were well launched his lambent flashes sometimes even played over the cardinal whose cerulean armor nevertheless remained always unscathed monsignore chidioch however who would once unnecessarily rush to the aid of his chief was tumbled over by the bishop with relentless gayety to the infinite delight of lady corisande who only wished it had been that dreadful monsignore catesby but though less demonstrative apparently not the least devout of his lordships votaries were the lady flora and the lady grizell these young gentlewomen though apparently gifted with appetites becoming their ample but far from graceless forms contrived to satisfy all the wants of nature without taking their charmed vision for a moment off the prelate or losing a word which escaped his consecrated lips sometimes even they ventured to smile and then they looked at their father and sighed it was evident notwithstanding their appetites and their splendid complexions which would have become the aurora of guido that these young ladies had some secret sorrow which required a confidante their visit to muriel towers was their introduction to society for the eldest had only just attained sweet seventeen young ladies under these circumstances always fall in love but with their own sex lady flora and lady grizell both fell in love with lady corisande and before the morning had passed away she had become their friend and counsellor and the object of their devoted adoration it seems that their secret sorrow had its origin in that mysterious religious sentiment which agitates or affects every class and condition of man and which creates or destroys states though philosophers are daily assuring us that there is nothing in it the daughters of the earl of culloden could not stand any longer the free kirk of which their austere parent was a fiery votary it seems that they had been secretly converted to the episcopal church of scotland by a governess who pretended to be a daughter of the covenant but who was really a niece of the primus and as lord culloden accurately observed when he ignominiously dismissed her a jesuit in disguise from that moment there had been no peace in his house his handsome and gigantic daughters who had hitherto been all meekness and who had obeyed him as they would a tyrant father of the feudal ages were resolute and would not compromise their souls they humbly expressed their desire to enter a convent or to become at least sisters of mercy lord culloden raged and raved and delivered himself of cynical taunts but to no purpose the principle that forms free kirks is a strong principle and takes many forms which the social polyphemes who have only one eye cannot perceive in his desperate confusion he thought that change of scene might be a diversion when things were at the worst and this was the reason that he had contrary to his original intention accepted the invitation of his ward  lady corisande was exactly the guide the girls required they sat on each side of her each holding her hand which they frequently pressed to their lips as her form was slight though of perfect grace and symmetry the contrast between herself and her worshippers was rather startling but her noble brow full of thought and purpose the firmness of her chiselled lip and the rich fire of her glance vindicated her post as the leading spirit  they breakfasted in a room which opened on a gallery and at the other end of the gallery was an apartment similar to the breakfastroom which was the male morningroom and where the world could find the newspapers or join in half an hours talk over the intended arrangements of the day when the breakfastparty broke up the bishop approached lothair and looked at him earnestly  i am at your lordships service said lothair and they quitted the breakfastroom together halfway down the gallery they met monsignore catesby who had in his hand a number just arrived of a newspaper which was esteemed an ultramontane organ he bowed as he passed them with an air of some exultation and the bishop and himself exchanged significant smiles which however meant different things quitting the gallery lothair led the way to his private apartments and opening the door ushered in the bishop  now what was contained in the ultramontane organ which apparently occasioned so much satisfaction to monsignore catesby a deftly drawnup announcement of some important arrangements which had been deeply planned the announcement would be repeated in all the daily papers which were hourly expected the world was informed that his eminence cardinal grandison now on a visit at muriel towers to his ward lothair would celebrate high mass on the ensuing sunday in the city which was the episcopal capital of the bishops see and afterward preach on the present state of the church of christ as the bishop must be absent from his cathedral that day and had promised to preach in the chapel at muriel there was something dexterous in thus turning his lordships flank and desolating his diocese when he was not present to guard it from the fiery dragon it was also remarked that there would be an unusual gathering of the catholic aristocracy for the occasion the rate of lodgings in the city had risen in consequence at the end of the paragraph it was distinctly contradicted that lothair had entered the catholic church such a statement was declared to be premature as his guardian the cardinal would never sanction his taking such a step until he was the master of his own actions the general impression left by the whole paragraph being that the world was not to be astonished if the first stop of lothair on accomplishing his majority was to pursue the very course which was now daintily described as premature  at luncheon the whole party were again assembled the newspapers had arrived in the interval and had been digested every one was aware of the popish plot as hugo bohun called it the bishop however looked serene and if not as elate as in the morning calm and content he sat by the duchess and spoke to her in a low voice and with seriousness the monsignore watched every expression  when the duchess rose the bishop accompanied her into the recess of a window and she said you may depend upon me i cannot answer for the duke it is not the early rising he always rises early in the country but he likes to read his letters before he dresses and that sort of thing i think you had better speak to lady corisande yourself  what had taken place at the interview of the bishop with lothair and what had elicited from the duchess an assurance that the prelate might depend upon her generally transpired in consequence of some confidential communications in the course of the afternoon it appeared that the right reverend lord had impressed and successfully on lothair the paramount duty of commencing the day of his majority by assisting in an early celebration of the most sacred rite of the church this in the estimation of the bishop though he had not directly alluded to the subject in the interview but had urged the act on higher grounds would be a triumphant answer to the insidious and calumnious paragraphs which had circulated during the last six months and an authentic testimony that lothair was not going to quit the church of his fathers  this announcement however produced consternation in the opposite camp it seemed to more than neutralize the anticipated effect of the programme and the deftlyconceived paragraph monsignore catesby went about whispering that he feared lothair was going to overdo it and considering what he had to go through on monday if it were only for considerations of health an early celebration was inexpedient he tried the duchessabout whom he was beginning to hover a good dealas he fancied she was of an impressible disposition and gave some promise of results but here the ground had been too forcibly preoccupied then he flew to lady st aldegonde but he had the mortification of learning from her lips that she herself contemplated being a communicant at the same time lady corisande had been before him all the energies of that young lady were put forth in order that lothair should be countenanced on this solemn occasion she conveyed to the bishop before dinner the results of her exertions  you may count on alberta st aldegonde and victoria montairy and i think lord montairy also if she presses him which she has promised to do bertram must kneel by his friend at such a time i think lord carisbrooke may duke of brecon i can say nothing about at present  lord st aldegonde said the bishop  lady corisande shook her head  there had been a conclave in the bishops room before dinner in which the interview of the morning was discussed  it was successful scarcely satisfactory said the bishop he is a very clever fellow and knows a great deal they have got hold of him and he has all the arguments at his fingers ends when i came to the point he began to demur i saw what was passing through his mind and i said at once your views are high so are mine so are those of the church it is a sacrifice undoubtedly in a certain sense no sound theologian would maintain the simplicity of the elements but that does not involve the coarse interpretation of the dark ages  good good said the archdeacon and what is it your lordship did not exactly like  he fenced too much and he said more than once and in a manner i did not like that whatever were his views as to the church he thought he could on the whole conscientiously partake of this rite as administered by the church of england  every thing depends on this celebration said the chaplain after that his doubts and difficulties will dispel  we must do our best that he is well supported said the archdeacon  no fear of that said the bishop i have spoken to some of our friends we may depend on the duchess and her daughtersall admirable women and they will do what they can with others it will be a busy day but i have expressed my hope that the heads of the household may be able to attend but the county notables arrive today and i shall make it a point with them especially the lordlieutenant  it should be known said the chaplain i will send a memorandum to the guardian  and john bull said the bishop  the lordlieutenant and lady agramont and their daughter lady ida alice arrived today and the highsheriff a manufacturer a great liberal who delighted in peers but whose otherwise perfect felicity today was a little marred and lessened by the haunting and restless fear that lothair was not duly aware that he took precedence of the lordlieutenant then there were sir hamlet clotworthy the master of the hounds and a capital man of business and the honorable lady clotworthy a haughty dame who ruled her circle with tremendous airs and graces but who was a little subdued in the empyrean of muriel towers the other county member mr ardenne was a refined gentleman and loved the arts he had an ancient pedigree and knew everybody elses which was not always pleasant what he most prided himself on was being the hereditary owner of a real deerpark the only one he asserted in the county other persons had parks which had deer in them but that was quite a different thing his wife was a pretty woman and the inspiring genius of archeological societies who loved their annual luncheon in her tudor halls and illustrated by their researches the deeds and dwellings of her husbands ancient race  the clergy of the various parishes on the estate all dined at the towers today in order to pay their respects to their bishop lothairs oecumenical council said hugo bohun as he entered the crowded room and looked around him with an air of not ungraceful impertinence among the clergy was mr smylie the brother of apollonia  a few years ago mr putney giles had not unreasonably availed himself of the position which he so usefully and so honorably filled to recommend this gentleman to the guardians of lothair to fill a vacant benefice the reverend dionysius smylie had distinguished himself at trinity college dublin and had gained a hebrew scholarship there after that he had written a work on the revelations which clearly settled the longcontroverted point whether rome in the great apocalypse was signified by babylon the bishop shrugged his shoulders when he received mr smylies papers the examining chaplain sighed and the archdeacon groaned but man is proverbially shortsighted the doctrine of evolution affords no instances so striking as those of sacerdotal development placed under the favoring conditions of clime and soil the real character of the reverend dionysius smylie gradually but powerfully developed itself where he now ministered he was attended by acolytes and incensed by thurifers the shoulders of a fellow countryman were alone equal to the burden of the enormous cross which preceded him while his ecclesiastical wardrobe furnished him with many colored garments suited to every season of the year and every festival of the church  at first there was indignation and rumors or prophecies that we should soon have another case of perversion and that mr smylie was going over to rome but these superficial commentators misapprehended the vigorous vanity of the man rome may come to me said mr smylie and it is perhaps the best thing it could do this is the real church without romish error  the bishop and his reverend stuff who were at first so much annoyed at the preferment of mr smylie had now with respect to him only one duty and that was to restrain his exuberant priestliness but they fulfilled that duty in a kindly and charitable spirit and when the reverend dionysius smylie was appointed chaplain to lothair the bishop did not shrug his shoulders the chaplain did not sigh nor the archdeacon groan  the party was so considerable today that they dined in the great hall when it was announced to lothair that his lordships dinner was served and he offered his arm to his destined companion he looked around and then in an audible voice and with a stateliness becoming such an incident called upon the highsheriff to lead the duchess to the table although that eminent personage had been thinking of nothing else for days and during the last halfhour had felt as a man feels and can only feel who knows that some public function is momentarily about to fall to his perilous discharge he was taken quite aback changed color and lost his head but the band of lothair who were waiting at the door of the apartment to precede the procession to the hall striking up at this moment the roast beef of old england reanimated his heart and following lothair and preceding all the other guests down the gallery and through many chambers he experienced the proudest moment of a life of struggle ingenuity vicissitude and success    chapter 45   under all this flowing festivity there was already a current of struggle and party passion serious thoughts and some anxiety occupied the minds of several of the guests amid the variety of proffered dishes and sparkling wines and the subdued strains of delicate music this disquietude did not touch lothair he was happy to find himself in his ancestral hall surrounded by many whom he respected and by some whom he loved he was an excellent host which no one can be who does not combine a good heart with high breeding  theodora was rather far from him but he could catch her grave sweet countenance at an angle of the table as she bowed her head to mr ardenne the county member who was evidently initiating her in all the mysteries of deerparks the cardinal sat near him winning over though without apparent effort the somewhat prejudiced lady agramont his eminence could converse with more facility than others for he dined off biscuits and drank only water  lord culloden had taken out lady st jerome who expended on him all the resources of her impassioned tittletattle extracting only grim smiles and lady corisande had fallen to the happy lot of the duke of brecon according to the fine perception of clare arundeland women are very quick in these discoveriesthe winning horse st aldegonde had managed to tumble in between lady flora and lady grizell and seemed immensely amused  the duke inquired of lothair how many he could dine in his hall  we must dine more than two hundred on monday he replied  and now i should think we have only a third of that number said his grace it will be a tight fit  mr putney giles has had a drawing made and every seat apportioned we shall just do it  i fear you will have too busy a day on monday said the cardinal who had caught up the conversation  well you know sir i do not sit up smoking with lord st aldegonde  after dinner lady corisande seated herself by mrs campian you must have thought me very rude she said to have left you so suddenly at tea when the bishop looked into the room but he wanted me on a matter of the greatest importance i must therefore ask your pardon you naturally would not feel on this matter as we all do or most of us do she added with some hesitation beingpardon mea foreigner and the question involving national as well as religious feelings and then somewhat hurriedly but with emotion she detailed to theodora all that had occurred respecting the early celebration on monday and the opposition it was receiving from the cardinal and his friends it was a relief to lady corisande thus to express all her feelings on a subject on which she had been brooding the whole day  you mistake said theodora quietly when lady corisande had finished i am much interested in what you tell me i should deplore our friend falling under the influence of the romish priesthood  and yet there is danger of it said lady corisande more than danger she added in a low but earnest voice you do not know what a conspiracy is going on and has been going on for months to effect this end i tremble  that is the last thing i ever do said theodora with a faint sweet smile i hope but i never tremble  you have seen the announcement in the newspapers today said lady corisande  i think if they were certain of their prey they would be more reserved said theodora  there is something in that said lady corisande musingly you know not what a relief it is to me to speak to you on this matter mamma agrees with me and so do my sisters but still they may agree with me because they are my mamma and my sisters but i look upon our nobility joining the church of rome as the greatest calamity that has ever happened to england irrespective of all religious considerations on which i will not presume to touch it is an abnegation of patriotism and in this age when all things are questioned a love of our country seems to me the one sentiment to cling to  i know no higher sentiment said theodora in a low voice and yet which sounded like the breathing of some divine shrine and her athenian eye met the fiery glance of lady corisande with an expression of noble sympathy  i am so glad that i spoke to you on this matter said lady corisande for there is something in you which encourages me as you say if they were certain they would be silent and yet from what i hear their hopes are high you know she added in a whisper that he has absolutely engaged to raise a popish cathedral my brother bertram has seen the model in his rooms  i have known models that were never realized said theodora  ah you are hopeful you said you were hopeful it is a beautiful disposition it is not mine she added with a sigh  it should be said theodora you were not born to sigh sighs should be for those who have no country like myself not for the daughters of englandthe beautiful daughters of proud england  but you have your husbands country and that is proud and great  i have only one country and it is not my husbands and i have only one thought and it is to set it free  it is a noble one said lady corisande as i am sure are all your thoughts there are the gentlemen i am sorry they have come there she added as monsignore catesby entered the room there is his evil genius  but you have baffled him said theodora  ah said lady corisande with a longdrawn sigh their manoeuvres never cease however i think monday must be safe would you come she said with a serious searching glance and in a kind of coaxing murmur  i should be an intruder my dear lady said theodora declining the suggestion but so far as hoping that our friend will never join the church of rome you will have ever my ardent wishes  theodora might have added her belief for lothair had never concealed from her a single thought or act of his life in this respect she knew all and had weighed every thing and flattered herself that their frequent and unreserved conversations had not confirmed his belief in the infallibility of the church of rome and perhaps of some other things  it had been settled that there should be dancing this eveningall the young ladies had wished it lothair danced with lady flora falkirk and her sister lady grizell was in the same quadrille they moved about like young giraffes in an african forest but looked bright and happy lothair liked his cousins their inexperience and innocence and the simplicity with which they exhibited and expressed their feelings had in them something bewitching then the rough remembrance of his old life at falkirk and its contrast with the present scene had in it something stimulating they were his juniors by several years but they were always gentle and kind to him and sometimes it seemed he was the only person whom they too had found kind and gentle he called his cousin too by her christian name and he was amused standing by this beautiful giantess and calling her flora there were other amusing circumstances in the quadrille not the least lord st aldegonde dancing with mrs campian the wonder of lady st aldegonde was only equalled by her delight  the lordlieutenant was standing by the duke in a comer of the saloon observing not with dissatisfaction his daughter lady ida alice dancing with lothair  do you know this is the first time i ever had the honor of meeting a cardinal he said  and we never expected that it would happen to either of us in this country when we were at christchurch together replied the duke  well i hope every thing is for the best said lord agramont we are to have all these gentlemen in our good city of grandchester tomorrow  so i understand  you read that paragraph in the newspapers do you think there is any thing in it  about our friend it would be a great misfortune  the bishop says there is nothing in it said the lordlieutenant  well he ought to know i understand he has had some serious conversation recently with our friend  yes he has spoken to me about it are you going to attend the early celebration tomorrow it is not much to my taste a little newfangled i think but i shall go as they say it will do good  i am glad of that it is well that he should be impressed at this moment with the importance and opinion of his county  do you know i never saw him before said the lordlieutenant he is winning  i know no youth said the duke i would not except my own son and bertram has never given me an uneasy moment of whom i have a better opinion both as to heart and head i should deeply deplore his being smashed by a jesuit  the dancing had ceased for a moment there was a stir lord carisbrooke was enlarging with unusual animation to an interested group about a new dance at paristhe new dance could they not have it here unfortunately he did not know its name and could not describe its figure but it was something new quite new they got it at paris princess metternich dances it he danced it with her and she taught it him only he never could explain any thing and indeed never did exactly make it out but you danced it with a shawl and then two ladies hold the shawl and the cavaliers pass under it in fact it is the only thing it is the new dance at paris  what a pity that any thing so delightful should be so indefinite and perplexing and indeed impossible which rendered it still more desirable if lord carisbrooke only could have remembered its name or a single step in its figureit was so tantalizing  do not you think so said hugo bohun to mrs campian who was sitting apart listening to lord st aldegondes account of his travels in the united states which he was very sorry he ever quitted and then they inquired to what mr bohun referred and then he told them all that had been said  i know what he means said mrs campian it is not a french dance it is a moorish dance  that woman knows everything hugo said lord st aldegonde in a solemn whisper and then he called to his wife bertha mrs campian will tell you all about this dance that carisbrooke is making such a mull of now look here bertha you must get the campians to come to us as soon as possible they are going to scotland from this place and there is no reason if you manage it well why they should not come on to us at once now exert yourself  i will do all i can granville  it is not french it is moorish it is called the tangerine said theodora to her surrounding votaries you begin with a circle  but how are we to dance without the music said lady montairy  ah i wish i had known this said theodora before dinner and i think i could have dotted down something that would have helped us but let me see and she went up to the eminent professor with whom she was well acquainted and said signor ricci it begins so and she hummed divinely a fantastic air which after a few moments musing he reproduced and then it goes off into what they call in spain a saraband is there a shawl in the room  my mother has always a shawl in reserve said bertram particularly when she pays visits to houses where there are galleries and he brought back a mantle of cashmere  now signor ricci said mrs campian and she again hummed an air and moved forward at the same time with brilliant grace waving at the end the shawl  the expression of her countenance looking round to signor ricci as she was moving on to see whether he had caught her idea fascinated lothair  it is exactly what i told you said lord carisbrooke and i can assure you it is the only dance now i am very glad i remembered it  i see it all said signor ricci as theodora rapidly detailed to him the rest of the figure and at any rate it will be the tangerine with variations  let me have the honor of being your partner in this great enterprise said lothair you are the inspiration of muriel  oh i am very glad i can do any thing however slight to please you and your friends i like them all but particularly lady corisande  a new dance in a countryhouse is a festival of frolic grace the incomplete knowledge and the imperfect execution are themselves causes of merry excitement in their contrast with the unimpassioned routine and almost unconscious practice of traditionary performances and gay and frequent were the bursts of laughter from the bright and airy band who were proud to be the scholars of theodora the least successful among them was perhaps lord carisbrooke  princess metternich must have taught you wrong carisbrooke said hugo bohun  they ended with a waltz lothair dancing with miss arundel she accepted his offer to take some tea on its conclusion while they were standing at the table a little withdrawn from the others and he holding a sugarbasin she said in a low voice looking on her cup and not at him the cardinal is vexed about the early celebration he says it should have been at midnight  i am sorry he is vexed said lothair  he was going to speak to you himself continued miss arundel but he felt a delicacy about it he had thought that your common feelings respecting the church might have induced you if not to consult at least to converse with him on the subject i mean as your guardian  it might have been perhaps as well said lothair but i also feel a delicacy on these matters  there ought to be none on such matters continued miss arundel when every thing is at stake  i do not see that i could have taken any other course than i have done saidlothair it can hardly be wrong the bishops church views are sound  sound said miss arundel moonshine instead of sunshine  moonshine would rather suit a midnight than a morning celebration said lothair would it not  a fair repartee but we are dealing with a question that cannot be settled by jests see she said with great seriousness putting down her cup and taking again his offered arm you think you are only complying with a form befitting your position and the occasion you deceive yourself you are hampering your future freedom by this step and they know it that is why it was planned it was not necessary nothing can be necessary so pregnant with evil you might have made you might yet make a thousand excuses it is a rite which hardly suits the levity of the hour even with their feelings but with your view of its real character it is sacrilege what at is occurring tonight might furnish you with scruples and she looked up in his face  i think you take an exaggerated view of what i contemplate said lothair even with your convictions it may be an imperfect rite but it never can be an injurious one  there can be no compromise on such matters said miss arundel the church knows nothing of imperfect rites they are all perfect because they are all divine any deviation from them is heresy and fatal my convictions on this subject are your convictions act up to them  i am sure if thinking of these matters would guide a man right said lothair with a sigh and he stopped  human thought will never guide you and very justly when you have for a guide divine truth you are now your own master go at once to its fountainhead go to rome and then all your perplexities will vanish and forever  i do not see much prospect of my going to rome said lothair at least at present  well said miss arundel in a few weeks i hope to be there and if so i hope never to quit it  do not say that the future is always unknown  not yours said miss arundel whatever you think you will go to rome mark my words i summon you to meet me at rome    chapter 46   there can be little doubt generally speaking that it is more satisfactory to pass sunday in the country than in town there is something in the essential stillness of countrylife which blends harmoniously with the ordinance of the most divine of our divine laws it is pleasant too when the congregation breaks up to greet ones neighbors to say kind words to kind faces to hear some rural news profitable to learn which sometimes enables you to do some good and sometimes prevents others from doing some harm a quiet domestic walk too in the afternoon has its pleasures and so numerous and so various are the sources of interest in the country that though it be sunday there is no reason why your walk should not have an object  but sunday in the country with your house full of visitors is too often an exception to this general truth it is a trial your guests cannot always be at church and if they could would not like it there is nothing to interest or amuse them no sport no castles or factories to visit no adventurous expeditions no gay music in the morn and no light dance in the evening there is always danger of the day becoming a course of heavy meals and stupid walks for the external scene and all teeming circumstances natural and human though full of concern to you are to your visitors an insipid blank  how did sunday go off at muriel towers  in the first place there was a special train which at an early hour took the cardinal and his suite and the st jerome family to grandchester where they were awaited with profound expectation but the anglican portion of the guests were not without their share of ecclesiastical and spiritual excitement for the bishop was to preach this day in the chapel of the towers a fine and capacious sanctuary of florid gothic and hit lordship was a sacerdotal orator of repute  it had been announced that the breakfasthour was to be somewhat earlier the ladies in general were punctual and seemed conscious of some great event impending the ladies flora and grizell entered with each in her hand a prayerbook of purple velvet adorned with a decided cross the gift of the primus lord culloden at the request of lady corisande had consented to their hearing the bishop which he would not do himself he passed his morning in finally examining the guardians accounts the investigation of which he conducted and concluded during the rest of the day with mr putney giles mrs campian did not leave her room lord st aldegonde came down late and looked about him with an uneasy illhumored air  whether it were the absence of theodora or some other cause he was brusk ungracious scowling and silent only nodding to the bishop who benignly saluted him refusing every dish that was offered then getting up and helping himself at the sidetable making a great noise with the carving instruments and flouncing down his plate when he resumed his seat nor was his costume correct all the other gentlemen though their usual morningdresses were sufficiently fantastictrunkhose of every form stockings bright as paroquets wondrous shirts and velvetcoats of every tinthabited themselves today both as regards form and color in a style indicative of the subdued gravity of their feelings lord st aldegonde had on his shootingjacket of brown velvet and a pinkshirt and no cravat and his rich brown locks always to a certain degree neglected were peculiarly dishevelled  hugo bohun who was not afraid of him and was a highchurchman being in religion and in all other matters always on the side of the duchesses said well st aldegonde are you going to chapel in that dress but st aldegonde would not answer he gave a snort and glanced at hugo with the eye of a gladiator  the meal was over the bishop was standing near the mantelpiece talking to the ladies who were clustered round him the archdeacon and the chaplain and some other clergy a little in the background lord st aldegonde who whether there were a fire or not always stood with his back to the fireplace with his hands in his pockets moved discourteously among them assumed his usual position and listened as it were grimly for a few moments to their talk then he suddenly exclaimed in a loud voice and with the groan of a rebellious titan how i hate sunday  granville exclaimed lady st aldegonde turning pale there was a general shudder  i mean in a countryhouse said lord st aldegonde of course i mean in a countryhouse i do not dislike it when alone and i do not dislike it in london but sunday in a countryhouse is infernal  i think it is now time for us to go said the bishop walking away with dignified reserve and they all dispersed  the service was choral and intoned for although the rev dionysius smylie had not yet had time or opportunity as was his intention to form and train a choir from the household of the towers he had secured from his neighboring parish and other sources external and effective aid in that respect the parts of the service were skillfully distributed and rarely were a greater number of priests enlisted in a more imposing manner a good organ was well played the singing as usual a little too noisy there was an anthem and an introitbut no incense which was forbidden by the bishop and though there were candles on the altar they were not permitted to be lighted  the sermon was most successful the ladies returned with elate and animated faces quite enthusiastic and almost forgetting in their satisfaction the terrible outrage of lord st aldegonde he himself had by this time repented of what he had done and recovered his temper and greeted his wife with a voice and look which indicated to her practised senses the favorable change  bertha he said you know i did not mean any thing personal to the bishop in what i said i do not like bishops i think there is no use in them but i have no objection to him personally i think him an agreeable man not at all a bore just put it right bertha but i tell you what bertha i cannot go to church here lord culloden does not go and he is a very religious man he is the man i most agree with on these matters i am a freechurch man and there is on end of it i cannot go this afternoon i do not approve of the whole thing it is altogether against my conscience what i mean to do if i can manage it is to take a real long walk with the campians  mrs campian appeared at luncheon the bishop was attentive to her even cordial he was resolved she should not feel he was annoyed by her not having been a member of his congregation in the morning lady corisande too had said to him i wish so much you would talk to mrs campian she is a sweet noble creature and so clever i feel that she might be brought to view things in the right light  i never know said the bishop how to deal with these american ladies i never can make out what they believe or what they disbelieve it is a sort of confusion between mrs beecher stowe and the fifth avenue congregation andbarnum he added with a twinkling eye  the second service was late the dean preached the lateness of the hour permitted the lordlieutenant and those guests who had arrived only the previous day to look over the castle or ramble about the gardens st aldegonde succeeded in his scheme of a real long walk with the campians which lothair bound to listen to the head of his college was not permitted to share  in the evening signor mardoni who had arrived and madame isola bella favored them with what they called sacred music principally prayers from operas and a grand stabat mater  lord culloden invited lothair into a farther saloon where they might speak without disturbing the performers or the audience  ill just take advantage my dear boy said lord culloden in a tone of unusual tenderness and of doric accent of the absence of these gentlemen to have a little quiet conversation with you though i have not seen so much of you of late as in old days i take a great interest in you no doubt of that and i was very pleased to see how goodnatured you were to the girls you have romped with them when they were little ones now in a few hours you will be master of a great inheritance and i hope it will profit ye i have been over the accounts with mr giles and i was pleased to hear that you had made yourself properly acquainted with them in detail never you sign any paper without reading it first and knowing well what it means you will have to sign a release to us if you be satisfied and that you may easily be my poor brotherinlaw left you as large an income as may be found on this side trent but i will be bound he would stare if he saw the total of the whole of your rentroll lothair your affairs have been well administered though i say it who ought not but it is not my management only or principally that has done it it is the progress of the country and you owe the country a good deal and you should never forget you are born to be a protector of its liberties civil and religious and if the country sticks to free trade and would enlarge its currency and be firm to the protestant faith it will under divine providence continue to progress  and here my boy ill just say a word in no disagreeable manner about your religious principles there are a great many stories about and perhaps they are not true and i am sure i hope they are not if popery were only just the sign of the cross and music and censerpots though i think them all superstitious id be free to leave them alone if they would leave me but popery is a much deeper thing than that lothair and our fathers found it out they could not stand it and we should be a craven crew to stand it now a man should be master in his own house you will be taking a wife some day at least it is to be hoped so and how will you like one of these monsignores to be walking into her bedroom eh and talking to her alone when he pleases and where he pleases and when you want to consult your wife which a wise man should often do to find there is another mind between hers and yours theres my girls they are just two young geese and they have a hankering after popery having had a jesuit in the house i do not know what has become of the women they are for going into a convent and they are quite right in that for if they be papists they will not find a husband easily in scotland i ween  and as for you my boy they will be telling you that it is only just this and just that and theres no great difference and what not but i tell you that if once you embrace the scarlet lady you are a tainted corpse youll not be able to order your dinner without a priest and they will ride your best horses without saying with your leave or by your leave  the concert in time ceased there was a stir in the room the rev dionysius smylie moved about mysteriously and ultimately seemed to make an obeisance before the bishop it was time for prayers  shall you go said lord st aldegonde to mrs campian by whom he was sitting  i like to pray alone she answered  as for that said aldegonde i am not clear we ought to pray at all either in public or private it seems very arrogant in us to dictate to an allwise creator what we desire  i believe in the efficacy of prayer said theodora  and i believe in you said st aldegonde after a momentary pause    chapter 47   on the morrow the early celebration in the chapel was numerously attended the duchess and her daughters lady agramont and mrs ardenne were among the faithful but what encouraged and gratified the bishop was that the laymen on whom he less relied were numerously represented the lordlieutenant lord carisbrooke lord montairy bertram and hugo bohun accompanied lothair to the altar  after the celebration lothair retired to his private apartments it was arranged that he was to join his assembled friends at noon when he would receive their congratulations and some deputations from the county  at noon therefore preparatively preceded by mr putney giles whose thought was never asleep and whose eye was on every thing the guardians the cardinal and the earl of culloden waited on lothair to accompany him to his assembled friends and as it were launch him into the world  they were assembled at one end of the chief gallery and in a circle although the deputations would have to advance the whole length of the chamber lothair and his guardians entered from a side apartment even with this assistance he felt very nervous there was no lack of feeling and among many of deep feeling on this occasion but there was an equal and a genuine exhibition of ceremony  the lordlieutenant was the first person who congratulated lothair though the highsheriff had pushed forward for that purpose but in his awkward precipitation he got involved with the train of the hon lady clotworthy who bestowed on him such a withering glance that he felt a routed man and gave up the attempt there were many kind and some earnest words even st aldegonde acknowledged the genius of the occasion he was grave graceful and dignified and addressing lothair by his title he said that he hoped he would meet in life that happiness which he felt confident he deserved theodora said nothing though her lips seemed once to move but she retained for a moment lothairs hand and the expression of her countenance touched his innermost heart lady corisande beamed with dazzling beauty her countenance was joyous radiant her mien imperial and triumphant she gave her hand with graceful alacrity to lothair and said in a hushed tone but every word of which reached his ear one of the happiest hours of my life was eight oclock this morning  the lordlieutenant and the county members then retired to the other end of the gallery and ushered in the deputation of the magistracy of the county congratulating their new brother for lothair had just been appointed to the bench on his secession to his estates the lordlieutenant himself read the address to which lothair replied with a propriety all acknowledged then came the address of the mayor and corporation of grandchester of which city lothair was hereditary highsteward and then that of his tenantry which was cordial and characteristic and here many were under the impression that this portion of the proceedings would terminate but it was not so there had been some whispering between the bishop and the archdeacon and the rev dionysius smylie had after conference with his superiors twice left the chamber it seems that the clergy had thought fit to take this occasion of congratulating lothair on his great accession and the proportionate duties which it would fall on him to fulfil the bishop approached lothair and addressed him in a whisper lothair seemed surprised and a little agitated but apparently bowed assent then the bishop and his staff proceeded to the end of the gallery and introduced a diocesan deputation consisting of archdeacons and rural deans who presented to lothair a most uncompromising address and begged his acceptance of a bible and prayerbook richly bound and borne by the rev dionysius smylie on a cushion of velvet  the habitual pallor of the cardinals countenance became unusually wan the cheek of clare arundel was a crimson flush monsignore catesby bit his lip theodora looked with curious seriousness as if she were observing the manners of a foreign country st aldegonde snorted and pushed his hand through his hair which had been arranged in unusual order the great body of those present unaware that this deputation was unexpected were unmoved  it was a trial for lothair and scarcely a fair one he was not unequal to it and what he said was esteemed at the moment by all parties as satisfactory though the archdeacon in secret conclave afterward observed that he dwelt more on religion than on the church and spoke of the church of christ and not of the church of england he thanked them for their present of volumes which all must reverence or respect  while all this was taking place within the towers vast bodies of people were assembling without besides the notables of the county and his tenantry and their families which drained all the neighboring villages lothair had forwarded several thousand tickets to the mayor and corporation of grandchester for distribution among their fellowtownsmen who were invited to dine at muriel and partake of the festivities of the day and trains were hourly arriving with their eager and happy guests the gardens were at once open for their unrestricted pleasure but at two oclock according to the custom of the county under such circumstances lothair held what in fact was a lev e or rather a drawingroom when every person who possessed a ticket was permitted and even invited and expected to pass through the whole range of the state apartments of muriel towers and at the same time pay their respects to and make the acquaintance of their lord  lothair stood with his chief friends near him the ladies however seated and every one passedfarmers and townsmen and honest folk down to the stokers of the trains from grandchester with whose presence st aldegonde was much pleased and whom he carefully addressed as they passed by  after this great reception they all dined in pavilions in the parkone thousand tenantry by themselves and at a fixed hour the miscellaneous multitude in a huge crimson tent very lofty with many flags and in which was served a banquet that never stopped till sunset so that in time all might be satisfied the notables and deputations with the guests in the house lunched in the armory it was a bright day and there was unceasing music  in the course of the afternoon lothair visited the pavilions where his health was proposed and pledgedin the first by one of his tenants and in the other by a workman both orators of repute and he addressed and thanked his friends this immense multitude orderly and joyous roamed about the parks and gardens or danced on a platform which the prescient experience of mr giles had provided for them in a due locality and whiled away the pleasant hours in expectation a little feverish of the impending fireworks which there was a rumor were to be on a scale and in a style of which neither grandchester nor the county had any tradition  i remember your words at blenheim said lothair to theodora you cannot say the present party is founded on the principle of exclusion  in the mean time about six oclock lothair dined in his great hall with his two hundred guests at a banquet where all the resources of nature and art seemed called upon to contribute to its luxury and splendor the ladies who had never before dined at a public dinner were particularly delighted they were delighted by the speeches though they had very few they were delighted by the national anthem all rising particularly they were delighted by threetimesthree and one cheer more and hip hip it seemed to their unpractised ears like a great naval battle or the end of the world or any thing else of unimaginable excitement tumult and confusion  the lordlieutenant proposed lothairs health and dexterously made his comparative ignorance of the subject the cause of his attempting a sketch of what he hoped might be the character of the person whose health he proposed every one intuitively felt the resemblance was just and even complete and lothair confirmed their kind and sanguine anticipations by his terse and wellconsidered reply his proposition of the ladies healths was a signal that the carriages were ready to take them as arranged to muriel mere  the sun had set in glory over the broad expanse of waters still glowing in the dying beam the people were assembled in thousands on the borders of the lake in the centre of which was an island with a pavilion fanciful barges and gondolas of various shapes and colors were waiting for lothair and his party to carry them over to the pavilion where they found a repast which became the hour and the scenecoffee and ices and whimsical drinks which sultanas would sip in arabian tales no sooner were they seated than the sound of music was hearddistant but now nearer till there came floating on the lake until it rested before the pavilion a gigantic shell larger than the building itself but holding in its golden and opal seats signor mardoni and all his orchestra  then came a concert rare in itself but ravishing in the rosy twilight and in about half an hour when the rosy twilight had subsided into a violet eve and when the white moon that had only gleamed began to glitter the colossal shell again moved on and lothair and his companions embarking once more in their gondolas followed it in procession about the lake he carried in his own bark the duchess theodora and the lordlieutenant and was rowed by a crew in venetian dresses as he handed theodora to her seat the impulse was irresistiblehe pressed her hand to his lips  suddenly a rocket rose with a hissing rush from the pavilion it was instantly responded to from every quarter of the lake then the island seemed on fire and the scene of their late festivity became a brilliant palace with pediments and columns and statues bright in the blaze of colored flame for half an hour the sky seemed covered with blue lights and the bursting forms of manycolored stars golden fountains like the eruption of a marine volcano rose from different parts of the water the statued palace on the island changed and became a forest glowing with green light and finally a temple of cerulean tint on which appeared in huge letters of prismatic color the name of lothair  the people cheered but even the voice of the people was overcome by troops of rockets rising from every quarter of the lake and by the thunder of artillery when the noise and the smoke had both subsided the name of lothair still legible on the temple but the letters quite white it was perceived that on every height for fifty miles round they had fired a beacon    chapter 48   the ball at muriel which followed the concert on the lake was one of those balls which it would seem never would end all the preliminary festivities instead of exhausting the guests of lothair appeared only to have excited them and rendered them more romantic and less tolerant of the routine of existence they danced in the great gallery which was brilliant and crowded and they danced as they dance in a festive dream with joy and the enthusiasm of gayety the fine ladies would sanction no exclusiveness they did not confine their inspiring society as is sometimes too often the case to the brecons and the bertrams and the carisbrookes they danced fully and freely with the youth of the county and felt that in so doing they were honoring and gratifying their host  at one oclock they supped in the armory which was illuminated for the first time and a banquet in a scene so picturesque and resplendent renovated not merely their physical energies at four oclock the duchess and a few others quietly disappeared but her daughters remained and st aldegonde danced endless reels which was a form in which he preferred to worship terpsichore perceiving by an open window that it was dawn he came up to lothair and said this is a case of breakfast  happy and frolicsome suggestion the invitations circulated and it was soon known that they were all to gather at the matin meal  i am so sorry that her grace has retired said hugo bohun to lady st aldegonde as he fed her with bread and butter because she always likes early breakfasts in the country  the sun was shining as the guests of the house retired and sank into couches from which it seemed they never could rise again but long after this the shouts of servants and the scuffle of carriages intimated that the company in general were not so fortunate and expeditious in their retirement from the scene and the fields were all busy and even the towns awake when the great body of the wearied but delighted wassailers returned from celebrating the majority of lothair  in the vast and statesmanlike programme of the festivities of the week which had been prepared by mr and mrs putney giles something of interest and importance had been appropriated to the morrow but it was necessary to erase all this and for a simple reasonno human being on the morrow morn even appearedone might say even stirred after all the gay tumult in which even thousands had joined muriel towers on the morrow presented a scene which only could have been equalled by the castle in the fairy tale inhabited by the sleeping beauty  at length about two hours after noon bells began to sound which were not always answered then a languid household prepared a meal of which no one for a time partook till at last a monsignore appeared and a rival anglican or two then st aldegonde came in with a troop of men who had been bathing in the mere and called loudly for kidneys which happened to be the only thing not at hand as is always the case st aldegonde always required kidneys when he had sat up all night and bathed but the odd thing is he said you never can get any thing to eat in these houses their infernal cooks spoil every thing thats why i hate staying with berthas people in the north at the end of the year what i want in november is a slice of cod and a beefsteak and by jove i never could get them i was obliged to come to town if is no joke to have to travel three hundred miles for a slice of cod and a beefsteak  notwithstanding all this however such is the magic of custom that by sunset civilization had resumed its reign at muriel towers the party were assembled before dinner in the saloon and really looked as fresh and bright as if the exhausting and tumultuous yesterday had never happened the dinner too notwithstanding the criticism of st aldegonde was first rate and pleased palates not so simply fastidious as his own the bishop and his suite were to depart on the morrow but the cardinal was to remain his eminence talked much to mrs campian by whom from the first he was much struck he was aware that she was born a roman and was not surprised that having married a citizen of the united states her sympathies were what are styled liberal but this only stimulated his anxious resolution to accomplish her conversion both religious and political he recognized in her a being whose intelligence imagination and grandeur of character might be of invaluable service to the church  in the evening monsieur raphael and his sister and their colleagues gave a representation which was extremely well done there was no theatre at muriel but apollonia had felicitously arranged a contiguous saloon for the occasion and as everybody was at ease in an armchair they all agreed it was preferable to a regular theatre  on the morrow they were to lunch with the mayor and corporation of grandchester and view some of the principal factories on the next day the county gave a dinner to lothair in their hall the lordlieutenant in the chair on friday there was to be a ball at grandchester given by the county and city united to celebrate the great local event it was whispered that this was to be a considerable affair there was not an hour of the week that was not appropriated to some festive ceremony  it happened on the morning of friday the cardinal being alone with lothair transacting some lingering business connected with the guardianship and on his legs as he spoke that he said we live in such a happy tumult here my dear child that i have never had an opportunity of speaking to you on one or two points which interest me and should not be uninteresting to you i remember a pleasant morningwalk we had in the park at vauxe when we began a conversation which we never finished what say you to a repetition of our stroll tis a lovely day and i dare say we might escape by this window and gain some green retreat without any one disturbing us  i am quite of your eminences mind said lothair taking up a wideawake and i will lead you where it is not likely we shall be disturbed  so winding their way through the pleasuregrounds they entered by a wicket a part of the park where the sunny glades soon wandered among the tall fern and wild groves of venerable oaks  i sometimes feel said the cardinal that i may have been too punctilious in avoiding conversation with you on a subject the most interesting and important to man but i felt a delicacy in exerting my influence as a guardian on a subject my relations to which when your dear father appointed me to that office were so different from those which now exist but you are now your own master i can use no control over you but that influence which the words of truth must always exercise over an ingenuous mind  his eminence paused for a moment and looked at his companion but lothair remained silent with his eyes fixed upon the ground  it has always been a source of satisfaction i would even say consolation to me resumed the cardinal to know you were a religious man that your disposition was reverential which is the highest order of temperament and brings us nearest to the angels but we live in times of difficulty and dangerextreme difficulty and danger a religious disposition may suffice for youth in the tranquil hour and he may find in due season his appointed restingplace but these are days of imminent peril the soul requires a sanctuary is yours at hand  the cardinal paused and lothair was obliged to meet a direct appeal he said then after a momentary hesitation when you last spoke to me sir on these grave matters i said i was in a state of great despondency my situation now is not so much despondent as perplexed  and i wish you to tell me the nature of your perplexity replied the cardinal for there is no anxious embarrassment of mind which divine truth cannot disentangle and allay  well said lothair i must say i am often perplexed at the differences which obtrude themselves between divine truth and human knowledge  those are inevitable said the cardinal divine truth being unchangeable and human knowledge changing every century rather i should say every generation  perhaps instead of human knowledge i should have said human progress rejoined lothair  exactly said the cardinal but what is progress movement but what if it be movement in the wrong direction what if it be a departure from divine truth  but i cannot understand why religion should be inconsistent with civilization said lothair  religion is civilization said the cardinal the highest it is a reclamation of man from savageness by the almighty what the world calls civilization as distinguished from religion is a retrograde movement and will ultimately lead us back to the barbarism from which we have escaped for instance you talk of progress what is the chief social movement of all the countries that three centuries ago separated from the unity of the church of christ the rejection of the sacrament of christian matrimony the introduction of the law of divorce which is in fact only a middle term to the abolition of marriage what does that mean the extinction of the home and the household on which god has rested civilization if there be no home the child belongs to the state not to the parent the state educates the child and without religion because the state in a country of progress acknowledges no religion for every man is not only to think as he likes but to write and to speak as he likes and to sow with both hands broadcast where he will errors heresies and blasphemies without any authority on earth to restrain the scattering of this seed of universal desolation and this system which would substitute for domestic sentiment and divine belief the unlimited and licentious action of human intellect and human will is called progress what is it but a revolt against god  i am sure i wish there were only one church and one religion said lothair  there is only one church and only one religion said the cardinal all other forms and phrases are mere phantasms without root or substance or coherency look at that unhappy germany once so proud of its reformation what they call the leading journal tells us today that it is a question there whether fourfifths or threefourths of the population believe in christianity some portion of it has already gone back i understand to number nip look at this unfortunate land divided subdivided parcelled out in infinite schism with new oracles every day and each more distinguished for the narrowness of his intellect or the loudness of his lungs once the land of saints and scholars and people in pious pilgrimages and finding always solace and support in the divine offices of an everpresent church which were a true though a faint type of the beautiful future that awaited man why only three centuries of this rebellion against the most high have produced throughout the world on the subject the most important that man should possess a clear firm faith an anarchy of opinion throwing out every monstrous and fantastic form from a caricature of the greek philosophy to a revival of fetichism  it is a chaos said lothair with a sigh  from which i wish to save you said the cardinal with some eagerness this is not a time to hesitate you must be for god or for antichrist the church calls upon her children  i am not unfaithful to the church said lothair which was the church of my fathers  the church of england said the cardinal it was mine i think of it ever with tenderness and pity parliament made the church of england and parliament will unmake the church of england the church of england is not the church of the english its fate is sealed it will soon become a sect and all sects are fantastic it will adopt new dogmas or it will abjure old ones any thing to distinguish it from the nonconforming herd in which nevertheless it will be its fate to merge the only consoling hope is that when it falls many of its children by the aid of the blessed virgin may return to christ  what i regret sir said lothair is that the church of rome should have placed itself in antagonism with political liberty this adds to the difficulties which the religious cause has to encounter for it seems impossible to deny that political freedom is now the sovereign passion of communities  i cannot admit replied the cardinal that the church is in antagonism with political freedom on the contrary in my opinion there can be no political freedom which is not founded on divine authority otherwise it can be at the best but a specious phantom of license inevitably terminating in anarchy the rights and liberties of the people of ireland have no advocates except the church because there political freedom is founded on divine authority but if you mean by political freedom the schemes of the illuminati and the freemasons which perpetually torture the continent all the dark conspiracies of the secret societies there i admit the church is in antagonism with such aspirations after liberty those aspirations in fact are blasphemy and plunder and if the church were to be destroyed europe would be divided between the atheist and the communist  there was a pause the conversation had unexpectedly arrived at a point where neither party cared to pursue it lothair felt he had said enough the cardinal was disappointed with what lothair had said his eminence felt that his late ward was not in that ripe state of probation which he had fondly anticipated but being a man not only of vivid perception but also of fertile resource while he seemed to close the present conversation he almost immediately pursued his object by another combination of means noticing an effect of scenery which pleased him reminded him of styria and so on he suddenly said you should travel  well bertram wants me to go to egypt with him said lothair  a most interesting country said the cardinal and well worth visiting it is astonishing what a good guide old herodotus still is in that land but you should know something of europe before you go there egypt is rather a land to end with a young man should visit the chief capitals of europe especially the seats of learning and the arts if my advice were asked by a young man who contemplated travelling on a proper scale i should say begin with rome almost all that europe contains is derived from rome it is always best to go to the fountainhead to study the original the society too there is delightful i know none equal to it that if you please is civilizationpious and refined and the peopleall so gifted and so goodso kind so orderly so charitable so truly virtuous i believe the roman people to be the best people that ever lived and this too while the secret societies have their foreign agents in every quarter trying to corrupt them but always in vain if an act of political violence occurs you may be sure it is confined entirely to foreigners  our friends the st jeromes are going to rome said lothair  well and that would be pleasant for you think seriously of this my dear young friend i could be of some little service to you if you go to rome which after all every man ought to do i could put you in the way of easily becoming acquainted with all the right people who would take care that you saw rome with profit and advantage  just at this moment in a winding glade they were met abruptly by a third person all seemed rather to start at the sudden rencounter and then lothair eagerly advanced and welcomed the stranger with a proffered hand  this is a most unexpected but to me most agreeable meeting he said you must now be my guest  that would be a great honor said the stranger but one i cannot enjoy i had to wait at the station a couple of hours or so for my train and they told me if i strolled here i should find some pretty country i have been so pleased with it that i fear i have strolled too long and i literally have not an instant at my command and he hurried away  who is that person asked the cardinal with some agitation  i have not the slightest idea said lothair all i know is he once saved my life  and all i know is said the cardinal he once threatened mine  strange said lothair and then he rapidly recounted to the cardinal his adventure at the fenian meeting  strange echoed his eminence    chapter 49   mrs campian did not appear at luncheon which was observed but not noticed afterward while lothair was making some arrangements for the amusement of his guests and contriving that they should fit in with the chief incident of the day which was the banquet given to him by the county and which it was settled the ladies were not to attend the colonel took him aside and said i do not think that theodora will care to go out today  she is not unwell i hope  not exactlybut she has had some news some news of some friends which has disturbed her and if you will excuse me i will request your permission not to attend the dinner today which i had hoped to have had the honor of doing but i think our plans must be changed a little i almost think we shall not go to scotland after all  there is not the slightest necessity for your going to the dinner you will have plenty to keep you in countenance at home lord st aldegonde is not going nor i fancy any of them i shall take the duke with me and lord culloden and if you do not go i shall take mr putney giles the lordlieutenant will meet us there i am sorry about mrs campian because i know she is not ever put out by little things may i not see her in the course of the day i should be very sorry that the day should pass over without seeing her  oh i dare say she will see you in the course of the day before you go  when she likes i shall not go out today i shall keep in my rooms always at her commands between ourselves i shall not be sorry to have a quiet morning and collect my ideas a little speechmaking is a new thing for me i wish you would tell me what to say to the county  lothair had appropriated to the campians one of the most convenient and complete apartments in the castle it consisted of four chambers one of them a saloon which had been fitted up for his mother when she married a pretty saloon hung with palegreen silk and portraits and scenes inlaid by vanloo and boucher it was rather late in the afternoon when lothair received a message from theodora in reply to the wish that he had expressed of seeing her  when he entered the room she was not seated her countenance was serious she advanced and thanked him for wishing to see her and regretted she could not receive him at an earlier hour i fear it may have inconvenienced you she added but my mind has been much disturbed and too agitated for conversation  even now i may be an intruder  no it is past on the contrary i wish to speak to you indeed you are the only person with whom i could speak and she sat down  her countenance which was unusually pale when he entered became flushed it is not a subject for the festive hour of your life she said but i cannot resist my fate  your fate must always interest me murmured lothair  yes but my fate is the fate of ages and of nations said theodora throwing up her head with that tumult of the brow which he had once before noticed amid the tortures of my spirit at this moment not the least is that there is only one person i can appeal to and he is one to whom i have no right to make that appeal  if i be that person said lothair you have every right for i am devoted to you  yes but it is not personal devotion that is the qualification needed it is not sympathy with me that would authorize such an appeal it must be sympathy with a cause and a cause for which i fear you do notperhaps i should say you cannotfeel  why said lothair  why should you feel for my fallen country who are the proudest citizen of the proudest of lands why should you feel for its debasing thraldomyou who in the religious mystification of man have at least the noble privilege of being a protestant  you speak of rome  yes of the only thought i have or ever had i speak of that country which first impressed upon the world a general and enduring form of masculine virtue the land of liberty and law and eloquence and military genius now garrisoned by monks and governed by a doting priest  everybody must be interested about rome said lothair rome is the country of the world and even the doting priest you talk of boasts of two hundred millions of subjects  if he were at avignon again i should not care for his boasts said theodora i do not grudge him his spiritual subjects i am content to leave his superstition to time time is no longer slow his scythe mows quickly in this age but when his debasing creeds are palmed off on man by the authority of our glorious capitol and the slavery of the human mind is schemed and carried on in the forum then if there be real roman blood leftand i thank my creator there is muchit is time for it to mount and move and she rose and walked up and down the room  you have had news from rome said lothair  i have had news from rome she replied speaking slowly in a deep voice and there was a pause  then lothair said when you have alluded to these matters before you never spoke of them in a sanguine spirit  i have seen the cause triumph said theodora the sacred cause of truth of justice of national honor i have sat at the feet of the triumvirate of the roman republic men who for virtue and genius and warlike skill and valor and every quality that exalts man were never surpassed in the olden timeno not by the catos and the scipios and i have seen the blood of my own race poured like a rich vintage on the victorious roman soil my father fell who in stature and in mien was a god and since then my beautiful brothers with shapes to enshrine in temples and i have smiled amid the slaughter of my race for i believed that rome was free and yet all this vanished how then when we talked could i be sanguine  and yet you are sanguine now said lothair with a scrutinizing glance and he rose and joined her leaning slightly on the mantelpiece  there was only one event that could secure the success of our efforts said theodora and that event was so improbable that i had long rejected it from calculation it has happened and rome calls upon me to act  the papalini are strong continued theodora after a pause they have been long preparing for the french evacuation they have a considerable and disciplined force of janizaries a powerful artillery the strong places of the city the result of a rising under such circumstances might be more than doubtful if unsuccessful to us it would be disastrous it is necessary that the roman states should be invaded and the papal army must then quit their capital we have no fear of them in the field yes she added with energy we could sweep them from the face of the earth  but the army of italy said lothair will that be inert  there it is said theodora that has been our stumblingblock i have always known that if ever the french quitted rome it would be on the understanding that the house of savoy should inherit the noble office of securing our servitude he in whom i alone confide would never credit this but my information in this respect was authentic however it is no longer necessary to discuss the question news has come and in no uncertain shape that whatever may have been the understanding under no circumstances will the italian army enter the roman state we must strike therefore and rome will be free but how am i to strike we have neither money nor arms we have only men i can give them no more because i have already given them every thing except my life which is always theirs as for my husband who i may say wedded me on the battlefield so fax as wealth was concerned he was then a prince among princes and would pour forth his treasure and his life with equal eagerness but things have changed since aspromonte the struggle in his own country has entirely deprived him of revenues as great as any forfeited by their italian princelings in fact it is only by a chance that he is independent had it not been for an excellent man one of your great english merchants who was his agent here and managed his affairs we should have been penniless his judicious investments of the superfluity of our income which at the time my husband never even noticed have secured for colonel campian the means of that decorous life which he appreciatesbut no more as for myself these considerations are nothing i will not say i should be insensible to a refined life with refined companions if the spirit were content and the heart serene but i never could fully realize the abstract idea of what they call wealth i never could look upon it except as a means to an end and my end has generally been military material perhaps the vicissitudes of my life have made me insensible to what are called reverses of fortune for when a child i remember sleeping on the moonlit flags of paris with no pillow except my tambourine and i remember it not without delight let us sit down i feel i am talking in an excited injudicious egotistical rhapsodical manner i thought i was calm and i meant to have been clear but the fact is i am ashamed of myself i am doing a wrong thing and in a wrong manner but i have had a sleepless night and a day of brooding thought i meant once to have asked you to help me and now i feel that you are the last person to whom i ought to appeal  in that you are in error said lothair rising and taking her hand with an expression of much gravity i am the right person for you to appeal tothe only person  nay said theodora and she shook her head  for i owe to you a debt that i never can repay continued lothair had it not been for you i should have remained what i was when we first met a prejudiced narrowminded being with contracted sympathies and false knowledge wasting my life on obsolete trifles and utterly insensible to the privilege of living in this wondrous age of change and progress why had it not been for you i should have at this very moment been lavishing my fortune on an ecclesiastical toy which i think of with a blush there may bedoubtless there areopinions in which we may not agree but in our love of truth and justice there is no difference dearest lady no though you must have felt that i am notthat no one could beinsensible to your beauty and infinite charms still it is your consummate character that has justly fascinated my thought and heart and i have long resolved were i permitted to devote to you my fortune and my life    chapter 50   the month of september was considerably advanced when a cab evidently from its luggage fresh from the railway entered the courtyard of hexham house of which the shuttered windows indicated the absence of its master the cardinal then in italy but it was evident that the person who had arrived was expected for before his servant could ring the hallbell the door opened and a gravelooking domestic advanced with much deference and awaited the presence of no less a personage than monsignore berwick  we have had a rough passage good clifford said the great man alighting but i see you duly received my telegram you are always ready  i hope my lord will find it not uncomfortable said clifford i have prepared the little suite which you mentioned and have been careful that there should be no outward sign of any one having arrived  and now said the monsignore stopping for a moment in the ball here is a letter which must be instantly delivered and by a trusty hand and he gave it to mr clifford who looking at the direction nodded his head and said by no one but myself i will show my lord to his rooms and depart with this instantly  and bring back a reply added the monsignore  the welllit room the cheerful fire the judicious refection on a sidetable were all circumstances which usually would have been agreeable to a wearied traveller but monsignore berwick seemed little to regard them though a man in general superior to care and master of thought his countenance was troubled and pensive even to dejection  even the winds and waves are against us he exclaimed too restless to be seated and walking up and down the room with his arms behind his back that such a struggle should fall to my lot why was i not a minister in the days of the gregorys the innocents even the leos but this is craven there should be inspiration in peril and the greatest where peril is extreme i am a little upsetwith travel and the voyage and those telegrams not being answered the good clifford was wisely provident and he approached the table and took one glass of wine good one must never despair in such a cause and if the worse happens it has happened beforeand what then suppose avignon over again or even gaeta or even paris so long as we never relinquish our title to the eternal city we shall be eternal but then some say our enemies before were the sovereigns now it is the people is it so true we have vanquished kings and baffled emperorsbut the french republic and the roman republic have alike reigned and ruled in the vatican and where are they we have lost provinces but we have also gained them we have twelve millions of subjects in the united states of america and they will increase like the sands of the sea still it is a hideous thing to have come back as it were to the days of the constable of bourbon and to be contemplating the siege of the holy see and massacre and pillage and ineffable horrors the papacy may survive such calamities as it undoubtedly will but i shall scarcely figure in history if under my influence such visitations should accrue if i had only to deal with men i would not admit of failure but when your antagonists are human thoughts represented by invisible powers there is something that might baffle a machiavel and appall a borgia  while he was meditating in this vein the door opened and mr clifford with some hasty action and speaking rapidly exclaimed he said he would be here sooner than myself his carriage was at the door i drove back as soon as possibleand indeed i hear something now in the court and he disappeared  it was only to usher in almost immediately a stately personage in an evening dress and wearing a decoration of a high class who saluted the monsignore with great cordiality  i am engaged to dine with the prussian ambassador who has been obliged to come to town to receive a prince of the blood who is visiting the dockyards here but i thought you might be later than you expected and i ordered my carriage to be in waiting so that we have a good little hourand i can come on to you again afterward if that will not do  a little hour with us is a long hour with other people said the monsignore because we are friends and can speak without windings you are a true friend to the holy see you have proved it we are in great trouble and need of aid  i hear that things are not altogether as we could wish said the gentleman in an evening dress but i hope and should think only annoyances  dangers said berwick and great  how so  well we have invasion threatening us without and insurrection within said berwick we might though it is doubtful successfully encounter one of these perils but their united action must be fatal  all this has come suddenly said the gentleman in the summer you had no fear and our people wrote to us that we might be perfectly tranquil  just so said berwick if we had met a month ago i should have told you the same thing a month ago the revolution seemed lifeless penniless without a future without a resource they had no money no credit no men at present quietly but regularly they are assembling by thousands on our frontiers thy have to our knowledge received two large consignments of small arms and apparently have unlimited credit with the trade both in birmingham and li ge they have even artillery every thing is paid for in coin or in good billsand worst of all they have a man the most consummate soldier in europe i thought he was at new york and was in hopes he would never have recrossed the atlanticbut i know that he passed through florence a fortnight ago and i have seen a man who says he spoke to him at narni  the italian government must stop all this said the gentleman  they do not stop it said berwick the government of his holiness has made every representation to them we have placed in their hands indubitable evidence of the illegal proceedings that are taking place and of the internal dangers we experience in consequence of their exterior movements but they do nothing it is even believed that the royal troops are joining the insurgents and garibaldi is spouting with impunity in every balcony of florence  you may depend upon it that our government is making strong representations to the government of florence  i come from paris and elsewhere said berwick with animation and perhaps a degree of impatience i have seen everybody there and i have heard every thing it is not representations that are wanted from your government it is something of a different kind  but if you have seen everybody at paris and heard every thing how can i help you  by acting upon the government here a word from you to the english minister would have great weight at this juncture queen victoria is interested in the maintenance of the papal throne her catholic subjects are counted by millions the influence of his holiness has been hitherto exercised against the fenians france would interfere if she was sure the step would not be disapproved by england  interfere said the gentleman our return to rome almost before we have paid our laundresses bills in the eternal city would be a diplomatic scandal  a diplomatic scandal would be preferable to a european revolution  suppose we were to have both and the gentleman drew his chair near the fire  i am convinced that a want of firmness now said berwick would lead to inconceivable calamities for all of us  let us understand each other my very dear friend berwick said his companion and he threw his arm over the back of his chair and looked the roman full in his face you say you have been at paris and elsewhere and have seen everybody and heard every thing  yes yes  something has happened to us also during the last month and as unexpectedly as to yourselves  the secret societies yes he spoke to me on that very point and fully tis strange but is only in my opinion an additional argument in favor of crushing the evil influence  well that he must decide but the facts are startling a month ago the secret societies in france were only a name they existed only in the memory of the police and almost as a tradition at present we know that they are in complete organization and what is most strange is that the prefects write they have information that the maryanne associations which are essentially republican and are scattered about the provinces are all revived and are astir maryanne as you know was the red name for the republic years ago and there always was a sort of myth that these societies had been founded by a woman of course that is all nonsense but they keep it up it affects the public imagination and my government has undoubted evidence that the word of command has gone round to all these societies that maryanne has returned and will issue her orders which must be obeyed  the church is stronger and especially in the provinces than the maryanne societies said berwick  i hope so said his friend but you see my dear monsignore the question with us is not so simple as you put it the secret societies will not tolerate another roman interference to say nothing of the diplomatic hubbub which we might if necessary defy but what if taking advantage of the general indignation your new kingdom of italy may seize the golden opportunity of making a popular reputation and declare herself the champion of national independence against the interference of the foreigner my friend we tread on delicate ground  if rome falls not an existing dynasty in europe will survive five years said berwick  it may be so said his companion but with no expression of incredulity you know how consistently and anxiously i have always labored to support the authority of the holy see and to maintain its territorial position as the guarantee of its independence but fate has decided against us i cannot indulge in the belief that his holiness will ever regain his lost provinces a capital without a country is an apparent anomaly which i fear will always embarrass us we can treat the possession as the capital of christendom but alas all the world are not as good christians as ourselves and christendom is a country no longer marked out in the map of the world i wish continued the gentleman in a tone almost coaxingi wish we could devise some plan which humanly speaking would secure to his holiness the possession of his holy throne forever i wish i could induce you to consider more favorably that suggestion that his holiness should content himself with the ancient city and in possession of st peters and the vatican leave the rest of rome to the vulgar cares and the mundane anxieties of the transient generation yes he added with energy if my dear berwick you could see your way to this or something like this i think even now and at once i could venture to undertake that the emperor my master would soon put an end to all these disturbances and dangers and that  non possumus said berwick sternly stopping him sooner than that attila the constable of bourbon or the blasphemous orgies of the red republic after all it is the church against the secret societies they are the only two strong things in europe and will survive kings emperors or parliaments  at this moment there was a tap at the door and bidden to enter mr clifford presented himself with a sealed paper for the gentleman in evening dress your secretary sir brought this which he said must be given you before you went to the ambassador  tis well said the gentleman and he rose and with a countenance of some excitement read the paper which contained a telegram and then he said this i think will help us out of our immediate difficulties my dear monsignore rattazzi has behaved like a man of sense and has arrested garibaldi but you do not seem my friend as pleased as i should have anticipated  garibaldi has been arrested before said berwick  well well i am hopeful but i must go to my dinner i will see you again tomorrow    chapter 51   the continuous gathering of what in popular language were styled the garibaldi volunteers on the southern border of the papal territory in the autumn of 1867 was not the only or perhaps the greatest danger which then threatened the holy see though the one which most attracted its alarmed attention the considerable numbers in which this assemblage was suddenly occurring the fact that the son of the liberator had already taken its command and only as the precursor of his formidable sire the accredited rumor that ghirelli at the head of a purely roman legion was daily expected to join the frontier force that nicotera was stirring in the old neapolitan kingdom while the liberator himself at florence and in other parts of tuscany was even ostentatiously certainly with impunity preaching the new crusade and using all his irresistible influence with the populace to excite their sympathies and to stimulate their energy might well justify the extreme apprehension of the court of rome and yet dangers at least equal and almost as close were at the same time preparing unnoticed and unknown  in the mountainous range between fiascone and viterbo contiguous to the sea is a valley surrounded by chains of steep and barren hills but which is watered by a torrent scarcely dry even in summer so that the valley itself which is not inconsiderable in its breadth is never without verdure while almost a forest of brushwood formed of shrubs which in england we should consider rare bounds the natural turf and ascends sometimes to no inconsiderable height the nearest hills  into this valley toward the middle of september there defiled one afternoon through a narrow pass a band of about fifty men all armed and conducting a cavalcade or rather a caravan of mules laden with munitions of war and other stores when they had gained the centre of the valley and a general halt was accomplished their commander accompanied by one who was apparently an officer surveyed all the points of the locality and when their companions had rested and refreshed themselves they gave the necessary orders for the preparation of a camp the turf already afforded a sufficient area for their present wants but it was announced that on the morrow they must commence clearing the brushwood in the mean time one of the liveliest scenes of military life soon rapidly developed itself the canvas houses were pitched the sentries appointed the videttes established the commissariat was limited to bread and olives and generally the running stream varied sometimes by coffee and always consoled by tobacco  on the third day amid their cheerful though by no means light labors a second caravan arrived evidently expected and heartily welcomed then in another eightandforty hours smaller bodies of men seemed to drop down from the hills generally without stores but always armed then men came from neighboring islands in open boats and one morning a considerable detachment crossed the water from corsica so that at the end of a week or ten days there was an armed force of several hundred men in this once silent valley now a scene of constant stir and continual animation for some one or something was always arriving and from every quarter men and arms and stores crept in from every wild pass of the mountains and every little rocky harbor of the coast  about this time while the officer in command was reviewing a considerable portion of the troops the rest laboring in still clearing the brushwood and establishing the many works incidental to a camp half a dozen horsemen were seen descending the mountainpass by which the original body had entered the valley a scout had preceded them and the troops with enthusiasm awaited the arrival of that leader a message from whose magic name had summoned them to this secluded rendezvous from many a distant state and city unruffled but with an inspiring fire in his pleased keen eye that general answered their devoted salute whom hitherto we have known by his travelling name of captain bruges  it was only toward the end of the preceding month that he had resolved to take the field but the organization of the secret societies is so complete that he knew he could always almost instantly secure the assembling of a picked force in a particular place the telegraph circulated its mystic messages to every part of france and italy and belgium and to some old friends not so conveniently at hand but who he doubted not would arrive in due time for action he himself had employed the interval in forwarding all necessary supplies and he had passed through florence in order that he might confer with the great spirit of italian movement and plan with him the impending campaign  after he had passed in review the troops the general with the officers of his staff who had accompanied him visited on foot every part of the camp several of the men he recognized by name to all of them he addressed some inspiring word a memory of combats in which they had fought together or happy allusions to adventures if romantic peril some question which indicated that local knowledge which is magical for those who are away from home mixed with all this sharp clear inquiries as to the business of the hour which proved the master of detail severe in discipline but never deficient in sympathy for his troops  after sunset enveloped in their cloaks the general and his companions the party increased by the officers who had been in command previous to his arrival smoked their cigars round the campfire  well sarano said the general i will look over your musterroll tomorrow but i should suppose i may count on a thousand rifles or so i want three and we shall get them the great man would have supplied them me at once but i will not have boys he must send those on to menotti i told him i am not a man of genius i do not pretend to conquer kingdoms with boys give me old soldiers men who have served a couple of campaigns and been seasoned with fourandtwenty months of camplife and i will not disgrace you or myself  we have had no news from the other place for a long time said sarano how is it  well enough they are in the mountains about nerola in a position not very unlike this numerically strong for nicotera has joined them and ghirelli with the roman legion is at hand they must be quiet till the great man joins them i am told they are restless there has been too much noise about the whole business had they been as mum as you have been we should not have had all these representations from france and these threatened difficulties from that quarter the papalini would have complained and remonstrated and rattazzi could have conscientiously assured the people at paris that they were dealing with exaggerations and bugbears the very existence of the frontier force would have become a controversy and while the newspapers were proving it was a myth we should have been in the vatican  and when shall we be there general  i do not want to move for a month by that time i shall have two thousand five hundred or three thousand of my old comrades and the great man will have put his boys in trim both bodies must leave their mountains at the same time join in the open country and march to rome  as the night advanced several of the party rose and left the campfiresome to their tents some to their duties two of the staff remained with the general  i am disappointed and uneasy that we have not heard from paris said one of them  i am disappointed said the general but not uneasy she never makes a mistake  the risk was too great rejoined the speaker in a depressed tone  i do not see that said the general what is the risk who could possibly suspect the ladys maid of the princess of tivoli i am told that the princess has become quite a favorite at the tuileries  they say that the police is not so well informed as it used to be nevertheless i confess i should be much happier were she sitting round this campfire  courage said the general i do not believe in many things but i do believe in the divine theodora what say you captain muriel i hope you are not offended by my criticism of young soldiers you are the youngest in our band but you have good military stuff in you and will be soon seasoned  i feel i serve under a master of the art replied lothair and will not take the gloomy view of colonel campian about our best friend though i share all his disappointment it seems to me that detection is impossible i am sure that i could not have recognized her when i handed the princess into her carriage  the step was absolutely necessary said the general no one could be trusted but herselfno other person has the influence all our danger is from france the italian troops will never cross the frontier to attack us rest assured of that i have proof of it and it is most difficult almost impossible for the french to return there never would have been an idea of such a step if there had been a little more discretion at florence less of those manifestoes and speeches from balconies but we must not criticise one who is above criticism without him we could do nothing and when he stamps his foot men rise from the earth i will go the rounds come with me captain muriel colonel i order you to your tent you are a veteranthe only one among us at least on the staff who was wounded at aspromonte    chapter 52   the life of lothair had been so strange and exciting since he quitted muriel towers that he had found little time for that reflection in which he was once so prone to indulge perhaps he shrank from it if he wanted an easy distraction from selfcriticism it may be a convenient refuge from the scruples or even the pangs of conscienceit was profusely supplied by the startling affairs of which he formed a part the singular characters with whom he was placed in contact the risk and responsibility which seemed suddenly to have encompassed him with their everstimulating influence and lastly by the novelty of foreign travel which even under ordinary circumstances has a tendency to rouse and stir up even ordinary men  so long as theodora was his companion in their counsels and he was listening to her deep plans and daring suggestions enforced by that calm enthusiasm which was not the least powerful of her commanding spells it is not perhaps surprising that he should have yielded without an effort to her bewitching ascendancy but when they had separated and she had embarked on that perilous enterprise of personally conferring with the chiefs of those secret societies of france which had been fancifully baptized by her popular name and had nurtured her tradition as a religious faith it might have been supposed that lothair left to himself might have recurred to the earlier sentiments of his youth but he was not left to himself he was left with her injunctions and the spirit of the oracle though the divinity was no longer visible pervaded his mind and life  lothair was to accompany the general as one of his aidesdecamp and he was to meet theodora again on what was contemplated as the field of memorable actions theodora had wisely calculated on the influence beneficial in her view which the character of a man like the general would exercise over lothair this consummate military leader though he had pursued a daring career and was a man of strong convictions was distinguished by an almost unerring judgment and a mastery of method rarely surpassed though he was without imagination or sentiment there were occasions on which he had shown he was not deficient in a becoming sympathy and he had a rapid and correct perception of character he was a thoroughly honest man and in the course of a life of great trial and vicissitude even envenomed foes had never impeached his pure integrity for the rest he was unselfish but severe in discipline inflexible and even ruthless in the fulfilment of his purpose a certain simplicity of speech and conduct and a disinterestedness which even in little things was constantly exhibiting itself gave to his character even charm and rendered personal intercourse with him highly agreeable  in the countless arrangements which had to be made lothair was never wearied in recognizing and admiring the prescience and precision of his chief and when the day had died and for a moment they had ceased from their labors or were travelling together often through the night lothair found in the conversation of his companion artless and unrestrained a wonderful fund of knowledge both of men and things and that too in very different climes and countries  the camp in the apennines was not favorable to useless reverie lothair found unceasing and deeplyinteresting occupation in his numerous and novel duties and if his thoughts for a moment wandered beyond the barren peaks around him they were attracted and engrossed by one subjectand that was naturally theodora from her they had heard nothing since her departure except a mysterious though not discouraging telegram which was given to them by colonel campian when he had joined them at florence it was difficult not to feel anxious about her though the general would never admit the possibility of her personal danger  in this state of affairs a week having elapsed since his arrival at the camp lothair who had been visiting the outposts was summoned one morning by an orderly to the tent of the general that personage was on his legs when lothair entered it and was dictating to an officer writing at a table  you ought to know my military secretary said the general as lothair entered and therefore i will introduce you  lothair was commencing a suitable reverence of recognition as the secretary raised his head to receive it when he suddenly stopped changed color and for a moment seemed to lose himself and then murmured is it possible  it was indeed theodora clothed in male attire she seemed a stripling  quite possible she said and all is well but i found it a longer business than i had counted on you see there are so many new persons who knew me only by tradition but with whom it was necessary i should personally confer and i had more difficulty just now in getting through florence than i had anticipated the papalini and the french are both worrying our allies in that city about the gathering on the southern frontier and there is a sort of examination true or false i will not aver of all who depart however i managed to pass with some soldiers wives who were carrying fruit as far as narni and there i met an old comrade of aspromonte who is a customofficer now but true to the good cause and he and his daughter who is with me helped me through every thing and so i am with my dear friends again  after some slight conversation in this vein theodora entered into a detailed narrative of her proceedings and gave to them her views of the condition of affairs  by one thing above all others she said i am impressed and that is the unprecedented efforts which rome is making to obtain the return of the french there never was such influence exercised such distinct offers made such prospects intimated you may prepare yourself for any thing a papal coronation a family pontiffi could hardly say a king of rome though he has been reminded of that royal fact our friends have acted with equal energy and with perfect temper the heads of the societies have met in council and resolved that if france will refuse to interfere no domestic disturbance shall be attempted during this reign and they have communicated this resolution to headquarters he trusts them he knows they are honest men they did something like this before the italian war when he hesitated about heading the army from the fear of domestic revolution anxious to recover the freedom of italy they apprized him that if he personally entered the field they would undertake to insure tranquillity at home the engagement was scrupulously fulfilled when i left paris all looked well but affairs require the utmost vigilance and courage it is a mighty struggle it is a struggle between the church and the secret societies and it is a deathstruggle    chapter 53   during the week that elapsed after the arrival of theodora at the camp many recruits and considerable supplies of military stores reached the valley theodora really acted as secretary to the general and her labors were not light though lothair was frequently in her presence they were never or rarely alone and when they conversed together her talk was of details the scouts too had brought information which might have been expected that their rendezvous was no longer a secret at rome the garrison of the neighboring town of viterbo had therefore been increased and there was even the commencement of an intrenched camp in the vicinity of that place to be garrisoned by a detachment of the legion of antibes and other good troops so that any junction between the general and garibaldi if contemplated should not be easily effected  in the mean time the life of the camp was busy the daily drill and exercise of two thousand men was not a slight affair and the constant changes in orders which the arrival of bodies of recruits occasioned rendered this primary duty more difficult the office of quartermaster required the utmost resource and temper the commissariat which from the nature of the country could depend little upon forage demanded extreme husbandry and forbearance but perhaps no labors were more severe than those of the armorers the clink of whose instruments resounded unceasingly in the valley and yet such is the magic of method when directed by a mastermind that the whole went on with the regularity and precision of machinery more than two thousand armed men all of whom had been accustomed to an irregular some to a lawless life were as docile as children animated in general by what they deemed a sacred cause and led by a chief whom they universally alike adored and feared  among these wild warriors theodora delicate and fragile but with a mien of majesty moved like the spirit of some other world and was viewed by them with admiration not unmixed with awe veterans round the campfire had told to the new recruits her deeds of prowess and devotion how triumphantly she had charged at voltorno and how heroically she had borne their standard when they were betrayed at fatal aspromonte  the sun had sunk behind the mountains but was still high in the western heaven when a mounted lancer was observed descending a distant pass into the valley the general and his staff had not long commenced their principal meal of the day of which the disappearance of the sun behind the peak was the accustomed signal this permitted them without inconvenience to take their simple repast in the open but still warm air theodora was seated between the general and her husband and her eye was the first that caught the figure of the distant but descending stranger  what is that she asked  the general immediately using his telescope after a moments examination said a lancer of the royal guard  all eyes were now fixed upon the movements of the horseman he had descended the winding steep and now was tracking the craggy path which led into the plain as he reached the precinct of the camp he was challenged but not detained nearer and nearer he approached and it was evident from his uniform that the conjecture of his character by the general was correct  a deserter from the guard whispered colonel campian to lothair  the horseman wag conducted by an officer to the presence of the commander when that presence was reached the lancer still silent slowly lowered his tall weapon and offered the general the dispatch which was fastened to the head of his spear  every eye was on the countenance of their chief as he perused the missive but that countenance was always inscrutable it was observed however that he read the paper twice looking up the general said to the officer see that the bearer is well quarteredthis is for you he added in a low voice to theodora and he gave her an enclosure read it quietly and then come into my tent  theodora read the letter and quietly though without the preparatory hint it might have been difficult to have concealed her emotion then after a short pause she rose and the general requesting his companions not to disturb themselves joined her and they proceeded in silence to his tent  he is arrested said the general when they had entered it and taken to alessandria where he is a close prisoner tis a blow but i am more grieved than surprised  this was the arrest of garibaldi at sinigaglia by the italian government which had been communicated at hexham house to monsignore berwick by his evening visitor  how will it affect operations in the field inquired theodora  according to this dispatch in no degree our original plan is to be pursued and acted upon the moment we are ready that should be in a fortnight or perhaps three weeks menotti is to take the command on the southern frontier well it may prevent jealousies i think i shall send sarano there to reconnoitre he is well both with nicotera and ghirelli and may keep things straight  but there are other affairs besides operations in the field said theodora and scarcely less critical read this and she gave him the enclosure which ran in these words  the general will tell thee what has happened have no fear for that all will go right it will not alter our plans a bunch of grapes be perfectly easy about this country no italian soldier will ever cross the frontier except to combat the french write that on thy heart are other things as well other places my advices are bad all the prelates are on their knees to himwith blessings on their lips and curses in their pockets archbishop of paris is as bad as any berwick is at biarritzan inexhaustible intriguer the only priest i fear i hear from one who never misled me that the polhes brigade has orders to be in readiness the maryanne societies are not strong enough for the situationtoo local he listens to them but he has given no pledge we must go deeper tis an affair of madre natura thou must see colonna  colonna is at rome said the general and cannot be spared he is acting president of the national committee and has enough upon his hands  i must see him said theodora  i had hoped i had heard the last of the madre natura said the general with an air of discontent  and the neapolitans hope they have heard the last of the eruptions of their mountain said theodora but the necessities of things are sterner stuff than the hopes of men  its last effort appalled and outraged europe said the general  its last effort forced the french into italy and has freed the country from the alps to the adriatic rejoined theodora  if the great man had only been as quiet as we have been said the general lighting a cigar we might have been in rome by this time  if the great man had been quiet we should not have had a volunteer in our valley said theodora my faith in him is implicit he has been right in every thing and has never failed except when he has been betrayed i see no hope for rome except in his convictions and energy i do not wish to die and feel i have devoted my life only to secure the triumph of savoyards who have sold their own country and of priests whose impostures have degraded mine  ah those priests exclaimed the general i really do not much care for any thing else they say the savoyard is not a bad comrade and at any rate he can charge like a soldier but those priests i fluttered them once why did i spare any why did i not burn down st peters i proposed it but mirandola with his history and his love of art and all that old furniture would reserve it for a temple of the true god and for the glory of europe fine results we have accomplished and now we are here hardly knowing where we are and as it appears hardly knowing what to do  not so dear general said theodora where we are is the threshold of rome and if we are wise we shall soon cross it this arrest of our great friend is a misfortune but not an irredeemable one i thoroughly credit what he says about the italian troops rest assured he knows what he is talking about they will never cross the frontier against us the danger is from another land but there will be no peril if we are prompt and firm clear your mind of all these dark feelings about the madre natura all that we require is that the most powerful and the most secret association in europe should ratify what the local societies of france have already intimated it will be enough send for colonna and leave the rest to me    chapter 54   the madre natura is the oldest the most powerful and the most occult of the secret societies of italy its mythic origin reaches the era of paganism and it is not impossible that it may have been founded by some of the despoiled professors of the ancient faith as time advanced the brotherhood assumed many outward forms according to the varying spirit of the age sometimes they were freemasons sometimes they were soldiers sometimes artists sometimes men of letters but whether their external representation were a lodge a commandery a studio or an academy their inward purpose was ever the same and that was to cherish the memory and if possible to secure the restoration of the roman republic and to expel from the aryan settlement of romulus the creeds and sovereignty of what they styled the semitic invasion  the madre natura have a tradition that one of the most celebrated of the popes was admitted to their fraternity as cardinal del medici and that when he ascended the throne mainly through their labors he was called upon to cooperate in the fulfilment of the great idea an individual who in his youth has been the member of a secret society and subsequently ascends a throne may find himself in an embarrassing position this however according to the tradition which there is some documentary ground to accredit was not the perplexing lot of his holiness pope leo x his tastes and convictions were in entire unison with his early engagements and it is believed that he took an early and no unwilling opportunity of submitting to the conclave a proposition to consider whether it were not both expedient and practicable to return to the ancient faith for which their temples had been originally erected  the chief tenet of the society of madre natura is denoted by its name they could conceive nothing more benignant and more beautiful more provident and more powerful more essentially divine than that system of creative order to which they owed their being and in which it was their privilege to exist but they differed from other schools of philosophy that have held this faith in this singular particular they recognize the inability of the latin race to pursue the worship of nature in an abstract spirit and they desired to revive those exquisite personifications of the abounding qualities of the mighty mother which the aryan genius had bequeathed to the admiration of man parthenope was again to rule at naples instead of januarius and starveling saints and winking madonnas were to restore their usurped altars to the god of the silver bow and the radiant daughter of the foaming wave  although the society of madre natura themselves accepted the allegorical interpretation which the neoplatonists had placed upon the pagan creeds during the first ages of christianity they could not suppose that the populace could ever comprehend an exposition so refined not to say so fanciful they guarded therefore against the corruptions and abuses of the religion of nature by the entire abolition of the priestly order and in the principle that every man should be his own priest they believed they had found the necessary security  as it was evident that the arrest of garibaldi could not be kept secret the general thought it most prudent to be himself the herald of its occurrence which he announced to the troops in a manner as little discouraging as he could devise it was difficult to extenuate the consequences of so great a blow but they were assured that it was not a catastrophe and would not in the slightest degree affect the execution of the plans previously resolved on two or three days later some increase of confidence was occasioned by the authentic intelligence that garibaldi had been removed from his stern imprisonment at alessandria and conveyed to his islandhome caprera though still a prisoner  about this time the general said to lothair my secretary has occasion to go on an expedition i shall send a small detachment of cavalry with her and you will be at its head she has requested that her husband should have this office but that is impossible i cannot spare my best officer it is your first command and though i hope it will involve no great difficulty there is no command that does not require courage and discretion the distance is not very great and so long as you are in the mountains you will probably be safe but in leaving this range and gaining the southern apennines which is your point of arrival you will have to cross the open country i do not hear the papalini are in force there i believe they have concentrated themselves at rome and about viterbo if you meet any scouts and reconnoitring parties you will be able to give a good account of them and probably they will be as little anxious to encounter you as you to meet them but we must be prepared for every thing and you may be threatened by the enemy in force in that case you will cross the italian frontier in the immediate neighborhood of which you will keep during the passage of the open country and surrender yourselves and your arms to the authorities they will not be very severe but at whatever cost and whatever may be the odds theodora must never be a prisoner to the papalini you will depart tomorrow at dawn  there is nothing so animating so invigorating alike to the body and soul so truly delicious as travelling among mountains in the early hours of day the freshness of nature falls upon a responsive frame and the nobility of the scene discards the petty thoughts that pester ordinary life so felt captain muriel as with every military precaution he conducted his little troop and his precious charge among the winding passes of the apennines at first dim in the matin twilight then soft with incipient day then coruscating with golden flashes sometimes they descended from the austere heights into the sylvan intricacies of chestnutforests amid the rush of waters and the fragrant stir of ancient trees and then again ascending to lofty summits ranges of interminable hills gray or green expanded before them with ever and anon a glimpse of plains and sometimes the splendor and the odor of the sea  theodora rode a mule which had been presented to the general by some admirer it was an animal of remarkable beauty and intelligence perfectly aware apparently of the importance of its present trust and proud of its rich accoutrements its padded saddle of crimson velvet and its silver bells a couple of troopers formed the advanced guard and the same number at a certain distance furnished the rear the body of the detachment fifteen strong with the sumptermules generally followed theodora by whose side whenever the way permitted rode their commander since he left england lothair had never been so much with theodora what struck him most now as indeed previously at the camp was that she never alluded to the past for her there would seem to be no muriel towers no belmont no england you would have supposed that she had been born in the apennines and had never quitted them all her conversation was details political or military not that her manner was changed to lothair it was not only as kind as before but it was sometimes unusually and even unnecessary tender as if she reproached herself for the too frequent and too evident selfengrossment of her thoughts and wished to intimate to him that though her brain were absorbed her heart was still gentle and true  two hours after noon they halted in a green nook near a beautiful cascade that descended in a mist down a sylvan cleft and poured its pellucid stream for their delightful use into a natural basin of marble the men picketed their horses and their corporal who was a man of the country and their guide distributed their rations all vied with each other in administering to the comfort and convenience of theodora and lothair hovered about her as a bee about a flower but she was silent which he wished to impute to fatigue but she said she was not at all fatigued indeed quite fresh before they resumed their journey he could not refrain from observing on the beauty of their restingplace she assented with a pleasing nod and then resuming her accustomed abstraction she said the more i think the more i am convinced that the battle is not to be fought in this country but in france  after one more ascent and that comparatively a gentle one it was evident that they were gradually emerging from the mountainous region their course since their halting lay through a spur of the chief chain they had hitherto pursued and a little after sunset they arrived at a farmhouse which the corporal informed his captain was the intended quarter of theodora for the night as the horses could proceed no farther without rest at dawn they were to resume their way and soon to cross the open country where danger if any was to be anticipated  the farmer was frightened when he was summoned from his house by a party of armed men but having some good ducats given him in advance and being assured they were all christians he took heart and labored to do what they desired theodora duly found herself in becoming quarters and a sentry was mounted at her residence the troopers who had been quite content to wrap themselves in their cloaks and pass the night in the air were pleased to find no despicable accommodation in the outbuildings of the farm and still more with the proffered vintage of their host as for lothair he enveloped himself in his mantle and threw himself on a bed of sacks with a truss of indian corn for his pillow and though he began by musing over theodora in a few minutes he was immersed in that profound and dreamless sleep which a life of action and mountainair combined can alone secure    chapter 55   the open country extending from the apennines to the very gates of rome and which they had now to cross was in general a desert a plain clothed with a coarse vegetation and undulating with an interminable series of low and uncouth mounds without any of the grace of form which always attends the disposition of nature nature had not created them they were the offspring of man and time and of their rival powers of destruction ages of civilization were engulfed in this drear expanse they were the tombs of empires and the sepulchres of contending races the campagna proper has at least the grace of aqueducts to break its monotony and everywhere the cerulean spell of distance but in this grim solitude antiquity has left only the memory of its violence and crimes and nothing is beautiful except the sky  the orders of the general to direct their course as much as possible in the vicinity of the italian frontier though it lengthened their journey somewhat mitigated its dreariness and an hour after noon after traversing some flinty fields they observed in the distance an olivewood beneath the pale shade of which and among whose twisted branches and contorted roots they had contemplated finding a haltingplace but here the advanced guard observed already an encampment and one of them rode back to report the discovery  a needless alarm for after a due reconnoissance they were ascertained to be friendsa band of patriots about to join the general in his encampment among the mountains they reported that a division of the italian army was assembled in force upon the frontier but that several regiments had already signified to their commanders that they would not fight against garibaldi or his friends they confirmed also the news that the great leader himself was a prisoner at caprera that although his son menotti by his command had withdrawn from nerola his force was really increased by the junction of ghirelli and the roman legion twelve hundred strong and that five hundred riflemen would join the general in the course of the week  a little before sunset they had completed the passage of the open country and had entered the opposite branch of the apennines which they had long observed in the distance after wandering among some rocky ground they entered a defile amid hills covered with ilex and thence emerging found themselves in a valley of some expanse and considerable cultivation bright crops vineyards in which the vine was married to the elm orchards full of fruit and groves of olive in the distance blue hills that were becoming dark in the twilight and in the centre of the plain upon a gentle and wooded elevation a vast file of building the exact character of which at this hour it was difficult to recognize for even as theodora mentioned to lothair that they now beheld the object of their journey the twilight seemed to vanish and the stars glistened in the dark heavens  though the building seemed so near it was yet a considerable time before they reached the wooded hill and though its ascent was easy it was night before they halted in face of a huge gate flanked by high stone walls a single light in one of the windows of the vast pile which it enclosed was the only evidence of human habitation  the corporal sounded a bugle and immediately the light moved and noises were heardthe opening of the halldoors and then the sudden flame of torches and the advent of many feet the great gate slowly opened and a steward and several servingmen appeared the steward addressed theodora and lothair and invited them to dismount and enter what now appeared to be a garden with statues and terraces and fountains and rows of cypress its infinite dilapidation not being recognizable in the deceptive hour and he informed the escort that their quarters were prepared for them to which they were at once attended guiding their captain and his charge they soon approached a double flight of steps and ascending reached the main terrace from which the building immediately rose it was in truth a castle of the middle ages on which a roman prince at the commencement of the last century had engrafted the character of one of those vast and ornate villas then the mode but its original character still asserted itself and notwithstanding its tuscan basement and its ionic pilasters its rich pediments and delicate volutes in the distant landscape it still seemed a fortress in the commanding position which became the residence of a feudal chief  they entered through a palladian vestibule a hall which they felt must be of huge dimensions though with the aid of a single torch it was impossible to trace its limits either of extent or of elevation then bowing before them and lighting as it were their immediate steps the steward guided them down a long and lofty corridor which led to the entrance of several chambers all vast with little furniture but their wells covered with pictures at length he opened a door and ushered them into a saloon which was in itself bright and glowing but of which the lively air was heightened by its contrast with the preceding scene it was lofty and hung with faded satin in gilded panels still bright an ancient chandelier of venetian crystal hung illumined from the painted ceiling and on the silver dogs of the marble hearth a fresh block of cedar had just been thrown and blazed with aromatic light  a lady came forward and embraced theodora and then greeted lothair with cordiality we must dine today even later than you do in london said the princess of tivoli but we have been expecting you these two hours then she drew theodora aside and said he is here but you must be tired my best beloved as some wise man said business tomorrow  no no said theodora now nowi am never tired the only thing that exhausts me is suspense  it shall be so at present i will take you away to shake the dust off your armor and serafino attend to captain muriel    chapter 56   when they assembled again in the saloon there was an addition to their party in the person of a gentleman of distinguished appearance his age could hardly have much exceeded that of thirty but time had agitated his truly roman countenance one which we now find only in consular and imperial busts or in the chance visage of a roman shepherd or a neapolitan bandit he was a shade above the middle height with a frame of wellknit symmetry his proud head was proudly placed on broad shoulders and neither time nor indulgence had marred his slender waist his darkbrown hair was short and hyacinthine close to his white forehead and naturally showing his small ears he wore no whiskers and his mustache was limited to the centre of his upper lip  when theodora entered and offered him her hand he pressed it to his lips with gravity and proud homage and then their hostess said captain muriel let me present you to a prince who will not bear his titles and whom therefore i must call by his nameromolo colonna  the large foldingdoors richly painted and gilt though dim from neglect and time and sustained by columns of precious marbles were suddenly opened and revealed another saloon in which was a round table brightly lighted and to which the princess invited her friends  their conversation at dinner was lively and sustained the travels of the last two days formed a natural part and were apposite to commence with but they were soon engrossed in the great subject of their lives and colonna who had left rome only fourandtwenty hours gave them interesting details of the critical condition of that capital when the repast was concluded the princess rose and accompanied by lothair reentered the saloon but theodora and colonna lingered behind and finally seating themselves at the farthest end of the apartment in which they had dined became engaged in earnest conversation  you have seen a great deal since we first met at belmont said the princess to lothair  it seems to me now said lothair that i knew as much of life then as i did of the stars above us about whose purposes and fortunes i used to puzzle myself  and might have remained in that ignorance the great majority of men exist but do not livelike italy in the last century the power of the passions the force of the will the creative energy of the imaginationthese make life and reveal to us a world of which the million are entirely ignorant you have been fortunate in your youth to have become acquainted with a great woman it develops all a mans powers and gives him a thousand talents  i often think said lothair that i have neither powers nor talents but am drifting without an orbit  into infinite space said the priestess well one might do worse than that but it is not so in the longrun your nature will prevail and you will fulfil your organic purpose but you will accomplish your ends with a completeness which can only be secured by the culture and development you are now experiencing  and what is my nature said lothair i wish you would tell me  has not the divine theodora told you  she has told me many things but not that  how then could i know said the princess if she has not discovered it  but perhaps she has discovered it said lothair  oh then she would tell you said the princess for she is the soul of truth  but she is also the soul of kindness and she might wish to spare my feelings  well that is very modest and i dare say not affected for there is no man however gifted even however conceited who has any real confidence in himself until he has acted  well we shall soon act said lothair and then i suppose i shall know my nature  in time said the princess and with the continued inspiration of friendship  but you too are a great friend of theodora  although a woman i see you are laughing at female friendships and generally speaking there is foundation for the general sneer i will own for my part i have every female weakness and in excess i am vain i am curious i am jealous and i am envious but i adore theodora i reconcile my feelings toward her and my disposition in this way it is not friendshipit is worship and indeed there are moments when i sometimes think she is one of those beautiful divinities that we once worshipped in this land and who when they listened to our prayers at least vouchsafed that our country should not be the terrible wilderness that you crossed this day  in the mean time colonna with folded arms and eyes fixed on the ground was listening to theodora  thus you see she continued it comes to thisrome can only be freed by the romans he looks upon the secret societies of his own country as he does upon universal suffragea wild beast and dangerous but which may be watched and tamed and managed by the police he listens but he plays with them he temporizes at the bottom of his heart his italian blood despises the gauls it must be something deeper and more touching than this rome must appeal to him and in the ineffable name  it has been uttered before said colonna looking up at his companion and and he hesitated  and in vain you would say said theodora not so there was a martyrdom but the blood of felice baptized the new birth of italian life but i am not thinking of bloodshed had it not been for the double intrigues of the savoyards it need not then have been shed we bear him no illwillat least not nowand we can make great offers make them the revolution in gaul is ever a mimicry of italian thought and life their great affair of the last century which they have so marred and muddied would never have occurred had it not been for tuscan reform 1848 was the echo of our societies and the seine will never be disturbed if the tiber flows unruffled let him consent to roman freedom and madre natura will guarantee him against lutetian barricades  it is only the offer of maryanne in another form said colonna  guarantee the dynasty said theodora there is the point he can trust us emperors and kings break treaties without remorse but he knows that what is registered by the most ancient power in the world is sacred  can republicans guarantee dynasties said colonna shaking his head  why what is a dynasty when we are dealing with eternal things the casualties of life compared with infinite space rome is eternal centuries of the most degrading and foreign priestcraftenervating rites brought in by hellogabalus and the syrian emperorshave failed to destroy her dynasties why even in our dark servitude we have seen merovingian and carlovingian kings and capets and valois and bourbons and now bonapartes they have disappeared and will disappear like orgetorix and the dynasties of the time of caesar what we want is rome free do not you see that everything has been preparing for that event this monstrous masquerade of united italywhat is it but an initiatory ceremony to prove that italy without rome is a series of provinces establish the roman republic and the roman race will as before conquer them in detail and when the italians are thus really united what will become of the gauls why the first bonaparte said that if italy were really united the gauls would have no chance and he was a good judge of such things  what would you have me do then said colonna  see himsee him at once say every thing that i have said and say it better his disposition is with us convenience all political propriety counsel and would justify his abstinence a return to rome would seem weak fitful capricious and would prove that his previous retirement was illconsidered and illinformed it would disturb and alarm europe but you have nevertheless to fight against great odds it is madre natura against st peters never was the abomination of the world so active as at present it is in the very throes of its fell despair to save itself it would poison in the eucharist  and if i fail said colonna  you will not fail on the whole his interest lies on our side  the sacerdotal influences are very strong there when the calculation of interest is fine a word a glance sometimes a sigh a tear may have a fatal effect  all depends upon him said theodora if he were to disappear from the stage interference would be impossible  but he is on the stage and apparently will remain  a single life should not stand between rome and freedom  what do you mean  i mean that romolo colonna should go to paris and free his country    chapter 57   when captain muriel and his detachment returned to the camp they found that the force had been not inconsiderably increased in their absence while the tidings of the disposition of the italian army brought by the recruits and the deserters from the royal standard cherished the hopes of the troops and stimulated their desire for action theodora had been far more communicative during their journey back than in that of her departure she was less absorbed and had resumed that serene yet even sympathizing character which was one of her charms without going into detail she mentioned more than once to lothair how relieved she felt by colonna accepting the mission to paris he was a person of so much influence she said and of such great judgment and resource she augured the most satisfactory results from his presence on the main scene of action  time passed rapidly at the camp when a life of constant activity is combined with routine the hours fly neither letter nor telegram arrived from colonna and neither was expected and yet theodora heard from him and even favorably one day as she was going the rounds with her husband a young soldier a new recruit approached her and pressing to his lips a branch of the olivetree presented it to her on another occasion when she returned to her tent she found a bunch of fruit from the same tree though not quite ripe which showed that the cause of peace had not only progressed but had almost matured all these communications sustained her sanguine disposition and full of happy confidence she labored with unceasing and inspiring energy so that when the lookedfor signal came they might be prepared to obey it and rapidly gather the rich fruition of their glorious hopes  while she was in this mood of mind a scout arrived from nerola bringing news that a brigade of the french army had positively embarked at marseilles and might be hourly expected at civita vecchia the news was absolute the italian consul at marseilles had telegraphed to his government both when the first regiment was on board and when the last had embarked copies of these telegrams had been forwarded instantly by a secret friend to the volunteers on the southern frontier  when theodora heard this news she said nothing but turning pale she quitted the group round the general and hastened to her own tent she told her attendant the daughter of the customhouse officer at narni and a true child of the mountains that no one must approach her not even colonel campian and the girl sat without the tent at its entrance dressed in her manycolored garments with fiery eyes and square white teeth and her dark hair braided with gold coins and covered with a long white kerchief of perfect cleanliness and she had a poniard at her side and a revolver in her hand and she would have used both weapons sooner than that her mistress should be disobeyed  alone in her tent theodora fell upon her knees and lifting up her hands to heaven and bowing her head to the earth she said o god whom i have ever worshipped god of justice and of truth receive the agony of my soul  and on the earth she remained for hours in despair  night came and it brought no solace and the day returned but to her it brought no light theodora was no longer seen the soul of the camp seemed extinct the mien of majesty that ennobled all the winning smile that rewarded the rifleman at his practice and the sapper at his toil the inciting word that reanimated the recruit and recalled to the veteran the glories of sicilian strugglesall vanishedall seemed spiritless and dull and the armorer clinked his forge as if he were the heartless hireling of a king  in this state of moral discomfiture there was one person who did not lose his head and this was the general calm collected and critical he surveyed the situation and indicated the possible contingencies our best if not our only chance he said to colonel campian is thisthat the italian army now gathered in force upon the frontier should march to rome and arrive there before the french whatever then happens we shall at least get rid of the great imposture but in all probability the french and italians will fight in that case i shall join the savoyards and in the confusion we may do some business yet  this embarkation said the colonel explains the gathering of the italians on the frontier they must have foreseen this event at florence they never can submit to another french occupation it would upset their throne the question is who will be at rome first  just so said the general and as it is an affair upon which all depends and is entirely beyond my control i think i shall now take a nap so saying he turned into his tent and in five minutes this brave and exact man but in whom the muscular development far exceeded the nervous was slumbering without a dream  civita vecchia was so near at hand and the scouts of the general were so numerous and able that he soon learned the french had not yet arrived and another day elapsed and still no news of the french but on the afternoon of the following day the startling but authentic information arrived that after the french army having embarked and remained two days in port the original orders had been countermanded and the troops had absolutely disembarked  there was a cheer in the camp when the news was known and theodora started from her desolation surprised that there could be in such a scene a sound of triumph then there was another cheer and though she did not move but remained listening and leaning on her arm the light returned to her eyes the cheer was repeated and there were steps about her tent she caught the voice of lothair speaking to her attendant and adjuring her to tell her mistress immediately that there was good news and that the french troops had disembarked then he heard her husband calling theodora  the camp became a scene of excitement and festivity which in general only succeeds some signal triumph the troops lived always in the air except in the hours of night when the atmosphere of the mountains in the late autumn is dangerous at present they formed groups and parties in the vicinity of the tents there was their gay canteen and there their humorous kitchen the man of the gulf with his rich venetian banter and the sicilian with his scaramouch tricks got on very well with the gentle and polished tuscan and could amuse without offending the high roman soul but there were some quips and cranks and sometimes some antics which were not always relished by the simpler men from the islands and the offended eye of a corsican sometimes seemed to threaten vendetta  about sunset colonel campian led forth theodora she was in female attire and her long hair restrained only by a fillet reached nearly to the ground her olympian brow seemed distended a phosphoric light glittered in her hellenic eyes a deep pink spot burnt upon each of those cheeks usually so immaculately fair  the general and the chief officers gathered round her with their congratulations but she would visit all the quarters she spoke to the men in all the dialects of that land of many languages the men of the gulf in general of gigantic stature dropped their merry venetian stories and fell down on their knees and kissed the hem of her garment the scaramouch forgot his tricks and wept as he would to the madonna tuscany and rome made speeches worthy of the arno and the forum and the corsicans and the islanders unsheathed their poniards and brandished them in the air which is their mode of denoting affectionate devotion as the night advanced the crescent moon glittering above the apennine theodora attended by the whole staff having visited all the troops stopped at the chief fire of the camp and in a voice which might have maddened nations sang the hymn of roman liberty the whole army ranged in ranks along the valley joining in the solemn and triumphant chorus    chapter 58   this exaltation of feeling in the camp did not evaporate all felt that they were on the eve of some great event and that the hour was at hand and it was in this state of enthusiasm that couriers arrived with the intelligence that garibaldi had escaped from caprera that he had reached nerola in safety and was in command of the assembled forces and that the general was without loss of time to strike his camp join the main body at a given place and then march to rome  the breakingup of the camp was as the breakingup of a long frost and the first scent of spring there was a brightness in every mans face and a gay elasticity in all their movements but when the order of the day informed them that they must prepare for instant combat and that in eightandforty hours they would probably be in face of the enemy the hearts of the young recruits fluttered with strange excitement and the veterans nodded to each other with grim delight  it was nearly midnight when the troops quitted the valley through a defile in an opposite direction to the pass by which they had entered it it was a bright night colonel campian had the command of the division in advance which was five hundred strong after the defile the country though hilly was comparatively open and here the advanced guard was to halt until the artillery and cavalry had effected the passage and this was the most laborious and difficult portion of the march but all was well considered and all went right the artillery and cavalry by sunrise had joined the advanced guard who were bivouacking in the rocky plain and about noon the main columns of the infantry began to deploy from the heights and in a short time the whole force was in the field soon after this some of the skirmishers who had been sent forward returned and reported the enemy in force and in a strong position commanding the intended route of the invading force on this the general resolved to halt for a few hours and rest and refresh the troops and to recommence their march after sunset so that without effort they might be in the presence of the enemy by dawn  lothair had been separated from theodora during this to him novel and exciting scene she had accompanied her husband but when the whole force advanced in battle array the general had desired that she should accompany the staff they advanced through the night and by dawn they were fairly in the open country in the distance and in the middle of the rough and undulating plain was a round hill with an ancient city for it was a bishops see built all about and over it it would have looked like a gigantic beehive had it not been for a long convent on the summit flanked by some stonepines as we see in the pictures of gaspar and claude  between this city and the invading force though not in a direct line was posted the enemy in a strong position their right wing protected by one of the mounds common in the plain and their left backed by an olivewood of considerable extent and which grew on the last rocky spur of the mountains they were therefore as regards the plain on commanding ground the strength of the two forces was not unequal and the papal troops were not to be despised consisting among others of a detachment of the legion of antibes and the zouaves they had artillery which was well posted  the general surveyed the scene for which he was not unprepared disposing his troops in positions in which they were as much protected as possible from the enemys fire he opened upon them a fierce and continuous cannonade while he ordered colonel campian and eight hundred men to fall back among the hills and following a circuitous path which had been revealed by a shepherd gain the spur of the mountains and attack the enemy in their rear through the olivewood it was calculated that this movement if successful would require about three hours and the general for that period of the time had to occupy the enemy and his own troops with what were in realty feint attacks  when the calculated time had elapsed the general became anxious and his glass was never from his eye he was posted on a convenient ridge and the wind which was high this day from the sea frequently cleared the field from the volumes of smoke so his opportunities of observation were good but the three hours passed and there was no sign of the approach of campian and he ordered sarano with his division to advance toward the mound and occupy the attention of the right wing of the enemy but very shortly after lothair had carried this order and four hours having elapsed the general observed some confusion in the left wing of the enemy and instantly countermanding the order commanded a general attack in line the troops charged with enthusiasm but they were encountered with a resolution as determined at first they carried the mound broke the enemys centre and were mixed up with their great guns but the enemy fiercely rallied and the invaders were repulsed the papal troops retained their position and their opponents were in disorder on the plain and a little dismayed it was at this moment that theodora rushed forward and waving a sword in one hand and in the other the standard of the republic exclaimed brothers to rome  this sight inflamed their faltering hearts which after all were rather confounded than dismayed they formed and rallied round her and charged with renewed energy at the very moment that campian had brought the force of his division on the enemys rear a panic came over the papal troops thus doubly assailed and their rout was complete they retreated in the utmost disorder to viterbo which they abandoned that night and hurried to rome  at the last moment when the victory was no longer doubtful and all were in full retreat or in full pursuit a zouave in wantonness firing his weapon before he throw it away sent a randomshot which struck theodora and she fell lothair who had never left her during the battle was at her side in a moment and a soldier who had also marked the fatal shot and strange to say so hot and keen was the pursuit that though a moment before they seemed to be in the very thick of the strife they almost instantaneously found themselves alone or rather with no companions than the wounded near them she looked at lothair but at first could not speak she seemed stunned but soon murmured go go you are wanted  at this moment the general rode up with some of his staff his countenance was elate and his eye sparkled with fire but catching the figure of lothair kneeling on the field he reined in his charger and said what is this then looking more closely he instantly dismounted and muttering to himself this mars the victory he was at theodoras side  a slight smile came over her when she recognized the general and she faintly pressed his hand and then said again go go you are all wanted  none of up are wanted the day is won we must think of you  is it won she murmured  complete  i die content  who talks of death said the general this is a wound but i have had some worse what we must think of now are remedies i passed an ambulance this moment run for it he said to his aidedecamp we must stanch the wound at once but it is only a mile to the city and then we shall find every thing for we were expected i will ride on and there shall be proper attendance ready before you arrive you will conduct our friend to the city he said to lothair and be of good courage as i am    chapter 59   the troops were rushing through the gates of the city when the general rode up there was a struggling and stifling crowd cheers and shrieks it was that moment of wild fruition when the master is neither recognized nor obeyed it is not easy to take a bone out of a dogs mouth nevertheless the presence of the general in time prevailed something like order was established and before the ambulance could arrive a guard had been appointed to receive it and the ascent to the monastery where a quarter was prepared kept clear  during the progress to the city theodora never spoke but she seemed stunned rather than suffering and once when lothair who was walking by her side caught her glance with his sorrowful and anxious face she put forth her head and pressed his  the ascent to the convent was easy and the advantages of air and comparative tranquillity which the place offered counterbalanced the risk of postponing for a very brief space the examination of the wound  they laid her on their arrival on a large bed without poles or canopy in a lofty whitewashed room of considerable dimensions clean and airy with high open windows there was no furniture in the room except a chair a table and a crucifix lothair took her in his arms and laid her on the bed and the common soldier who had hitherto assisted him a giant in stature with a beard a foot long stood by the bedside crying like a child the chief surgeon almost at the same moment arrived with an aidedecamp of the general and her faithful female attendant and in a few minutes her husband himself wounded and covered with dust  the surgeon at once requested that all should withdraw except her devoted maid and they waited his report without in that deep sad silence which will not despair and yet dares not hope  when the wound had been examined and probed and dressed theodora in a faint voice said is it desperate  not desperate said the surgeon but serious all depends upon your perfect tranquilityof mind as well as body  well i am here and cannot move and as for my mind i am not only serene but happy  then we shall get through this said the surgeon encouragingly  i do not like you to stay with me said theodora there are other sufferers besides myself  my orders are not to quit you said the surgeon but i can be of great use within these walls i shall return when the restorative has had its effect but remember if i be wanted i am always here  soon after this theodora fell into a gentle slumber and after two hours woke refreshed the countenance of the surgeon when he again visited her was less troubled it was hopeful  the day was now beginning to decline notwithstanding the scenes of tumult and violence near at hand all was here silent and the breeze which had been strong during the whole day but which blew from the sea and was very soft played gratefully upon the pale countenance of the sufferer suddenly she said what is that  and they answered and said we heard nothing  i hear the sound of great guns said theodora  and they listened and in a moment both the surgeon and the maid heard the sound of distant ordnance  the liberator is at hand said the maid  i dare say said the surgeon  no said theodora looking distressed the sounds do not come from his direction go and see dolores ask and tell me what are these sounds  the surgeon was sitting by her side and occasionally touching her pulse or wiping the slight foam from her brow when dolores returned and said lady the sounds are the great guns of civita vecchia  a deadly change come over the countenance of theodora and the surgeon looked alarmed he would have given her some restorative but she refused it no kind friend she said it is finished i have just received a wound more fatal than the shot in the field this morning the french are at rome tell me kind friend how long do you think i may live  the surgeon felt her pulse his look was gloomy in such a case as yours he said the patient is the best judge  i understand she said send then at once for my husband  he was at hand for his wound had been dressed in the convent and he came to theodora with his arm in a sling but with the attempt of a cheerful visage  in the mean time lothair after having heard the first and by no means hopeless bulletin of the surgeon had been obliged to leave the convent to look after his men and having seen theme in quarters and made his report to the general he obtained permission to return to the convent and ascertain the condition of theodora arrived there he heard that she had had refreshing slumber and that her husband was now with her and a ray of hope lighted up the darkness of his soul he was walking up and down the refectory of the convent with that sickening restlessness which attends impending and yet uncertain sorrow when colonel campian entered the apartment and beckoned to him  there was an expression in his face which appalled lothair and he was about to inquire after theodora when his tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth and he could not speak the colonel shook his head and said in a low hollow voice she wishes to see you and alone come  theodora was sitting in the bed propped up by cushions when lothair entered and as her wound was internal there was no evidence of her sufferings the distressful expression of her face when she heard the great guns of civita vecchia had passed away it was serious but it was serene she bade her maid leave the chamber and then she said to lothair it is the last time i shall speak to you and i wish that we should be alone there is something much on my mind at this moment and you can relieve it  adored being murmured lothair with streaming eyes there is no wish of yours that i will not fulfil  i know your life for you have told it me and you are true i know your nature it is gentle and brave but perhaps too susceptible i wished it to be susceptible only of the great and good mark mei have a vague but strong conviction that there will be another and a more powerful attempt to gain you to the church of rome if i have ever been to you as you have sometimes said an object of kind thoughtsif not a fortunate at least a faithful friendpromise me now at this hour of trial with all the solemnity that becomes the moment that you will never enter that communion  lothair would have spoken but his voice was choked and he could only press her hand and bow his head  but promise me said theodora  i promise said lothair  and now she said embrace me for i wish that your spirit should be upon me as mine departs    chapter 60   it was a november day in rome and the sky was as gloomy as the heaven of london the wind moaned through the silent streets deserted except by soldiers the shops were shut not a civilian or a priest could be seen the corso was occupied by the swiss guard and zouaves with artillery ready to sweep it at a moments notice six of the city gates were shut and barricaded with barrels full of earth troops and artillery were also posted in several of the principal piazzas and on some commanding heights and st peters itself was garrisoned  and yet these were the arrangements rather of panic than precaution the utmost dismay pervaded the councilchamber of the vatican since the news had arrived of the disembarkation of the french troops at marseilles all hope of interference had expired it was clear that berwick had been ultimately foiled and his daring spirit and teeming device were the last hope as they were the ablest representation of roman audacity and stratagem the revolutionary committee whose abidingplace or agents never could be traced or discovered had posted every part of the city during the night with their manifesto announcing that the hour had arrived an attempt partially successful had been made to blow up the barracks of the zouaves and the cardinal secretary was in possession of information that an insurrection was immediate and that the city won fired in four different quarters  the pope had escaped from the vatican to the castle of st angelo where he was secure and where his courage could be sustained by the presence of the noble guard with their swords always drawn the sixscore of monsignori who in their different offices form what is styled the court of rome had either accompanied his holiness or prudently secreted themselves in the strongest palaces and convents at their command later in the day news arrived of the escape of garibaldi from caprera he was said to be marching on the city and only fiveandtwenty miles distant there appeared another proclamation from the revolutionary committee mysteriously posted under the very noses of the guards and police postponing the insurrection till the arrival of the liberator  the papal cause seemed hopeless there was a general feeling throughout the city and all classes that this time it was to be an affair of alaric or genseric or the constable of bourbon no negotiations no compromises no conventions but slaughter havoc a great judicial devastation that was to extirpate all signs and memories of mediaeval and semitic rome and restore and renovate the inheritance of the true offspring of the shewolf the very aspect of the place itself was sinister whether it were the dulness of the dark sky or the frown of madre natura herself but the old seven hills seemed to look askance the haughty capitol impatient of its chapels sighed once more for triumphs and the proud palatine remembering the caesars glanced with imperial contempt on the palaces of the papal princelings that in the course of ignominious ages had been constructed out of the exhaustless womb of its still sovereign ruin the jews in their quarter spoke nothing but exchanged a curious glance as if to say has it come at last and will they indeed serve her as they served sion  this dreadful day at last passed followed by as dreadful a night and then another day equally gloomy equally silent equally panicstricken even insurrection would have been a relief amid the horrible and wearing suspense on the third day the government made some wild arrests of the wrong persons and then came out a fresh proclamation from the revolutionary committee directing the romans to make no move until the advanced guard of garibaldi had appeared upon monte mario about this time the routed troops of the pope arrived in confusion from viterbo and of course extenuated their discomfiture by exaggerating the strength of their opponents according to them they had encountered not less than ten thousand men who now having joined the still greater force of garibaldi were in full march on the city  the members of the papal party who showed the greatest spirit and the highest courage at this trying conjuncture were the roman ladies and their foreign friends they scraped lint for the troops as incessantly as they offered prayers to the virgin some of them were trained nurses and they were training others to tend the sick and wounded they organized a hospital service and when the wounded arrived from viterbo notwithstanding the rumors of incendiarism and massacre they came forth from their homes and proceeded in companies with no male attendants but armed men to the discharge of their selfappointed public duties there were many foreigners in the papal ranks and the sympathies and services of the female visitors to rome were engaged for their countrymen princesses of france and flanders might be seen by the tresselbeds of many a suffering soldier of dauphin and brabant but there were numerous subjects of queen victoria in the papal rankssome englishmen several scotchmen and many irish for them the english ladies had organized a special service lady st jerome with unflagging zeal presided over this department and the superior of the sisterhood of mercy that shrank from no toil and feared no danger in the fulfilment of those sacred duties of pious patriots was miss arundel  she was leaning over the bed of one who had been cut down in the olivewood by a sabre of campians force when a peal of artillery was heard she thought that her hour had arrived and the assault had commenced  most holy mary she exclaimed sustain me  there was another peal and it was repeated and again and again at regular intervals  that is not a battle it is a salute murmured the wounded soldier  and he was right it was the voice of the great guns telling that the french had arrived  the consternation of the revolutionary committee no longer sustained by colonna absent in france was complete had the advanced guard of garibaldi been in sight it might still have been the wisest course to rise but monte mario was not yet peopled by them and an insurrection against the papal troops reanimated by the reported arrival of the french and increased in numbers by the fugitives from viterbo would have been certainly a rash and probably a hopeless effort and so in the midst of confused and hesitating councils the first division of the french force arrived at the gates of rome and marched into the gloomy and silent city  since the interference of st peter and st paul against alaric the papacy had never experienced a more miraculous interposition in its favor shortly after this the wind changed and the sky became serene a sunbeam played on the flashing cross of st peters the pope left the castle of angelo and returned to the quirinal the noble guard sheathed their puissant blades the sixscore of monsignori reappeared in all their busy haunts and stately offices and the court of rome no longer despairing of the republic and with a spirit worthy of the senate after cannae ordered the whole of its forces into the field to combat its invaders with the prudent addition in order to insure a triumph of a brigade of french infantry armed with chassepots  garibaldi who was really at hand hearing of these events fell back on monte rotondo about fifteen miles from the city and took up a strong position he was soon attacked by his opponents and defeated with considerable slaughter and forced to fly the papal troops returned to rome in triumph but with many wounded the roman ladies and their friends resumed their noble duties with enthusiasm the ambulances were apportioned to the different hospitals and the services of all were required our own countrymen had suffered severely but the skill and energy and gentle care of clare arundel and her companions only increased with the greater calls upon their beautiful and sublime virtue  a woman came to miss arundel and told her that in one of the ambulances was a young man whom they could not make out he was severely wounded and had now swooned but they had reason to believe he was an englishman would she see him and speak to him and she went  the person who had summoned her was a woman of much beauty not an uncommon quality in rome and of some majesty of mien as little rare in that city she was said at the time when some inquiry was made to be maria serafina de angelis the wife of a tailor in the ripetta  the ambulance was in the courtyard of the hospital of the santissima trinita di pellegrini the woman pointed to it and then went away there was only one person in the ambulance the rest had been taken to the hospital but he had been left because he was in a swoon and they were trying to restore him those around the ambulance made room for miss arundel as she approached and she beheld a young man covered with the stains of battle and severely wounded but his countenance was uninjured though insensible his eyes were closed and his auburn hair fell in clusters on his white forehead the sister of mercy touched the pulse to ascertain whether there yet was life but in the very act her own frame became agitated and the color left her cheek as she recognizedlothair    chapter 61   when lothair in some degree regained consciousness he found himself in bed the chamber was lofty and dim and had once been splendid thoughtfulness had invested it with an air of comfort rare under italian roofs the fagots sparkled on the hearth the light from the windows was veiled with hangings and the draughts from the tall doors guarded against by screens and by his bedside there were beautiful flowers and a crucifix and a silver bell  where was he he looked up at the velvet canopy above and then at the pictures that covered the walls but there was no familiar aspect he remembered nothing since he was shot down in the field of mentana and even that incoherently  and there had been another battle before that followed by a catastrophe still more dreadful when had all this happened and where he tried to move his bandaged form but he had no strength and his mind seemed weaker than his frame but he was soon sensible that he was not alone a veiled figure gently lifted him and another one refreshed his pillows he spoke or tried to speak but one of them pressed her finger to her shrouded lips and he willingly relapsed into the silence which he had hardly strength enough to break  and sometimes these veiled and gliding ministers brought him sustenance and sometimes remedies and he complied with all their suggestions but with absolute listlessness and sometimes a coarser hand interposed and sometimes he caught a countenance that was not concealed but was ever strange he had a vague impression that they examined and dressed his wounds and arranged his bandages but whether he really had wounds and whether he were or were not bandaged he hardly knew and did not care to know he was not capable of thought and memory was an effort under which he always broke down day after day he remained silent and almost motionless alike in mind and body he had a vague feeling that after some great sorrows and some great trials he was in stillness and in safety and he had an indefinite mysterious sentiment of gratitude to some unknown power that had cherished him in his dark calamities and poured balm and oil into his wounds  it was in this mood of apathy that one evening there broke upon his ear low but beautiful voices performing the evening service of the church his eye glistened his heart was touched by the vesper spell he listened with rapt attention to the sweet and sacred strains and when they died away he felt depressed would they ever sound again  sooner than he could have hoped for when he woke in the morning from his slumbers which strange to say were always disturbed for the mind and the memory seemed to work at night though in fearful and exhausting chaos the same divine melodies that had soothed him in the eve now sounded in the glad and grateful worship of matin praise  i have heard the voice of angels he murmured to his veiled attendant  the vesper and the matin hours became at once the epochs of his day he was ever thinking of them and soon was thinking of the feelings which their beautiful services celebrate and express his mind seemed no longer altogether a blank and the religious sentiment was the first that returned to his exhausted heart  there will be a requiem today whispered one of his veiled attendants  a requiem a service for the dead a prayer for their peace and rest and who was dead the bright the matchless one the spell and fascination of his life was it possible could she be dead who seemed vitality in its consummate form was there ever such a being as theodora and if there were no theodora on earth why should one think of any thing but heaven  the sounds came floating down the chamber till they seemed to cluster round his brain sometimes solemn sometimes thrilling sometimes the divine pathos melting the human heart with celestial sympathy and heavenly solace the tears fell fast from his agitated vision and he sank back exhausted almost insensible on his pillow  the church has a heart for all our joys and all our sorrows and for all our hopes and all our fears whispered a veiled attendant as she bathed his temples with fragrant waters  though the condition of lothair had at first seemed desperate his youthful and vigorous frame had enabled him to rally and with time and the infinite solicitude which he received his case was not without hope but though his physical cure was somewhat advanced the prostration of his mind seemed susceptible of no relief the services of the church accorded with his depressed condition they were the only events of his life and he cherished them his attendants now permitted and even encouraged him to speak but he seemed entirely incurious and indifferent sometimes they read to him and he listened but he never made remarks the works which they selected had a religious or ecclesiastical bias even while they were imaginative and it seemed difficult not to be interested by the ingenious fancy by which it was worked out that every thing that was true and sacred in heaven had its symbol and significance in the qualities and accidents of earth  after a month passed in this manner the surgeons having announced that lothair might now prepare to rise from his bed a veiled attendant said to him one day there is a gentleman here who is a friend of yours and who would like to see you and perhaps you would like to see him also for other reasons for you must have much to say to god after all that you have suffered and he is a most holy man  i have no wish to see any one are you sure he is not a stranger asked lothair  he is in the next room said the attendant he has been here throughout your illness conducting our services often by your bedside when you were asleep and always praying for you  the veiled attendant drew back and waved her hand and some one glided forward and said in a low soft voice you have not forgotten me  and lothair beheld monsignore catesby  it is a long time since we met said lothair looking at him with some scrutiny and then all interest died away and he turned away his vague and wandering eyes  but you know me  i know not where i am and i but faintly comprehend what has happened murmured lothair  you are among friends said the monsignore in tones of sympathy what has happened he added with an air of mystery not unmixed with a certain expression of ecstasy in his glance must be reserved for other times when you are stronger and can grapple with such high themes  how long have i been here inquired lothair dreamily  it is a month since the annunciation  what annunciation  hush said the monsignore and he raised his finger to his lip we must not talk of these thingsat least at present no doubt the game blessed person that saved you from the jaws of death is at this moment guarding over your recovery and guiding it but we do not deserve nor does the church expect perpetual miracles we must avail ourselves under divine sanction of the beneficent tendencies of nature and in your case her operations must not be disturbed at this moment by any excitement except indeed the glow of gratitude for celestial aid and the inward joy which must permeate the being of any one who feels that he is among the most favored of men  from this time monsignore catesby scarcely ever quitted lothair he hailed lothair in the morn and parted from him at night with a blessing and in the interval catesby devoted his whole life and the inexhaustible resources of his fine and skilled intelligence to alleviate or amuse the existence of his companion sometimes he conversed with lothair adroitly taking the chief burden of the talk and yet whether it were bright narrative or lively dissertation never seeming to lecture or hold forth but relieving the monologue when expedient by an interesting inquiry which he was always ready in due time to answer himself or softening the instruction by the playfulness of his mind and manner sometimes he read to lothair and attuned the mind of his charge to the true spiritual note by melting passages from kempis or chrysostom  then he would bring a portfolio of wondrous drawings by the mediaeval masters of saints and seraphs and accustom the eye and thought of lothair to the forms and fancies of the court of heaven  one day lothair having risen from his bed for the first time and lying on a sofa in an adjoining chamber to that in which he had been so long confined the monsignore seated himself by the side of lothair and opening a portfolio took out a drawing and held it before lothair observing his countenance with a glance of peculiar scrutiny  well said catesby after some little pause as if awaiting a remark from his companion  tis beautiful said lothair is it by raffaelle  no by fra bartolomeo but the countenance do you remember ever having met such a one  lothair shook his head catesby took out another drawing the same subject the blessed virgin by giulio said the monsignore and he watched the face of lothair but it was listless  then he showed lothair another and another and another at last he held before him one which was really by raffaelle and by which lothair was evidently much moved his eye lit up a blush suffused his pale cheek he took the drawing himself and held it before his gaze with a trembling hand  yes i remember this he murmured for it was one of those faces of greek beauty which the great painter not infrequently caught up at rome the monsignore looked gently round and waved his hand and immediately arose the hymn to the virgin in subdued strains of exquisite melody  on the next morning when lothair woke he found on the table by his side the drawing of the virgin in a sliding frame  about this time the monsignore began to accustom lothair to leave his apartment and as he was not yet permitted to walk catesby introduced what he called an english chair in which lothair was enabled to survey a little the place which had been to him a refuge and a home it seemed a building of vast size raised round an inner court with arcades and windows and in the higher story where he resided an apparently endless number of chambers and galleries one morning in their perambulations the monsignore unlocked the door of a covered way which had no light but from a lamp which guided their passage the opposite door at the end of this covered way opened into a church but one of a character different from any which lothair had yet entered  it had been raised during the latter of the sixteenth century by vignola when under the influence of the great pagan revival the christian church began to assume the character of an olympian temple a central painted cupola of large but exquisite proportions supported by pilasters with gilded capitals and angels of white marble springing from golden brackets walls incrusted with rare materials of every tint and altars supported by serpentine columns of agate and alabaster a blaze of pictures and statues and precious stones and precious metals denoted one of the chief temples of the sacred brotherhood of jesus raised when the great order had recognized that the views of primitive and mediaeval christianity founded on the humility of man were not in accordance with the age of confidence in human energy in which they were destined to rise and which they were determined to direct  guided by catesby and leaning on a staff lothair gained a gorgeous side chapel in which mass was celebrating the air was rich with incense and all heaven seemed to open in the ministrations of a seraphic choir crushed by his great calamities both physical and moral lothair sometimes felt that he could now be content if the rest of his life could flow away amid this celestial fragrance and these gushing sounds of heavenly melody and absorbed in these feelings it was not immediately observed by him that on the altar behind the dazzling blaze of tapers was a picture of the virgin and identically the same countenance as that he had recognized with emotion in the drawing of raffaelle  it revived perplexing memories which agitated him thoughts on which it seemed his brain had not now strength enough to dwell and yet with which it now seemed inevitable for him to grapple the congregation was not very numerous and when it broke up several of them lingered behind and whispered to the monsignore and then after a little time catesby approached lothair and said there are some here who would wish to kiss your hand or even touch the hem of your garments it is troublesome but natural considering all that has occurred and that this is the first time perhaps that they have met any one who has been so favored  favored said lothair am i favored it seems to me i am the most forlorn of menif even i am that  hush said the monsignore we must not talk of these things at present and he motioned to some who approached and contemplated lothair with blended curiosity and reverence  these visits of lothair to the beautiful church of the jesuits became of daily occurrence and often happened several times on the same day indeed they formed the only incident which seemed to break his listlessness he became interested in the change and variety of the services in the persons and characters of the officiating priests the soft manners of these fathers their intelligence in the performance of their offices their obliging carriage and the unaffected concern with which all he said or did seemed to inspire the won upon him unconsciously the church had become his world and his sympathies if he still had sympathies seemed confined to those within its walls  in the mean time his physical advancement though slow was gradual and had hitherto never been arrested he could even walk a little alone though artificially supported and ramble about the halls and galleries full of a prodigious quantity of pictures from the days of raffael sanzio to those of raffael mengs  the doctors think now we might try a little drive said the monsignore one morning the rains have ceased and refreshed every thing today is like the burst of spring and when lothair seemed to shudder at the idea of facing any thing like the external world the monsignore suggested immediately that they should go out in a close carriage which they finally entered in the huge quadrangle of the building lothair was so nervous that he pulled down even the blind of his window and the monsignore who always humored him half pulled down his own  their progress seemed through a silent land and they could hardly be traversing streets then the ascent became a little precipitous and then the carriage stopped and the monsignore said here is a solitary spot we shall meet no one the view is charming and the air is soft and he placed his hand gently on the arm of lothair and as it were drew him out of the carriage  the sun was bright and the sky was bland there was something in the breath of nature that was delightful the scent of violets was worth all the incense in the world all the splendid marbles and priestly vestments seemed hard and cold when compared with the glorious colors of the cactus and the wild forms of the golden and gigantic aloes the favonian breeze played on the brow of this beautiful hill and the exquisite palmtrees while they bowed their rustling heads answered in responsive chorus to the antiphon of nature  the dreary look that had been so long imprinted on the face of lothair melted away  tis well that we came is it not said catesby and now we will seat ourselves below and before them on an undulating site a city of palaces and churches spread out its august form enclosing within its ample walls sometimes a wilderness of classic ruinscolumn and arch and theatresometimes the umbrageous spread of princely gardens a winding and turbid river divided the city in unequal parts in one of which there rose a vast and glorious temple crowned with a dome of almost superhuman size and skill on which the favorite sign of heaven flashed with triumphant truth  the expression of relief which for a moment had reposed on the face of lothair left it when he said in an agitated voice i at length behold rome    chapter 62   this recognition of rome by lothair evinced not only a consciousness of locality but an interest in it not before exhibited and the monsignore soon after seized the opportunity of drawing the mind of his companion to the past and feeling how far he now realized the occurrences that immediately preceded his arrival in the city but lothair would not dwell on them i wish to think of nothing he said that happened before i entered this city all i desire now is to know those to whom i am indebted for my preservation in a condition that seemed hopeless  there is nothing hopeless with divine aid said the monsignore but humanly speaking you are indebted for your preservation to english friends long and intimately cherished it is under their roof that you dwell the agostini palace tenanted by lord st jerome  lord st jerome murmured lothair to himself  and the ladies of his house are those who only with some slight assistance from my poor self tended you throughout your most desperate state and when we sometimes almost feared that mind and body were alike wrecked  i have a dream of angels said lothair and sometimes i listened to heavenly voices that i seemed to have heard before  i am sure you have not forgotten the ladies of that house said catesby watching his countenance  no one of them summoned me to meet her at rome murmured lothair and i am here  that summons was divine said catesby and only the herald of the great event that was ordained and has since occurred in this holy city miss arundel must ever count as the most sanctified of her sex  lothair lapsed into silence which subsequently appeared to be meditation for when the carriage stopped and the monsignore assisted him to alight he said i must see lord st jerome  and in the afternoon with due and preparatory announcement lord st jerome waited on lothair the monsignore ushered him into the chamber and though he left them as it were alone never quitted it he watched them conversing while he seemed to be arranging books and flowers he hovered over the conference dropping down on them at a critical moment when the words became either languid or embarrassing lord st jerome was a hearty man simple and highbred he addressed lothair with all his former kindness but with some degree of reserve and even a dash of ceremony lothair was not insensible to the alteration in his manner but could ascribe it to many causes he was himself resolved to make an effort when lord st jerome arose to depart and expressed the intention of lady st jerome to wait on him on the morrow no my dear lord said lothair tomorrow i make my first visit and it shall be to my best friends i would try to come this evening but they will not be alone and i must see them alone if it be only once  this visit of the morrow rather pressed on the nervous system of lothair it was no slight enterprise and called up many recollections he brooded over his engagement during the whole evening and his night was disturbed his memory long in a state of apathy or curbed and controlled into indifference seemed endowed with unnatural vitality reproducing the history of his past life in rapid and exhausting tumult all its scenes rose before himbrentham and vauxe and murieland closing with one absorbing spot which for a long time it avoided and in which all merged and endedbelmont then came that anguish of the heart which none can feel but those who in the youth of life have lost some one infinitely fascinating and dear and the wild query why he too had not fallen on the fatal plain which had entombed all the hope and inspiration of his existence  the interview was not so trying an incident as lothair anticipated as often under such circumstances occurs miss arundel was not present and in the second place although lothair could not at first be insensible to a change in the manner of lady st jerome as well as in that of her lord exhibiting as it did a degree of deference and ceremony which with her toward him were quite unusual still the genial gushing nature of this lively and enthusiastic woman full of sympathy soon asserted itself and her heart was overflowing with sorrow for all his sufferings and gratitude for his escape  and after all she said every thing must have been ordained and without these trials and even calamities that great event could not have been brought about which must make all hail you as the most favored of men  lothair stared with a look of perplexity and then said if i be the most favored of men it is only because two angelic beings have deigned to minister to me in my sorrow with a sweet devotion i can never forget and alas can never repay    chapter 63   lothair was not destined to meet clare arundel alone or only in the presence of her family he had acceded after a short time to the wish of lady st jerome and the advice of monsignore catesby to wait on her in the evening when lady st jerome was always at home and never alone her rooms were the privileged resort of the very cream of roman society and of those english who like herself had returned to the roman church an italian palace supplied an excellent occasion for the display of the peculiar genius of our countrywomen to make a place habitable beautiful carpets baskets of flowers and cases of ferns and chairs which you could sit upon tables covered with an infinity of toyssparkling useful and fantastichuge silken screens of rich color and a profusion of light produced a scene of combined comfort and brilliancy which made every one social who entered it and seemed to give a bright and graceful turn even to the careless remarks of ordinary gossip  lady st jerome rose the moment her eye caught the entry of lothair and advancing received him with an air of ceremony mixed however with an expression of personal devotion which was distressing to him and singularly contrasted with the easy and genial receptions that he remembered at vauxe then lady st jerome led lothair to her companion whom she had just quitted and presented him to the princess tarpeiacinque cento a dame in whose veins it was said flowed both consular and pontifical blood of the rarest tint  the princess tarpeiacinque cento was the greatest lady in rome had still vast possessionspalaces and villas and vineyards and broad farms notwithstanding all that had occurred she still looked upon the kings and emperors of the world as the mere servants of the pope and on the old roman nobility as still the conscript fathers of the world her other characteristic was superstition so she was most distinguished by an irrepressible haughtiness and an illimitable credulity the only softening circumstance was that being in the hands of the jesuits her religion did not assume an ascetic or gloomy character she was fond of society and liked to show her wondrous jewels which were still unrivalled although she had presented his holiness in his troubles with a tiara of diamonds  there were rumors that the princess tarpeiacinque cento had on occasions treated even the highest nobility of england with a certain indifference and all agreed that to laymen however distinguished her highness was not prone too easily to relax but in the present instance it is difficult to convey a due conception of the graciousness of her demeanor when lothair bent before her she appeared even agitated almost rose from her seat and blushed through her rouge lady st jerome guiding lothair into her vacant seat walked away  we shall never forget what you have done for us said the princess to lothair  i have done nothing said lothair with a surprised air  ali that is so like gifted beings like you said the princess they never will think they have done any thing even were they to save the world  you are too gracious princess said lothair i have no claims to esteem which all must so value  who has if you have not rejoined the princess yes it is to you and to you alone that we must look i am very impartial in what i say for to be frank i have not been of those who believed that the great champion would rise without the patrimony of st peter i am ashamed to say that i have even looked with jealousy on the energy that has been shown by individuals in other countries but i now confess that i was in error i cannot resist this manifestation it was a privilege to have lived when it happened all that we can do now is to cherish your favored life  you are too kind madam murmured the perplexed lothair  i have done nothing rejoined the princess and am ashamed that i have done nothing but it is well for you at this season to be at rome and you cannot be better i am sure than under this roof but when the spring breaks i hope you will honor me by accepting for your use a villa which i have at albano and which at that season has many charms  there were other roman ladies in the room only inferior in rank and importance to the princess tarpeiacinque cento and in the course of the evening at their earnest request they were made acquainted with lothair for it cannot be said he was presented to them these ladies generally so calm would not wait for the ordinary ceremony of life but as he approached to be introduced sank to the ground with the obeisance offered only to royalty  there were some cardinals in the apartment and several monsignori catesby was there in close attendance on a pretty english countess who had just gone over her husband had been at first very much distressed at the event and tore himself from the severe duties of the house of lords in the hope that he might yet arrive in time at rome to save her soul but he was too late and strange to say being of a domestic turn and disliking family dissensions he remained at rome during the rest of the session and finally went over himself  later in the evening arrived his eminence cardinal berwick for our friend had gained and bravely gained the great object of a churchmans ambition and which even our laud was thinking at one time of accepting although he was to remain a firm anglican in the deathstruggle between the church and the secret societies berwick had been the victor and no one in the sacred college more truly deserved the scarlet hat  his eminence had a reverence of radiant devotion for the princess tarpeiacinque cento a glance of friendship for lady st jeromefor all a courtly and benignant smile but when he recognized lothair he started forward seized and retained his hand and then seemed speechless with emotion ah my comrade in the great struggle he at length exclaimed this is indeed a pleasureand to see you here  early in the evening while lothair was sitting by the side of the princess his eye had wandered round the room not unsuccessfully in search of miss arundel and when he was free he would immediately have approached her but she was in conversation with a roman prince then when she was for a moment free he was himself engaged and at last he had to quit abruptly a cardinal of taste who was describing to him a statue just discovered in the baths of diocletian in order to seize the occasion that again offered itself  her manner was constrained when he addressed her but she gave him her hand which he pressed to his lips looking deeply into her violet eyes he said you summoned me to meet you at rome i am here  and i summoned you to other things she answered at first with hesitation and a blush but then as if rallying herself to the performance of a duty too high to allow of personal embarrassment she added all of which you will perform as becomes one favored by heaven  i have been favored by you said lothair speaking low and hurriedly to whom i owe my life and more than my life yes he continued this is not the scene i would have chosen to express my gratitude to you for all that you have done for me and my admiration of your sublime virtues but i can no longer repress the feelings of my heart though their utterance be as inadequate as your deeds have been transcendent  i was but the instrument of a higher power  we are all instruments of a higher power but the instruments chosen are always choice  ay there it is said miss arundel and that is what i rejoice you feel for it is impossible that such a selection could have been made as in your case without your being reserved for great results  i am but a shattered actor for great results said lothair shaking his head  you have had trials said miss arundel so had st ignatius so had st francis and great temptations but these are the tests of character of will of spiritual powerthe fine gold is searched all things that have happened have tended and have been ordained to one end and that was to make you the champion of the church of which you are now more than the child  more than the child  indeed i think so however this is hardly the place and occasion to dwell on such matters and indeed i know your friendsmy friends equallyare desirous that your convalescence should not be unnecessarily disturbed by what must be however delightful still agitating thoughts but you touched yourself unexpectedly on the theme and at any rate you will pardon one who has the inconvenient quality of having only one thought  whatever you say or think must always interest me  you are kind to say so i suppose you know that our cardinal cardinal grandison will be here in a few days    chapter 64   although the reception of lothair by his old friends and by the leaders of the roman world was in the highest degree flattering there was something in its tone which was perplexing to him and ambiguous could they be ignorant of his italian antecedents impossible miss arundel had admitted or rather declared that he had experienced great trials and even temptations she could only allude to what had occurred since their parting in england but all this was now looked upon as satisfactory because it was ordained and tended to one end and what was that end his devotion to the church of rome of which they admitted he was not formally a child  it was true that his chief companion was a priest and that he passed a great portion of his life within the walls of a church but the priest was his familiar friend in england who in a foreign land had nursed him with devotion in a desperate illness and although in the great calamities physical and moral that had overwhelmed him he had found solace in the beautiful services of a religion which he respected no one for a moment had taken advantage of this mood of his suffering and enfeebled mind to entrap him into controversy or to betray him into admissions that he might afterward consider precipitate and immature indeed nothing could be more delicate than the conduct of the jesuit fathers throughout his communications with them they seemed sincerely gratified that a suffering fellow creature should find even temporary consolation within their fair and consecrated structure their voices modulated with sympathy their glances gushed with fraternal affection their affectionate politeness contrived in a thousand slight instances the selection of a mass the arrangement of a picture the loan of a book to contribute to the interesting or elegant distraction of his forlorn and brooding being  and yet lothair began to feel uneasy and his uneasiness increased proportionately as his health improved he sometimes thought that he should like to make an effort and get about a little in the world but he was very weak and without any of the resources to which he had been accustomed throughout life he had no servants of his own no carriages no man of business no banker and when at last he tried to bring himself to write to mr putney gilesa painful taskmonsignore catesby offered to undertake his whole correspondence for him and announced that his medical attendants had declared that he must under no circumstances whatever attempt at present to write a letter hitherto he had been without money which was lavishly supplied for his physicians and other wants and he would have been without clothes if the most fashionable tailor in rome a german had not been in frequent attendance on him under the direction of monsignore catesby who in fact had organized his wardrobe as he did every thing else  somehow or other lothair never seemed alone when he woke in the morning the monsignore was frequently kneeling before an oratory in his room and if by any chance lothair was wanting at lady st jeromes reception father coleman who was now on a visit to the family would look in and pass the evening with him as men who keep a gamingtable find it discreet occasionally to change the dealer it is a huge and even stupendous pilethat palazzo agostini and yet lothair never tried to thread his way through its vestibules and galleries or attempt a reconnaissance of its endless chambers without some monsignore or other gliding up quite propos and relieving him from the dulness of solitary existence during the rest of his promenade  lothair was relieved by hearing that big former guardian cardinal grandison was daily expected at rome and he revolved in his mind whether he should not speak to his eminence generally on the system of his life which he felt now required some modification in the interval however no change did occur lothair attended every day the services of the church and every evening the receptions of lady st jerome and between the discharge of these two duties he took a drive with a priestsometimes with more than one but always most agreeable mengenerally in the environs of the city or visited a convent or a villa some beautiful gardens or a gallery of works of art  it was at lady st jeromes that lothair met his former guardian the cardinal had only arrived in the morning his manner to lothair was affectionate he retained lothairs hand and pressed it with his pale thin fingers his attenuated countenance blazed for a moment with a divine light  i have long wished to see you sir said lothair and much wish to talk with you  i can hear nothing from you nor of you but what must be most pleasing to me said the cardinal  i wish i could believe that said lothair  the cardinal caressed him put his arm round lothairs neck and said there is no time like the present let us walk together in this gallery and they withdrew naturally from the immediate scene  you know all that has happened i dare say said lothair with embarrassment and with a sigh since we parted in england sir  all said the cardinal it has been a most striking and merciful dispensation  then i need not dwell upon it said lothair and naturally it would be most painful what i wish particularly to speak to you about is my position under this roof what i owe to those who dwell under it no language can describe and no efforts on my part and they shall be unceasing can repay but i think the time has come when i ought no longer to trespass on their affectionate devotion though when i allude to the topic they seem to misinterpret the motives which influence me and to be pained rather than relieved by my suggestions i cannot bear being looked upon as ungrateful when in fact i am devoted to them i think sir you might help me in putting all this right  if it be necessary said the cardinal but i apprehend you misconceive them when i last left rome you were very ill but lady st jerome and others have written to me almost daily about you during my absence so that i am familiar with all that has occurred and quite cognizant of their feelings rest assured that toward yourself they are exactly what they ought to be and what you would desire  well i am glad said lothair that you are acquainted with every thing that has happened for you can put them right if it be necessary but i sometimes cannot help fancying that they are under some false impression both as to my conduct and my convictions  not in the slightest said the cardinal trust me my dear friend for that they know everything and appreciate everything and great as no doubt have been your sufferings feel that every thing has been ordained for the best that the hand of the almighty has been visible throughout all these strange events that his church was never more clearly built upon a rock than at this moment that this great manifestation will revive and even restore the faith of christendom and that you yourself must be looked upon as one of the most favored of men  everybody says that said lothair rather peevishly  and everybody feels it said the cardinal  well to revert to lesser points said lothair i do not say i want to return to england for i dread returning to england and do not know whether i shall ever go back there and at any rate i doubt not my health at present is unequal to the effort but i should like some change in my mode of life i will not say it is too much controlled for nothing seems ever done without first consulting me but somehow or other we are always in the same groove i wish to see more of the world i wish to see rome and the people of rome i wish to see and do many things which if i mention it would seem to hurt the feelings of others and my own are misconceived but if mentioned by you all would probably be different  i understand you my dear young friend my child i will still say said the cardinal nothing can be more reasonable than what you suggest no doubt our friends may be a little too anxious about you but they are the best people in the world you appear to me to be quite well enough now to make more exertion than hitherto they have thought you capable of they see you every day and cannot judge so well of you as i who have been absent i will charge myself to effect all your wishes and we will begin by my taking you out tomorrow and your driving with me about the city i will show you rome and the roman people  accordingly on the morrow cardinal grandison and his late pupil visited together rome and the romans and first of all lothair was presented to the cardinalprefect of the propaganda who presides over the ecclesiastical affairs of every country in which the roman church has a mission and that includes every land between the arctic and the southern pole this glimpse of the organized correspondence with both the americas all asia all africa all australia and many european countries carried on by a countless staff of clerks in one of the most capacious buildings in the world was calculated to impress the visitor with a due idea of the extensive authority of the roman pontiff this institution greater according to the cardinal than any which existed in ancient rome was to propagate the faith the purity of which the next establishment they visited was to maintain according to cardinal grandison there never was a body the character of which had been so wilfully and so malignantly misrepresented as that of the roman inquisition its true object is reformation not punishment and therefore pardon was sure to follow the admission of error true it was there were revolting stories afloat for which there was undoubtedly some foundation though their exaggeration and malice were evident of the ruthless conduct of the inquisition but these details were entirely confined to spain and were the consequences not of the principles of the holy office but of the spanish race poisoned by moorish and jewish blood or by long contact with those inhuman infidels had it not been for the inquisition organizing and directing the mitigating influences of the church spain would have been a land of wild beasts and even in quite modern times it was the holy office at rome which always stepped forward to protect the persecuted and by the power of appeal from madrid to rome saved the lives of those who were unjustly or extravagantly accused  the real business however of the holy office now continued the cardinal is in reality only doctrinal and there is something truly sublimeessentially divine i would sayin this idea of an old man like the holy father himself the object of ceaseless persecution by all the children of satan never for a moment relaxing his heaveninspired efforts to maintain the purity of the faith once delivered to the saints and at the same time to propagate it throughout the whole world so that there should be no land on which the sun shines that should not afford means of salvation to suffering man yes the propaganda and the inquisition alone are sufficient to vindicate the sacred claims of rome compared with them mere secular and human institutions however exalted sink into insignificance  these excursions with the cardinal were not only repeated but became almost of daily occurrence the cardinal took lothair with him in his visits of business and introduced him to the eminent characters of the city some of these priests were illustrious scholars or votaries of science whose names were quoted with respect and as authority in the circles of cosmopolitan philosophy then there were other institutions at rome which the cardinal snatched occasions to visit and which if not so awfully venerable as the propaganda and the inquisition nevertheless testified to the advanced civilization of rome and the romans and the enlightened administration of the holy father according to cardinal grandison all the great modern improvements in the administration of hospitals and prisons originated in the eternal city scientific ventilation popular lavatories the cellular or silent system the reformatory and yet these were nothing compared with the achievements of the pontifical government in education in short complete popular education only existed at rome its schools were more numerous even than its fountains gratuitous instruction originated with the ecclesiastics and from the nightschool to the university here might be found the perfect type  i really believe said the cardinal that a more virtuous a more religious a more happy and contented people than the romans never existed they could all be kept in order with the police of one of your counties true it is the holy father is obliged to garrison the city with twelve thousand men of arms but not against the romans not against his own subjects it is the secret societies of atheism who have established their lodges in this city entirely consisting of foreigners that render these lamentable precautions necessary they will not rest until they have extirpated the religious principle from the soul of man and until they have reduced him to the condition of wild beasts but they will fail as they failed the other day as sennacherib failed these men may conquer zouaves and cuirassiers but they cannot fight against saint michael and all the angels they may do mischief they may aggravate and prolong the misery of man but they are doomed to entire and eternal failure    chapter 65   lady st jerome was much interested in the accounts which the cardinal and lothair gave her of their excursions in the city and their visits  it is very true she said i never knew such good people and they ought to be so favored by heaven and leading a life which if any thing earthly can must give them however faint some foretaste of our joys hereafter did your eminence visit the pellegrini this was the hospital where miss arundel had found lothair  the cardinal looked grave no he replied my object was to secure for our young friend some interesting but not agitating distraction from certain ideas which however admirable and transcendently important are nevertheless too high and profound to permit their constant contemplation with impunity to our infirm natures besides he added in a lower but still distinct tone i was myself unwilling to visit in a mere casual manner the scene of what i must consider the greatest event of this century  but you have been there inquired lady st jerome  his eminence crossed himself  in the course of the evening monsignore catesby told lothair that a grand service was about to be celebrated in the church of st george thanks were to be offered to the blessed virgin by miss arundel for the miraculous mercy vouchsafed to her in saving the life of a countryman lothair all her friends will make a point of being there added the monsignore even the protestants and some russians miss arundel was very unwilling at first to fulfil this office but the holy father has commanded it i know that nothing will induce her to ask you to attend and yet if i were you i would turn it over in your mind i know she said that she would sooner that you were present than all her english friends together however you can think about it one likes to do what is proper  one does and yet it is difficult sometimes in doing what we think proper we get into irremediable scrapes and often what we hold to be proper society in its caprice resolves to be highly improper  lady st jerome had wished lothair to see tivoli and they were all consulting together when they might go there lord st jerome who besides his hunters had his drag at rome wanted to drive them to the place lothair sat opposite miss arundel gazing on her beauty it was like being at vauxe again and yet a great deal had happened since they were at vauxe and what so far as they two were concerned nothing but what should create or confirm relations of confidence and affection whatever may have been the influence of others on his existence hers at least had been one of infinite benignity she had saved his life she had cherished it she had raised him from the lowest depth of physical and moral prostration to health and comparative serenity if at vauxe he had beheld her with admiration had listened with fascinated interest to the fervid expression of her saintly thoughts and the large purposes of her heroic mind all these feelings were naturally heightened now when he had witnessed her lofty and consecrated spirit in action and when that action in his own case had only been exercised for his ineffable advantage  your uncle cannot go tomorrow continued lady st jerome and on thursday i am engaged  and on friday said miss arundel hesitating  we are all engaged said lady st jerome  i should hardly wish to go out before friday anywhere said miss arundel speaking to her aunt and in a lower tone  friday was the day on which the thanksgiving service was to be celebrated in the jesuit church of st george of cappadocia lothair knew this well enough and was embarrassed a thanksgiving for the mercy vouchsafed to miss arundel in saving the life of a fellowcountryman an that fellowcountryman not present all her protestant friends would be there and some russians and he not there it seemed on his part the most ungracious and intolerable conduct and he knew that she would prefer his presence to that of all her acquaintances together it was more than ungracious on his part it was ungrateful almost inhuman  lothair sat silent and stupid and stiff and dissatisfied with himself once or twice he tried to speak but his tongue would not move or his throat was not clear and if he had spoken he would only have made some trifling and awkward remark in his minds eye he saw gliding about him the veiled figure of his sickroom and he recalled with clearness the unceasing and angelic tenderness of which at the time he seemed hardly conscious  miss arundel had risen and had proceeded some way down the room to a cabinet where she was accustomed to place her work suddenly lothair rose and followed her miss arundel he said and she looked round hardly stopping when he had reached her miss arundel i hope you will permit me to be present at the celebration on friday  she turned round quickly extending even eagerly her hand with mantling cheek her eyes glittered with celestial fire the words hurried from her palpitating lips and support me she said for i need support  in the evening reception monsignore catesby approached father coleman it is done he said with a look of saintly triumph it is done at last he will not only be present but he will support her there are yet eightandforty hours to elapse can any thing happen to defeat us it would seem not yet when so much is at stake one is fearful he must never be out of our sight not a human being must approach him  i think we can manage that said father coleman    chapter 66   the jesuit church of st george of cappadocia was situate in one of the finest piazzas of rome it was surrounded with arcades and in its centre the most beautiful fountain of the city spouted forth its streams to an amazing height and in forms of graceful fancy on friday morning the arcades were festooned with tapestry and hangings of crimson velvet and gold every part was crowded and all the rank and fashion and power of rome seemed to be there assembling there had been once some intention on the part of the holy father to be present but a slight indisposition had rendered that not desirable his holiness however had ordered a company of his halberdiers to attend and the ground was kept by those wonderful guards in the dress of the middle ageshalberds and ruffs and white plumes and partycolored coats a match for our beefeaters carriages with scarlet umbrellas on the box and each with three servingmen behind denoted the presence of the cardinals in force they were usually brilliant equipages being sufficiently new or sufficiently new purchases garibaldi and the late commanding officer of lothair having burnt most of the ancient coaches in the time of the roman republics twenty years before from each carriage an eminence descended with his scarlet cap and his purple train borne by two attendants the princess tarpeiacinque cento was there and most of the roman princes and princesses and dukes and duchesses it seemed that the whole court of rome was theremonsignori and prelates without end some of their dresses and those of the generals of the orders appropriately varied the general effect for the ladies were all in black their heads covered only with black veils  monsignore catesby had arranged with lothair that they should enter the church by their usual private way and lothair therefore was not in any degree prepared for the sight which awaited him on his entrance into it the church was crowded not a chair nor a tribune vacant there was a suppressed gossip going on as in a public place before a performance begins much fluttering of fans some snuff taken and many sugarplums  where shall we find a place said lothair  they expect us in the sacristy said the monsignore  the sacristy of the jesuit church of st george of cappadocia might have served for the ballroom of a palace it was lofty and proportionately spacious with a grooved ceiling painted with all the court of heaven above the broad and richlygilt cornice floated a company of seraphim that might have figured as the cupids of albano the apartment was crowded for there and in some adjoining chambers were assembled the cardinals and prelates and all the distinguished or official characters who in a few minutes were about to form a procession of almost unequal splendor and sanctity and which was to parade the whole body of the church  lothair felt nervous an indefinable depression came over him as on the morning of a contest when a candidate enters his crowded committeeroom considerable personages bowing approached to address himthe cardinal prefect of the propaganda the cardinal assessor of the holy office the cardinal prodatario and the cardinal vicar of rome monsignori the secretary of briefs to princes and the master of the apostolic palace were presented to him had this been a conclave and lothair the future pope it would have been impossible to have treated him with more consideration than he experienced they assured him that they looked upon this day as one of the most interesting in their lives and the importance of which to the church could not be overrated all this somewhat encouraged him and he was more himself when a certain general stir and the entrance of individuals from adjoining apartments intimated that the proceedings were about to commence it seemed difficult to marshal so considerable and so stately an assemblage but those who had the management of affairs were experienced in such matters the acolytes and the thurifers fell into their places there seemed no end of banners and large golden crosses great was the company of the prelatesa long purple line some only in cassocks some in robes and mitred then came a new banner of the blessed virgin which excited intense interest and every eye was strained to catch the pictured scene after this banner amid frequent incense walked two of the most beautiful children in rome dressed as angels with golden wings the boy bearing a rose of jericho the girl a lily after these as was understood dressed in black and veiled walked six ladies who were said to be daughters of the noblest houses of england and then a single form with a veil touching the ground  here we must go said monsignore catesby to lothair and he gently but irresistibly pushed him into his place you know you promised to support her you had better take this he said thrusting a lighted taper into his hand it is usual and one should never be singular  so they walked on followed by the roman princes bearing a splendid baldachin and then came the pomp of the cardinals each with his trainbearers exhibiting with the skill of artists the splendor of their violet robes  as the head of the procession emerged from the sacristy into the church three organs and a choir to which all the roman churches had lent their choicest voices burst into the te deum round the church and to all the chapels and then up the noble nave the majestic procession moved and then the gates of the holy place opening the cardinals entered and seated themselves their trainbearers crouching at their knees the prelates grouped themselves and the banners and crosses were ranged in the distance except the new banner of the virgin which seemed to hang over the altar the holy one seemed to be in what was recently a field of battle and was addressing a beautiful maiden in the dress of a sister of mercy  this is your place said monsignore catesby and he pushed lothair into a prominent position  the service was long but sustained by exquisite music celestial perfumes and the graceful movements of priests in resplendent dresses continually changing it could not be said to be wearisome when all was over monsignore catesby said to lothair i think we had better return by the public way it seems expected  it was not easy to leave the church lothair was detained and received the congratulations of the princess tarpeiacinque cento and many others the crowd much excited by the carriages of the cardinals had not diminished when they came forth and they were obliged to linger some little time upon the steps the monsignore making difficulties when lothair more than once proposed to advance  i think we may go now said catesby and they descended into the piazza immediately many persons in this immediate neighborhood fell upon their knees many asked a blessing from lothair and some rushed forward to kiss the hem of his garment    chapter 67   the princess tarpeiacinque cento gave an entertainment in the evening in honor of the great event italian palaces are so vast are so illadapted to the moderate establishments of modern tones that their grand style in general only impresses those who visit them with a feeling of disappointment and even mortification the meagre retinue are almost invisible as they creep about the corridors and galleries and linger in the sequence of lofty chambers these should be filled with crowds of servingmen and groups of splendid retainers they were built for the days when a great man was obliged to have a great following and when the safety of his person as well as the success of his career depended on the number and the lustre of his train  the palace of the princess tarpeia was the most celebrated in rome one of the most ancient and certainly the most beautiful she dwelt in it in a manner not unworthy of her consular blood and her modern income tonight her guests were received by a long line of footservants in showy liveries and bearing the badge of her house while in every convenient spot pages and gentlemenushers in courtly dress guided the guests to their place of destination the palace blazed with light and showed to advantage the thousand pictures which it is said were there enshrined and the long galleries full of the pale statues of grecian gods and goddesses and the busts of the former rulers of rome and the romans the atmosphere was fragrant with rare odors and music was heard amid the fall of fountains in the dim but fancifullyillumined gardens  the princess herself wore all those famous jewels which had been spared by all the goths from the days of brennus to those of garibaldi and on her bosom reposed the celebrated transparent cameo of augustus which caesar himself is said to have presented to livia and which benvenuto cellini had set in a framework of cupids and rubies if the weight of her magnificence were sometimes distressing she had the consolation of being supported by the arm of lothair  two young roman princes members of the guarda nobile discussed the situation  the english here say said one that he is their richest man  and very noble too said the other  certainly truly noblea kind of cousin of the queen  this great event must have an effect upon all their nobility i cannot doubt they will all return to the holy father  they would if they were not afraid of having to restore their church lands but they would be much more happy if rome were again the capital of the world  no shadow of doubt i wonder if this young prince will hunt in the campagna  all englishmen hunt  i make no doubt he rides well and has famous horses and will sometimes lend us one i am glad his soul is saved  yes it is well when the blessed virgin interferes it should be in favor of princes when princes become good christians it is an example it does good and this man will give an impulse to our opera which wants it and as you say he will have many horses  in the course of the evening miss arundel with a beaming face but of deep expression said to lothair i could tell you some good news had i not promised the cardinal that he should communicate it to you himself he will see you tomorrow although it does not affect me personally it will be to me the happiest event that ever occurred except of course one  what can she mean thought lothair but at that moment cardinal berwick approached him and miss arundel glided away  father coleman attended lothair home to the agostini palace and when they parted said with much emphasis i must congratulate you once more on the great event  on the following morning lothair found on his table a number of the roman journal published that day it was customary to place it there but in general he only glanced at it and scarcely that on the present occasion his own name caught immediately his eye it figured in a long account of the celebration of the preceding day it was with a continually changing countenance now scarlet now pallid as death with a palpitating heart a trembling hand a cold perspiration and at length a disordered vision that lothair read the whole of an article of which we now give a summary  rome was congratulated on the service of yesterday which celebrated the greatest event of this century and it came to pass in this wise it seems that a young english noble of the highest rank family and for tune and here the name and titles of lothair were accurately given like many of the scions of the illustrious and influential families of britain was impelled by an irresistible motive to enlist as a volunteer in the service of the pope when the holy father was recentlyattacked by the secret societies of atheism this gallant and gifted youth after prodigies of valor and devotion had fallen at mentana in the sacred cause and was given up for lost the day after the battle when the ambulances laden with the wounded were hourly arriving at rome from the field an english lady daughter of an illustrious house celebrated throughout centuries for its devotion to the holy see and who during the present awful trial had never ceased in her efforts to support the cause of christianity was employed as was her wont in offices of charity and was tending with her companion sisters her wounded countrymen at the hospital la consolazione in the new ward which has been recently added to that establishment by the holy father  while she was leaning over one of the beds she felt a gentle and peculiar pressure on her shoulder and looking round beheld a most beautiful woman with a countenance of singular sweetness and yet majesty and the visitor said you are attending to those english who believe in the virgin mary now at the hospital santissima trinita di pellegrini there is in an ambulance a young englishman apparently dead but who will not die if you go to him immediately and say you came in the name of the virgin  the influence of the stranger was so irresistible that the young english lady attended by a nurse and one of the porters of la consolazione repaired instantly to the di pellegrini and there they found in the courtyard as they had been told an ambulance in form and color and equipment unlike any ambulance used by the papal troops and in the ambulance the senseless body of a youth who was recognized by the english lady as her young and gallant countryman she claimed him in the name of the blessed virgin and after due remedies was permitted to take him at once to his noble relatives who lived in the palazzo agostini  after a short time much conversation began to circulate about this incident the family wished to testify their gratitude to the individual whose information had led to the recovery of the body and subsequently of the life of their relation but all that they could at first learn at la consolazione was that the porter believed the woman was maria serafina di angelis the handsome wife of a tailor in the strada di ripetta but it was soon shown that this could not be true for it was proved that on the day in question maria serafina di angelis was on a visit to a friend at la riccia and in the second place that she did not bear the slightest resemblance to the stranger who had given the news moreover the porter of the gate being required to state why he had admitted any stranger without the accustomed order denied that he had so done that he was in his lodge and the gates were locked and the stranger had passed through without his knowledge  two priests were descending the stairs when the stranger came upon them and they were so struck by the peculiarity of her carriage that they turned round and looked at her and clearly observed at the back of her head a sort of halo she was out of their sight when they made this observation but in consequence of it they made inquiries of the porter of the gate and remained in the courtyard till she returned  this she did a few minutes before the english lady and her attendants came down as they had been detained by the preparation of some bandages and other remedies without which they never moved the porter of the gate having his attention called to the circumstance by the priests was most careful in his observations as to the halo and described it as most distinct the priests then followed the stranger who proceeded down a long and solitary street made up in a great degree of garden and convent walls and without a turning they observed her stop and speak to two or three children and then though there was no house to enter and no street to turn into she vanished  when they had reached the children they found each of them holding in its hand a beautiful flower it seems the lady had given the boy a rose of jericho and to his sister a white and golden lily inquiring whether she had spoken to them they answered that she had said let these flowers be kept in remembrance of me they will never fade and truly though months had elapsed these flowers had never failed and after the procession of yesterday they were placed under crystal in the chapel of the blessed virgin in the jesuit church of st george of cappadocia and may be seen every day and will be seen forever in primeval freshness  this is the truthful account of what really occurred with respect to this memorable event and as it was ascertained by a consulta of the holy office presided over by the cardinal prefect himself the holy office is most severe in its inquisition of the truth and though it well knows that the divine presence never leaves his church it is most scrupulous in its investigations whenever any miraculous interposition is alleged it was entirely by its exertions that the somewhat inconsistent and unsatisfactory evidence of the porter of the gate in the first instance was explained cleared and established the whole chain of evidence worked out all idle gossip and mere rumors rejected and the evidence obtained of above twenty witnesses of all ranks of life some of them members of the learned profession and others military officers of undoubted honor and veracity who witnessed the first appearance of the stranger at the pellegrini and the undoubted fact of the halo playing round her temples  the consulta of the holy office could only draw one inference sanctioned by the holy father himself as to the character of the personage who thus deigned to appear and interpose and no wonder that in the great function of yesterday the eyes of all rome were fixed upon lothair as the most favored of living men  he himself now felt as one sinking into an unfathomable abyss the despair came over him that involves a man engaged in a hopeless contest with a remorseless power all his life during the last year passed rushingly across his mind he recalled the wiles that had been employed to induce him to attend a function in a jesuits chapel in an obscure nook of london the same agencies had been employed there then as now the influence of clare arundel had been introduced to sway him when all others had failed belmont had saved him then there was no belmont now the last words of theodora murmured in his ear like the awful voice of a distant sea they were the diapason of all the thought and feeling of that profound and passionate spirit  that seemed only a petty plot in london and he had since sometimes smiled when he remembered how it had been baffled shallow apprehension the petty plot was only part of a great and unceasing and triumphant conspiracy and the obscure and inferior agencies which he had been rash enough to deride had consummated their commanded purpose in the eyes of all europe and with the aid of the great powers of the world  he felt all the indignation natural to a sincere and highspirited man who finds that he has been befooled by those whom he has trustee but summoning all his powers to extricate himself from his desolate dilemma he found himself without resource what public declaration on his part could alter the undeniable fact now circulating throughout the world that in the supernatural scene of yesterday he was the willing and the principal actor unquestionably he had been very imprudent not only in that instance but in his habitual visits to the church he felt all that now but he was tom and shattered infinitely distressed both in body and in mind weak and miserable and he thought he was leaning on angelic hearts when he found himself in the embrace of spirits of another sphere  in what a position of unexampled pain did he not now find himself to feel it your duty to quit the faith in which you have been bred must involve an awful pang but to be a renegade without the consolation of conscience against your sense against your will alike for no celestial hope and no earthly objectthis was agony mixed with selfcontempt  he remembered what lady corisande had once said to him about those who quitted their native church for the roman communion what would she say now he marked in imagination the cloud of sorrow on her imperial brow and the scorn of her curled lip  whatever happened he could never return to englandat least for many years when all the things and persons he cared for would have disappeared or changed which is worse and then what would be the use of returning he would go to america or australia or the indian ocean or the interior of africa but even in all these places according to the correspondence of the propaganda he would find roman priests and active priests he felt himself a lost man not free from faults in this matter but punished beyond his errors but this is the fate of men who think they can struggle successfully with a supernatural power  a servant opened a door and said in a loud voice that with his permission his eminence the english cardinal would wait on him    chapter 68   it is proverbial to what drowning men will cling lothair in his utter hopelessness made a distinction between the cardinal and the conspirators the cardinal had been absent from rome during the greater portion of the residence of lothair in that city the cardinal was his fathers friend an english gentleman with an english education once an anglican a man of the world a man of honor a good kindhearted man lothair explained the apparent and occasional cooperation of his eminence with the others by their making use of him without a due consciousness of their purpose on his part lothair remembered how delicately his former guardian had always treated the subject of religion in their conversations the announcement of his visit instead of aggravating the distresses of lothair seemed as all these considerations rapidly occurred to him almost to impart a ray of hope  i see said the cardinal as he entered serene and graceful as usual and glancing at the table that you have been reading the account of our great act of yesterday  yes and i have been reading it said lothair reddening with indignation with alarm i should add with disgust  how is this said the cardinal feeling or affecting surprise  it is a tissue of falsehood and imposture continued lothair and i will take care that my opinion is known of it  do nothing rashly said the cardinal this is an official journal and i have reason to believe that nothing appears in it which is not drawn up or well considered by truly pious men  you yourself sir must know continued lothair that the whole of this statement is founded on falsehood  indeed i should be sorry to believe said the cardinal that there was a particle of misstatement or even exaggeration either in the base or the superstructure of the narrative  good god exclaimed lothair why take the very first allegation that i fell at mentana fighting in the ranks of the holy father everyone knows that i fell fighting against him and that i was almost slain by one of his chassepots it is notorious and though as a matter of taste i have not obtruded the fact in the society in which i have been recently living i have never attempted to conceal it and have not the slightest doubt that it must be as familiar to every member of that society as to your eminence  i know there are two narratives of your relations with the battle of mentana observed the cardinal quietly the one accepted as authentic is that which appears in this journal the other account which can only be traced to yourself bears no doubt a somewhat different character but considering that it is in the highest degree improbable and that there is not a tittle of confirmatory or collateral evidence to extenuate its absolute unlikelihood i hardly think you are justified in using with reference to the statement in this article the harsh expression which i am persuaded on reflection you will feel you have hastily used  i think said lothair with a kindling eye and a burning cheek that i am the best judge of what i did at mentana  well well said the cardinal with dulcet calmness you naturally think so but you must remember you have been very ill my dear young friend and laboring under much excitement if i were youand i speak as your friend i hope your best onei would not dwell too much on this fancy of yours about the battle of mentana i would myself always deal tenderly with a fixed idea harsh attempts to terminate hallucination are seldom successful nevertheless in the case of a public event a matter of fact if a man finds that he is of one opinion and all orders of society of another he should not be encouraged to dwell on a perverted view he should be gradually weaned from it  you amaze me said lothair  not at all said the cardinal i am sure you will benefit by my advice and you must already perceive that assuming the interpretation which the world without exception places on your conduct in the field to be the just one there really is not a single circumstance in the whole of this interesting and important statement the accuracy of which you yourself would for a moment dispute  what is there said about me at mentana makes me doubt of all the rest said lothair  well we will not dwell on mentana said the cardinal with a sweet smile i have treated of that point your case is by no means an uncommon one it will wear off with returning health king george iv believed that he was at the battle of waterloo and indeed commanded there and his friends were at one time a little alarmed but knighton who was a sensible man said his majesty has only to leave off curacao and rest assured he will gain no more victories the rest of this statement which is today officially communicated to the whole world and which in its results will probably be not less important even than the celebration of the centenary of st peter is established by evidence so incontestableby witnesses so numerous so variousin all the circumstances and accidents of testimony so satisfactoryi may say so irresistible that controversy on this head would be a mere impertinence and waste of time  i am not convinced said lothair  hush said the cardinal the freaks of your own mind about personal incidents however lamentable may be viewed with indulgenceat least for a time but you cannot be permitted to doubt of the rest you must be convinced and on reflection you will be convinced remember sir where you are you are in the centre of christendom where truth and where alone truth resides divine authority has perused this paper and approved it it is published for the joy and satisfaction of two hundred millions of christians and for the salvation of all those who unhappily for themselves are not yet converted to the faith it records the most memorable event of this century our blessed lady has personally appeared to her votaries before during that period but never at rome wisely and well she has worked in villages and among the illiterate as at the beginning did her divine son but the time is now ripe for terminating the infidelity of the world in the eternal city amid all its matchless learning and profound theology in the sight of thousands this great act has been accomplished in a manner which can admit of no doubt and which can lead to no controversy some of the most notorious atheists of rome have already solicited to be admitted to the offices of the church the secret societies have received their deathblow i look to the alienation of england as virtually over i am panting to see you return to the home of your fathers and reconquer it for the church in the name of the lord god of sabaoth never was a man in a greater position since godfrey or ignatius the eyes of all christendom are upon you as the most favored of men and you stand there like saint thomas  perhaps he was as bewildered as i am said lothair  well his bewilderment ended in his becoming an apostle as yours will i am glad we have had this conversation and that we agree i knew we should but now i wish to speak to you on business and very grave the world assumes that being the favored of heaven you are naturally and necessarily a member of the church i your late guardian know that is not the case and sometimes i blame myself that it is not so but i have ever scrupulously refrained from attempting to control your convictions and the result has justified me heaven has directed your life and i have now to impart to you the most gratifying intelligence that can be communicated by man and that the holy father will tomorrow himself receive you into the bosom of that church of which he is the divine head christendom will then hail you as its champion and regenerator and thus will be realized the divine dream with which you were inspired in our morning walk in the park at vauxe    chapter 69   it was the darkest hour in lothairs life he had become acquainted with sorrow he had experienced calamities physical and moral the death of theodora had shaken him to the centre it was that first great grief which makes a man acquainted with his deepest feelings which detracts something from the buoyancy of the youngest life and dims to a certain degree the lustre of existence but even that bereavement was mitigated by distractions alike inevitable and ennobling the sternest and highest of all obligations military duty claimed him with an unfaltering grasp and the clarion sounded almost as he closed her eyes then he went forth to struggle for a cause which at least she believed to be just and sublime and if his own convictions on that head might be less assured or precise still there was doubtless much that was inspiring in the contest and much dependent on the success of himself and his comrades that tended to the elevation of man  but now there was not a single circumstance to sustain his involved and sinking life a renegadea renegade without conviction without necessity in absolute violation of the pledge he had given to the person he most honored and most loved as he received her parting spirit and why was all this and bow was all this what system of sorcery had encompassed his existence for he was spellboundas much as any knight in fairytale whom malignant influences had robbed of his valor and will and virtue no sane person could credit even comprehend his position had he the opportunity of stating it in a court of justice tomorrow he could only enter into a narrative which would decide his lot as an insane being the magical rites had been so gradual so subtle so multifarious all in appearance independent of each other though in reality scientifically combined that while the conspirators had probably effected his ruin both in body and in soul the only charges he could make against them would be acts of exquisite charity tenderness selfsacrifice personal devotion refined piety and religious sentiment of the most exalted character  what was to be done and could any thing be done could he escape where from and where to he was certain and had been for some time from many circumstances that he was watched could he hope that the vigilance which observed all his movements would scruple to prevent any which might be inconvenient he felt assured that to quit that palace alone was not in his power and were it whither could he go to whom was he to appeal and about what was he to appeal should he appeal to the holy father there would be an opportunity for that tomorrow to the college of cardinals who had solemnized yesterday with gracious unction his spiritual triumph to those congenial spirits the mild assessor of the inquisition or the president of the propaganda who was busied at that moment in circulating throughout both the americas all asia all africa all australia and parts of europe for the edification of distant millions the particulars of the miraculous scene in which he was the principal actor should he throw himself on the protection of the ambiguous minister of the british crown and invoke his aid against a conspiracy touching the rights reason and freedom of one of her majestys subjects he would probably find that functionary inditing a private letter to the english secretary of state giving the minister a graphic account of the rare doings of yesterday and assuring the minister from his own personal and ocular experience that a member of one of the highest orders of the british peerage carried in the procession a lighted taper after two angels with amaranthine flowers and golden wings  lothair remained in his apartments no one approached him it was the only day that the monsignore had not waited on him father coleman was equally reserved strange to say not one of those agreeable and polite gentlemen fathers of the oratory who talked about gems torsos and excavations and who always more or less attended his levee troubled him this morning with that exquisite tact which pervades the hierarchical circles of rome every one felt that lothair on the eve of that event of his life which providence had so long and so mysteriously prepared would wish to be undisturbed  restless disquieted revolving all the incidents of his last year trying by terrible analysis to ascertain how he ever could have got into such a false position and how he could yet possibly extricate himself from it not shrinking in many things from selfblame and yet not recognizing on his part such a degree of deviation from the standard of right feeling or even of commonsense as would authorize such an overthrow as that awaiting himhigh rank and boundless wealth a station of duty and of honor some gifts of nature and golden youth and a disposition that at least aspired in the employment of these accidents of life and fortune at something better than selfish gratification all smashedthe day drew on  drew on the day and every hour it seemed his spirit was more lone and dark for the first time the thought of death occurred to him as a relief from the perplexities of existence how much better had he died at mentana to this pass had arrived the cordial and brilliant lord of muriel who enjoyed and adorned life and wished others to adorn and to enjoy it the individual whom probably were the majority of the english people polled they would have fixed upon as filling the most enviable of all positions and holding out a hope that he was not unworthy of it born with every advantage that could command the sympathies of his fellowmen with a quick intelligence and a noble disposition here he was at oneandtwenty ready to welcome death perhaps even to devise it as the only rescue from a doom of confusion degradation and remorse  he had thrown himself on a sofa and had buried his face in his hands to assist the abstraction which he demanded there was not an incident of his life that escaped the painful inquisition of his memory he passed his childhood once more in that stern scotch home that after all had been so kind and as it would seem so wise the last words of counsel and of warning from his uncle expressed at muriel came back to him and yet there seemed a destiny throughout these transactions which was irresistible the last words of theodora her look even more solemn than her tone might have been breathed over a tripod for they were a prophecy not a warning  how long he had been absorbed in this passionate reverie he knew not but when he looked up again it was night and the moon had touched his window he rose and walked up and down the room and then went into the corridor all was silent not an attendant was visible the sky was clear and starry and the moonlight fell on the tall still cypresses in the vast quadrangle  lothair leaned over the balustrade and gazed upon the moonlit fountains the change of scene silent and yet not voiceless and the softening spell of the tranquillizing hour were a relief to him and after a time he wandered about the corridors and after a time he descended into the court the tall swiss in his grand uniform was closing the gates which had just released a visitor lothair motioned that he too wished to go forth and the swiss obeyed him the threshold was passed and lothair found himself for the first time alone in rome  utterly reckless he cared not where he went or what might happen the streets were quite deserted and he wandered about with a strange curiosity gratified as he sometimes encountered famous objects he had read of and yet the true character of which no reading ever realizes  the moonlight becomes the proud palaces of rome their corniced and balconied fronts rich with deep shadows in the blaze sometimes he encountered an imperial column sometimes he came to an arcadian square flooded with light and resonant with the fall of statued fountains emerging from a long straggling street of convents and gardens he found himself in an open space full of antique ruins and among them the form of a colossal amphitheatre that he at once recognized  it rose with its three tiers of arches and the huge wall that crowns them black and complete in the air and not until lothair had entered it could he perceive the portion of the outer wall that was in ruins and now bathed with the silver light lothair was alone in that huge creation once echoing with the shouts and even the agonies of thousands lothair was alone  he sat him down on a block of stone in that sublime and desolate arena and asked himself the secret spell of this rome that had already so agitated his young life and probably was about critically to affect it theodora lived for rome and died for rome and the cardinal born and bred an english gentleman with many hopes and honors had renounced his religion and it might be said his country for rome and for rome tomorrow catesby would die without a pang and sacrifice himself for rome as his race for three hundred years had given for the same cause honor and broad estates and unhesitating lives and these very people were influenced by different motives and thought they were devoting themselves to opposite ends but still it was romerepublican or caesarian papal or pagan it still was rome  was it a breeze in a breezeless night that was sighing amid these ruins a pinetree moved its head on a broken arch and there was a stir among the plants that hung on the ancient walls it was a breeze in a breezeless night that was sighing amid the ruins  there was a tall crag of ancient building contiguous to the block on which lothair was seated and which on his arrival he had noted although long lost in reverie he had not recently turned his glance in that direction he was roused from that reverie by the indefinite sense of some change having occurred which often disturbs and terminates ones brooding thoughts and looking round he felt he saw he was no longer alone the moonbeams fell upon a figure that was observing him from the crag of ruin that was near and as the light clustered and gathered round the form it became every moment more definite and distinct  lothair would have sprung forward but he could only extend his arms he would have spoken but his tongue was paralyzed  lothair said a deep sweet voice that never could be forgotten  i am here he at last replied  remember and she threw upon him that glance at once serene and solemn that had been her last and was impressed indelibly upon his heart of hearts  now he could spring forward and throw himself at her feet but alas as he reached her the figure melted into the moonlight and she was gonethat divine theodora who let us hope returned at last to those elysian fields she so well deserved    chapter 70   they have overdone it gertrude with lothair said lord jerome to his wife i spoke to monsignore catesby about it some time ago but he would not listen to me i had more confidence in the cardinal and am disappointed but a priest is ever too hot his nervous system has been tried too much  lady st jerome still hoped the best and believed in it she was prepared to accept the way lothair was found senseless in the coliseum as a continuance of miraculous interpositions he might have remained there for a day or days and never have been recognized when discovered how marvelously providential that father coleman should have been in the vicinity and tempted to visit the great ruin that very night  lord st jerome was devout and easy in his temper priests and women seemed to have no difficulty in managing him but he was an english gentleman and there was at the bottom of his character a fund of courage firmness and commonsense that sometimes startled and sometimes perplexed those who assumed that he could be easily controlled he was not satisfied with the condition of lothair a peer of england and my connection and he had not unlimited confidence in those who had been hitherto consulted as to his state there was a celebrated english physician at that time visiting rome and lord st jerome notwithstanding the multiform resistance of monsignors catesby insisted he should be called in to lothair  the english physician was one of those men who abhor priests and do not particularly admire ladies the latter in revenge denounced his manners as brutal though they always sent for him and were always trying though vainly to pique him into sympathy he rarely spoke but he listened to every one with entire patience he sometimes asked a question but he never made a remark  lord st jerome had seen the physician alone before he visited the palazzo agostini and had talked to him freely about lothair the physician saw at once that lord st jerome was truthful and that though his intelligence might be limited it was pure and direct appreciating lord st jerome that nobleman found the redoubtable doctor not ungenial and assured his wife that she would meet on the morrow by no means so savage a being as she anticipated she received him accordingly and in the presence of monsignore catesby never had she exercised her distinguished powers of social rhetoric with more art and fervor and never apparently had they proved less productive of the intended consequences the physician said not a word and merely bowed when exhausted nature consigned the luminous and impassioned lady st jerome to inevitable silence monsignore catesby felt he was bound in honor to make some diversion in her favor repeat some of her unanswered inquiries and reiterate some of her unnoticed views but the only return he received was silence without a bow and then the physician remarked i presume i can now see the patient  the english physician was alone with lothair for some time and then he met in consultation the usual attendants the result of all these proceedings was that he returned to the saloon in which he found lord and lady st jerome monsignore catesby and father coleman and he then said my opinion is that his lordship should quit rome immediately and i think he had better return at once to his own country  all the efforts of the english propaganda were now directed to prevent the return of lothair to his own country the cardinal and lady st jerome and the monsignore and father coleman all the beautiful young countesses who had gone over to rome and all the spirited young earls who had come over to bring their wives back but had unfortunately remained themselves looked very serious and spoke much in whispers lord st jerome was firm that lothair should immediately leave the city and find that change of scene and air which were declared by authority to be indispensable for his health both of mind and body but his return to england at this moment was an affair of serious difficulty he could not return unattended and attended too by some intimate and devoted friend besides it was very doubtful whether lothair had strength remaining to bear so great an exertion and at such a season of the yearand he seemed disinclined to it himself he also wished to leave rome but he wished also in time to extend his travels amid these difficulties a neapolitan duke a great friend of monsignore catesby a gentleman who always had a friend in need offered to the young english noble the interesting young englishman so favored by heaven the use of his villa on the coast of the remotest part of sicily near syracuse here was a solution of many difficulties departure from rome change of scene and airsea air too particularly recommendedand almost the same as a return to england without an effort for was it not an island only with a better climate and a people with free institutions or a taste for them which is the same  the mode in which lady st jerome and monsignors catesby consulted lord st jerome on the subject took the adroit but insidious form of congratulating him on the entire and unexpected fulfilment of his purpose are we not fortunate exclaimed her ladyship looking up brightly in his face and gently pressing one of his arms  exactly everything your lordship required echoed monsignore catesby congratulating him by pressing the other  the cardinal said to lord st jerome in the course of the morning in an easy way and as if he were not thinking too much of the matter so you have got out of all your difficulties  lord st jerome was not entirely satisfied but he thought he had done a great deal and to say the truth the effort for him had not been inconsiderable and so the result was that lothair accompanied by monsignore catesby and father coleman travelled by easy stages and chiefly on horseback through a delicious and romantic country which alone did lothair a great deal of good to the coast crossed the straits on a serene afternoon visited messina and palermo and finally settled at their point of destinationthe villa catalano  nothing could be more satisfactory than the monsignores bulletin announcing to his friends at rome their ultimate arrangements three weeks travel air horse exercise the inspiration of the landscape and the clime had wonderfully restored lothair and they might entirely count on his passing holy week at rome when all they had hoped and prayed for would by the blessing of the holy virgin be accomplished    chapter 71   the terrace of the villa catalano with its orange and palm trees looked upon a sea of lapiz lazuli and rose from a shelving shore of aloes and arbutus the waters reflected the color of the sky and all the foliage wag bedewed with the same violet light of morn which bathed the softness of the distant mountains and the undulating beauty of the evervarying coast  lothair was walking on the terrace his favorite walk for it was the duly occasion on which he ever found himself alone not that he had any reason to complain of his companions more complete ones could scarcely be selected travel which they say tries all tempers had only proved the engaging equanimity of catesby and had never disturbed the amiable repose of his brother priest and then they were so entertaining and so instructive as well as handy and experienced in all common things the monsignore had so much taste and feeling and various knowledge and as for the reverend father all the antiquaries they daily encountered were mere children in his hands who without effort could explain and illustrate every scene and object and spoke as if he had never given a thought to any other theme than sicily and syracuse the expedition of nicias and the adventures of agathocles and yet during all their travels lothair felt that he never was alone this was remarkable at the great cities such as messina and palermo but it was a prevalent habit in lessfrequented places there was a petty town near them which he had never visited alone although he had made more than one attempt with that view and it was only on the terrace in the early morn a spot whence he could be observed from the villa and which did not easily communicate with the precipitous and surrounding scenery that lothair would indulge that habit of introspection which he had pursued through many a long ride and which to him was a neverfailing source of interest and even excitement  he wanted to ascertain the causes of what he deemed the failure of his life and of the dangers and discomfiture that were still impending over him were these causes to be found in any peculiarity of his disposition or in the general inexperience and incompetence of youth the latter he was now quite willing to believe would lead their possessors into any amount of disaster but his ingenuous nature hesitated before it accepted them as the selfcomplacent solution of his present deplorable position  of a nature profound and inquisitive though with a great fund of reverence which had been developed by an ecclesiastical education lothair now felt that he had started in life with an extravagant appreciation of the influence of the religious principle on the conduct of human affairs with him when heaven was so nigh earth could not be remembered and yet experience showed that so long as one was on the earth the incidents of this planet considerably controlled ones existence both in behavior and in thought all the world could not retire to mount athos it was clear therefore that there was a juster conception of the relations between religion and life than that which he had at first adopted  practically theodora had led or was leading him to this result but theodora though religious did not bow before those altars to which he for a moment had never been faithless theodora believed in her immortality and did not believe in death according to the ecclesiastical interpretation but her departure from the scene and the circumstances under which it had taken place had unexpectedly and violently restored the course of his life to its old bent shattered and shorn he was willing to believe that he was again entering the kingdom of heaven but found he was only under the gilded dome of a jesuits church and woke to reality from a scene of magical deceptions with a sad conviction that even cardinals and fathers of the church were inevitably influenced in this life by its interest and his passions  but the incident of his life that most occupiedit might be said engrossedhis meditation was the midnight apparition in the coliseum making every allowance that a candid nature and an ingenious mind could suggest for explicatory circumstances the tension of his nervous system which was then doubtless strained to its last point the memory of her deathscene which always harrowed and haunted him and that dark collision between his promise and his life which then after so many efforts appeared by some supernatural ordination to be about inevitably to occur in that very rome whose gigantic shades surrounded him he still could not resist the conviction that he had seen the form of theodora and had listened to her voice often the whole day when they were travelling and his companions watched him on his saddle in silent thought his mind in reality was fixed on this single incident and he was crossexamining his memory as some adroit and ruthless advocate deals with the witness in the box and tries to demonstrate his infidelity or his weakness  but whether it were indeed the apparition of his adored friend or a distempered dream lothair not less recognized the warning as divine and the only conviction he had arrived at throughout his sicilian travels was a determination that however tragical the cost his promise to theodora should never be broken  the beautiful terrace of the villa catalano overlooked a small bay to which it descended by winding walks the water was deep and in any other country the bay might have been turned to good account but bays abounded on this coast and the people with many harbors had no freights to occupy them this morn this violet morn when the balm of the soft breeze refreshed lothair and the splendor of the rising sun began to throw a flashing line upon the azure waters a few fishermen in one of the country boats happened to come in about to dry a net upon a sunny bank the boat was what is called a speronaro an open boat worked with oars but with a lateen sail at the same time when the breeze served  lothair admired the trim of the vessel and got talking with the men as they ate their bread and olives and a small fish or two  and your lateen sail continued lothair  is the best thing in the world except in a white squall replied the sailor and then every thing is queer in these seas with an open boat though i am not afraid of santa agnese and that is her name but i took two english officers who came over here for sport and whose leave of absence was outi took them over in her to malta and did it in ten hours i believe it had never been done in an open boat before but it was neck or nothing with them  and you saved them  with the lateen up the whole way  they owed you much and i hope they paid you well  i asked them ten ducats said the man and they paid me ten ducats  lothair had his hand in his pocket all this time feeling but imperceptibly for his purse and when he had found it feeling how it was lined he generally carried about him as much as fortunatus  what are you going to do with yourselves this morning said lothair  well not much we thought of throwing the net but we have had one dip and no great luck  are you inclined to give me a sail  certainly signor  have you a mind to go to malta  that is business signor  look here said lothair here are ten ducats in this purse and a little more i will give them to you if you will take me to malta at once but if you will start in a hundred seconds before the sun touches that rock and the waves just beyond it are already bright you shall have ten more ducats when you reach the isle  step in signor  from the nature of the course which was not in the direction of the open sea for they had to double cape passaro the speronaro was out of the sight of the villa in a few minutes they rowed only till they had doubled the cape and then set the lateen sail the breeze being light but steady and favorable they were soon in open sea no land in sight and if a white squall does rise thought lothair it will only settle many difficulties  but no white squall came every thing was favorable to their progress the wind the current the courage and spirit of the men who liked the adventure and liked lothair night came on but they were as tender to him as women fed him with their least coarse food and covered him with a cloak made of stuff spun by their mothers and their sisters  lothair was slumbering when the patron of the boat roused him and he saw at hand many lights and in a few minutes was in still water they were in one of the harbors of malta but not permitted to land at midnight and when the morn arrived the obstacles to the release of lothair were not easily removed a speronaro an open boat from sicily of course with no papers to prove their point of departurehere were materials for doubt and difficulty of which the petty officers of the port knew how to avail themselves they might come from barbary from an infected port plague might be aboard a question of quarantine lothair observed that they were nearly alongside of a fine steamyacht english for it bore the cross of st george and while on the quay he and the patron of the speronaro arguing with the officers of the port a gentleman from the yacht put ashore in a boat of which the bright equipment immediately attracted attention the gentleman landed almost close to the point where the controversy was carrying on the excited manner and voice of the sicilian mariner could not escape notice the gentleman stopped and looked at the group and then suddenly exclaimed good heavens my lord can it be you  ah mr phoebus you will help me said lothair and then he went up to him and told him every thing all difficulties of course vanished before the presence of mr phoebus whom the officers of the port evidently looked upon as a being beyond criticism and control  and now said mr phoebus about your people and your baggage  i have neither servants nor clothes said lothair and if it had not been for these good people i should not have had food    chapter 72   phoebus in his steamyacht pan of considerable admeasurement and fitted up with every luxury and convenience that science and experience could suggest was on his way to an island which he occasionally inhabited near the asian coast of the gean sea and which he rented from the chief of his wifes house the prince of samos mr phoebus by his genius and fame commanded a large income and he spent it freely and fully there was nothing of which he more disapproved than accumulation it was a practice which led to sordid habits and was fatal to the beautiful on the whole he thought it more odious even than debt more permanently degrading mr phoebus liked pomp and graceful ceremony and he was of opinion that great artists should lead a princely life so that in their manners and method of existence they might furnish models to mankind in general and elevate the tone and taste of nations  sometimes when he observed a friend noticing with admiration perhaps with astonishment the splendor or finish of his equipments he would say the world think i had a large fortune with madame phoebus i had nothing i understand that a fortune and no inconsiderable one would have been given had i chosen to ask for it but i did not choose to ask for it i made madame phoebus my wife because she was the finest specimen of the aryan race that i was acquainted with and i would have no considerations mixed up with the high motive that influenced me my fatherinlaw cantacuzene whether from a feeling of gratitude or remorse is always making us magnificent presents i like to receive magnificent presents but also to make them and i presented him with a picture which is the gem of his gallery and which if he ever part with it will in another generation be contended for by kings and peoples  on her last birthday we breakfasted with my fatherinlaw cantacuzene and madame phoebus found in her napkin a check for five thousand pounds i expended it immediately in jewels for her personal use for i wished my fatherinlaw to understand that there are other princely families in the world besides the cantacuzenes  a friend once ventured inquiringly to suggest whether his way of life might not be conducive to envy and so disturb that serenity of sentiment necessary to the complete life of an artist but mr phoebus would not for a moment admit the soundness of the objection no he said envy is a purely intellectual process splendor never excites it a man of splendor is looked upon always with favorhis appearance exhilarates the heart of man he is always popular people wish to dine with him to borrow his money but they do not envy him if you want to know what envy is you should live among artists you should hear me lecture at the academy i have sometimes suddenly turned round and caught countenances like that of the man who was waiting at the corner of the street for benvenuto cellini in order to assassinate the great florentine  it was impossible for lothair in his present condition to have fallen upon a more suitable companion than mr phoebus it is not merely change of scene and air that we sometimes want but a revolution in the atmosphere of thought and feeling in which we live and breathe besides his great intelligence and fancy and his peculiar views on art and man and affairs in general which always interested their hearer and sometimes convinced there was a general vivacity in mr phoebus and a vigorous sense of life which were inspiriting to his companions when there was any thing to be done great or small mr phoebus liked to do it and this as he averred from a sense of duty since if any thing is to be done it should be done in the best manner and no one could do it so well as mr phoebus he always acted as if he had been created to be the oracle and model of the human race but the oracle was never pompous or solemn and the model was always beaming with goodnature and high spirits  mr phoebus liked lothair he liked youth and goodlooking youth and youth that was intelligent and engaging and wellmannered he also liked old men but between fifty and seventy he saw little to approve of in the dark sex they had lost their good looks if they ever had any their wits were on the wane and they were invariably selfish when they attained second childhood the charm often returned age was frequently beautiful wisdom appeared like an aftermath and the heart which seemed dry and deadened suddenly put forth shoots of sympathy  mr phoebus postponed his voyage in order that lothair might make his preparations to become his guest in his island i cannot take you to a banker said mr phoebus for i have none but i wish you would share my purse nothing will ever induce me to use what they call paper money it is the worst thing that what they call civilization has produced neither hue nor shape and yet a substitute for the richest color and where the arts flourish the finest forms  the telegraph which brought an order to the bankers at malta to give an unlimited credit to lothair rendered it unnecessary for our friend to share what mr phoebus called his purse and yet he was glad to have the opportunity of seeing it as mr phoebus one morning opened a chest in his cabin and produced several velvet bags one full of pearls another of rubies others of venetian sequins napoleons and golden piastres i like to look at them said mr phoebus and find life more intense when they are about my person but banknotes so cold and thinthey give me an ague  madame phoebus and her sister euphrosyne welcomed lothair in maritime costumes which were absolutely bewitching wondrous jackets with loops of pearls girdles defended by dirks with handles of turquoises and tilted hats that while they screened their long eyelashes from the sun crowned the longer braids of their neverending hair mr phoebus gave banquets every day on board his yacht attended by the chief personages of the island and the most agreeable officers of the garrison they dined upon deck and it delighted him with a surface of sangfroid to produce a repast which both in its material and its treatment was equal to the refined festivals of paris sometimes they had a dance sometimes in his barge rowed by a crew in venetian dresses his guests glided on the tranquil waters under a starry sky and listened to the exquisite melodies of their hostess and her sister  at length the day of departure arrived it was bright with a breeze favorable to the sail and opportune for the occasion for all the officers of the garrison and all beautiful valetta itself seemed present in their yachts and barges to pay their last tribute of admiration to the enchanting sisters and the allaccomplished owner of the pan placed on the galley of his yacht mr phoebus surveyed the brilliant and animated scene with delight this is the way to conduct life he said if fortunately for them i could have passed another month among these people i could have developed a feeling equal to the old regattas of the venetians  the gean isle occupied by mr phoebus was of no inconsiderable dimensions a chain of mountains of white marble intersected it covered with forests of oak though in parts precipitous and bare the lowlands while they produced some good crops of grain and even cotton and silk were chiefly clothed with fruittreesorange and lemon and the fig the olive and the vine sometimes the land was uncultivated and was principally covered with myrtles of large size and oleanders and arbutus and thorny brooms here game abounded while from the mountainforests the wolf sometimes descended and spoiled and scared the islanders  on the seashore yet not too near the wave and on a sylvan declivity was along pavilionlooking building painted in white and arabesque it was backed by the forest which had a parklike character from its partial clearance and which after a convenient slip of even land ascended the steeper country and took the form of wooded hills backed in due time by still sylvan yet loftier elevations and sometimes a glittering peak  welcome my friend said mr phoebus to lothair welcome to an aryan clime an aryan landscape and an aryan race it will do you good after your semitic hallucinations    chapter 73   mr phoebus pursued a life in his island partly feudal partly oriental partly venetian and partly idiosyncratic he had a grand studio where he could always find interesting occupation in drawing every fine face and form in his dominions then he hunted and that was a remarkable scene the ladies looking like diana or her nymphs were mounted on creamcolored anatolian chargers with golden bells while mr phoebus himself in green velvet and sevenleagued boots sounded a wondrous twisted horn rife with all the inspiring or directing notes of musical and learned venerie his neighbors of condition came mounted but the field was by no means confined to cavaliers a vast crowd of men in small caps and jackets and huge white breeches and armed with all the weapons of palikari handjars and ataghans and silversheathed muskets of uncommon length and almost as old as the battle of lepanto always rallied round his standard the equestrians caracoled about the park and the horns sounded and the hounds bayed and the men shouted till the deer had all scudded away then by degrees the hunters entered the forest and the notes of venerie became more faint and the shouts more distant then for two or three hours all was silent save the sound of an occasional shot or the note of a stray hound until the human stragglers began to reappear emerging from the forest and in due time the great body of the hunt and a gilded cart drawn by mules and carrying the prostrate forms of fallowdeer and roebuck none of the ceremonies of the chase were omitted and the crowd dispersed refreshed by samian wine which mr phoebus was teaching them to make without resin and which they quaffed with shrugging shoulders  we must have a wolfhunt for you said euphrosyne to lothair you like excitement i believe  well i am rather inclined for repose at present and i came here with the hope of obtaining it  well we are never idle here in fact that would be impossible with gaston he has established here an academy of the fine arts and also revived the gymnasia and my sister and myself have schoolsonly music and dancing gaston does not approve of letters the poor people have of course their primary schools with their priests and gaston does not interfere with them but he regrets their existence he looks upon reading and writing as very injurious to education  sometimes reposing on divans the sisters received the chief persons of the isle and regaled them with fruits and sweetmeats and coffee and sherbets while gastons chibouques and tobacco of salonica were a proverb these meetings always ended with dance and song replete according to mr phoebus with studies of aryan life  i believe these islanders to be an unmixed race said mr phoebus the same form and visage prevails throughout and very little changed in any thingeven in their religion  unchanged in their religion said lothair with some astonishment  yes you will find it so their existence is easy their wants are not great and their means of subsistence plentiful they pass much of their life in what is called amusementand what is it they make parties of pleasure they go in procession to a fountain or a grove they dance and eat fruit and they return home singing songs they have in fact been performing unconsciously the religious ceremonies of their ancestors and which they pursue and will forever though they may have forgotten the name of the dryad or the nymph who presides over their waters  i should think their priests would guard them from these errors said lothair  the greek priests particularly in these asian islands are good sort of people said mr phoebus they marry and have generally large families often very beautiful they have no sacerdotal feelings for they never can have any preferment all the high posts in the greek church being reserved for the monks who study what is called theology the greek parish priest is not at all semitic there is nothing to counteract his aryan tendencies i have already raised the statue of a nymph at one of their favorite springs and places of pleasant pilgrimage and i have a statue now in the island still in its case which i contemplate installing in a famous grove of laurel not far off and very much resorted to  and what then inquired lothair  well i have a conviction that among the great races the old creeds will come back said mr phoebus and it will be acknowledged that true religion is the worship of the beautiful for the beautiful cannot be attained without virtue if virtue consists as i believe in the control of the passions in the sentiment of repose and the avoidance in all things of excess  one night lothair was walking home with the sisters from a village festival where they had been much amused  you have had a great many adventures since we first met said madame phoebus  which makes it seem longer ago than it really is said lothair  you count time by emotion then said euphrosyne  well it is a wonderful thing however it be computed said lothair  for my part i do not think that it ought to be counted at all said madame phoebus and there is nothing to me so detestable in europe as the quantity of clocks and watches  do you use a watch my lord asked euphrosyne in a tone which always seemed to lothair one of mocking artlessness  i believe i never wound it up when i had one said lothair  but you make such good use of your time said madame phoebus you do not require watches  i am glad to hear i make good use of my time said lothair but a little surprised  but you are so good so religious said madame phoebus that is a great thing especially for one so young  hem said lothair  that must have been a beautiful procession at rome said euphrosyne  i was rather a spectator of it than an actor in it said lothair with some seriousness it is too long a tale to enter into but my part in those proceedings was entirely misrepresented  i believe that nothing in the newspapers is ever true said madame phoebus  and that is why they are so popular added euphrosyne the taste of the age being so decidedly for fiction  is it true that you escaped from a convent to malta said madame phoebus  not quite said lothair but true enough for conversations  as confidential as the present i suppose said euphrosyne  yes when we are grave as we are inclined to be now said lothair  then you have been fighting a good deal said madame phoebus  you are putting me on a courtmartial madame phoebus said lothair  but we do not know on which side you were said euphrosyne  that is matter of history said lothair and that you know is always doubtful  well i do not like fighting said madame phoebus and for my part i never could find out that it did an good  and what do you like said lothair tell me how would you pass your life  well much as i do i do not know that i want any change except i think i should like it to be always summer  and i would have perpetual spring said euphrosyne  but summer or spring what would be your favorite pursuit  well dancing is very nice said madame phoebus  but we cannot always be dancing said lothair  then we would sing said euphrosyne  but the time comes when one can neither dance nor sing said lothair  oh then we become part of the audience said madame phoebus the people for whose amusement everybody labors  and enjoy power without responsibility said euphrosyne detect false notes and mark awkward gestures how can any one doubt of providence with such a system of constant compensation  there was something in the society of these two sisters that lothair began to find highly attractive their extraordinary beauty their genuine and unflagging gayety their thorough enjoyment of existence and the variety of resources with which they made life amusing and graceful all contributed to captivate him they had too a great love and knowledge both of art and nature and insensibly they weaned lothair from that habit of introspection which though natural to him he had too much indulged and taught him to find sources of interest and delight in external objects he was beginning to feel happy in this islands and wishing that his life might never change when one day mr phoebus informed them that the prince agathonides the eldest son of the prince of samos would arrive from constantinople in a few days and would pay them a visit he will come with some retinue said mr phoebus but i trust we shall be able by our reception to show that the cantacuzenes are not the only princely family in the world  mr phoebus was confident in his resources in this respect for his yachts crew in their venetian dresses could always furnish a guard of honor which no grecian prince or turkish pacha could easily rival when the eventful day arrived he was quite equal to the occasion the yacht was dressed in every part with the streaming colors of all nations the banner of gaston phoebus waved from his pavilion the guard of honor kept the ground but the population of the isle were present in numbers and in their most showy costume and a battery of ancient turkish guns fired a salute without an accident  the prince agathonides was a youth good looking and dressed in a splendid palikar costume though his manners were quite european being an attach to the turkish embassy at vienna he had with him a sort of governor a secretary servants in mamlouk dresses pipebearers and grooms there being some horses as presents from his father to mr phoebus and some rarelyembroidered kerchiefs and choice perfumes and persian greyhounds for the ladies  the arrival of the young prince was the signal for a series of entertainments on the island first of all mr phoebus resolved to give a dinner in the frank style to prove to agathonides that there were other members of the cantacuzene family besides himself who comprehended a firstrate frank dinner the chief people of the island were invited to this banquet they drank the choicest grapes of france and germany were stuffed with truffles and sat on little cane chairs but one might detect in their countenances how they sighed for their easy divans their simple dishes and their resinous wine then there was a wolfhunt and other sport a great day of gymnasia many dances and much music in fact there were choruses all over the island and every night was a serenade  why such general joy because it was understood that the heirapparent of the isle their future sovereign had in fact arrived to make his bow to the beautiful euphrosyne as though he saw her for the first time    chapter 74   very shortly after his arrival at malta mr phoebus had spoken to lothair about theodora it appeared that lucien campian though severely wounded had escaped with garibaldi after the battle of mentana into the italian territories here they were at once arrested but not severely detained and colonel campian took the first opportunity of revisiting england where after settling his affairs he had returned to his native country from which he had been separated for many years mr phoebus during the interval had seen a great deal of him and the colonel departed for america under the impression that lothair had been among the slain at the final struggle  campian is one of the beat men i over knew said phoebus he was a remarkable instance of energy combined with softness of disposition in my opinion however he ought never to have visited europe he was made to clear the backwoods and govern man by the power of his hatchet and the mildness of his words he was fighting for freedom all his life yet slavery made and slavery destroyed him among all the freaks of fate nothing is more surprising than that this transatlantic planter should have been ordained to be the husband of a divine beinga true hellenic goddess who in the good days would have been worshipped in this country and have inspired her race to actions of grace wisdom and beauty  i greatly esteem him said lothair and i shall write to him directly  except by campian who spoke probably about you to no one save myself continued phoebus your name has never been mentioned with reference to those strange transactions once there was a sort of rumor that you had met with some mishap but these things were contradicted and explained and then forgotten and people were all out of town i believe that cardinal grandison communicated with your man of business and between them every thing was kept quiet until this portentous account of your doings at rome which transpired after we left england and which met us at malta  i have written to my man of business about that said lothair but i think it will tax all his ingenuity to explain or to mystify it as successfully as he did the preceding adventures at any rate he will not have the assistance of my lord cardinal  theodora was a remarkable woman on many accounts said mr phoebus but particularly on this that although one of the most beautiful women that ever existed she was adored by beautiful women my wife adored her euphrosyne who has no enthusiasm adored her the princess of tivoli the most capricious being probably that ever existed adored and always adored theodora i think it must have been that there was on her part a total absence of vanity and this the more strange in one whose vocation in her earlier life had been to attract and live on popular applause but i have seen her quit theatres ringing with admiration and enter her carriage with the serenity of a phidian muse  i adored her said lothair but i never could quite solve her character perhaps it was too rich and deep far rapid comprehension  we shall never perhaps see her like again said mr phoebus it was a rare combination peculiar to the tyrrhenian sea i am satisfied that we must go there to find the pure hellenic blood and from thence it got to rome  we may not see her like again but we may see her again said lothair and sometimes i think she is always hovering over me  in this vein when they were alone they were frequently speaking of the departed and one dayit was before the arrival of prince agathonidesmr phoebus said to lothair we will ride this morning to what we call the grove of daphne it is a real laurelgrove some of the trees must be immemorial and deserve to have been sacred if once they were not so in their huge grotesque forms you would not easily recognize your polished friends of europe so trim and glossy and shrublike the people are very fond of this grove and make frequent processions there once a year they must be headed by their priest no one knows why nor has he the slightest idea of the reason of the various ceremonies which he that day performs but we know and some day he or his successors will equally understand them yes if i remain here long enoughand i sometimes think i will never again quit the islei shall expect some fine summer night when there is that rich stillness which the whispering waves only render more intense to hear a voice of music on the mountains declaring that the god pan has returned to earth  it was a picturesque ride as every ride was on this island skirting the sylvan hills with the sea glimmering in the distance lothair was pleased with the approaches to the sacred grove now and then a single tree with gray branches and a green head then a great spread of underwood all laurel and then spontaneous plantations of young trees  there was always a vacant space in the centre of the grove said mr phoebus once sadly overrun with wild shrubs but i have cleared it and restored the genius of the spot see  they entered the sacred circle and beheld a statue raised on a porphyry pedestal the light fell with magical effect on the face of the statue it was the statue of theodora the placing of which in the pavilion of belmont mr phoebus was superintending when lothair first made his acquaintance    chapter 75   the prince agathonides seemed quite to monopolize the attention of madame phoebus and her sister this was not very unreasonable considering that he was their visitor the future chief of their house and had brought them so many embroidered pockethandkerchiefs choice scents and fancy dogs but lothair thought it quite disgusting nor could he conceive what they saw in him what they were talking about or laughing about for so far as he had been able to form any opinion on the subject the prince was a shallowpated coxcomb without a single quality to charm any woman of sense and spirit lothair began to consider how he could pursue his travels where he should go to and when that was settled how he should get there  just at this moment of perplexity as is often the case something occurred which no one could foresee but which like every event removed some difficulties and introduced others  there arrived at the island a dispatch forwarded to mr phoebus by the russian ambassador at constantinople who had received it from his colleague at london this dispatch contained a proposition to mr phoebus to repair to the court of st petersburg and accept appointments of high distinction and emolument without in any way restricting the independent pursuit of his profession he was offered a large salary the post of court painter and the presidency of the academy of fine arts of such moment did the russian government deem the official presence of this illustrious artist in their country that it was intimated if the arrangement could be effected its conclusion might be celebrated by conferring on mr phoebus a patent of nobility and a decoration of a high class the dispatch contained a private letter from an exalted member of the imperial family who had had the high and gratifying distinction of making mr phoebuss acquaintance in london personally pressing the acceptance by him of the general proposition assuring him of cordial welcome and support and informing mr phoebus that what was particularly desired at this moment was a series of paintings illustrative of some of the most memorable scenes in the holy land and especially the arrival of the pilgrims of the greek rite at jerusalem as for this purpose he would probably like to visit palestine the whole of the autumn or even a longer period was placed at his disposal so that enriched with all necessary drawings and studies he might achieve his more elaborate performances in russia at his leisure and with every advantage  considering that the great objects in life with mr phoebus were to live in an aryan country amid an aryan race and produce works which should revive for the benefit of human nature aryan creeds a proposition to pass some of the prime years of his life among the mongolian race and at the same time devote his pencil to the celebration semitic subjects was startling  i shall say nothing to madame phoebus until the prince has gone he remarked to lothair he will go the day after tomorrow i do not know what they may offer to make meprobably only a baron perhaps a count but you know in russia a man may become a prince and i certainly should like those cantacuzenes to feel that after all their daughter is a princess with no thanks to them the climate is detestable but one owes much to ones profession art would be honored at a great perhaps the greatest court there would not be a fellow at his easel in the streets about fitzroy square who would not be prouder i wonder what the decoration will be of a high classvague it might be alexander newsky you know you have a right whatever your decoration to have it expressed of course at your own expense in brilliants i confess i have my weaknesses i should like to get over to the academy dinnerone can do any thing in these days of railroadsand dine with the r as in my ribbon and the star of the alexander newsky in brilliants i think every academician would feel elevated what i detest are their semitic subjectsnothing but drapery they cover even their heads in those scorching climes can any one make any thing of a caravan of pilgrims to be sure they say no one can draw a camel if i went to jerusalem a camel would at last be drawn there is something in that we must think over these things and when the prince has gone talk it over with madame phoebus i wish you all to come to a wise decision without the slightest reference to my individual tastes or it may be prejudices  the result of all this was that mr phoebus without absolutely committing himself favorably entertained the general proposition of the russian court while with respect to their particular object in art he agreed to visit palestine and execute at least one work for his imperial friend and patron he counted on reaching jerusalem before the easter pilgrims returned to their homes  if they would make me a prince at once and give me the alexander newsky in brilliants it might be worth thinking of he said to lothair  the ladies though they loved their isle were quite delighted with the thought of going to jerusalem madame phoebus knew a russian grandduchess who had boasted to her that she had been both to jerusalem and torquay and madame phoebus had felt quite ashamed that she had been to neither  i suppose you will feel quite at home there said euphrosyne to lothair  no i never was there  no but you know all about those places and peopleholy places and holy persons the blessed virgin did not i believe appear to you it was to a young lady was it not we were asking each other last night who the young lady could be    chapter 76   time which changes every thing is changing even the traditionary appearance of forlorn jerusalem not that its mien after all was ever very sad its airy site its splendid mosque its vast monasteries the bright material of which the whole city is built its cupolaed houses of freestone and above all the towers and gates and battlements of its lofty and complete walls always rendered it a handsome city jerusalem has not been sacked so often or so recently as the other two great ancient cities rome and athens its vicinage was never more desolate than the campagna or the state of attica and the morea in 1830  the battlefield of western asia from the days of the assyrian kings to those of mehemet ali palestine endured the same devastation as in modern times has been the doom of flanders and the milanese but the years of havoc in the low countries and lombardy must be counted in palestine by centuries yet the wide plains of the holy land sharon and shechem and esdraelon have recovered they are as fertile and as fair as in old days it is the hillculture that has been destroyed and that is the culture on which jerusalem mainly depended its hills were terraced gardens vineyards and groves of olivetrees and here it is that we find renovation the terraces are again ascending the stony heights and the eye is frequently gladdened with young plantations fruittrees the peach and the pomegranate the almond and the fig offer gracious groups and the true children of the land the vine and the olive are again exulting in their native soil  there is one spot however which has been neglected and yet the one that should have been the first remembered as it has been the most rudely wasted blessed be the hand which plants trees upon olivet blessed be the hand that builds gardens about sion  the most remarkable creation however in modern jerusalem is the russian settlement which within a few years has risen on the elevated ground on the western side of the city the latin the greek and the armenian churches had for centuries possessed enclosed establishments in the city which under the name of monasteries provided shelter and protection for hundredsit might be said even thousandsof pilgrims belonging to their respective rites the great scale therefore on which russia secured hospitality for her subjects was not in reality so remarkable as the fact that it seemed to indicate a settled determination to separate the muscovite church altogether from the greek and throw off what little dependence is still acknowledged on the patriarchate of constantinople whatever the motive the design has been accomplished on a large scale the russian buildings all well defended are a caravanserai a cathedral a citadel the consular flag crowns the height and indicates the office of administration priests and monks are permanent inhabitants and a whole caravan of muscovite pilgrim and the trades on which they depend can be accommodated within the precinct  mr phoebus his family and suite were to be the guests of the russian consul and every preparation was made to insure the celebrated painter a becoming reception frequent telegrams had duly impressed the representative of all the russias in the holy land with the importance of his impending visitor even the qualified and strictly provisional acceptance of the russian proposition by mr phoebus had agitated the wires of europe scarcely less than a suggested conference  an artist should always remember what he owes to posterity and his profession said mr phoebus to lothair as they were walking the deck even if you can distinguish between them which i doubt for it is only by a sense of the beautiful that the human family can be sustained in its proper place in the scale of creation and the sense of the beautiful is a result of the study of the fine arts it would be something to sow the seeds of organic change in the mongolian type but i am nor sanguine of success there is no original fund of aptitude to act upon the most ancient of existing communities is turanian and yet though they could invent gunpowder and the mariners compass they never could understand perspectiveman ahead there tell madame phoebus to come on deck for the first sight of mount lebanon  when the pan entered the port of joppa they observed another english yacht in those waters but before they could speculate on its owner they were involved in all the complications of landing on the quay the russian viceconsul was in attendance with horses and mules and donkeys handsomer than either the ladies were delighted with the vast orangegardens of joppa which madame phoebus said realized quite her idea of the holy land  i was prepared for milk and honey said euphrosyne but this is too delightful as she travelled through lanes of datebearing palmtrees and sniffed with her almondshaped nostrils the allpervading fragrance  they passed the night at arimathea a pretty village surrounded with gardens enclosed with hedges of prickly pear here they found hospitality in an old convent but all the comforts of europe and many of the refinements of asia had been forwarded for their accommodations  it is a great homage to art said mr phoebus as he scattered his gold like a great seigneur of gascony  the next day two miles from jerusalem the consul met them with a cavalcade and the ladies assured their host that they were not at all wearied with their journey but were quite prepared in due time to join his dinnerparty which he was most anxious they should attend as he had two english lords who had arrived and whom he had invited to meet them they were all curious to know their names though that unfortunately the consul could not tell them but he had sent to the english consulate to have them written down all he could assure them was that they were real english lords not travelling english lords but in sober earnestness great personages  mr phoebus was highly gratified he was pleased with his reception there was nothing he liked much more than a procession he was also a sincere admirer of the aristocracy of his country on the whole he would say they most resemble the old hellenic race excelling in athletic sports speaking no other language than their own and never reading  your fault he would sometimes say to lothair and the cause of many of your sorrows is the habit of mental introspection man is born to observe but if he falls into psychology he observes nothing and then he is astonished that life has no charms for him or that never seizing the occasion his career is a failure no sir it is the eye that must be occupied and cultivated no one knows the capacity of the eye who has not developed it or the visions of beauty and delight and inexhaustible interest which it commands to a man who observes life is as different as the existence of a dreaming psychologist is to that of the animals of the field  i fear said lothair that i have at length found out the truth and that i am a dreaming psychologist  you are young and not irremediably lost said mr phoebus fortunately you have received the admirable though partial education of your class you are a good shot you can ride you can row you can swim that imperfect secretion of the brain which is called thought has not yet bowed your frame you have not had time to read much give it up altogether the conversation of a woman like theodora is worth all the libraries in the world if it were only for her sake i should wish to save you but i wish to do it for your own yes profit by the vast though calamitous experience which you have gained in a short time we may know a great deal about our bodies we can know very little about our minds  the real english lords turned out to be bertram and st aldegonde returning from nubia they had left england about the same time as lothair and had paired together on the irish church till easter with a sort of secret hope on the part of st aldegonde that they might neither of them reappear in the house of commons again until the irish church were either saved or subverted holy week had long passed and they were at jerusalem not quite so near the house of commons as the reform club or the carlton but still st aldegonde had mentioned that he was beginning to be bored with jerusalem and bertram counted on their immediate departure when they accepted the invitation to dine with the russian consul  lothair was unaffectedly delighted to meet bertram and glad to see st aldegonde but he was a little nervous and embarrassed as to the probable tone of his reception by them but their manner relieved him in an instant for he saw they knew nothing of his adventures  well said st aldegonde what have you been doing with yourself since we last met i wish you had come with us and had a shot at a crocodile  bertram told lothair in the course of the evening that he found letters at cairo from corisande on his return in which there was a good deal about lothair and which had made him rather uneasy that there was a rumor you had been badly wounded and some other things and bertram looked him full in the face but i dare say not a word of truth  i was never better in my life said lothair and i have been in sicily and in greece however we will talk over all this another time  the dinner at the consulate was one of the most successful banquets that was ever given if to please your guests be the test of good fortune in such enterprises st aldegonde was perfectly charmed with the phoebus family he did not know which to admire mostthe great artist who was in remarkable spirits today considering he was in a semitic country or his radiant wife or his brilliant sisterinlaw st aldegonde took an early opportunity of informing bertram that if he liked to go over and vote for the irish church he would release him from his pair with the greatest pleasure but for his part he had not the slightest intention of leaving jerusalem at present strange to say bertram received this intimation without a murmur he was not so loud in his admiration of the phoebus family as st aldegonde but there is a silent sentiment sometimes more expressive than the noisiest applause and more dangerous bertram had sat next to euphrosyne and was entirely spellbound  the consuls wife a hostess not unworthy of such guests had entertained her friends in the european style the dinnerhour was not late and the gentlemen who attended the ladies from the dinnertable were allowed to remain some time in the saloon lothair talked much to the consuls wife by whose side sat madame phoebus st aldegonde was always on his legs distracted by the rival attractions of that lady and her husband more remote bertram whispered to euphrosyne who answered him with laughing eyes  at a certain hour the consul attended by his male guests crossing a court proceeded to his divan a lofty and capacious chamber painted in fresco and with no furniture except the low but broad raised seat that surrounded the room here when they were seated an equal number of attendantsarabs in arab dress blue gowns and red slippers and red capsentered each proffering a long pipe of cherry or jasmine wood then in a short time guests dropped in and pipes and coffee were immediately brought to them any person who had been formally presented to the consul had this privilege without any further invitation the society often found in these consular divans in the more remote places of the eastcairo damascus jerusalemis often extremely entertaining and instructive celebrated travellers distinguished men of science artists adventurers who ultimately turn out to be heroes eccentric characters of all kinds are here encountered and give the fruits of their original or experienced observation without reserve  it is the smokingroom over again whispered st aldegonde to lothair only in england one is so glad to get away from the women but here i must say i should have liked to remain behind  an individual in a syrian dress fawncolored robes girdled with a rich shawl and a white turban entered he made his salute with grace and dignity to the consul touching his forehead his lip and his heart and took his seat with the air of one not unaccustomed to be received playing until he received his chibouque with a chaplet of beads  that is a goodlooking fellow lothair said st aldegonde or is it the dress that turns them out such swells i feel quite a lout by some of these fellows  i think he would be goodlooking in any dress said lothair a remarkable countenance  it was an oval visage with features in harmony with that form large darkbrown eyes and lashes and brows delicately but completely defined no hair upon the face except a beard full but not long he seemed about the same age as mr phoebus and his complexion though pale was clear and fair  the conversation after some rambling had got upon the suez canal mr phoebus did not care for the political or the commercial consequences of that great enterprise but he was glad that a natural division should be established between the greater races and the ethiopian it might not lead to any considerable result but it asserted a principle he looked upon that trench as a protest  but would you place the nilotic family in the ethiopian race inquired the syrian in a voice commanding from its deep sweetness  i would certainly the were cushim and that means negroes  the syrian did not agree with mr phoebus he stated his views firmly and clearly but without urging them he thought that we must look to the pelasgi as the colonizing race that had peopled and produced egypt the mention of the pelasgi fired mr phoebus to even unusual eloquence he denounced the pelasgi as a barbarous race men of gloomy superstitions who had it not been for the hellenes might have fatally arrested the human development the triumph of the hellenes was the triumph of the beautiful and all that is great and good in life was owing to their victory  it is difficult to ascertain what is great in life said the syrian because nations differ on the subject and ages some for example consider war to be a great thing others condemn it i remember also when patriotism was a boast and now it is a controversy but it is not so difficult to ascertain what is good for man has in his own being some guide to such knowledge and divine aid to acquire it has not been wanting to him for my part i could not maintain that the hellenic system led to virtue  the conversation was assuming an ardent character when the consul as a diplomatist turned the channel mr phoebus had vindicated the hellenic religion the syrian with a terse protest against the religion of nature however idealized as tending to the corruption of man had let the question die away and the divan were discussing dromedaries and dancinggirls and sherbet made of pomegranate which the consul recommended and ordered to be produced some of the guests retired and among them the syrian with the same salute and the same graceful dignity as had distinguished his entrance  who is that man said mr phoebus i met him at rome ten years ago baron mecklenburg brought him to me to paint for my great picture of st john which is in the gallery of munich he said in his wayyou remember his waythat he would bring me a face of paradise  i cannot exactly tell you his name said the consul prince galitzin brought him here and thought highly of him i believe he is one of the old syrian families in the mountain but whether he be a maronite or a druse or any thing else i really cannot say now try the sherbet    chapter 77   there are few things finer than the morning view of jerusalem from the mount of olives the fresh and golden light falls on a walled city with turrets and towers and frequent gates the houses of freestone with terraced or oval roofs sparkle in the sun while the cupolaed pile of the church of the holy sepulchre the vast monasteries and the broad steep of sion crowned with the tower of david vary the monotony of the general masses of building but the glory of the scene is the mosque of omar as it rises on its broad platform of marble from the deep ravine of kedron with its magnificent dome high in the air its arches and gardened courts and its ornaments glittering amid the cedar the cypress and the palm  reclining on olivet lothair alone and in charmed abstraction gazed on the wondrous scene since his arrival at jerusalem he lived much apart nor had he found difficulty in effecting this isolation mr phoebus had already established a studio on a considerable scale and was engaged in making sketches of pilgrims and monks tall donkeys of bethlehem with starry fronts in which he much delighted and grave jellaheen sheiks who were hanging about the convents in the hopes of obtaining a convoy to the dead sea as for st aldegonde and bertram they passed their lives at the russian consulate or with its most charming inhabitants this morning with the consul and his wife and the matchless sisters as st aldegonde always termed them they had gone on an excursion to the convent of the nativity dinner usually reassembled all the party and then the divan followed  i say bertram said st aldegonde what a lucky thing we paired and went to nubia i rejoice in the divan and yet somehow i cannot bear leaving those women if the matchless sisters would only smoke by jove they would be perfect  i should not like euphrosyne to smoke said bertram  a person approached lothair by the pathway from bethany it was the syrian gentleman whom he had met at the consulate as he was passing lothair he saluted him with the grace which had been before remarked and lothair who was by nature courteous and even inclined a little to ceremony in his manners especially with those with whom he was not intimate immediately rose as he would not receive such a deputation in a reclining posture  let me not disturb you said the stranger or if we must be on equal terms let me also be seated for this is a view that never palls  it is perhaps familiar to you said lothair but with me only a pilgrim its effect is fascinating almost overwhelming  the view of jerusalem never becomes familiar said the syrian for its associations are so transcendent so various so inexhaustible that the mind can never anticipate its course of thought and feeling when one sits as we do now on this immortal mount  i presume you live here said lothair  not exactly said his companion i have recently built a house without the walls and i have planted my hill with fruittrees and made vineyards and olivegrounds but i have done this as muchperhaps moreto set an example which i am glad to say has been followed as for my own convenience or pleasure my home is in the north of palestine on the other side of jordan beyond the sea of galilee my family has dwelt there from time immemorial but they always loved this city and have a legend that they dwelt occasionally within its walls even in the days when titus from that hill looked down upon the temple  i have often wished to visit the sea of galilee said lothair  well you have now an opportunity said the syrian the north of palestine though it has no topical splendor has much variety and a peculiar natural charm the burst and brightness of spring have not yet quite vanished you would find our plains radiant with wildflowers and our hills green with young crops and though we cannot rival lebanon we have forest glades among our famous hills that when once seen are remembered  but there is something to me more interesting than the splendor of tropical scenery said lothair even if galilee could offer it i wish to visit the cradle of my faith  and you would do wisely said the syrian for there is no doubt the spiritual nature of man is developed in this land  and yet there are persons at the present day who doubteven denythe spiritual nature of man said lothair i do not i could notthere are reasons why i could not  there are some things i know and some things i believe said the syrian i know that i have a soul and i believe that it is immortal  it is science that by demonstrating the insignificance of this globe in the vast scale of creation has led to this infidelity said lothair  science may prove the insignificance of this globe in the scale of creation said the stranger but it cannot prove the insignificance of man what is the earth compared with the sun a molehill by a mountain yet the inhabitants of this earth can discover the elements of which the great orb consists and will probably ere long ascertain all the conditions of its being nay the human mind can penetrate far beyond the sun there is no relation therefore between the faculties of man and the scale in creation of the planet which he inhabits  i was glad to hear you assert the other night the spiritual nature of man in opposition to mr phoebus  ah mr phoebus said the stranger with a smile he is an old acquaintance of mine and i must say he is very consistentexcept in paying a visit to jerusalem that does surprise me he said to me the other night the same things as he said to me at rome many years ago he would revive the worship of nature the deities whom he so eloquently describes and so exquisitely delineates are the ideal personifications of the most eminent human qualities and chiefly the physical physical beauty is his standard of excellence and he has a fanciful theory that moral order would be the consequence of the worship of physical beauty for without moral order he holds physical beauty cannot be maintained but the answer to mr phoebus is that his system has been tried and has failed and under conditions more favorable than are likely to exist again the worship of nature ended in the degradation of the human race  but mr phoebus cannot really believe in apollo and venus said lothair these are phrases he is i suppose what is called a pantheist  no doubt the olympus of mr phoebus is the creation of his easel replied the syrian i should not however describe him as a pantheist whose creed requires more abstraction than mr phoebus the worshipper of nature would tolerate his school never care to pursue any investigation which cannot be followed by the eyeand the worship of the beautiful always ends in an orgy as for pantheism it is atheism in domino the belief in a creator who is unconscious of creating is more monstrous than any dogma of any of the churches in this city and we have them all here  but there are people now who tell you that there never was any creation and therefore there never could have been a creator said lothair  and which is now advanced with the confidences of novelty said the syrian though all of it has been urged and vainly urged thousands of years ago there must be design or all we see would be without sense and i do not believe in the unmeaning as for the natural forces to which all creation is now attributed we know they are unconscious while consciousness is as inevitable a portion of our existence as the eye or the hand the conscious cannot be derived from the unconscious man is divine  i wish i could assure myself of the personality of the creator said lothair i cling to that but they say it is unphilosophical  in what sense asked the syrian is it more unphilosophical to believe in a personal god omnipotent and omniscient than in natural forces unconscious and irresistible is it unphilosophical to combine power with intelligence goethe a spinozist who did not believe in spinoza said that he could bring his mind to the conception that in the centre of space we might meet with a monad of pure intelligence what may be the centre of space i leave to the daedal imagination of the author of faust but a monad of pure intelligenceis that more philosophical than the truth first revealed to man amid these everlasting hills said the syrian that god made man in his own image  i have often found in that assurance a source of sublime consolation said lothair  it is the charter of the nobility of man said the syrian one of the divine dogmas revealed in this land not the invention of councils not one of which was held on this sacred soil confused assemblies first got together by the greeks and then by barbarous nations in barbarous times  yet the divine land no longer tells us divine things said lothair  it may or it may not have fulfilled its destiny said the syrian in my fathers house are many mansions and by the various families of nations the designs of the creator are accomplished god works by races and one was appointed in due season and after many developments to reveal and expound in this land the spiritual nature of man the aryan and the semite are of the same blood and origin but when they quitted their central land they were ordained to follow opposite courses each division of the great race has developed one portion of the double nature of humanity till after all their wanderings they met again and represented by their two choicest families the hellenes and the hebrews brought together the treasures of their accumulated wisdom and secured the civilization of man  those among whom i have lived of late said lothair have taught me to trust much in councils and to believe that without them there could be no foundation for the church i observe you do not speak in that vein though like myself you find solace in those dogmas which recognize the relations between the created and the creator  there can be no religion without that recognition said the syrian and no creed can possibly be devised without such a recognition that would satisfy man why we are here whence we come whither we gothese are questions which man is organically framed and forced to ask himself and that would not be the case if they could not be answered as for churches depending on councils the first council was held more than three centuries after the sermon on the mount we syrians had churches in the interval no one can deny that i bow before the divine decree that swept them away from antioch to jerusalem but i am not yet prepared to transfer my spiritual allegiance to italian popes and greek patriarchs we believe that our family were among the first followers of jesus and that we then held lands in bashan which we hold now we had a gospel once in our district where there was some allusion to this and being written by neighbors and probably at the time i dare say it was accurate but the western churches declared our gospel was not authentic though why i cannot tell and they succeeded in extirpating it it was not an additional reason why we should enter into their fold so i am content to dwell in galilee and trace the footsteps of my divine master musing over his life and pregnant sayings amid the mounts he sanctified and the waters he loved so well  the sun was now rising in the heavens and the hour had arrived when it became expedient to seek the shade lothair and the syrian rose at the same time  i shall not easily forget our conversation on the mount of olives said lothair and i would ask you to add to this kindness by permitting me before i leave jerusalem to pay my respects to you under your roof  peace be with you said the syrian i live without the gate of damascus on a hill which you will easily recognize and my name is paraclete    chapter 78   time passed very agreeably to st aldegonde and bertram at jerusalem for it was passed entirely at the russian consulate or with its interesting and charming inmates who were always making excursions or as they styled them pilgrimages they saw little of lothair who would willingly have conversed with his friend on many topics but his friend was almost always engaged and if by some chance they succeeded in finding themselves alone bertram appeared to be always preoccupied one day he said to lothair i tell you what old fellow if you want to know all about what has happened at home i will give you corisandes letters they are a sort of journal which she promised to keep for me and they will tell you every thing i found an immense packet of them on our return from cairo and i meant to have read them here but i do not know how it isi suppose there is so much to be seen herebut i never seem to have a moment to myself i have got an engagement now to the consulate we are going to elishas fountain today why do not you come  well i am engaged too said lothair i have settled to go to the tombs of the kings today with signor paraclete and i cannot well get off but remember the letters  the box of letters arrived at lothairs rooms in due season and their perusal deeply interested him in their pages alike earnest and lively and a picture of a mind of high intelligence adorned with fancy and feeling the name of lothair frequently appeared and sometimes accompanied with expressions that made his heart beat all the rumors of his adventures as they gradually arrived in england generally distorted were duly chronicled and sometimes with comments which intimated the interest they occasioned to the correspondent of bertram more than once she could not refrain from reproaching her brother for having left his friend so much to himself of all your friends she said the one who always most interested me and seemed most worthy of your affection and then she deplored the absolute ruin of lothair for such she deemed his entrance into the roman church  i was right in my appreciation of that woman though i was utterly inexperienced in life thought lothair if her mother had only favored my views two years ago affairs would have been different would they have been better can they be worse but i have gained experience certainly and paid for it with my hearts blood and might i not have gained experience tranquilly in the discharge of the duties of my position at homedear home perhaps not and suppose i never had gained experience i still might have been happy and what am i now most lone and sad so lone and sad that nothing but the magical influence of the scene around me saves me from an overwhelming despondency  lothair passed his life chiefly with paraclete and a few weeks after their first acquaintance they left jerusalem together for galilee  the month of may had disappeared and june was advancing bertram and saint aldegonde no longer talked about their pair and their engagements in the house of commons there seemed a tacit understanding between them to avoid the subject remarkable on the part of bertram for he had always been urgent on his brotherinlaw to fulfil their parliamentary obligation  the party at the russian consulate had gone on a grand expedition to the dead sea and had been absent for many days from jerusalem they were conveyed by one of the sheiks of the jordan valley it was a most successful expeditionconstant adventure novel objects and habits all the spell of a romantic life the ladies were delighted with the scenery of the jordan valley and the gentlemen had good sport st aldegonde had killed a wildboar and bertram an ibex whose horns were preserved for brentham mr phoebus intensely studied the camel and its habits he persuaded himself that the ship of the desert entirely understood him but it is always so he added there is no animal that in a week does not perfectly comprehend me had i time and could give myself up to it i have no doubt i could make them speak nature has endowed me so far as dumb animals are concerned with a peculiar mesmeric power  at last this happy caravan was again within sight of the walls of jerusalem  i should like to have remained in the valley of the jordan forever said st aldegonde  and so should i whispered bertram to euphrosyne with the same companions  when they had returned to the consulate they found the post from england had arrived during their absence there were dispatches for all it is an agitating momentthat arrival of letters in a distant land lord st aldegonde seemed much disturbed when he tore open and perused his his countenance became clouded he dashed his hand through his dishevelled locks he pouted and then he said to bertram come to my room  anything wrong at home  not at home said st aldegonde bertha is all right but a most infernal letter from glynmost insolent if i do return i will vote against them but i will not return i have made up my mind to that people are so selfish exclaimed st aldegonde with indignation they never think of any thing but themselves  show me his letter said bertram i have got a letter too it is from the duke  the letter of the opposition whip did not deserve the epithets ascribed to it by st aldegonde it was urgent and courteously peremptory but considering the circumstances of the case by no means too absolute paired to easter by great indulgence st aldegonde was passing whitsuntide at jerusalem the parliamentary position was critical and the future of the opposition seemed to depend on the majority by which their resolutions on the irish church were sent up to the house of lords  well said bertram i see nothing to complain of in that letter except a little more urgency it is almost the same language as reached us at cairo and then you said glyn was a capital fellow and seemed quite pleased  yes because i hated egypt said st aldegonde i hated the pyramids and i was disappointed with the dancinggirls and it seemed to me that if it had not been for the whip we never should have been able to escape but things are very different now  yes they are said bertram in a melancholy tone  you do not think of returning said st aldegonde  instantly replied bertram i have a letter from the duke which is peremptory the county is dissatisfied with my absence and mine is a queer constituency very numerous and several large towns the popularity of my family gained me the seat not their absolute influence  my constituents never trouble me said st aldegonde  you have none said bertram  well if i were member for a metropolitan district i would hot budge and i little thought you would have deserted me  ah sighed bertram youre discontented because your amusements are interrupted but think of my position torn from a woman whom i adore  well you know you must have left her sooner or later urged st aldegonde  why asked bertram  you know what lothair told us she is engaged to her cousin the prince of samos and  if i had only the prince of samos to deal with i should care little said bertram  why what do you mean  that euphrosyne is mine if my family will sanction our union but not otherwise  st aldegonde gave a long whistle and he added i wish bertha were here she is the only person i know who has a head  you see my dear granville while you are talking of your little disappointments i am involved in awful difficulties  you are sure about the palace of samos  clear your head of that there is no engagement of any kind between him and euphrosyne the visit to the island was only a preliminary ceremonyjust to show himself no doubt the father wishes the alliance nor is there any reason to suppose that it would be disagreeable to the son but i repeat itno engagement exists  if i were not your brotherinlaw i should have been very glad to have married euphrosyne myself said st aldegonde  yes but what am i to do asked bertram rather impatiently  it will not do to write to brentham said st aldegonde gravely that i see clearly then after musing a while he added i am vexed to leave our friends here and shall miss them sadly they are the most agreeable people i ever knew i never enjoyed myself so much but we must think of nothing but your affairs we must return instantly the whip will be an excuse but the real business will be euphrosyne i should delight in having her for a sisterinlaw but the affair will require management we can make short work of getting home steam to marseilles leave the yacht there and take the railroad i have half a mind to telegraph to bertha to meet us there she would be of great use    chapter 79   lothair was delighted with galilee and particularly with the blue waters of its lake slumbering beneath the surrounding hills of all its once pleasant towns tiberias alone remains and that in ruins from a recent earthquake but where are chorazin and bethsaida and capernaum a group of hovels and an ancient tower still bear the magic name of magdala and all around are green mounts and gentle slopes the scenes of miracles that softened the heart of man and of sermons that never tire his ear dreams passed over lothair of settling forever on the shores of these waters and of reproducing all their vanished happiness rebuilding their memorable cities reviving their fisheries cultivating the plain of gennesaret and the country of the gadarenes and making researches in this cradle of pure and primitive christianity  the heritage of paraclete was among the oaks of bashan a lofty land rising suddenly from the jordan valley verdant and well watered and clothed in many parts with forest there the host of lothair resided among his lands and people and himself dwelt in a stone and castellated building a portion of which was of immemorial antiquity and where he could rally his forces and defend himself in case of the irruption and invasion of the desert tribes and here one morn arrived a messenger from jerusalem summoning lothair back to that city in consequence of the intended departure of his friends  the call was urgent and was obeyed immediately with that promptitude which the manners of the east requiring no preparation admit paraclete accompanied his guest they had to cross the jordan and then to trace their way till they reached the southern limit of the plain of esdraelon from whence they counted on the following day to reach jerusalem while they were encamped on this spot a body of turkish soldiery seized all their horses which were required they said by the pacha of damascus who was proceeding to jerusalem attending a great turkish general who was on a mission to examine the means of defence of palestine on the egyptian side this was very vexatious but one of those incidents of eastern life against which it is impossible to contend so lothair and paraclete were obliged to take refuge in their pipes beneath a huge and solitary sycamoretree awaiting the arrival of the ottoman magnificoes  they came at last a considerable force of cavalry then mules and barbarous carriages with the harem all the riders and inmates enveloped in what appeared to be windingsheets white and shapeless about them eunuchs and servants the staff of the pachas followed preceding the grandees who closed the march mounted on anatolian chargers  paraclete and lothair had been obliged to leave the grateful shade of the sycamoretree as the spot had been fixed on by the commander of the advanced guard for the restingplace of the pachas they were standing aside and watching the progress of the procession and contemplating the earliest opportunity of representing their grievances to high authority when the turkish general or the seraskier as the syrians inaccurately styled him suddenly reined in his steed and said in a loud voice captain muriel  lothair recognized the wellknown voice of his commanding officer in the apennine and advanced to him with a military salute i must first congratulate you on being alive which i hardly hoped said the general then let me know why you are here  and lothair told him  well you shall have back your horses said the general and i will escort you to el khuds in the mean time you must be our guest and he presented him to the pacha of damascus with some form you and i have bivouacked in the open air before this and not in so bland a clime  beneath the shade of the patriarchal sycamore the general narrated to lothair his adventures since they were fellowcombatants on the fatal field of mentana  when all was over continued the general i fled with garibaldi and gained the italian frontier at terrni here we were of course arrested by the authorities but not very maliciously i escaped one morning and got among the mountains in the neighborhood of our old camp i had to wander about these parts for some time for the papalini were in the vicinity and there was danger it was a hard time but i found a friend now and then among the country people though they are dreadfully superstitious at last i got to the shore and induced an honest fellow to put to sea in an open boat on the chance of something turning up it did in the shape of a brigantine from elba bound for corfu here i was sure to find friends for the brotherhood are strong in the ionian isles and i began to look about for business the greeks made me some offers but their schemes were all vanity worse than the irish you remember our fenian squabble from something that transpired i had made up my mind so soon as i was well equipped to go to turkey i had had some transactions with the house of cantacuzene through the kindness of our dear friend whom we will never forget but will never mention and through them i became acquainted with the prince of samos who is the chief of their house he is in the entire confidence of aali pacha i soon found out that there was real business on the carpet the ottoman army after many trials and vicissitudes is now in good case and the porte has resolved to stand no more nonsense either in this direction and the general gave a significant glanceor in any other but they wanted a general they wanted a man who knew his business i am not a garibaldi you know and never pretended to be i have no genius or volcanic fire or that sort of thing but i do presume to say with fair troops paid with tolerable regularity a battery or two of rifled cannon and a wellorganized commissariat i am not afraid of meeting any captain of my acquaintance whatever his land or language the turks are a brave people and there is nothing in their system political or religious which jars with my convictions in the army which is all that i much care for there is the career of merit and i can promote any able man that i recognize as for their religion they are tolerant and exact nothing from me and if i had any religion except madre natura i am not sure i would not prefer islamism which is at least simple and as little sacerdotal as any organized creed can be the porte made me a liberal offer and i accepted it it so happened that the moment i entered their service i was wanted they had a difficulty on their dalmatian frontier i settled it in a way they liked and now i am sent here with full powers and am a pacha of the highest class and with a prospect of some warm work i do not know what your views are but if you would like a little more soldiering i will put you on my staff and for aught i know we may find your winterquarters at grand cairothey say a pleasant place for such a season  my soldiering has not been very fortunate said lothair and i am not quite as great an admirer of the turks as you are general my mind is rather on the pursuits of peace and twenty hours ago i had a dream of settling on the shores of the sea of galilee  whatever you do said the general give up dreams  i think you may be right in that said lothair with half a sigh  action may not always be happiness said the general but there is no happiness without action if you will not fight the egyptians were i you i would return home and plunge into affairs that was a fine castle of yours i visited one morning a man who lives in such a place must be able to find a great deal to do  i almost wish i were there with you for my companion said lothair  the wheel may turn said the general but i begin to think i shall not see much of europe again i have given it some of my best years and best blood and if i had assisted in establishing the roman republic i should not have lived in vain but the old imposture seems to me stronger than ever i have got ten good years in me yet and if i be well supported and in luck for after all every thing depends on fortune and manage to put a couple of hundred thousand men in perfect discipline i may find some consolation for not blowing up st peters and may do something for the freedom of mankind on the banks of the danube    chapter 80   mrs putney giles in full toilet was standing before the mantelpiece of her drawingroom in hyde park gardens and watching with some anxiety the clock that rested on it it was the dinnerhour and mr putney giles particular in such matters had not returned no one looked forward to his dinner and a chat with his wife with greater zest than mr putney giles and he deserved the gratification which both incidents afforded him for he fairly earned it full of news and bustle brimful of importance and prosperity sunshiny and successful his daily return homewhich with many perhaps most men is a process lugubriously monotonouswas in hyde park gardens even to apollonia who possessed many means of amusement and occupation a source ever of interest and excitement  today too particularly for their great client friend and patron lothair had arrived last night from the continent at muriel house and had directed mr putney giles to be in attendance on him on the afternoon of this day  muriel house was a family mansion in the green park it was built of hewn stone during the last centurya palladian edifice for a time much neglected but now restored and duly prepared for the reception of its lord and master by the same combined energy and taste which had proved so satisfactory and successful at muriel towers  it was a long room the front saloon at hyde park gardens and the door was as remote as possible from the mantelpiece it opened suddenly but only the panting face of mr putney giles was seen as he poured forth in hurried words my dear dreadfully late but i can dress in five minutes i only opened the door in passing to tell you that i have seen our great friend wonderful man but i will tell you all at dinner or after it was not he who kept me but the duke of brecon the duke has been with me two hours i had a good mind to bring him home to dinner and give him a bottle of my 48 they like that sort of thing but it will keep and the head vanished  the duke of brecon would not have dined ill had he honored this household it is a pleasant thing to see an opulent and prosperous man of business sanguine and full of health and a little overworked at that royal meal dinner how he enjoys his soup and how curious in his fish how critical in his entr e and how nice in his welsh mutton his exhausted brain rallies under the glass of dry sherry and he realizes all his dreams with the aid of claret that has the true flavor of the violet  and now my dear apollonia said mr putney giles when the servants had retired and he turned his chair and played with a new nut from the brazils about our great friend well i was there at two oclock and found him at breakfast indeed he said that had he not given me an appointment he thought he should not have risen at all so delighted he was to find himself again in an english bed well he told me every thing that had happened i never knew a man so unreserved and so different from what he was when i first knew him for he never much cared then to talk about himself but no egotism nothing of that sort of thingall his mistakes all his blunders as he called them he told me every thing that i might thoroughly understand his position and that he might judge whether the steps i had taken in reference to it were adequate  i suppose about his religion said apollonia what is he after all  as sound as you are but you are right that was the point on which he was most anxious he wrote you know to me from malta when the account of his conversion first appeared to take all necessary steps to contradict the announcement and counteract its consequences he gave me carte blanche and was anxious to know precisely what i had done i told him that a mere contradiction anonymous or from a third person however unqualified its language would have no effect in the face of a detailed narrative like that in all the papers of his walking in procession and holding a lighted taper and all that sort of thing what i did was this i commenced building by his direction two new churches on his estate and announced in the local journals copied in london that he would be present at the consecration of both i subscribed in his name and largely to all the diocesan societies gave a thousand pounds to the bishop of londons fund and accepted for him the office of steward for this year for the sons of the clergy then when the public feeling was ripe relieved from all its anxieties and beginning to get indignant at the calumnies that had been so freely circulated the time for paragraphs had arrived and one appeared stating that a discovery had taken place of the means by which an unfounded and preposterous account of the conversion of a distinguished young english nobleman at rome had been invented and circulated and would probably furnish the occasion for an action for libel and now his return and appearance at the chapel royal next sunday will clinch the whole business  and he was satisfied  most satisfied a little anxious whether his personal friends and particularly the brentham family were assured of the truth he travelled home with the dukes son and lord st aldegonde but they came from remote parts and their news from home was not very recent  and how does he look  very well never saw him look better he is handsomer than he was but he is changed i could not conceive in a year that any one could be so changed he was young for his years he is now old for his years he was in fact a boy he is now a man and yet it is only a year he said it seemed to him ten  he has been through a fiery furnace said apollonia  well he has borne it well said mr giles it is worth while serving such a client so cordial so frank and yet so full of thought he say he does not in the least regret all the money he has wasted had he remained at home it would have gone to building a cathedral  and a popish one said apollonia i cannot agree with him she continued that his italian campaign was a waste of money it will bear fruit we shall still see the end of the abomination of desolation  very likely said mr giles but i trust my client will have no more to do with such questions either way  and did he ask after his friends said apollonia  very much he asked after you i think he went through all the guests at muriel towers except the poor campians he spoke to me about the colonel to whom it appears he has written but theodora he never mentioned except by some periphrasis some allusion to a great sorrow or to some dear friend whom he had lost he seems a little embarrassed about the st jeromes and said more than once that he owed his life to miss arundel he dwelt a good deal upon this he asked also a great deal about the brentham family they seem the people whom he most affects when i told him of lady corisandes approaching union with the duke of brecon i did not think he half liked it  but is it settled  the same as the duke has been with me two hours today about his arrangements he has proposed to the parents who are delighted with the match and has received every encouragement from the young lady he looks upon it as certain  i wish our kind friend had not gone abroad said apollonia  well at any rate he has come back said mr giles that is something i am sure i more than once never expected to see him again  he has every virtue and every charm said apollonia and principles that are now proved i shall never forget his kindness at the towers i wish he were settled for life but who is worthy of him i hope he will not fall into the clutches of that popish girl i have sometimes from what i observed at muriel and other reasons a dread misgiving    chapter 81   it was the first night that lothair had slept in his own house and when he awoke in the morning he was quite bewildered and thought for a moment he was in the palazzo agostini he had not reposed in so spacious and lofty a chamber since he was at rome and this brought all his recollection to his roman life and every thing that had happened there and yet after all he said had it not been for clare arundel i should never have seen muriel house i owe to her my life his relations with the st jerome family were doubtless embarrassing even painful and yet his tender and susceptible nature could not for a moment tolerate that he should passively submit to an estrangement from those who had conferred on him so much kindness and whose illconsidered and injurious courses as he now esteemed them were perhaps and probably influenced and inspired by exalted even sacred motives  he wondered whether they were in london and if so what should he do should he call or should he write he wished he could do something to show to miss arundel how much he appreciated her kindness and how grateful he was she was a fine creature and all her errors were noble ones enthusiasm energy devotion to a sublime cause errors but are these errors are they not on the contrary qualities which should command admiration in any one and in a womanand a beautiful womanmore than admiration  there is always something to worry you it comes as regularly as sunrise here was lothair under his own roof again after strange and trying vicissitudes with his health restored his youth little diminished with some strange memories and many sweet ones on the whole once more in great prosperity and yet his mind harped only on one vexing thought and that was his painful and perplexed relations with the st jerome family  his thoughts were a little distracted from this harassing theme by the novelty of his house and the pleasure it gave him he admired the double staircase and the somewhat heavy yet richlycarved ceilings and the look into the park shadowy and green with a rich summer sun and the palace in the distance what an agreeable contrast to his hard noisy sojourn in a brannew brobdingnagian hotel as was his coarse fate when he was launched into london life this made him think of many comforts for which he ought to be grateful and then he remembered muriel towers and how completely and capitally every thing was there prepared and appointed and while he was thinking over all thisand kindly of the chief author of these satisfactory arrangements and the instances in which that individual had shown not merely professional dexterity and devotion but some of the higher qualities that make life sweet and pleasantmr putney giles was announced and lothair sprang forward and gave him his hand with a cordiality which repaid at once that perfect but largehearted lawyer for all his exertions and some anxieties that he had never expressed even to apollonia  nothing in life is more remarkable than the unnecessary anxiety which we endure and generally occasion ourselves between four and five oclock having concluded his long conference with mr putney giles lothair as if he were travelling the principal street of a foreign town or rather treading on tiptoe like a prince in some enchanted castle ventured to walk down st james street and the very first person he met was lord st jerome  nothing could be more unaffectedly hearty than his greeting by that good man and thorough gentleman i saw by the post you had arrived said lord st jerome and we were all saying at breakfast how glad we should be to see you again and looking so well quite yourself i never saw you looking better you have been to egypt with lord st aldegonde i think it was the wisest thing you could do i said to gertrude when you went to sicily if i were lothair i would go a good deal farther than sicily you wanted change of scene and air more than any man i know  and how are they all said lothair my first visit will be to them  and they will be delighted to see you lady st jerome is a little indisposeda cold caught at one of her bazaars she will hold them and they say that no one ever sells so much but still as i often say my dear gertrude would it not be better if i were to give you a check for the institution it would be the same to them and would save you a great deal of trouble but she fancies her presence inspires others and perhaps there is something in it  i doubt not and miss arundel  clare is quite well and i am hurrying home now to ride with her i shall tell her that you asked after her  and offer her my kindest remembrances  what a relief exclaimed lothair when once more alone i thought i should have sunk into the earth when he first addressed me and now i would not have missed this meeting for any consideration  he had not the courage to go into whites he was under a vague impression that the whole population of the metropolis and especially those who reside in the sacred land bounded on the one side by piccadilly and on the other by pall mall were unceasingly talking of his scrapes and misadventures but he met lord carisbrooke and mr brancepeth  ah lothair said carisbrooke i do not think we have seen you this seasoncertainly not since easter what have you been doing with yourself  you have been in egypt said mr brancepeth the duke was mentioning at whites today that you had returned with his son and lord st aldegonde  and does it pay inquired carisbrooke egypt what i have found generally in this sort of thing is that one hardly knows what to do with ones evenings  there is something in that said lothair and perhaps it applies to other countries besides egypt however though it is true i did return with st aldegonde and bertram i have myself not been to egypt  and where did you pick them up  at jerusalem  jerusalem what on earth could they go to jerusalem for said lord carisbrooke i am told there is no sort of sport there they say in the upper nile there is good shooting  st aldegonde was disappointed i suppose our countrymen have disturbed the crocodiles and frightened away the pelicans  we were going to look in at whitescome with us  lothair was greeted with general kindness but nobody seemed aware that he had been long and unusually absent from them some had themselves not come up to town till after easter and had therefore less cause to miss him the great majority however were so engrossed with themselves that they never missed anybody the duke of brecon appealed to lothair about something that had happened at the last derby and was under the impression until better informed that lothair had been one of his party there were some exceptions to this general unacquaintance with events which an hour before lothair had feared fearfully engrossed society hugo bohun was doubly charmed to see him because we were all in a fright one day that they were going to make you a cardinal and it turned out that at the very time they said you were about to enter the conclave you happened to be at the second cataract what lies these newspapers do tell  but the climax of relief was reached when the noble and grayheaded patron of the arts in great britain approached him with polished benignity and said i can give you perhaps even later news than you can give me of our friends at jerusalem i had a letter from madame phoebus this morning and she mentioned with great regret that you had just left them your first travels i believe  my first  and wisely planned you were right in starting out and seeing the distant parts one may not always have the energy which such an expedition requires you can keep italy for a later and calmer day  thus one by one all the cerulean demons of the morn had vanished and lothair had nothing to worry him he felt a little dull as the dinnerhour approached bertram was to dine at home and then go to the house of commons st aldegonde concluding the day with the same catastrophe had in the most immoral manner in the interval gone to the play to see school of which he had read an account in galignani when he was in quarantine lothair was so displeased with this unfeeling conduct on his part that he declined to accompany him but lady st aldegonde who dined at crecy house defended her husband and thought it very right and reasonable that one so fond of the drama as he who had been so long deprived of gratifying his taste in that respect should take the first opportunity of enjoying this innocent amusement a solitary dinner at muriel house in one of those spacious and lofty chambers rather appalled lothair and he was getting low again remembering nothing but his sorrows when mr pinto came up to him and said the impromptu is always successful in life you cannot be engaged to dinner for everybody believes you are at jericho what say you to dining with me less than the muses and more than the graces certainly if you come lady beatrice has invited herself and she is to pick up a lady and i was to look out for a couple of agreeable men huge is coming and you will complete the charm  the spell then is complete said lothair i suppose a late eight    chapter 82   lothair was breakfasting alone on the morrow when his servant announced the arrival of mr ruby who had been ordered to be in attendance  show him up said lothair and bring me the dispatchbox which is in my dressingroom  mr ruby was deeply gratified to be again in the presence of a nobleman so eminently distinguished both for his property and his taste as lothair he was profuse in his congratulations to his lordship on his return to his native land while at the same time he was opening a bag from which he extracted a variety of beautiful objects none of them for sale all executed commissions which were destined to adorn the fortunate and the fair this is lovely my lord quite new for the queen of madagascar for the empress this her majestys own design at least almost lady meltons bridal necklace and my lords george the last given by king james ii broken up during the revolution but reset by us from an old drawing with picked stones  very pretty said lothair but it is not exactly this sort of thing that i want see and he opened the dispatchbox and took from out of it a crucifix it was made of some eastern wood inlaid with motherofpearl the figure carved in brass though not without power and at the end of each of the four terminations of the cross was a small cavity enclosing something and covered with glass  see continued lothair this is the crucifix given with a carved shell to each pilgrim who visits the holy sepulchre within these four cavities is earth from the four holy places calvary sion bethlehem and gethsemane now what i want is a crucifix something of this dimension but made of the most costly materials the figure must be of pure gold i should like the cross to be of choice emeralds which i am told are now more precious even than brilliants and i wish the earth of the sacred places to be removed from this crucifix and introduced in a similar manner into the one which you are to make and each cavity must be covered with a slit diamond do you understand  i follow you my lord said mr ruby with glistening eyes it will be a rare jewel is there to be a limit as to the cost  none but such as taste and propriety suggest said lothair you will of course make a drawing and an estimate and send them to me but i desire dispatch  when mr ruby had retired lothair took from the dispatchbox a sealed packet and looked at it for some moments and then pressed it to his lips  in the afternoon lothair found himself again in the saddle and was riding about london as if he had never quitted it he left his cards at crecy house and many other houses and he called at the st jeromes late but asked if they were at home he had reckoned that they would not be and his reckoning was right it was impossible to conceal from himself that it was a relief mr putney giles dined alone with lothair this evening and they talked over many things among others the approaching marriage of lady corisande with the duke of brecon  everybody marries except myself said lothair rather peevishly  but your lordship is too young to think of that yet said mr putney giles  i feel very old said lothair  at this moment there arrived a note from bertram saying his mother was quite surprised and disappointed that lothair had not asked to see her in the morning she had expected him as a matter of course at luncheon and begged that he would come on the morrow  i have had many pleasant luncheons in that house said lothair but this will be the last when all the daughters are married nobody eats luncheon  that would hardly apply to this family said mr putney giles who always affected to know every thing and generally did they are so united that i fancy the famous luncheons at crecy house will always go on and be a popular mode of their all meeting  i half agree with st aldegonde said lothair grumbling to himself that if one is to meet that duke of brecon every day at luncheon for my part i had rather stay away  in the course of the evening there also arrived invitations to all the impending balls and assemblies for lothair and there seemed little prospect of his again being forced to dine with his faithful solicitor as a refuge from melancholy  on the morrow he went in his brougham to crecy house and he had such a palpitation of the heart when he arrived that for a moment he absolutely thought he must retire his mind was full of jerusalem the mount of olives and the sea of galilee he was never nervous there never agitated never harassed no palpitations of the heart no dread suspense there was repose alike of body and soul why did he ever leave palestine and paraclete he should have remained in syria forever cherishing in a hallowed scene a hallowed sorrow of which even the bitterness was exalted and ennobling  he stood for a moment in the great hall at crecy house and the groom of the chambers in vain solicited his attention it was astonishing how much passed through his mind while the great clock hardly described sixty seconds but in that space he had reviewed his life arrived at the conclusion that all was vanity and bitterness that he had failed in every thing was misplaced had no object and no hope and that a distant and unbroken solitude in some scene where either the majesty of nature was overwhelming or its moral associations were equally sublime must be his only refuge in the meditation of the cosmos or in the divine reverie of sacred lands the burden of existence might be endured  her grace is at luncheon my lord at length said the groom of the chamberand lothair was ushered into the gay and festive and cordial scene the number of the selfinvited guests alone saved him his confusion was absolute and the duchess remarked afterward that lothair seemed to have regained all his shyness  when lothair had rallied and could survey the scene he found he was sitting by his hostess that the duke not a luncheon man was present and as it turned out afterward for the pleasure of meeting lothair bertram also was present and several married daughters and lord montairy and captain mildmay and one or two others and next to lady corisande was the duke of brecon  so far as lothair was concerned the luncheon was unsuccessful his conversational powers deserted him he answered in monosyllables and never originated a remark he was greatly relieved when they rose and returned to the gallery in which they seemed all disposed to linger the duke approached him and in his mood he found it easier to talk to men than to women male conversation is of a coarser grain and does not require so much play of thought and manner discourse about suez canal and arab horses and pipes and pachas can be carried on without any psychological effort and by degrees banishes all sensibility and yet he was rather dreamy talked better than he listened did not look his companion in the face as the duke spoke which was his custom and his eye was wandering suddenly bertram having joined them and speaking to his father lothair darted away and approached lady corisande whom lady montairy had just quitted  as i may never have the opportunity again said lothair let me thank you lady corisande for some kind thoughts which you deigned to bestow on me in my absence  his look was serious his tone almost sad neither were in keeping with the scene and the apparent occasion and lady corisande not displeased but troubled murmured since i last met you i heard you had seen much and suffered much  and that makes the kind thoughts of friends more precious said lothair i have few your brother is the chief but even he never did me any kindness so great as when he told me that you had spoken of me with sympathy  bertrams friends are mine said lady corisande but otherwise it would be impossible for us all not to feel an interest in one of whom we had seen so much she added with some hesitation  ah brentham said lothair dear brentham do you remember once saying to me that you hoped you should never leave brentham  did i say so said lady corisande  i wish i had never left brentham said lothair it was the happiest time of my life i had not then a sorrow or a care  but everybody has sorrows and cares said lady corisande you have however a great many things which ought to make you happy  i do not deserve to be happy said lothair for i have made so many mistakes my only consolation is that one great error which you most deprecated i have escaped  take a brighter and a nobler view of your life said lady corisande feel rather you have been tried and not found wanting  at this moment the duchess approached them and interrupted their conversation and soon after this lothair left crecy house still moody but less despondent  there was a ball at lady clanmornes in the evening and lothair was present he was astonished at the number of new faces he saw the new phrases he heard the new fashions alike in dress and manner he could not believe it was the same world that he had quitted only a year ago he was glad to take refuge with hugo bohun as with an old friend and could not refrain from expressing to that eminent person his surprise at the novelty of all around him  it is you my dear lothair replied hugo that is surprising not the worldthat has only developed in your absence what could have induced a man like you to be away for a whole season from the scene our forefathers might afford to travelthe world was then stereotyped it will not do to be out of sight now it is very well for st aldegonde to do these things for the great object of st aldegonde is not to be in society and he has never succeeded in his object but here is the new beauty  there was a stir and a sensation men made way and even women retreatedand leaning on the arm of lord carisbrooke in an exquisite costume that happily displayed her splendid figure and radiant with many charms swept by a lady of commanding mien and stature selfpossessed and even grave when suddenly turning her head her pretty face broke into enchanting dimples as she exclaimed oh cousin lothair  yes the beautiful giantesses of muriel towers had become the beauties of the season their success had been as sudden and immediate as it was complete and sustained well this is stranger than all said lothair to hugo bohun when lady flora had passed on  the only persons talked of said hugo i am proud of my previous acquaintance with them i think carisbrooke has serious thoughts but there are some who prefer lady grizell  lady corisande was your idol last season said lothair  oh she is out of the running said hugo she is finished but i have not heard yet of any day being fixed i wonder when he marries whether brecon will keep on his theatre  his theatre  yes the high mode now for a real swell is to have a theatre brecon has the frolic kate simmons is his manager who calls herself athalie de montfort you ought to have a theatre lothair and if there is not one to hire you should build one it would show that you are alive again and had the spirit of an english noble and atone for some of your eccentricities  but i have no kate simmons who calls herself athalie de montfort said lothair i am not so favored hugo however i might succeed brecon as i hardly suppose he will maintain such an establishment when he is married  i beg your pardon rejoined hugo it is the thing several of our greatest swells have theatres and are married in fact a firstrate man should have every thing and therefore he ought to have both a theatre and a wife  well i do not think your manners have improved since last year or your words said lothair i have half a mind to go down to muriel and shut myself up there  he walked away and sauntered into the ballroom the first forms he recognized were lady corisande waltzing with the duke of brecon who was renowned for this accomplishment the heart of lothair felt bitter he remembered his stroll to the dairy with the duchess at brentham and their conversation had his views then been acceded to how different would have been his lot and it was not his fault that they had been rejected and yet had they been accomplished would they have been happy the character of corisande according to her mother was not then formed nor easily scrutable was it formed now and what were its bent and genius and his own character it could not be denied that his mind was somewhat crude then and his general conclusions on life and duty hardly sufficiently matured and developed to offer a basis for domestic happiness on which one might confidently depend  and theodora had he married then he should never have known theodora in this bright saloon amid the gayety of festive music and surrounded by gliding forms of elegance and brilliancy his heart was full of anguish when he thought of theodora to have known such a woman and to have lost her why should a man live after this yes he would retire to muriel once hallowed by her presence and he would raise to her memory some monumental fane beyond the dreams ever of artemisia and which should commemorate alike her wondrous life and wondrous mind  a beautiful hand was extended to him and a fair face animated with intelligence welcomed him without a word it was lady st jerome lothair bowed lowly and touched her hand with his lip  i was sorry to have missed you yesterday we had gone down to vauxe for the day but i heard of you from my lord with great pleasure we are all of us so happy that you have entirely recovered your health  i owe that to you dearest lady said lothair and to those under your roof i can never forget your goodness to me had it not been for you i should not have been here or anywhere else  no no we did our best for the moment but i quite agree with my lord now that you stayed too long at rome under the circumstances it was a good movethat going to sicily and so wise of you to travel in egypt men should travel  i have not been to egypt said lothair i have been to the holy land and am a pilgrim i wish you would tell miss arundel that i shall ask her permission to present her with my crucifix which contains the earth of the holy places i should have told her this myself if i had seen her yesterday is she here  she is at vauxe she could not tear herself away from the roses  but she might have brought them with her as companions said lothair as you have i apprehend yourself  i will give you this in clares name said lady st jerome as she selected a beautiful flower and presented it to lothair it is in return for your crucifix which i am sure she will highly esteem i only wish it were a rose of jericho  lothair started the name brought up strange and disturbing associations the procession in the jesuits church the lighted tapers the consecrated children one of whom had been supernaturally presented with the flower in question there was an awkward silence until lothair almost without intending it expressed a hope that the cardinal was well  immersed in affairs but i hope well replied lady st jerome you know what has happened but you will see him he will speak to you of these matters himself  but i should like also to hear from you  well they are scarcely yet to be spoken of said lady st jerome i ought not perhaps even to have alluded to the subject but i know how deeply devoted you are to religion we are on the eve of the greatest event of this century when i wake in the morning i always fancy that i have heard of it only in dreams and manyall this roomwill not believe in the possibility of its happening they smile when the contingency is alluded to and if i were not present they would mock but it will happeni am assured it will happen exclaimed lady st jerome speaking with earnestness though in a hushed voice and no human imagination can calculate or conceive what may be its effect on the destiny of the human race  you excite my utmost curiosity said lothair  hush there are listeners but we shall soon meet again you will come and see us and soon come down to vauxe on saturday the cardinal will be there and the place is so lovely now i always say vauxe at whitsuntide or a little later is a scene for shakespeare you know you always liked vauxe  more than liked it said lothair i have passed at vauxe some of the happiest hours of my life    chapter 83   on the morning of the very saturday on which lothair was to pay his visit to vauxe riding in the park he was joined by that polished and venerable nobleman who presides over the destinies of art in great britain this distinguished person had taken rather a fancy to lothair and liked to talk to him about the phoebus family about the great artist himself and all his theories and styles but especially about the fascinating madame phoebus and the captivating euphrosyne  you have not found time i dare say said the nobleman to visit the exhibition of the royal academy  well i have only been here a week said lothair and have had so many things to think of and so many persons to see  naturally said the nobleman but i recommend you to go i am now about to make my fifth visit there but it is only to a single picture and i envy its owner  indeed said lothair pray tell me its subject that i may not fail to see it  it is a portrait said the nobleman only a portrait some would say as if the finest pictures in the world were not only portraits the masterpieces of the english school are portraits and some day when you have leisure and inclination and visit italy you will see portraits by titian and raffaelle and others which are the masterpieces of art well the picture in question is a portrait by a young english painter at rome and of an english lady i doubt not the subject was equal to the genius of the artist but i do not think that the modern pencil has produced any thing equal to it both in design and color and expression you should see it by all means and i have that opinion of your taste that i do not think you will be content by seeing it once the real taste for fine art in this country is proved by the crowd that always surrounds that picture and yet only a portrait of an english lady a miss arundel  a miss arundel said lothair  yes of a roman catholic family i believe a relative of the st jeromes they were at rome last year when this portrait was executed  if you will permit me said lothair i should like to accompany you to the academy i am going out of town this afternoon but not far and could manage it  so they went together it was the last exhibition of the academy in trafalgar square the portrait in question was in the large room and hung on the eye line so as the throng about it was great it was not easy immediately to inspect it but one or two r as who were gliding about and who looked upon the noble patron of art as a sort of divinity insensibly controlled the crowd and secured for their friend and his companion the opportunity which they desired  it is the finest thing since the portrait of the cenci said the noble patron  the painter had represented miss arundel in her robe of a sister of mercy but with uncovered head a wallet was at her side and she held a crucifix her beautiful eyes full of mystic devotions met those of the spectator with a fascinating power that kept many spellbound in the background of the picture was a masterly glimpse of the papal gardens and the wondrous dome  that must be a great woman said the noble patron of art  lothair nodded assent in silence  the crowd about the picture seemed breathless and awestruck there were many women and in some eyes there were tears  i shall go home said one of the spectators i do not wish to see any thing else  that is religion murmured her companion they may say what they like but it would be well for us if we were all like her  it was a short halfhour by the railroad to vauxe and the station was close to the park gates the sun was in its last hour when lothair arrived but he was captivated by the beauty of the scene which he had never witnessed in its summer splendor the rich foliage of the great avenues the immense oaks that stood alone the deer glancing in the golden light and the quaint and stately edifice itself so finished and so fair with its freestone pinnacles and its gilded vanes glistening and sparkling in the warm and lucid sky contrasted with the chilly hours when the cardinal and himself had first strolled together in that park and when they tried to flatter themselves that the morning mist clinging to the skeleton trees was perhaps the burst of spring  lothair found himself again in his old rooms and as his valet unpacked his toilet he fell into one of his reveries  what he thought to himself if life after all be only a dream i can scarcely realize what is going on it seems to me i have passed through a year of visions that i should be at vauxe again a roof i once thought rife with my destiny and perhaps it may prove so and were it not for the memory of one event i should be a ship without a rudder  there were several guests in the house and when lothair entered the drawingroom he was glad to find that it was rather full the cardinal was by the side of lady st jerome when lothair entered and immediately after saluting his hostess it was his duty to address his late guardian lothair had looked forward to this meeting with apprehension it seemed impossible that it should not to a certain degree be annoying nothing of the kind it was impossible to greet him more cordially more affectionately than did cardinal grandison  you have seen a great deal since we parted said the cardinal nothing could be wiser than your travelling you remember that at muriel i recommended you to go to egypt but i thought it better that you should see rome first and it answered you made the acquaintance of its eminent men men whose names will be soon in everybodys mouth for before another year elapses rome will be the cynosure of the world then when the great questions come on which will decide the fate of the human race for centuries you will feel the inestimable advantage of being master of the situation and that you are familiar with every place and every individual i think you were not very well at rome but next time you must choose your season however i may congratulate you on your present looks the air of the levant seems to have agreed with you  dinner was announced almost at this moment and lothair who had to take out lady clanmorne had no opportunity before dinner of addressing any one else except his hostess and the cardinal the dinnerparty was large and it took some time to reconnoitre all the guests lothair observed miss arundel who was distant from him and on the same side of the table but neither monsignore capel nor father coleman were present  lady clanmorne chatted agreeably she was content to talk and did not insist on conversational reciprocity she was a pure freetrader in gossip this rather suited lothair it pleased lady clanmorne today to dilate upon marriage and the married state but especially on all her acquaintances male and female who were meditating the surrender of their liberty and about to secure the happiness of their lives  i suppose the wedding of the seasonthe wedding of weddingswill be the duke of brecons she said but i do not hear of any day being fixed  ah said lothair i have been abroad and am very deficient in these matters but i was travelling with the ladys brother and he has never yet told me that his sister was going to be married  there is no doubt about that said lady clanmorne the duchess said to a friend of mine the other day who congratulated her that there was no person in whom she should have more confidence as a soninlaw than the duke  but most marriages turn out unhappy said lothair rather morosely  oh my dear lord what can you mean  well i think so he said doggedly among the lower orders if we may judge from the newspapers they are always killing their wives and in our class we get rid of them in a more polished way or they get rid of us  you quite astonish me with such sentiments said lady clanmorne what would lady st jerome think if she heard you who told me the other day that she believed you to be a faultless character and the duchess too your friends mamma who thinks you so good and that it is so fortunate for her son to have such a companion  as for lady st jerome she believes in every thing said lothair and it is no compliment that she believes in me as for my friends mamma her ideal character according to you is the duke of brecon and i cannot pretend to compete with him he may please the duchess but i cannot say the duke of brecon is a sort of man i admire  well he is no great favorite of mine said lady clanmorne i think him overbearing and selfish and i should not like at all to be his wife  what do you think of lady corisande said lothair  i admire her more than any girl in society and i think she will be thrown away on the duke of brecon she is clever and she has strong character and i am told is capable of great affections her manners are good finished and natural and she is beloved by her young friends which i always think a test  do you think her handsome  there can be no question about that she is beautiful and her beauty is of a high class i admire her much more than all her sisters she has a grander mien  have you seen miss arundels picture at the academy  everybody has seen that it has made a fury  i heard an eminent judge say today that it was the portrait of one who must be a great woman  well miss arundel is a remarkable person  do you admire her  i have heard firstrate critics say that there was no person to be compared to miss arundel and unquestionably it is a most striking countenance that profound brow and those large deep eyesand then her figure is so fine but to tell you the truth miss arundel is a person i never could make out  i wonder she does not marry said lothair  she is very difficult said lady clanmorne perhaps too she is of your opinion about marriage  i have a good mind to ask her after dinner whether she is said lothair i fancy she would not marry a protestant  i am no judge of such matters said lady clanmorne only i cannot help thinking that there would be more chance of a happy marriage when both were of the same religion  i wish we were all of the same religion do not you  well that depends a little on what the religion might be  ah sighed lothair what between religion and marriage and some other things it appears to me one never has a tranquil moment i wonder what religious school the duke of brecon belongs to very high and dry i should think  the moment the gentlemen returned to the drawingroom lothair singled out miss arundel and attached himself to her  i have been to see your portrait today he said she changed color  i think it he continued the triumph of modern art and i could not easily fix on any production of the old masters that excels it  it was painted at rome she said in a low voice  so i understood i regret that when i was at rome i saw so little of its art but my health you know was wretched indeed if it had not been for some friendsi might say for one friendi should not have been here or in this world i can never express to that person my gratitude and it increases every day all that i have dreamed of angels was then realized  you think too kindly of us  did lady st jerome give you my message about the earth from the holy places which i had placed in a crucifix and which i hope you will accept from me in remembrance of the past and your christian kindness to me i should have left it at st jamess square before this but it required some little arrangement after its travels  i shall prize it most dearly both on account of its consecrated character and for the donors sake whom i have ever wished to see the champion of our master  you never had a wish i am sure said lothair that was not sublime and pure    chapter 84   they breakfasted at vauxe in the long gallery it was always a merry meal and it was the fashion of the house that all should be present the cardinal was seldom absent he used to say i feel more on equal terms with my friends at breakfast and rather look forward to my banquet of dry toast lord st jerome was quite proud of receiving his letters and newspapers at vauxe earlier by far than he did at st jamess square and as all were supplied with their letters and journals there was a great demand for news and a proportional circulation of it lady clanmorne indulged this passion for gossip amusingly one morning and read a letter from her correspondent written with the grace of a sevigne but which contained details of marriages elopements and a murder among their intimate acquaintance which made all the real intelligence quite insipid and was credited for at least half an hour  the gallery at vauxe was of great length and the breakfasttable was laid at one end of it the gallery was of panelled oak with windows of stained glass in the upper panes and the ceiling richly and heavily carved was entirely gilt but with deadened gold though stately the general effect was not free from a certain character of gloom lit as it was by sconces this was at night much softened but on a rich summer morn the gravity and repose of this noble chamber were grateful to the senses  the breakfast was over the ladies had retired stealing off with the morning post the gentlemen gradually disappearing for the solace of their cigars the cardinal who was conversing with lothair continued their conversation while walking up and down the gallery far from the hearing of the servants who were disembarrassing the breakfasttable and preparing it for luncheon a visit to a countryhouse as pinto says is a series of meals mitigated by the new dresses of the ladies  the more i reflect on your travels said the cardinal the more i am satisfied with what has happened i recognize the hand of providence in your preliminary visit to rome and your subsequent one to jerusalem in the vast events which are impending that man is in a strong position who has made a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre yo remember our walk in the park here continued the cardinal i felt then that we were on the eve of some mighty change but it was then indefinite though to me inevitable you were destined i was persuaded to witness it even as i hoped to take no inconsiderable share in its fulfilment but i hardly believed that i should have been spared for this transcendent day and when it is consummated i will gratefully exclaim nunc me dimittis  you allude sir to some important matter which lady st jerome a few days ago intimated to me but it was only an intimation and purposely very vague  there is no doubt said the cardinal speaking with solemnity of what i now communicate to you the holy father pius ix has resolved to summon an oecumenical council  an oecumenical council said lothair  it is a weak phrase resumed the cardinal to say it will be the greatest event of this century i believe it will be the greatest event since the episcopate of st peter greater in its consequences to the human race than the fall of the roman empire the pseudoreformation or the revolution of france it is much more than three hundred years since the last oecumenical council the council of trent and the world still vibrates with its decisions but the council of trent compared with the impending council of the vatican will be as the mediaeval world of europe compared with the vast and complete globe which man has since discovered and mastered  indeed said lothair  why the very assembly of the fathers of the church will astound the freemasons and the secret societies and the atheists that alone will be a demonstration of power on the part of the holy father which no conqueror from sesostris to napoleon has ever equalled it was only the bishops of europe that assembled at trent and inspired by the holy spirit their decisions have governed man for more than three hundred years but now the bishops of the whole world will assemble round the chair of st peter and prove by their presence the catholic character of the church asia will send its patriarchs and pontiffs and america and australia its prelates and at home my dear young friend the council of the vatican will offer a striking contrast to the council of trent great britain will be powerfully represented the bishops of ireland might have been counted on but it is england also that will send her prelates now and some of them will take no ordinary share in transactions that will give a new form and color to human existence  is it true sir that the object of the council is to declare the infallibility of the pope  in matters of faith and morals said the cardinal quickly there is no other infallibility that is a secret with god all that we can know of the decision of the council on this awful head is that its decision inspired by the holy spirit must infallibly be right we must await that decision and when made known we must embrace it not only with obedience but with the interior assent of mind and will but there are other results of the council on which we may speculate and which i believe it will certainly accomplish first it will show in a manner that cannot be mistaken that there is only one alternative for the human intellect rationalism or faith and secondly it will exhibit to the christian powers the inevitable future they are now preparing for themselves  i am among the faithful said lothair  then you must be a member of the church catholic said the cardinal the basis on which god has willed that his revelation should rest in the world is the testimony of the catholic church which if considered only as a human and historical witness affords the highest and most certain evidence for the fact and the contents of the christian religion if this be denied there is no such thing as history but the catholic church is not only a human and historical witness of its own origin constitution and authority it is also a supernatural and divine witness which can neither fail nor err when it oecumenically speaks it is not merely the voice of the fathers of the world it declares what it hath seemed good to the holy ghost and to us  there was a pause and then lothair remarked you said air that the council would show to the civil powers of the christian world the inevitable future they are preparing for themselves  even so now mark this my child at the council of trent the christian powers were represented and properly so their seats will be empty at the council of the vatican what does that mean the separation between church and state talked of for a long time now demonstrated and what does separation between church and state mean that society is no longer consecrated the civil governments of the world no longer profess to be catholic the faithful indeed among their subjects will be represented at the council by their pastors but the civil powers have separated themselves from the church either by royal edict or legislative enactment or revolutionary changes they have abolished the legal status of the catholic church within their territory it is not their choice they are urged on by an invisible power that is antichristian and which is the true natural and implacable enemy of the one visible and universal church the coming anarchy is called progress because it advances along the line of departure from the old christian order of the world christendom was the offspring of the christian family and the foundation of the christian family is the sacrament of matrimony the sprit of all domestic and public morals the antichristian societies are opposed to the principle of home when they have destroyed the hearth the morality of society will perish a settlement in the foundations may be slow in sinking but it brings all down at last the next step in dechristianizing the political life of nations is to establish national education without christianity this is systematically aimed at wherever the revolution has its way the period and policy of julian are returning some think this bodes ill for the church no it is the state that will suffer the secret societies are hurrying the civil governments of the world and mostly the governments who disbelieve in their existence to the brink of a precipice over which monarchies and law and civil order will ultimately fall and perish together  then all is hopeless said lothair  to human speculation said the cardinal but none can fathom the mysteries of divine interposition this coming council may save society and on that i would speak to you most earnestly his holiness has resolved to invite the schismatic priesthoods to attend it and labor to bring about the unity of christendom he will send an ambassador to the patriarch of the heresy of photius which is called the greek church he will approach lambeth i have little hope of the latter though there is more than one of the anglican bishops who revere the memory and example of laud but i by no means despair of your communion being present in some form at the council there are true spirits at oxford who sigh for unity they will form i hope a considerable deputation but as not yet being prelates they cannot take their seats formally in the council i wish in order to increase and assert their influence that they should be accompanied by a band of powerful laymen who shall represent the pious and pure mind of englandthe coming guardians of the land in the dark hour that may be at hand considering your previous knowledge of rome your acquaintance with its eminent men and its language and considering too as i well know that the holy father looks to you as one marked out by providence to assert the truth it would please meand trust me it would be wise in youwere you to visit rome on this sublime occasion and perhaps put your mark on the worlds history  it must yet be a long time before the council meets said lothair after a pause  not too long for preparation replied the cardinal from this hour until its assembling the pulse of humanity will throb even at this hour they are speaking of the same matters as ourselves alike on the euphrates and the st lawrence the good catesby is in ireland conferring with the bishops and awakening them to the occasion there is a party among them narrowminded and local the effects of their education there ought not to be an irish priest who was not brought up at the propaganda you know that admirable institution we had some happy hours at rome togethermay we soon repeat them you were very unwell there next time you will judge of rome in health and vigor    chapter 85   they say there is a skeleton in every house it may be doubted what is more certain are the sorrow and perplexity which sometimes without a warning and preparation suddenly fall upon a family living in a world of happiness and ease and meriting their felicity by every gift of fortune and disposition  perhaps there never was a circle that enjoyed life more and deserved to enjoy life more than the brentham family never was a family more admired and less envied nobody grudged them their happy gifts and accidents for their demeanor was so winning and their manners so cordial and sympathetic that every one felt as if he shared their amiable prosperity and yet at this moment the duchess whose countenance was always as serene as her soul was walking with disturbed visage and agitated step up and down the private room of the duke while his grace seated his head upon his arm and with his eyes on the ground was apparently in anxious thought  now what had happened it seems that these excellent parents had become acquainted almost at the same moment with two astounding and disturbing facts their son wanted to marry euphrosyne cantacuzene and their daughter would not marry the duke of brecon  i was so perfectly unprepared for the communication said the duke looking up that i have no doubt i did not express myself as i ought to have done but i do not think i said any thing wrong i showed surprise sorrowno anger i was careful not to say any thing to hurt his feelingsthat is a great point in these mattersnothing disrespectful of the young lady i invited him to speak to me again about it when i had a little got over my surprise  it is really a catastrophe exclaimed the duchess and only think i came to you for sympathy in my sorrow which after all though distressing is only a mortification  i am very sorry about brecon said the duke who is a man of honor and would have suited us very well but my dear augusta i never took exactly the same view of this affair as you didi was never satisfied that corisande returned his evident i might say avowed admiration of her  she spoke of him always with great respect said the duchess and that is much in a girl of corisandes disposition i never heard her speak of any of her admirers in the same tonecertainly not of lord carisbrooke i was quite prepared for her rejection of him she never encouraged him  well said the duke i grant you it is mortifyinginfinitely distressing and brecon is the last man i could have wished that it should occur to but after all our daughter must decide for herself in such affairs she is the person most interested in the event i never influenced her sisters in their choice and she also must be free the other subject is more grave  if we could only ascertain who she really is said the duchess  according to bertram fully our equal but i confess i am no judge of levantine nobility his grace added with a mingled expression of pride and despair  that dreadful travelling abroad exclaimed the duchess i always had a foreboding of something disastrous from it why should he have gone abroad who has never been to ireland or seen half the counties of his own country  they all will go said the duke and i thought with st aldegonde he was safe from getting into any scrape of this kind  i should like to speak to granville about it said the duchess when he is serious his judgment is good  i am to see st aldegonde before i speak to bertram said the duke i should not be surprised if he were here immediately  one of the social mysteries is how things get about it is not the interest of any of the persons immediately connected with the subject that society should be aware that the lady corisande had declined the proposal of the duke of brecon society had no right even to assume that such a proposal was either expected or contemplated the duke of brecon admired lady corisande so did many others and many others were admired by the duke of brecon the duchess even hoped that as the season was waning it might break up and people go into the country or abroad and nothing be observed and yet it got about the way things get about is through the hugo bohuns nothing escapes their quick eyes and slow hearts their mission is to peer into society like professional astronomers ever on the watch to detect the slightest change in the phenomena never embarrassed by any passion of their own and their only social scheming being to maintain their transcendent position all their life and energy are devoted to the discovery of what is taking place around them and experience combined with natural tact invests them with almost a supernatural skill in the detection of social secrets and so it happened that scarcely a week had passed before hugo began to sniff the air and then to make fine observations at balls as to whom certain persons danced with or did not dance with and then he began the curious process of what he called putting two and two together and putting two and two together proved in about a fortnight that it was all up between lady corisande and the duke of brecon  among others he imparted this information to lothair and it set lothair a thinking and he went to a ball that evening solely with the purpose of making social observations like hugo bohun but lady corisande was not there though the duke of brecon was apparently in high spirits and waltzing more than once with lady grizell falkirk lothair was not very fortunate in his attempts to see bertram he called more than once at crecy house too but in vain the fact is bertram was naturally entirely engrossed with his own difficulties and the duchess harassed and mortified could no longer be at home in the morning  her grace however evinced the just appreciation of character for which women are remarkable in the confidence which she reposed in the good sense of lord st aldegonde at this crisis st aldegonde was the only one of his sonsinlaw whom the duke really considered and a little feared when st aldegonde was serious his influence over men was powerful and he was serious now st aldegonde who was not conventional had made the acquaintance of mr cantacuzene immediately on his return to england and they had become friends he had dined in the tyburnian palace of the descendant of the greek emperors more than once and had determined to make his second son who was only four years of age a greek merchant when the duke therefore consulted him on the catastrophe st aldegonde took high ground spoke of euphrosyne in the way she deserved as one equal to an elevated social position and deserving it but if you ask me my opinion sir he continued i do not think except for bertrams sake that you have any cause to fret yourself the family wish her to marry her cousin the eldest son of the prince of samos it is an alliance of the highest and suits them much better than any connection with us besides cantacuzene will give his children large fortunes and they like the money to remain in the family a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand poundsperhaps moregoes a great way on the coasts of asia minor you might buy up half the archipelago the cantacuzenes are coming to dine with us next week bertha is delighted with them mr cantacuzene is so kind as to say he will take clovis into his countinghouse i wish i could induce your grace to come and meet him then you could judge for yourself you would not be in the least shocked were bertram to marry the daughter of some of our great merchants or bankers this is a great merchant and banker and the descendant of princes and his daughter one of the most beautiful and gifted of women and worthy to be a princess  there is a good deal in what st aldegonde says said the duke afterward to his wife the affair takes rather a different aspect it appears they are really people of high consideration and great wealth too nobody could describe them as adventurers  we might gain a little time said the duchess i dislike peremptory decisions it is a pity we have not an opportunity of seeing the young lady  granville says she is the most beautiful woman he ever met except her sister  that is the artists wife said the duchess  yes said the duke i believe a most distinguished man but it rather adds to the imbroglio perhaps things may turn out better than they first promised the fact is i am more amazed than annoyed granville knows the father it seems intimately he knows so many odd people he wants me to meet him at dinner what do you think about it it is a good thing sometimes to judge for ones self they say this prince of samos she is half betrothed to is attach to the turkish embassy at vienna and is to visit england  my nervous system is quite shaken said the duchess i wish we could all go to brentham i mentioned it to corisande this morning and i was surprised to find that she wished to remain in town  well we will decide nothing my dear in a hurry st aldegonde says that if we decide in that sense he will undertake to break off the whole affair we may rely on that we need consider the business only with reference to bertrams happiness and feelings that is an important issue no doubt but it is a limited one the business is not of so disagreeable a nature as it seemed it is not an affair of a rash engagement in a discreditable quarter from which he cannot extricate himself there is no doubt they are thoroughly reputable people and will sanction nothing which is not decorous and honorable st aldegonde has been a comfort to me in this matter and you will find out a great deal when you speak to him about it things might be worse i wish i was as easy about the duke of brecon i met him this morning and rode with himto show there was no change in my feelings    chapter 86   the world goes on with its aching hearts and its smiling faces and very often when a year has revolved the world finds out there was no sufficient cause for the sorrows or the smiles there is too much unnecessary anxiety in the world which is apt too hastily to calculate the consequences of any unforeseen event quite forgetting that acute as it is in observation the world where the future is concerned is generally wrong the duchess would have liked to have buried herself in the shades of brentham but lady corisande who deported herself as if there were no care at crecy house except that occasioned by her brothers rash engagement was of opinion that mamma would only brood over this vexation in the country and that it would be much better not to anticipate the close of the waning season so the duchess and her lovely daughter were seen everywhere where they ought to be seen and appeared the pictures of serenity and satisfaction  as for bertrams affair itself under the manipulation of st aldegonde it began to assume a less anxious and more practicable aspect the duke was desirous to secure his sons happiness but wished nothing to be done rashly if for example in a years time or so bertram continued in the same mind his father would never be an obstacle to his wellconsidered wishes in the mean time an opportunity might offer of making the acquaintance of the young lady and her friends  and in the mean time the world went on dancing and betting and banqueting and making speeches and breaking hearts and heads till the time arrived when social stock is taken the results of the campaign estimated and ascertained and the question asked where do you think of going this year  we shall certainly winter at rome said lady st jerome to lady clanmorne who was paying a morning visit i wish you could induce lord clanmorne to join us  i wish so too said the lady but that is impossible he never will give up his hunting  i am sure there are more foxes in the campagna than at vauxe said lady st jerome  i suppose you have heard of what they call the double event said lady clanmorne  no  well it is quite true mr bohun told me last night and he always knows every thing  every thing said lady st jerome but what is it that he knows now  both the ladies falkirk are to be married and on the same day  but to whom  whom should you think  i will not even guess said lady st jerome  clare she said to miss arundel who was engaged apart you always find out conundrums lady clanmorne has got some news for us lady flora falkirk and her sister are going to be married and on the same day and to whom think you  well i should think that somebody has made lord carisbrooke a happy man said miss arundel  very good said lady clanmorne i think lady flora will make an excellent lady carisbrooke he is not quite as tall as she is but he is a man of inches and now for lady grizell  my powers of divination are quite exhausted said miss arundel  well i will not keep you in suspense said lady clanmorne lady grizell is to be duchess of brecon  duchess of brecon exclaimed both miss arundel and lady st jerome  i always admired the ladies said miss arundel we met them at a countryhouse last year and i thought them pleasing in every wayartless and yet piquant but i did not anticipate their fate being so soon sealed  and so brilliantly added lady st jerome  you met them at muriel towers said lady clanmorne i heard of you there a most distinguished party there was an american lady there was there not a charming person who sang and acted and did all sorts of things  yes there was i believe however she was an italian married to an american  have you seen much of your host at muriel towers said lady clanmorne  we see him frequently said lady st jerome  ah yes i remember i met him at vauxe the other day he is a great admirer of yours lady clanmorne added addressing miss arundel  oh we are friends and have long been so said miss arundel and she left the room  clare does not recognize admirers said lady st jerome gravely  i hope the ecclesiastical fancy is not reviving said lady clanmorne i was half in hopes that the lord of muriel towers might have deprived the church of its bride  that could never be said lady st jerome though if it could have been a source of happiness to lord st jerome and myself would not have been wanting we greatly regard our kinsman but between ourselves added lady st jerome in a low voice it was supposed that he was attached to the american lady of whom you were speaking  and where is she now  i have heard nothing of late lothair was in italy at the same time as ourselves and was ill there under our roof so we saw a great deal of him afterward he travelled for his health and has now just returned from the east  a visitor was announced and lady clanmorne retired  nothing happens as you expect on his voyage home lothair had indulged in dreams of renewing his intimacy at crecy house around whose hearth all his sympathies were prepared to cluster the first shock to this romance was the news he received of the impending union of lady corisande with the duke of brecon and what with this unexpected obstacle to intimacy and the domestic embarrassments occasioned by bertrams declaration he had become a stranger to a roof which had so filled his thoughts it seemed to him that he could not enter the house either as the admirer of the daughter or as the friend of her brother she was probably engaged to another and as bertrams friend and fellowtraveller he fancied he was looked upon by the family as one who had in some degree contributed to their mortification much of this was imaginary but lothair was very sensitive and the result was that he ceased to call at crecy house and for some time kept aloof from the duchess and her daughter when he met them in general society he was glad to hear from bertram and st aldegonde that the position of the former was beginning to soften at home and that the sharpness of his announcement was passing away and when he had clearly ascertained that the contemplated union of lady corisande with the duke was certainly not to take place lothair began to reconnoitre and try to resume his original position but his reception was not encouraging at least not sufficiently cordial for one who by nature was retiring and reserved lady corisande was always kind and after some time he danced with her again but there were no invitations to luncheon from the duchess they never asked him to dinner his approaches were received with courtesy but he was not courted  the announcement of the marriage of the duke of brecon did not apparently in any degree distress lady corisande on the contrary she expressed much satisfaction at her two young friends settling in life with such success and splendor the ambition both of lady flora and lady grizell was that corisande should be a bridesmaid this would be a rather awkward post to occupy under the circumstances so she embraced both and said that she loved them both so equally that she would not give a preference to either and therefore though she certainly would attend their wedding she would refrain from taking part in the ceremony  the duchess went with lady corisande one morning to mr rubys to choose a present from her daughter to each of the young ladies mr ruby in a back shop poured forth his treasures of bracelets and rings and lockets the presents must be similar in value and in beauty and yet there must be some difference between them so it was a rather long and troublesome investigation mr ruby as usual varying its monotony or mitigating its wearisomeness by occasionally or suddenly exhibiting some splendid or startling production of his art the parure of an empress the bracelets of grandduchesses a wonderful fan that was to flutter in the hands of majesty had all in due course appeared as well as the black pearls and yellow diamonds that figure and flash on such occasions before eyes so favored and so fair  at lastfor like a prudent general mr ruby had always a great reserveopening a case he said there and displayed a crucifix of the most exquisite workmanship and the most precious materials  i have no hesitation in saying the rarest jewel which this century has produced see the figure by monti a masterpiece every emerald in the cross a picked stone these corners your grace is aware said mr ruby condescendingly contain the earth of the holy places at jerusalem it has been shown to no one but your grace  it is indeed most rare and beautiful said the duchess and most interesting too from containing the earth of the holy places a commission of course  from one of our most eminent patrons and then he mentioned lothairs name  lady corisande looked agitated  not for himself said mr ruby  lady corisande seemed relieved  it is a present to a young ladymiss arundel  lady corisande changed color and turning away walked toward a case of works of art which was in the centre of the shop and appeared to be engrossed in their examination    chapter 87   a day or two after this adventure of the crucifix lothair met bertram who said to him bytheby if you want to see my people before they leave town you must call at once  you do not mean that replied lothair much surprised why the duchess told me only three or four days ago that they should not leave town until the end of the first week of august they are going to the weddings  i do not know what my mother said to you my dear fellow but they go to brentham the day after tomorrow and will not return the duchess has been for a long time wishing this but corisande would stay she thought they would only bother themselves about my affairs and there was more distraction for them in town but now they are going and it is for corisande they go she is not well and they have suddenly resolved to depart  well i am very sorry to hear it said lothair i shall call at crecy house do you think they will see me  certain  and what are your plans  i have none said bertram i suppose i must not leave my father alone at this moment he has behaved well very kindly indeed i have nothing to complain of but still all is vague and i feel somehow or other i ought to be about him  have you heard from our dear friends abroad  yes said bertram with a sigh euphrosyne writes to me but i believe st aldegonde knows more about their views and plans than i do he and mr phoebus correspond much i wish to heaven they were here or rather that we were with them he added with another sigh how happy we all were at jerusalem how i hate london and brentham worse i shall have to go to a lot of agricultural dinners and all sorts of things the duke expects it and i am bound now to do every thing to please him what do you think of doing  i neither know nor care said lothair in a tone of great despondency  you are a little hipped  not a little i suppose it is the excitement of the last two years that has spoiled me for ordinary life but i find the whole thing utterly intolerable and regret now that i did not rejoin the staff of the general i shall never have such a chance again it was a mistake but one is born to blunder  lothair called at crecy house the hallporter was not sure whether the duchess was at home and the groom of the chambers went to see lothair had never experienced this form when the groom of the chambers came down again he gave her graces compliments but she had a headache and was obliged to lie down and was sorry she could not see lothair who went away livid  crecy house was only yards from st jamess square and lothair repaired to an accustomed haunt he was not in a humor for society and yet he required sympathy there were some painful associations with the st jerome family and yet they had many charms and the painful associations had been greatly removed by their easy and cordial reception of him and the charms had been renewed and increased by subsequent intercourse after all they were the only people who had always been kind to him and if they had erred in a great particular they had been animated by pure and even sacred motives and had they erred were not his present feelings of something approaching to desolation a fresh proof that the spirit of man can alone be sustained by higher relations than merely human ones so he knocked at the door and lady st jerome was at home she had not a headache there were no mysterious whisperings between hallporters and grooms of the chamber to ascertain whether he was one of the initiated whether it were london or vauxe the eyes of the household proved that he was ever a welcome and cherished guest  lady st jerome was alone and rose from her writingtable to receive him and thenfor she was a lady who never lost a momentshe resumed some work did not interfere with their conversation her talking resources were so happy and inexhaustible that it signified little that her visitor who was bound in that character to have something to say was silent and moody  my lord she continued has taken the palazzo agostini for a term i think we should always pass our winters at rome under any circumstances butthe cardinal has spoken to you about the great eventif that comes off of which between ourselves whatever the world may say i believe there is no sort of doubt we should not think of being absent from rome for a day during the council  why it may last years said lothair there is no reason why it should not last the council of trent it has in reality much more to do  we do things quicker now said lady st jerome  that depends on what there is to do to revive faith is more difficult than to create it  there will be no difficulty when the church has assembled said lady st jerome this sight of the universal fathers coming from the uttermost ends of the earth to bear witness to the truth will at once sweep away all the vain words and vainer thoughts of this unhappy century it will be what they call a great fact dear lothair and when the holy spirit descends upon their decrees my firm belief is the whole world will rise as it were from a trance and kneel before the divine tomb of st peter  well we shall see said lothair  the cardinal wishes you very much to attend the council he wishes you to attend it as an anglican representing with a few others our laity he says it would have the very best effect for religion  he spoke to me  and you agreed to go  i have not refused him if i thought i could do any good i am not sure i would not go said lothair but from what i have seen of the roman court there is little hope of reconciling our differences rome is stubborn now look at the difficulty they make about the marriage of a protestant and one of their own communion it to cruel and i think on their part unwise  the sacrament of marriage is of ineffable holiness said lady st jerome  i do not wish to deny that said lothair but i see no reason why i should not marry a roman catholic if i liked without the roman church interfering and entirely regulating my house and home  i wish you would speak to father coleman about this said lady st jerome  i have had much talk with father coleman about many things in my time said lothair but not about this bytheby have you any news of the monsignore  he is in ireland arranging about the oecumenical council they do not understand these matters there as well as we do in england and his holiness by the cardinals advice has sent the monsignore to put things right  all the father colemans in the world cannot alter the state of affairs about mixed marriages said lothair they can explain but they cannot alter i want change in this matter and rome never changes  it is impossible for the church to change said lady st jerome because it is truth  is miss arundel at home said lothair  i believe so said lady st jerome  i never see her now he said discontentedly she never goes to balls and she never rides except occasionally under this roof she is invisible  clare does not go any longer into society said lady st jerome  why  well it is a secret said lady st jerome with some disturbance of countenance and speaking in a lower tone at least at present and yet i can hardly on such a subject wish that there should be a secret from youclare is about to take the veil  then i have not a friend left in the world said lothair in a despairing tone  lady st jerome looked at him with an anxious glance yes she continued i do not wish to conceal it from you that for a time we could have wished it otherwiseit has been it is a trying event for my lord and myselfbut the predisposition which was always strong has ended in a determination so absolute that we recognize the divine purpose in her decision and we bow to it  i do not bow to it said lothair i think it barbarous and unwise  hush hush dear friend  and does the cardinal approve of this step  entirely  then my confidence in him is entirely destroyed said lothair    chapter 88   it was august and town was thinning fast parliament still lingered but only for technical purposes the political struggle of the session having terminated at the end of july one social event was yet to be consummatedthe marriages of lothairs cousins they were to be married on the same day at the same time and in the same place westminster abbey was to be the scene and as it was understood that the service was to be choral great expectations of ecclesiastical splendor and effect were much anticipated by the fair sex they were however doomed to disappointment for although the day was fine the attendance numerous and brilliant beyond precedent lord culloden would have no popery lord carisbrooke who was a ritualist murmured and was encouraged in his resistance by lady clanmorne and a party but as the duke of brecon was high and dry there was a want of united action and lord culloden had his way  after the ceremony the world repaired to the mansion of lord culloden in belgrave square to inspect the presents and to partake of a dinner called a breakfast cousin lothair wandered about the rooms and had the satisfaction of seeing a bracelet with a rare and splendid sapphire which he had given to lady flora and a circlet of diamond stars which he had placed on the brow of the duchess of brecon the st aldegondes were the only members of the brentham family who were present st aldegonde had a taste for marriages and public executions and lady st aldegonde wandered about with lothair and pointed out to him corisandes present to his cousins  i never was more disappointed than by your family leaving town so early this year he said  we were quite surprised  i am sorry to bear your sister is indisposed  corisande she is perfectly well  i hope the duchesss headache is better said lothair she could not receive me when i called to say farewell because she had a headache  i never knew mamma to have a headache said lady st aldegonde  i suppose you will be going to brentham  next week  and bertram too  i fancy that we shall be all there  i suppose we may consider now that the season is really over  yes they stayed for this i should not be surprised if every one in these rooms had disappeared by tomorrow  except myself said lothair  do you think of going abroad again  one might as well go said lothair as remain  i wish granville would take me to paris it seems so odd not to have seen paris all i want is to see the new streets and dine at a caf  well you have an object that is something said lothair i have none  men have always objects said lady st aldegonde they make business when they have none or it makes itself they move about and it comes  i have moved about a great deal said lothair and nothing has come to me but disappointment i think i shall take to croquet like that curious gentleman i remember at brentham  ah you remember every thing  it is not easy to forget any thing at brentham said lothair it is just two years ago that was a happy time  i doubt whether our reassembling will be quite as happy this year said lady st aldegonde in a serious tone this engagement of bertram is an anxious business i never saw papa before really fret and there are other things which are not without vexationat least to mamma  i do not think i am a great favorite of your mamma said lothair she once used to be very kind to me but she is so no longer  i am sure you mistake her said lady st aldegonde but not in a tone which indicated any confidence in her remark mamma is anxious about my brother and all that  i believe the duchess thinks that i am in some way or other connected with this embarrassment but i really had nothing to do with it though i could not refuse my testimony to the charms of the young lady and my belief she would make bertram a happy man  as for that you know granville saw a great deal more of her at least at jerusalem than you did and he has said to mamma a great deal more than you have done  yes but she thinks that had it not been for me bertram would never have known the phoebus family she could not conceal that from me and it has poisoned her mind  oh do not use such words  yes but they are true and your sister is prejudiced against me also  that i am sure she is not said lady st aldegonde quickly corisande was always your friend  well they refused to see me when we may never meet again for months perhaps for years said lothair perhaps never  what shocking things you are saying my dear lord today here lord culloden wants you to return thanks for the bridesmaids you must put on a merry face  the dreary day at last arrived and very quickly when lothair was the only person left in town when there is nobody you know in london the million that go about are only voiceless phantoms solitude in a city is a trance the motion of the silent beings with whom you have no speech or sympathy only makes the dreamlike existence more intense it is not so in the country the voices of nature are abundant and from the hum of insects to the fall of the avalanche something is always talking to you  lothair shrank from the streets he could not endure the dreary glare of st jamess and the desert sheen of pall mall he could mount his horse in the park and soon lose himself in suburban roads that he once loved yes it was irresistible and he made a visit to belmont the house was dismantled and the gardens shorn of their lustre but still it was there very fair in the sunshine and sanctified in his heart he visited every room that he had frequented and lingered in her boudoir he did not forget the now empty pavilion and he plucked some flowers that she once loved and pressed them to his lips and placed them near his heart he felt now what it was that made him unhappy it was the want of sympathy  he walked through the park to the residence of mr phoebus where he had directed his groom to meet him his heart beat as he wandered along and his eye was dim with tears what characters and what scenes had he not become acquainted with since his first visit to belmont and even now when they had departed or were absent what influence were they not exercising over his life and the life of those most intimate with him had it not been for his pledge to theodora it was far from improbable that he would now have been a member of the roman catholic church and all his hopes at brentham and his intimacy with the family on which he had most reckoned in life for permanent friendship and support seemed to be marred and blighted by the witching eyes of that mirthful euphrosyne whose mocking words on the moonlit terrace at belmont first attracted his notice to her and then by association of ideas he thought of the general and what his old commander had said at their last interview reminding him of his fine castle and expressing his conviction that the lord of such a domain must have much to do  i will try to do it said lothair and will go down to muriel tomorrow    chapter 89   lothair who was very sensible to the charms of nature found at first relief in the beauties of muriel the season was propitious to the scene august is a rich and leafy month and the glades and avenues and stately trees of his parks and pleasaunces seemed at the same time to soothe and gladden his perturbed spirit muriel was still new to him and there was much to examine and explore for the first time he found a consolation also in the frequent remembrance that these scenes had been known to those whom he loved often in the chamber and often in the bower their forms arose sometimes their voices lingered in his ear a frolic laugh or whispered words of kindness and enjoyment such a place as muriel should always be so peopled but that is impossible one cannot always have the most agreeable people in the world assembled under ones roof and yet the alternative should not be the loneliness he now experienced the analytical lothair resolved that there was no happiness without sympathy  the most trying time were the evenings a man likes to be alone in the morning he writes his letters and reads the newspapers attempts to examine his stewards accounts and if he wants society can gossip with his studgroom but a solitary evening in the country is gloomy however brilliant the accessories as mr phoebus was not present lothair violated the prime principles of a firstclass aryan education and ventured to read a little it is difficult to decide which is the most valuable companion to a country eremite at his nightly studies the volume that keeps him awake or the one that sets him aslumbering  at the end of a week lothair had some good sport on his moorsand this reminded him of the excellent campian who had received and answered his letter the colonel however held out but a faint prospect of returning at present to europe though whenever he did he promised to be the guest of lothair lothair asked some of his neighbors to dinner and he made two large parties to slaughter his grouse they were grateful and he was popular but we have not an idea in common thought lothair as wearied and uninterested he bade his last guest his last goodnight then lothair paid a visit to the lordlieutenant and stayed two nights at agramont castle here he met many county notables and great was the company of the preachers but the talk was local or ecclesiastical and after the highspiced condiments of the conversation to which he was accustomed the present discourse was insipid even to nausea he sought some relief in the society of lady ida alice but she blushed when she spoke to him and tittered when he replied to her and at last he found refuge in pretty mrs ardenne who concluded by asking him for his photograph  on the morrow of his return to muriel the servant bringing in his letters he seized one in the handwriting of bertram and discarding the rest devoured the communication of his friend which was eventful  it seems that the phoebus family had returned to england and were at brentham and had been there a week the family were delighted with them and euphrosyne was an especial favorite but this was not all it seems that mr cantacuzene had been down to brentham and stayed which he never did anywhere a couple of days and the duke was particularly charmed with mr cantacuzene this gentleman who was only in the earlier term of middle age and looked younger than his age was distinguished in appearance highly polished and singularly acute he appeared to be the master of great wealth for he offered to make upon euphrosyne any settlement which the duke desired he had no son and did not wish his sonsinlaw to be sighing for his death he wished his daughters therefore to enjoy the bulk of their inheritances in his lifetime he told the duke that he had placed one hundred thousand pounds in the names of trustees on the marriage of madame phoebus to accumulate and when the genius and vanity of her husband are both exhausted though i believe they are inexhaustible remarked mr cantacuzene it will be a nestsegg for them to fall back upon and at least save them from penury the duke had no doubt that mr cantacuzene was of imperial lineage but the latter portion of the letter was the most deeply interesting to lothair bertram wrote that his mother had just observed that she thought the phoebus family would like to meet lothair and begged bertram to invite him to brentham the letter ended by an urgent request that if disengaged he should arrive immediately  mr phoebus highly approved of brentham all was art and art of a high character he knew no residence with an aspect so thoroughly aryan though it was really a family party the house was quite full at least as bertram said to lothair on his arrival there is only room for youand you are in your old quarters  that is exactly what i wished said lothair  he had to escort the duchess to dinner her manner was of old days i thought you would like to meet your friends she said  it gives me much pleasure but much more to find myself at brentham  there seems every prospect of bertram being happy we are enchanted with the young lady you know her i believe well the duke is highly pleased with her father mr cantacuzenehe says one of the most sensible men he ever met and a thorough gentleman which he may well be for i believe there is no doubt he is of the highest descentemperors they say princes even now i wish you could have met him but he would only stay eightandforty hours i understand his affairs are vast  i have always heard a considerable person quite the head of the greek community in this countryindeed in europe generally  i see by the morning papers that miss arundel has taken the veil  i missed my papers today said lothair a little agitated but i have long been aware of her intention of doing so  lady st jerome will miss her very much she was quite the soul of the house  it must be a great and painful sacrifice said lothair but i believe long meditated i remember when i was at vauxe nearly two years ago that i was told this was to be her fate she was quite determined on it  i saw the beautiful crucifix you gave her at mr rubys  it was an homage to her for her great goodness to me when i was ill at romeand it was difficult to find any thing that would please or suit her i fixed on the crucifix because it permitted me to transfer to it the earth of the holy places which were included in the crucifix that was given to me by the monks of the holy sepulchre when i made my pilgrimage to jerusalem  in the evening st aldegonde insisted on their dancing and he engaged himself to madame phoebus bertram and euphrosyne seemed never separated lothair was successful in inducing lady corisande to be his partner  do you remember your first ball at crecy house asked lothair you are not nervous now  i would hardly say that said lady corisande though i try not to show it  it was the first ball for both of us said lothair i have not danced so much in the interval as you have do you know i was thinking just now i have danced oftener with you than with any one else  are not you glad about bertrams affair ending so well  very he will be a happy man every body is happy i think except myself  in the course of the evening lady st aldegonde on the arm of lord montairy stopped for a moment as she passed lothair and said do you remember our conversation at lord cullodens breakfast who was right about mamma  they passed their long summer days in rambling and riding and in wondrous new games which they played in the hall the striking feature however were the matches at battledore and shuttlecock between madame phoebus and lord st aldegonde in which the skill and energy displayed were supernatural and led to betting the evenings were always gay sometimes they danced more or less they always had some delicious singing and mr phoebus arranged some tableaux most successfully  all this time lothair hung much about lady corisande he was by her side in the ridingparties always very near her when they walked and sometimes he managed unconsciously to detach her from the main party and they almost walked alone if he could not sit by her at dinner he joined her immediately afterward and whether it were a dance a tableau or a new game somehow or other he seemed always to be her companion  it was about a week after the arrival of lothair and they were at breakfast at brentham in that bright room full of little round tables which lothair always admired looking as it did upon a garden of many colors  how i hate modern gardens said st aldegonde what a horrid thing this is one might as well have a mosaic pavement there give me cabbageroses sweetpeas and wallflowers that is my idea of a garden corisandes garden is the only sensible thing of the sort  one likes a mosaic pavement to look like a garden said euphrosyne but not a garden like a mosaic pavement  the worst of these mosaic beds said madame phoebus is you can never get a nosegay and if it were not for the kitchengarden we should be destitute of that gayest and sweetest of creations  corisandes garden is since your first visit to brentham said the duchess to lothair no flowers are admitted that have not perfume it is very oldfashioned you must get her to show it you  it was agreed that after breakfast they should go and see corisandes garden and a party did goall the phoebus family and lord and lady st aldegonde and lady corisande and bertram and lothair  in the pleasuregrounds of brentham were the remains of an ancient garden of the ancient house that had long ago been pulled down when the modern pleasuregrounds were planned and created notwithstanding the protests of the artists in landscape the father of the present duke would not allow this ancient garden to be entirely destroyed and you came upon its quaint appearance in the dissimilar world in which it was placed as you might in some festival of romantic costume upon a person habited in the courtly dress of the last century it was formed upon a gentle southern slope with turfen terraces walled in on three sides the fourth consisting of arches of golden yew the duke had given this garden to lady corisande in order that she might practise her theory that flowergardens should be sweet and luxuriant and not hard and scentless imitations of works of art here in their season flourished abundantly all those productions of nature which are now banished from our once delighted senses huge bushes of honeysuckle and bowers of sweetpea and sweetbrier and jessamine clustering over the walls and gillyflowers scenting with their sweet breath the ancient bricks from which they seemed to spring there were banks of violets which the southern breeze always stirred and mignonette filled every vacant nook as they entered now it seemed a blaze of roses and carnations though one recognized in a moment the presence of the lily the heliotrope and the stock some white peacocks were basking on the southern wall and one of them as their visitors entered moved and displayed its plumage with scornful pride the bees were busy in the air but their homes were near and you might watch them laboring in their glassy hives  now is not corisande quite right said lord st aldegonde as he presented madame phoebus with a garland of woodbine with which she said she would dress her head at dinner all agreed with him and bertram and euphrosyne adorned each other with carnations and mr phoebus placed a flower on the uncovered head of lady st aldegonde according to the principles of high art and they sauntered and rambled in the sweet and sunny air amid a blaze of butterflies and the ceaseless hum of bees  bertram and euphrosyne had disappeared and the rest were lingering about the hives while mr phoebus gave them a lecture on the apiary and its marvellous life the bees understood mr phoebus at least he said so and thus his friends had considerable advantage in this lesson in entomology lady corisande and lothair were in a distant corner of the garden and she was explaining to him her plans what she had done and what she meant to do  i wish i had a garden like this at muriel said lothair  you could easily make one  if you helped me  i have told you all my plans said lady corisande  yes but i was thinking of something else when you spoke said lothair  that was not very complimentary  i do not wish to be complimentary said lothair if compliments mean less than they declare i was not thinking of your garden but of you  where can they have all gone said lady corisande looking round we must find them  and leave this garden said lothair and i without a flower the only one without a flower i am afraid that is significant of my lot  you shall choose a rose said lady corisande  nay the charm is that it should be your choice  but choosing the rose lost more times and when corisande and lothair reached the arches of golden yew there were no friends in sight  i think i hear sounds this way said lothair and he led his companion farther from home  i see no one said lady corisande distressed and when they had advanced a little way  we are sure to find them in good time said lothair besides i wanted to speak to you about the garden at muriel i wanted to induce you to go there and help me to make it yes he added after some hesitation on this spoti believe on this very spoti asked the permission of your mother two years ago to express to you my love she thought me a boy and she treated me as a boy she said i knew nothing of the world and both our characters were unformed i know the world now i have committed many mistakes doubtless many follieshave formed many opinions and have changed many opinions but to one i have been constant in one i am unchangedand that is my adoring love to you  she turned pale she stopped then gently taking his arm she hid her face in his breast  he soothed and sustained her agitated frame and sealed with an embrace her speechless form then with soft thoughts and softer words clinging to him he induced her to resume their stroll which both of them now wished might assuredly be undisturbed they had arrived at the limit of the pleasuregrounds and they wandered into the park and its most sequestered parts all this time lothair spoke much and gave her the history of his life since he first visited her home lady corisande said little but when she was more composed she told him that from the first her heart had been his but every thing seemed to go against her hopes perhaps at last to please her parents she would have married the duke of brecon had not lothair returned and what he had said to her that morning at crecy house had decided her resolution whatever might be her lot to unite it to no one else but him but then came the adventure of the crucifix and she thought all was over for her and she quitted town in despair  let us rest here for a while said lothair under the shade of this oak and lady corisande reclined against its mighty trunk and lothair threw himself at her feet he had a great deal still to tell her and among other things the story of the pearls which he had wished to give to theodora  she was after all your good genius said lady corisande i always liked her  well now said lothair that case has never been opened the year has elapsed but i would not open it for i had always a wild wish that the person who opened it should be yourself see here it is and he gave her the case  we will not break the seal said corisande let us respect it for her sakeroma she said examining it and then they opened the case there was the slip of paper which theodora at the time had placed upon the pearls and on which she had written some unseen words they were read now and ran thus  the offering of theodora to lothairs bride  let me place them on you now said lothair  i will wear them as your chains said corisande  the sun began to tell them that some hours had elapsed since they quitted brentham house at last a soft hand which lothair retained gave him a slight pressure and a sweet voice whispered dearest i think we ought to return  and they returned almost in silence they rather calculated that taking advantage of the luncheonhour corisande might escape to her room but they were a little too late luncheon was over and they met the duchess and a large party on the terrace  what has become of you my good people said her grace bells have been ringing for you in every direction where can you have been  i have been in corisandes garden said lothair and she has given me a rose
