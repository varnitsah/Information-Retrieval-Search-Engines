92909089	deep waters  by ww jacobs     sams ghost  yes i know said the nightwatchman thoughtfully as he sat with a cold pipe in his mouth gazing across the river  ive eard it afore  people tell me they dont believe in ghosts and make a laugh of em and all i say is let them take on a nightwatchmans job  let em sit ere all alone of a night with the water lapping against the posts and the wind moaning in the corners especially if a pal of theirs has slipped overboard and there is little nasty bills stuck up just outside in the high street offering a reward for the body  twice men ave fallen overboard from this jetty and ive ad to stand my watch here the same night and not a farthing more for it  one of the worst and artfullest ghosts i ever ad anything to do with was sam bullet  he was a waterman at the stairs near by ere the sort o man that ud get you to pay for drinks and drink yours up by mistake arter he ad finished his own  the sort of man that ad always left his baccybox at ome but always ad a big pipe in is pocket  he fell overboard off of a lighter one evening and all that his mates could save was is cap  it was ony two nights afore that he ad knocked down an old man and bit a policemans little finger to the bone so that as they pointed out to the widder praps he was taken for a wise purpose  praps he was appier where he was than doing six months  he was the sort o chap thatll make himself appy anywhere ses one of em comfortinglike  not without me ses mrs bullet sobbing and wiping her eyes on something she used for a pockethankercher  he never could bear to be away from me  was there no last words  ony one ses one o the chaps joe peel by name  as e fell overboard ses the other  mrs bullet began to cry agin and say wot a good usband he ad been seventeen years come michaelmas she ses and never a cross word nothing was too good for me  nothing  i ad only to ask to ave  well hes gorn now ses joe and we thought we ought to come round and tell you  so as you can tell the police ses the other chap  that was ow i came to hear of it fust a policeman told me that night as i stood outside the gate aving a quiet pipe  he wasnt shedding tears his only idea was that sam ad got off too easy  well well i ses trying to pacify im he wont bite no more fingers theres no policemen where hes gorn to  he went off grumbling and telling me to be careful and i put my pipe out and walked up and down the wharf thinking  ony a month afore i ad lent sam fifteen shillings on a gold watch and chain wot he said an uncle ad left im  i wasnt wearing it because e said is uncle wouldnt like it but i ad it in my pocket and i took it out under one of the lamps and wondered wot i ought to do  my fust idea was to take it to mrs bullet and then all of a sudden the thought struck me suppose he adnt come by it honest  i walked up and down agin thinking  if he adnt and it was found out it would blacken his good name and break is pore wifes art  thats the way i looked at it and for his sake and er sake i determined to stick to it  i felt appier in my mind when i ad decided on that and i went round to the bears head and ad a pint  arter that i ad another and then i come back to the wharf and put the watch and chain on and went on with my work  every time i looked down at the chain on my waistcoat it reminded me of sam  i looked on to the river and thought of im going down on the ebb then i got a sort o lonesome feeling standing on the end of the jetty all alone and i went back to the bears head and ad another pint  they didnt find the body and i was amost forgetting about sam when one evening as i was sitting on a box waiting to get my breath back to ave another go at sweeping joe peel sams mate came on to the wharf to see me  he came in a mysterious sort o way that i didnt like looking beind im as though he was afraid of being follered and speaking in a whisper as if e was afraid of being heard  he wasnt a man i liked and i was glad that the watch and chain was stowed safe away in my trowsispocket  ive ad a shock watchman he ses  oh i ses  a shock wots shook me all up he ses working up a shiver  ive seen something wot i thought people never could see and wot i never want to see agin  ive seen sam  i thought a bit afore i spoke  why i thought he was drownded i ses  so e is ses joe  when i say ive seen im i mean that i ave seen his ghost  he began to shiver agin all over  wot was it like  i ses very calm  like sam he ses rather short  when was it i ses  last night at a quarter to twelve he ses  it was standing at my front door waiting for me  and ave you been shivering like that ever since i ses  worse than that ses joe looking at me very ard  its wearing off now  the ghost gave me a message for you  i put my and in my trowsispocket and looked at im  then i walked very slow towards the gate  it gave me a message for you ses joe walking beside me  we was always pals joe it ses you and me and i want you to pay up fifteen bob for me wot i borrowed off of bill the watchman  i cant rest until its paid it ses  so heres the fifteen bob watchman  he put his and in is pocket and takes out fifteen bob and olds it out to me  no no i ses  i cant take your money joe peel  it wouldnt be right  pore sam is welcome to the fifteen bobi dont want it  you must take it ses joe  the ghost said if you didnt it would come to me agin and agin till you did and i cant stand any more of it  i cant elp your troubles i ses  you must ses joe  give bill the fifteen bob it ses and hell give you a gold watch and chain wot i gave im to mind till it was paid  i see his little game then  gold watch and chain i ses laughing you must ha misunderstood it joe  i understood it right enough ses joe getting a bit closer to me as i stepped outside the gate  heres your fifteen bob are you going to give me that watch and chain  sartainly not i ses  i dont know wot you mean by a watch and chain if i ad it and i gave it to anybody i should give it to sams widder not to you  its nothing to do with er ses joe very quick  sam was most pertikler about that  i expect you dreamt it all i ses  where would pore sam get a gold watch and chain from  and why should e go to you about it  why didnt e come to me  if e thinks i ave got it let im come to me  all right ill go to the policestation ses joe  ill come with you i ses  but eres a policeman coming along lets go to im  i moved towards im but joe hung back and arter using one or two words that would ha made any ghost ashamed to know im he sheered off  i ad a word or two with the policeman about the weather and then i went inside and locked the gate  my idea was that sam ad told joe about the watch and chain afore he fell overboard  joe was a nasty customer and i could see that i should ave to be a bit careful  some men might ha told the police about itbut i never cared much for them  theyre like kids in a way always asking questionsmost of which you cant answer  it was a little bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night  i dont deny it  twice i thought i eard something coming up on tiptoe behind me  the second time i was so nervous that i began to sing to keep my spirits up and i went on singing till three of the hands of the susan emily wot was lying alongside came up from the focsle and offered to fight me  i was thankful when daylight came  five nights arterwards i ad the shock of my life  it was the fust night for some time that there was no craft up  a dark night and a nasty moaning sort of a wind  i ad just lighted the lamp at the corner of the warehouse wot ad blown out and was sitting down to rest afore putting the ladder away when i appened to look along the jetty and saw a head coming up over the edge of it  in the light of the lamp i saw the dead white face of sam bullets ghost making faces at me  illustration in the light of the lamp i saw the dead white face  i just caught my breath sharp like and then turned and ran for the gate like a racehorse  i ad left the key in the padlock in case of anything happening and i just gave it one turn flung the wicket open and slammed it in the ghosts face and tumbled out into the road  i ran slap into the arms of a young policeman wot was passing  nasty shorttempered chap he was but i dont think i was more glad to see anybody in my life  i hugged im till e nearly lost is breath and then he sat me down on the kerbstone and asked me wot i meant by it  wot with the excitement and the running i couldnt speak at fust and when i did he said i was trying to deceive im  there aint no such thing as ghosts he ses youve been drinking  it came up out o the river and run arter me like the wind i ses  why didnt it catch you then he ses looking me up and down and all round about  talk sense  he went up to the gate and peeped in and arter watching a moment stepped inside and walked down the wharf with me follering  it was my dooty besides i didnt like being left all alone by myself  twice we walked up and down and all over the wharf  he flashed his lantern into all the dark corners into empty barrels and boxes and then he turned and flashed it right into my face and shook his ead at me  youve been having a bit of a lark with me he ses and for two pins id take you  mind if you say a word about this to anybody i will  he stalked off with his ead in the air and left me all alone in charge of a wharf with a ghost on it  i stayed outside in the street of course but every now and then i fancied i heard something moving about the other side of the gate and once it was so distinct that i run along to the bears head and knocked em up and asked them for a little brandy for illness  i didnt get it of course i didnt expect to but i ad a little conversation with the landlord from is bedroomwinder that did me more good than the brandy would ha done  once or twice i thought he would ave fallen out and many a man has ad his licence taken away for less than a quarter of wot e said to me that night  arter he thought he ad finished and was going back to bed agin i pointed out to im that he adnt kissed me good night and if it adnt ha been for is missis and two grownup daughters and the potman i believe hed ha talked to me till daylight  ow i got through the rest of the night i dont know  it seemed to be twenty nights instead of one but the day came at last and when the hands came on at six oclock they found the gate open and me on dooty same as usual  i slept like a tired child when i got ome and arter a steak and onions for dinner i sat down and lit my pipe and tried to think wot was to be done  one thing i was quite certain about i wasnt going to spend another night on that wharf alone  i went out arter a bit as far as the clarendon arms for a breath of fresh air and i ad just finished a pint and was wondering whether i ought to ave another when ted dennis came in and my mind was made up he ad been in the army all is life and so far he ad never seen anything that ad frightened im  ive seen him myself take on men twice is size just for the love of the thing and arter knocking them silly stand em a pint out of is own pocket  when i asked im whether he was afraid of ghosts he laughed so ard that the landlord came from the other end of the bar to see wot was the matter  i stood ted a pint and arter he ad finished it i told im just how things was  i didnt say anything about the watch and chain because there was no need to and when we came outside agin i ad engaged an assistantwatchman for ninepence a night  all youve got to do i ses is to keep me company  you neednt turn up till eight oclock of a night and you can leave arf an hour afore me in the morning  righto ses ted  and if i see the ghost ill make it wish it ad never been born  it was a load off my mind and i went ome and ate a tea that made my missis talk about the workouse and orstritches in uman shape wot would eat a woman out of ouse and ome if she would let em  i got to the wharf just as it was striking six and at a quarter to seven the wicket was pushed open gentle and the ugly ead of mr joe peel was shoved inside  hullo i ses  wot do you want  i want to save your life he ses in a solemn voice  you was within a inch of death last night watchman  oh i ses carelesslike  ow do you know  the ghost o sam bullet told me ses joe  arter it ad chased you up the wharf screaming for elp it came round and told me all about it  it seems fond of you i ses  i wonder why  it was in a terrible temper ses joe and its face was awful to look at  tell the watchman it ses that if he dont give you the watch and chain i shall appear to im agin and kill im  all right i ses looking behind me to where three of the ands of the daisy was sitting on the focsle smoking  ive got plenty of company tonight  company wont save you ses joe  for the last time are you going to give me that watch and chain or not  heres your fifteen bob  no i ses even if i ad got it i shouldnt give it to you and its no use giving it to the ghost because being made of air he asnt got anywhere to put it  very good ses joe giving me a black look  ive done all i can to save you but if you wont listen to sense you wont  youll see sam bullet agin and youll not ony lose the watch and chain but your life as well  all right i ses and thank you kindly but ive got an assistant as it appensa man wot wants to see a ghost  an assistant ses joe staring  an old soldier i ses  a man wot likes trouble and danger  his idea is to shoot the ghost and see wot appens  shoot ses joe  shoot a pore armless ghost  does he want to be ung  aint it enough for a pore man to be drownded but wot you must try and shoot im arterwards  why you ought to be ashamed o yourself wheres your art  it wont be shot if it dont come on my wharf i ses  though i dont mind if it does when ive got somebody with me  i aint afraid of anything living and i dont mind ghosts when theres two of us  besides which the noise of the pistol ll wake up arf the river  you take care you dont get woke up ses joe ardly able to speak for temper  he went off stamping and grinding is teeth and at eight oclock to the minute ted dennis turned up with is pistol and helped me take care of the wharf  happy as a skylark e was and to see him iding behind a barrel with his pistol ready waiting for the ghost amost made me forget the expense of it all  it never came near us that night and ted was a bit disappointed next morning as he took is ninepence and went off  next night was the same and the next and then ted gave up hiding on the wharf for it and sat and snoozed in the office instead  a week went by and then another and still there was no sign of sam bullets ghost or joe peel and every morning i ad to try and work up a smile as i shelled out ninepence for ted  it nearly ruined me and worse than that i couldnt explain why i was short to the missis  fust of all she asked me wot i was spending it on then she asked me who i was spending it on  it nearly broke up my omeshe did smash one kitchen chair and a vase off the parlour mantelpiecebut i wouldnt tell er and then led away by some men on strike at smiths wharf ted went on strike for a bob a night  that was arter he ad been with me for three weeks and when saturday came of course i was more short than ever and people came and stood at their doors all the way down our street to listen to the missis taking my character away  i stood it as long as i could and then when er back was turned for arf a moment i slipped out  while shed been talking id been thinking and it came to me clear as daylight that there was no need for me to sacrifice myself any longer looking arter a dead mans watch and chain  i didnt know exactly where joe peel lived but i knew the part and arter peeping into seven publicouses i see the man i wanted sitting by imself in a little bar  i walked in quietlike and sat down opposite im  morning i ses  joe peel grunted  ave one with me i ses  he grunted agin but not quite so fierce and i fetched the two pints from the counter and took a seat alongside of im  ive been looking for you i ses  oh he ses looking me up and down and all over  well youve found me now  i want to talk to you about the ghost of pore sam bullet i ses  joe peel put is mug down sudden and looked at me fierce  look ere dont you come and try to be funny with me he ses  cos i wont ave it  i dont want to be funny i ses  wot i want to know is are you in the same mind about that watch and chain as you was the other day  he didnt seem to be able to speak at fust but arter a time e gives a gasp  woes the game  he ses  wot i want to know is if i give you that watch and chain for fifteen bob will that keep the ghost from anging round my wharf agin  i ses  why o course he ses staring but you aint been seeing it agin ave you  ive not and i dont want to i ses  if it wants you to ave the watch and chain give me the fifteen bob and its yours  he looked at me for a moment as if he couldnt believe is eyesight and then e puts his and into is trowsispocket and pulls out one shilling and fourpence arf a claypipe and a bit o leadpencil  thats all ive got with me he ses  ill owe you the rest  you ought to ha took the fifteen bob when i ad it  there was no elp for it and arter making im swear to give me the rest o the money when e got it and that i shouldnt see the ghost agin i anded the things over to im and came away  he came to the door to see me off and if ever a man looked puzzled e did  pleased at the same time  it was a load off of my mind  my conscience told me id done right and arter sending a little boy with a note to ted dennis to tell im not to come any more i felt appier than i ad done for a long time  when i got to the wharf that evening it seemed like a diffrent place and i was whistling and smiling over my work quite in my old way when the young policeman passed  hullo   he ses  ave you seen the ghost agin  i ave not i ses drawing myself up ave you  no he ses  we missed it  missed it i ses staring at im  yes he ses nodding  the day arter you came out screaming and cuddling me like a frightened baby it shipped as ab on the barque ocean king for valparaiso  we missed it by a few hours  next time you see a ghost knock it down fust and go and cuddle the police arterwards
