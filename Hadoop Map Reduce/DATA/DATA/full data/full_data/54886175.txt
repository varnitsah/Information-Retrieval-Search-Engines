part 2  key for dissection sheets and abbreviations       introduction  in the year 1884 i was invited to give tuition by correspondence in biology although disposed at the time to ridicule the idea of imparting instruction in natural science by letter i gladly accepted the opportunity thus afforded me of ascertaining for myself what could and could not be accomplished in that direction anyone familiar with the scope of biological enquiry and the methods of biological instruction will not need to be reminded that it is only by the most rigorous employment of precise directions for observation that any good results are to be looked for at the hand of the elementary student true to this principle i determined to issue to my correspondence pupils rigid instructions and to demand in return faithful annotated drawings of facts observed in their usage in the case of two among the few students who passed through my hands the result far exceeded my most sanguine anticipations the notes sent in by one of them a man working at a distance alone and unaided far excelled those wrung from many a student placed under the most favourable surroundings and their promise for the future has been fulfilled to the utmost the individual in question being now a recognised investigator it thus became clear that notwithstanding the complex conditions of work in the biological field tuition by correspondence would suffice to awaken the latent abilities of a naturally qualified enquirer the average members of a university correspondence class will be found neither better nor worse than those of any other and they may therefore pass unnoticed if however the correspondence system of tuition may furnish the means of arousing a latent aptitude when the possibilities of other methods of approach are excluded and in so doing of elevating the individual to that position for which he was by nature qualified ensuring him the introduction to the one sphere of labour for which he was born it will have created its own defence and have merited the confidence of all rightthinking people the plucking of one such brand from the burning is ample compensation for the energy expended on any number of average dullards who but require to be left alone to find their natural level  mr wells little book is avowedly written for examination purposes and in conformity with the requirements of the now familiar type system of teaching recent attempts have been made to depreciate this while affording a discipline in detailed observation and manipulation second to that of no other branch of learning it provides for that deduction and verification by which all science has been built up and this appears to me ample justification for its retention as the most rational system which can be today adopted evidence that its alleged shortcomings are due rather to defective handling than to any inherent weakness of its own would not be difficult to produce although rigid in its discipline it admits of commentatorial treatment which while heightening the interest of the student is calculated to stimulate alike his ambition and his imagination that the sister sciences of botany and zoology fall under one discipline is expressed in the english usage of the term biology experience has shown that the best work in either department has been produced by those who have acquired on allround knowledge of at least the elementary stages of both and that the advanced morphologist and physiologist are alike the better for a familiarity with the principles not to say with the progressive advancement of each others domain is today undeniable these and other allied considerations render it advisable that the elementary facts of morphology and physiology should be presented to the beginner side by side a principle too frequently neglected in books which like this one are specially written for the biological neophyte although the student is the wiser for the actual observation of the fact of nature he becomes the better only when able to apply them as for example by the judicious construction of elementary generalizations such as are introduced into the pages of this work so long as these generalizations regarded as first attempts to deduce laws in the form of generalized statement of facts based observation are properly introduced into an elementary textbook intended for the isolated worker cut off from the lecture room their intercalation is both healthy and desirable  mr wells has kept these precepts constantly in mind in the preparation of his work and in the formulation of his plans for its future extension thereby enhancing the value of the book itself and at the same time discouraging the system of pure cram which is alien to the discipline of biological science  g b howes royal college of science south kensington november 30 1892    preface  no method of studying more especially when the objects of study are tangible things can rival that prosecuted under the direction and in the constant presence of a teacher who has also a living and vivid knowledge of the matter which he handles with the student in the ideal world there is a plentiful supply of such teachers and easy access to their teaching but in this real world only a favoured few enjoy these advantages through causes that cannot be discussed here a vast number of solitary workers are scattered through the country to whom sustained help in this form is impossible or possible only in days stolen from a needed vacation and to such students especially does this book appeal as well as to those more fortunate learners who are within reach of orderly instruction but anxious to save their teachers patience and their own time by some preliminary work  one of the most manifest disadvantages of bookwork under the conditions of the solitary worker is the rigidity of its expressions if the exact meaning is doubtful he can not ask a question this has been kept in view throughout the writer has above all sought to be explicit has saving oversights used no uncommon or technical term without a definition or a clear indication of its meaning  in this study of biology the perception and memory of form is a very important factor indeed every student should draw sketches of his dissections and accustom himself to copying book diagrams in order to train his eye to perception of details he might otherwise disregard the drawing required is within the reach of all but for those who are very inexperienced tracing figures is a useful preliminary exercise  by the time the student has read the circulation of the rabbit sections 34 to 49 he will be ready to begin dissection it is possible to hunt to death even such a sound educational maxim as the thing before the name and we are persuaded by a considerable experience that dissection before some such preparatory reading is altogether a mistake at the end of the book is a syllabus with suggestions for practical work originally drawn up by the writer for his own private use with the evening classes of the university tutorial college classes of students working mainly in their spare time for the london examination and at an enormous disadvantage as regards the number of hours available in comparison with the leisurely students of a university laboratory this syllabus may perhaps by itself serve a useful purpose in some cases but in this essential part of the study the presence of some experienced overlooker to advise warn and correct is at first almost indispensable  a few words may perhaps be said with respect to the design of this volume it is manifestly modelled upon the syllabus of the intermediate examination in science of london university that syllabus as at present constituted appears to me to afford considerable scope for fairly efficient biological study the four types dealt with in this book are extremely convenient for developing the methods of comparative anatomy and morphological embryology without any extensive reference to related organisms these four forms and especially the three vertebrata may be made to explain and illustrate one another in a way that cannot fail to be educational in the truest sense after dealing with the rabbit therefore as an organic mechanism our sections upon the frog and dogfish and upon development are simply statements of differences and a commentary as it were upon the anatomy of the mammalian type in the concluding chapter a few suggestions of the most elementary ideas of it is hoped to make this first part of our biological course complete in itself and of some real and permanent value to the student and the writer is convinced that not only is a constant insistence upon resemblances and differences and their import intellectually the most valuable but also the most interesting and therefore the easiest way of studying animal anatomy that chaotic and breathless cramming of terms misunderstood tabulated statements formulated tips and lists of names in which so many students in spite of advice waste their youth is i sincerely hope as impossible with this book as it is useless for the purposes of a london candidate on the other hand our chief endeavour has been to render the matter of the book clear connected progressive and easily assimilable in the second part plants unicellular organisms and invertebrata will be dealt with in a wider and less detailed view of the entire biological province     lines from first edition only    in this volume we study four organisms and chiefly in their    relation to each other in the next we shall study a number of    organisms largely in relation to their environment in this part    our key note is the evidence of inheritance in our second part    it will be of adaptation to circumstances  this book will speedily under the scrutiny of the critical reader reveal abundant weakness for these the author claims the full credit for whatever merit it may posses he must however acknowledge his profound indebtedness to his former teacher professor howes not only has the writer enjoyed in the past the privilege of professor howes instruction and example but he has during the preparation of this work received the readiest help advise and encouragement from him assistance as generous as it was unmerited and as unaffected as it was valuable     lines from second edition only    the publication of a second and revised edition of this part affords    the author an opportunity of expressing his sense of the general    kindliness of his reviewers and the help they have him in improving    this maiden effort to no one is there vouchsafed such a facility in    the discovery of errors in a book as to its author so soon as it has    passed beyond his power of correction hence the general tone of    encouragement and in some cases the decided approval of the    members of this termination to a period of considerable remorse and    apprehension  i have been able through their counsel and the experience i have had while using this book in teaching to correct several printers errors and to alter various ambiguous or misleading expressions as well as to bring the book up to date again in one or two particulars  my thanks are particularly due to my friend miss robbins who has very kindly redrawn the occasionally rather blottesque figures of the first edition not only have these plates gained immensely in grace and accuracy but the lettering is now distinct an improvement that any student who has had to hunt my reference letters in the first edition will at once appreciate  h g wells november 1892 first edition december 1893 second edition    the rabbit  1 external form and general considerations  section 1 it is unnecessary to enter upon a description of the appearance of this familiar type but it is not perhaps superfluous as we proceed to consider its anatomy to call attention to one or two points in its external or externally apparent structure most of our readers know that it belongs to that one of two primary animal divisions which is called the vertebrata and that the distinctive feature which place it in this division is the possession of a spinal column or backbone really a series of small ringlike bones the vertebrae figure 1 vb strung together as it were on the main nerve axis the spinal cord figure 1 sc this spinal column can be felt along the neck and back to the tail this tail is small tilted up and conspicuously white beneath and it serves as a recognition mark to guide the young when during feeding an alarm is given and a bolt is made for the burrows in those more primitive older and simplerfashioned vertebrata the fishes the tail is much large and far more important as compared with the rest of the body than it is in most of the airinhabiting vertebrates in the former it is invariably a great muscular mass to propel the body forward in the latter it may disappear as in the frog be simply a featherbearing stump as in the pigeon a fly flicker as in the cow or horse a fur cape in squirrel or be otherwise reduced and modified to meet special requirements   section 2 at the fore end or as english zoologists prefer to say anterior end of the vertebral column of the rabbit is of course the skull containing the anterior portion of the nerve axis the brain figure 1 br between the head and what is called the body in the more restricted sense of the word is the neck the neck gives freedom of movement to the head enables the animal to look this way and that to turn its ears about to determine the direction of a sound and to perform endless motions in connexion with biting and so forth easily we may note that in types which swim through the water the neck dose not appear in the fish and frog for instance and the head simply widens out as one passes back to the body the high resistance offered by water necessitates this tendency to a cigar or ship outline just as it has determined the cigar shape of the ordinary fish torpedo   section 3 in the body of the rabbit as examined from the outside we can make out by feeling two distinct regions just as we might in the body of a man anteriorily a bony cage having the ribs at the sides a rodlike bone in the front the sternum figure 1 st stm and the backbone behind and called the chest or thorax and posteriorily a part called the abdomen which has no bony protection over its belly or ventral surface these parts together with the neck constitute the trunk as a consequence of these things in the backbone of the rabbit there are four regions the neck or cervical part consisting of seven vertebrae the thoracic part of twelve joined to ribs the abdominal also called the lumbar region of seven without ribs and the tail or caudal of about fifteen between the lumbar and caudal come four vertebrae the sacral which tend to run together into a bony mass as the animal grows old and which form a firm attachment for the base of the hind limb   section 4 the thorax and abdomen are separated by a partition the diaphragm figure 1 dia this structure is distinctive of that class of the vertebrata called mammals and which includes man most of the larger and commoner land animals and whales and manatee we shall find later that it is essentially connected with the perfection of the air breathing to which this group has attained another characteristic shared by all mammals and by no other creature is the presence of hair in birds we have an equally characteristic cover in the feathers the frog is naked and the fishes we find either naked skins or scales   section 5 the short strong fore limbs are adapted to the burrowing habit and have five digits the hind limbs are very much longer and muscular enable the animal to progress rapidly by short leaps and they have four toes if the student thinks it worth while to attempt to remember the number of digits it is the fault of examiners if any value dose attach to such intrinsically valueless facts he should associate the number 54 5 in front 4 behind with the rabbit and observe that with the frog the reverse is the case   section 6 we may note here the meaning of certain terms we shall be constantly employing the head end of the rabbit is anterior the tail end posterior the backbone side of the body the upper side in life is dorsal the breast and belly side the lower side of the animal is ventral if we imagine the rabbit sawn asunder as it were by a plane passing through the head and tail that would be the median plane and parts on either side of it are lateral and left or right according as they lie to the animals left or right in a limb or in the internal organs the part nearest the central organ or axis is proximal the more remote or terminal parts are distal for instance the mouth is anteriorly placed the tongue on its ventral wall the tongue is median the eyes are lateral and the fingers are distal to the elbow the student must accustom himself to these words and avoid in his descriptions the use of such terms as above below outside which vary with the position in which we conceive the animal placed   section 7 so much for the general form we may note a few facts of general knowledge in connection with the rabbits lifeactivity in a day of the rabbits life a considerable amount of work is done the animal runs hither and thither for instance in other words a certain mass of matter is moved through space and for that we know force must be exerted whence comes the force   section 8 we find the rabbit occupies a considerable amount of its time in taking in vegetable matter consisting chiefly of more or less complex combustible and unstable organic compounds it is a pure vegetarian and a remarkably moderate drinker some but only a small proportion of the vegetable matter it eats leaves its body comparatively unchanged in little pellets the faeces in the process of defaecation for the rest we have to account   section 9 we find also that the rabbit breathes air into its lungs which is returned to the atmosphere with a lessened amount of oxygen and the addition of a perceptible amount of carbon dioxide the rabbit also throws off or excretes a fluid the urine which consists of water with a certain partially oxydised substance containing nitrogen and called urea and other less important salts the organs within the body by which the urine is separated are called the kidneys   section 10 repeating these facts in other words the rabbit takes into its body complex and unstable organic compounds containing nitrogen carbon hydrogen a certain amount of oxygen a small quantity of sulphur and still smaller amounts of other elements it also breathes in oxygen   section 11 it returns a certain rejected part of its food comparatively unchanged besides this it returns carbon dioxide and water which are completely oxydised and very simple and stable bodies and urea a less completely oxydised compound but a very simple one compared with the food constituents   section 12 now the chemist tells us that when a stable body is formed or when an unstable compound decomposes into simpler stable ones force is evolved the oxydation of carbon for instance in the fireplace is the formation of the stable compound called carbon dioxide and light and heat are evolved the explosion of dynamite again is the decomposition of an unstable compound hence we begin to perceive that force the vital force which keeps the rabbit moving is supplied by the decomposition and partial oxydation of compounds continued in its food to carbon dioxide water urea and smaller quantities of other substances   section 13 this is the roughest statement of the case possible but it will give the general idea underlying our next chapters we shall consider how the food enters the body and is taken up into the system how it is conveyed to the muscles in the limbs to the nerve centres and to wherever work is done to be there decomposed and partially oxydised and finally how the products of its activity the katastases of which the three principal are carbon dioxide water and urea are removed from the body   section 14 there are one or two comparatively modern terms that we may note here this decomposition of unstable chemical compounds releasing energy is called kataboly a reverse process which has a less conspicuous part in our first view of the animals life action by which unstable compounds are built up and energy stored is called anaboly the katastases are the products of kataboly   section 15 in an ordinary animal locomotion and other activity predominate over nutritive processes which fact we may express in the terms just given by saying that kataboly prevails over anaboly an animal as we have just explained is an apparatus for the decomposition and partial oxydation of certain compounds and these are obtained either directly or indirectly through other animals in the case of meateaters from the vegetable kingdom as the student will learn early in his botanical reading the typical plant has in its green colouring matter chlorophyll a trap to catch the radiating energy of the sun and to accomplish by the absorption of that energy the synthesis building up of those organic compounds which the animal destroys the typical plant is on whole passive and synthetic or anabolic the typical animal active and katabolic and the excess of kataboly over anaboly in the animal is compensated for by the anabolic work stored up as it were by the plant which is directly or indirectly the animals food    2 the alimentary canal of the rabbit  section 16 figure 1 represents the general anatomy of the rabbit but is especially intended to show the alimentary  food canal shortened to a certain extent and with the proportions altered in order to avoid any confusing complications it is evidently simply a coiled tube coiled for the sake of packing with occasional dilatations and with one sideshunt the caecum cae into which the food enters and is returned to the main line after probably absorbent action imperfectly understood at present a spiral fold in this culdesac bottomofsack which is marked externally by constrictions has a directive influence on the circulation of its contents the student should sketch figure 1 once or twice and make himself familiar with the order and names of the parts before proceeding we have in succession the mouth m separated from the nasal passage na above the palate the pharynx ph where the right and left nasal passages open by the posterior nares into the mouth the oesophagus oes the baglike stomach its left section 6 end being called the cardiac cdst and its right the pyloric end py the ushaped duodenum ddnm and the very long and greatly coiled ileum il the duodenum and ileum together form the small intestine and the ileum is dilated at its distal end into a thickwalled sacculus rotundus sr beyond which point comes the large intestine the colon co and rectum r continue the main line of the alimentary canal but at the beginning of the large intestine there is also inserted a great sideshunt the caecum cae ending blindly in a fleshy vermiform appendix vap the figure will indicate how the parts are related better than any verbal description can between the coiling alimentary tube and the body walls is a space into which the student cuts when he begins dissecting this is the peritoneal cavity pt a thin transparent membrane the mesentery holds the intestines in place and binds them to the dorsal wall of this peritoneal space   section 17 the food stuffs of an animal the unstable compounds destined ultimately to be worked into its life and to leave it again in the form of katastases section 13 fall into two main divisions the first of these includes the nonnitrogenous food stuffs containing either carbon together with hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of h2o the carbohydrates or carbon and hydrogen without oxygen the hydrocarbons the second division consists of the nitrogenous materials containing also carbon hydrogen a certain amount of oxygen sulphur and possibly other elements among the carbohydrates the commonest are starch and cellulose which are insoluble bodies and sugar which is soluble the hydrocarbons fats oils and so on form a comparatively small proportion of the rabbits diet the proverb of oil and water will remind the student that these are insoluble the nitrogenous bodies have their type in the albumen of an egg and muscle substance and the less modified living protoplasm of plants a considerable proportion of the substance of seeds bulbs and so on are albuminous bodies or proteids these also are insoluble bodies or when soluble will not diffuse easily through animal membranes   section 18 now the essential problem which the digestive canal of the rabbit solves is to get these insoluble or quasiinsoluble bodies into its blood and system they have to pass somehow into the circulation through the walls of the alimentary canal in order that a compound should diffuse through a membrane it must be both soluble and diffusible and therefore an essential preliminary to the absorption of nutritive matter is its conversion into a diffusible soluble form this is effected by certain fluids formed either by the walls of the alimentary canal or by certain organs called glands which open by ducts into it all these fluids contain small quantities of organic compounds of the class called ferments and these are the active agents in the change the soluble form of the carbohydrates is sugar proteids can be changed into the of course chemically equivalent but soluble and diffusible the peptones and fats and oils undergo a more complicated but finally similar change   section 19 we shall discuss the structure and action of a gland glands a little more fully in a subsequent chapter here we will simply say that they are organs forming each its characteristic fluid or secretion and sending it by a conduit the duct to the point where its presence is required the saliva in our mouths tears and perspiration are examples of the secretions of glands   section 20 in the month of the rabbit the food is acted upon by the teeth and saliva the saliva contains ptyalin a ferment converting starch into sugar and it also serves to moisten the food as it is ground up by the cheek teeth it does not act on fat to any appreciable extent the teeth of the rabbit are shown in figure xviii sheet 4 the incisor teeth in front two pairs above and one pair below i are simply employed in grasping the food the cheek teeth the premolars pm and molars m behind triturate the food by a complicated motion over each their crowns are flat for this purpose with harder ridges running across them   section 21 this grinding up of the food in the mouth invariably occurs in herbivorous animals where there is a considerable amount of starch and comparatively little hydrocarbon in the food by finely dividing the food it ensures its intimate contact with the digestive ferment ptyalin in such meateaters as the cat and dog where little starchy matter and much fat is taken the saliva is of course of less importance and this mastication does not occur the cheek teeth of a dog section 91 and more so of a cat are sharp and used for gnawing off fragments of food which are swallowed at once between the incisors and premolars of a dog come the characteristic biting teeth or canines absent in the rabbit   section 22 the student will probably ask why the cheek teeth which are all similar in appearance are divided into premolars and molars the rabbit has a set of milk molars a milk dentition which are followed by the permanent teeth just as in man those cheek teeth of the second set which have predecessors in the first series are called premolars the ones posterior to these are the molars   section 23 after mastication the food is worked by the tongue and cheeks into a salivasoaked bolus and swallowed the passage down the oesophagus is called deglutition in the stomach it comes under the influence of the gastric juice formed in little glandular pits in the stomach wall the gastric figure viii sheet 3 and pyloric glands this fluid is distinctly acid its acidity being due to about onetenth per cent of a hundred of hydrochloric acid and it therefore stops any further action of the ptyalin which can act only on neutral or slightly alkaline fluids the gastric juice does not act on carbohydrates or hydrocarbons to any very noticeable degree its essential property is the conversion of proteids into peptones and the ferment by which this is effected is called pepsin milk contains a peculiar soluble proteid called casein which is precipitated by a special ferment the rennetferment and the insoluble proteid the curd thus obtained is then acted on by the pepsin in the manufacture of cheese the rennetferment obtained from the stomach of a calf is used to curdle the milk   section 24 after the food has undergone digestion in the stomach it passes into the duodenum the ushaped loop of intestine immediately succeeding the stomach the duodenum is separated from the stomach by a ringlike muscular valve the pylorus this valve belongs to the class of muscles called sphincters which under ordinary circumstances are closed but which relax to open the circular central aperture the valve at the anus which retains the faeces is another instance of a sphincter   section 25 the food at this stage is called chyme it is an acid and souplike fluid acid through the influence of the gastric juice the temperature of the animals body is sufficiently high to keep most of the fat in the food melted and floating in oily drops much of the starch has been changed to sugar and the solid proteids to soluble peptones but many fragments of material still float unchanged   section 26 it meets now with the bile a greenish fluid secreted by that large and conspicuous gland the liver the bile is not simply a digestive secretion like the saliva or the gastric juice it contains matters destined to mix in and after a certain amount of change to be passed out of the body with the faeces among these substances of which some portion is doubtless excretory are compounds containing sulphur the bile salts there is also a colouring matter bili verdin which may possibly also be excretory if the student will compare sections 10 and 11 he will notice that in those paragraphs no account is taken of the sulphur among the katastases the account does not balance and he will at once see that here probably is the missing item on the outgoing side the bile through the presence of these salts is strongly alkaline and so stops the action of the gastric juice and prepares for that of the pancreas which can act only in an alkaline medium the fermentive action of the bile is trifling it dissolves fats to a certain extent and is antiseptic that is it prevents putrefaction to which the chyme might be liable it also seems to act as a natural purgative   section 27 the bile as we shall see later is by no means the sole product of the liver   section 28 the pancreatic juice the secretion of the pancreas is remarkable as acting on all the food stuffs that have not already become soluble it emulsifies fats that is it breaks the drops up into extremely small globules forming a milky fluid and it furthermore has a fermentive action upon them it splits them up into fatty acids and the soluble body glycerine the fatty acids combine with alkaline substances section 26 to form bodies which belong to the chemical group of soaps and which are soluble also the pancreatic juice also attacks any proteids that have escaped the gastric juice and converts them into peptones and any residual starch into sugar hence by this stage in the duodenum all the food constituents noticed in section 17 are changed into soluble forms there are probably three distinct ferments in the pancreatic juice acting respectively on starch fat and proteid but they have not been isolated and the term pancreatin is sometimes used to suggest the three together   section 29 a succus entericus a salivalike fluid secreted by numerous small glands in the intestine wall brunners glands lieberkuhnian follicles probably aids to an unknown but comparatively small extent in the digestive processes   section 30 the walls of the whole of the small intestine are engaged in the absorption of the soluble results of digestion in the duodenum especially small processes the villi project into the cavity and being like the small hairs of velvet pile and as thickly set give its inner coat a velvety appearance in a villus we find figure ix sheet 3 a series of small bloodvessels and with it another vessel called a lacteal the lacteals run together into larger and larger branches until they form a main trunk the thoracic duct which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart but of this we shall speak further later they contain after a meal a fluid called chyle   section 31 emulsified fats pass into the chyle water and diffusible salts certainly pass into the vein the course taken by the peptones is uncertain but professor foster favours the chyle in the case of the rabbit the student should read his textbook of physiology part 2 chapter 1 section 11 if interested in the further discussion of this question   section 32 the processes that occur in the remaining portions of the alimentary canal are imperfectly understood the caecum is so large in the rabbit that it must almost certainly be of considerable importance in carnivorous animals it may be so much reduced as to be practically absent an important factor in the diet of the herbivorous animals and one absent from the food of the carnivora is that carbohydrate the building material of all greenmeat food cellulose and there is some ground for thinking that the caecum is probably a region of special fermentive action upon it the pancreatic juice it may be noted exercises a slight digestive activity upon this substance   section 33 water is most largely absorbed in the large intestine and in it the rejected mainly insoluble portion of the food gradually acquires its dark colour and other faecal characteristics    3 the circulation  section 34 the next thing to consider is the distribution of the food material absorbed through the walls of the alimentary canal to the living and active parts of the body this is one of the functions of the series of structures heart and bloodvessels called the circulation circulatory system or vascular system it is not the only function the blood also carries the oxygen from the lungs to the various parts where work is done and kataboly occurs and it carries away the katastases to the points where they are excreted the carbon dioxide and some water to the lungs water and urea to the kidneys sulphur compounds of some kind to the liver   section 35 the blood figure 4 sheet 2 is not homogeneous under the low power of the microscope it may be seen to consist of     1 a clear fluid the plasma in which float     2 a few transparent colourless bodies of indefinite and changing    shape and having a central brighter portion the nucleus with a still    brighter dot therein the nucleolus the white corpuscles wc and     3 flat round discs without a nucleus the red corpuscles rc    greatly more numerous than the white   section 36 the chyle of the lacteals passes as we have said by the thoracic duct directly into the circulation it enters the left vena cava superior lvcs near where this joins the jugular vein exj see figure 1 sheet 2 thd and goes on at once with the rest of the blood to the heart the small veins of the villi however which also help suck up the soluble nutritive material are not directly continuous with the other body veins the systemic veins they belong to a special system and running together into larger and larger branches form the lieno gastric lgv and mesenteric mv veins which unite to form the portal vein pv which enters the liver lv and there breaks up again into smaller and smaller branches the very finest ramifications of this spreading network are called the liver capillaries and these again unite to form at last the hepatic vein hv which enters the vena cava inferior vci a median vessel running directly to the heart this capillary network in the liver is probably connected with changes requisite before the recently absorbed materials can enter the general blood current   section 37 the student has probably already heard the terms vein and artery employed in the rabbit a vein is a vessel bringing blood towards the heart while an artery is a vessel conducting it away veins are thinwalled and therefore flabby a conspicuous purple when full of blood and when empty through bleeding and collapsed sometimes difficult to make out in dissection they are formed by the union of lesser factors the portal breaks up into lesser branches within the liver arteries have thick muscular and elastic walls thick enough to prevent the blood showing through and are therefore pale pink or white and keep their round shape   section 38 the heart of the rabbit is divided by partitions into four chambers two upper thinwalled ones the auricles au and two lower ones both and especially the left with very muscular walls the ventricles vn the right ventricle rvn and auricle rau communicate and the left ventricle lvn and auricle lau   section 39 the blood coming from all parts of the body partly robbed of its oxygen and containing much carbon dioxide and other katastases enters the right auricle of the heart through three great veins the median vena cava inferior from the posterior parts of the body and the paired venae cavae superiores from the anterior with the beating of the heart described below it is forced into the right ventricle and from there through the pulmonary artery pa seen in the figure passing under the loop of the aorta ao to the lungs   section 40 the lungs lg figure 1 sheet 1 are moulded to the shape of the thoracic cavity and heart they communicate with the pharynx by the trachea tr in figure 1 sheet 1 or windpipe and are made up of a tissue of continually branching and diminishing airtubes which end at last in small airsacs the alveoli the final branches of the pulmonary arteries the lung capillaries lie in the walls of these airsacs and are separated from the air by an extremely thin membrane through which the oxygen diffuses into and the carbon dioxide escapes from the blood   section 41 the mechanism of respiration will be understood by reference to figure 3 sheet 2 it will be noted in dissecting that the lungs have shrunk away from the walls of the thorax this collapse occurs directly an aperture is made in the thorax wall and is in part due to their extreme elasticity in life the cavity of the thorax forms an airtight box between which and the lungs is a slight space the pleural cavity plc lined by a moist membrane which is also reflected over the lungs the thorax wall is muscular and bony and resists the atmospheric pressure on its outer side so that the lungs before this is cut through are kept distended to the size of the thoracic cavity by the pressure of the air within them in inspiration or breathingin the ribs are raised by the external intercostal anglice betweenribs eicm and other allied muscles and the diaphragm dia contracts and becomes flatter the air is consequently sucked in as the lungs follow the movement of the thorax wall in expiration the intercostals and diaphragm relax and allow the elastic recoil of the lungs to come into play the thoracic wall is simultaneously depressed by the muscles of the abdominal area the diaphragm thrust forwards as the result of the displacement and compression of the alimentary viscera thus brought about rrr in the figure mark ribs   section 42 the oxygen and carbon dioxide are not carried in exactly the same way by the blood the student will know from his chemical reading that neither of these gases is very soluble but carbon dioxide is sufficiently so in an alkaline fluid to be conveyed by the liquid plasma the oxygen however needs a special portative mechanism in the colouring matter of the red corpuscles the haemoglobin with which it combines weakly to form oxyhaemoglobin of a bright red colour and decomposing easily in the capillaries the finest vessels between the arteries and veins to release the oxygen again the same compound occurs in all true vertebrata and in the bloodfluid of the worm in the crayfish a similar substance haemocyanin which when oxygenated is blue and when deoxydized colourless discharges the same function   section 43 the blood returns from the lungs to the left auricle lau by the pulmonary veins hidden in the figure by the heart passes thence to the thickwalled left ventricle lvn and on into the aorta ao   section 44 the beating of the heart is of course a succession of contractions and expansions of its muscular wall the contraction or systole commences at the base of the venae cavae and passes to the auricles driving the blood before it into the ventricles which then contract sharply and drive it on into the aorta or pulmonary artery a pause and then a dilatation the diastole follows the flow of the blood is determined in one direction by the various valves of the heart no valves occur in the opening of the superior cavae but an imperfect one the eustachian valve protects the inferior cava the direction of the hearts contraction prevents any excessive backflow into the veins and the onward tendency is encouraged by the suck of the diastole of the ventricles between the left ventricle and auricle is a valve made up of two flaps of skin the mitral valve the edges of the flaps being connected with the walls of the ventricle through the intermediation of small muscular threads the chordae tendinae which stretch across its cavity to little muscular pillars the papillary muscles these attachments prevent the mitral valve from flapping back into the auricle and as the blood flows into and accumulates in the ventricle it gets behind the flaps of the valve and presses its edges together when the systole of the ventricle occurs the increased tension of the blood only closes the aperture the tighter and the current passes on into the aorta where we find three watchpocket valves with the pocket turned away from the heart which are also closed and tightened by any attempt at regurgitation backflow a similar process occurs on the right side of the heart but here instead of a mitral valve of two flaps between auricle and ventricle we have a tricuspid valve with three the thickness of the muscular walls in view of the lesser distance through which it has to force the blood are is less for the right ventricle than the left   section 45 the following are the chief branches of the aorta the student should be able to follow them with certainty in dissection they are all displayed in the figure but it must not be imagined for a moment that familiarity with this diagram will obviate the necessity for the practical work in is the innominate artery it forks into scla the right subclavian and rcc the right common carotid each carotid splits at the angle of the jaw into an internal and an external branch the left common carotid lcc arises from the base of the innominate lscla the left subclavian directly from the aorta the aorta now curves round to the dorsal middle line and runs down as seen in figure 1 sheet 1 dao and figure 1 sheet 2 dao small branches are given off to the ribs and then comes the median coeliac coea to the stomach and spleen the median superior mesenteric smesa to the main portion of the intestine and the inferior mesenteric pma to the rectum note that no veins to the inferior vena cava correspond to these arteries the blood they supply going back by the portal vein pv the paired renal arteries ra supply the kidneys and the common iliacs cila the hind legs splitting into the internal iliacs iila and the femoral f     lines from second edition only    the student should note that the only arteries in the middle line    are those supplying the alimentary canal     lines from first edition only     the figure is inaccurate and represents the left common carotid    as arising from the aortic arch   section 46 the distribution of the veins of the rabbit has only a superficial parallelism with arteries the chief factors of vena cava inferior are the hepatic vein hv which receives the liver blood the renal veins rv from the kidneys the ilaeolumbar from the abdominal wall and the external eilv and internal ilias iilv with the exception of the renal veins none of these run side by side with arteries the superior cavae r and lvcs are formed by the union of internal ij and external jugular ej veins with a subclavian sclv from the fore limb the term precaval vein is sometimes used for superior cava the attention of the student is called to the small azygos vein az running into the right vena cava superior and forming the only asymmetrical notbalancing feature of the veins in front of the heart it brings blood back from the ribs of the thorax wall and is of interest mainly because it answers to an enormous main vessel the right postcardinal sinus in fishes there are spermatic arteries and veins sv and a to the genital organs all these vessels should be patiently dissected out by the student and drawn   section 47 between the final branches of the arteries and the first fine factors of the veins and joining them come the systemic capillaries these smallest and ultimate ramifications of the circulation penetrate every living part of the animal so that if we could isolate the vascular system we should have the complete form of the rabbit in a closelymeshed network it is in the capillaries that the exchange of gases occurs and that nutritive material passes out to the tissues and katastases in from them they are the essential factor in the circulatory system of the mammal veins arteries and heart simply exist to remove and replace their contents the details of the branching of the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins need not detain us now   section 48 summarising the course of the circulation starting from the right ventricle we have pulmonary artery pulmonary capillaries pulmonary vein left auricle left ventricle aorta arteries and systemic capillaries after this from all parts except the spleen and alimentary canal the blood returns to systemic veins superior or inferior cavae right auricle and right ventricle the blood from the stomach spleen and intestines however passes via through the portal vein to the liver capillaries and then through the hepatic vein to inferior cava and so on material leaves the blood to be excreted in lungs kidneys by the skin as perspiration and elsewhere new material enters most conspicuously     a by the portal veins portal veins and     b by the thoracic duct and left superior cava   section 49 the following table summarises what we have learnt up to the present of the physiology of the rabbit considered as a mechanism using up food and oxygen and disengaging energy     air nitrogen returned unchanged    oxygen through pulmonary vein

sweat glands    other substances mainly by kidney liver and alimentary canal    4 the amoeba cells and tissue  section 50 we have thus seen how the nutritive material is taken into the animals system and distributed over its body and incidentally we have noted how the resultant products of the creatures activity are removed the essence of the whole process as we have already stated is the decomposition and partial oxydation of certain complex chemical compounds to water carbon dioxide a low nitrogenous body which finally takes the form of urea and other substances we may now go on to a more detailed study the microscopic study or histology of the tissues in which metaboly and kataboly occur but before we do this it will be convenient to glance for a moment at another of our animal types the amoeba the lowest as the rabbit is the highest in our series   section 51 this is shown in figure iii sheet 3 as it would appear under the low power of the microscope we have a mass of a clear transparent greyish substance called protoplasm granular in places and with a clearer border within this is a denser portion called the nucleus or endoplast n which under the microscope by transmitted light appear brighter and within that a still denser spot the nucleolus ns or endoplastule the protoplasm is more or less extensively excavated by fluid spaces vacuoles one clearer circular space or vacuole which is invariably present appears at intervals enlarges gradually and then vanishes abruptly to reappear after a brief interval this is called the contractile vacuole cv the amoeba is constantly changing its shape whence its older name of the proteus animalcule thrusting out masses of its substance in one direction and withdrawing from another and hence slowly creeping about these thrustout parts in its outline are called pseudopodia ps by means of them it gradually creeps round and encloses its food little particles of nutritive matter are usually to be detected in the homogeneous protoplasm of its body commonly these are surrounded by a drop of water taken in with them and the drop of water is then called a food vacuole the process of taking in food is called ingestion the amoeba in all probability performs essentially the same chemical process as we have summarised in sections 10 11 12 it ingests food digests it in the food vacuoles and builds it up into its body protoplasm to undergo kataboly and furnish the force of its motion the contractile vacuole is probably respiratory and perhaps excretory accumulating and then by its systole compare section 44 forcing out of its body the water carbon dioxide urea and other katastases which are formed concomitantly with its activity the amoeba reproduces itself in the simplest way the nucleus occasionally divides into two portions and a widening fissure in the protoplasm of the animals body separates one from the other it is impossible to say that one is the parent cell and the other the offspring the amoeba we merely perceive was one and is now two it is curious to note therefore that the amoeba is in a sense immortal that the living nucleus of one of these minute creatures that we examine today under a microscope may have conceivably drawn out an unbroken thread of life since the remotest epochs of the worlds history although no sexual intercourse can be observed there is reason to believe that a process of supposed cannabalism in which a larger amoeba may occasionally engulph a smaller one is really a conjugative reproductive process and followed by increased vitality and division   section 52 now if the student will compare section 35 he will see that in the white blood corpuscles we have a very remarkable resemblance to the amoeba the contractile vacuole is absent but we have the protoplasmic body the nucleus and nucleolus and those creeping fluctuations of shape through the thrusting out and withdrawal of pseudopodia which constitute amoeboid motion they also multiply in the same way by division   section 53 it is not only in the white corpuscle of the blood that we find this resemblance in all the firmer parts of the body we find on microscopic examination similar little blebs of protoplasm and at an early stage of development the young rabbit is simply one mass of these protoplasmic bodies their division and multiplication is an essential condition of growth through an unfortunate accident these protoplasmic blebs which constitute the living basis of the animal body have come to be styled cells though the term corpuscles is far more appropriate   section 54 the word is cell suggests something enclosed by firm and definite walls and it was first employed in vegetable histology unlike the typical cells of animals the cells of most plants are not naked protoplasm but protoplasm enclosed in a wall of substance cell wall called cellulose the presence of this cellulose cell wall and the consequent necessity of feeding entirely upon liquids and gases that soak through it instead of being able to ingest a portion of solid food is indeed the primary distinction between the vegetable and the animal kingdoms as ordinarily considered   section 55 throughout life millions of these cells retain their primary characters and constitute the white corpuscles of blood phagocytes and connective tissue corpuscles others again engage in the formation of material round themselves and lie in such cases as gristle and bone embedded in the substance they have formed others again undergo great changes in form and internal structure and become permanently modified into for instance nerve fibres and muscle substance the various substances arising in this way through the activity of cells are called tissues the building materials of that complex thing the animal body since such a creature as the rabbit is formed through the cooperation of a vast multitude of cells it is called multicellular the amoeba on the other hand is unicellular the rabbit may be thus regarded as a vast community of amoeboid creatures and their products   section 56 figure iv sheet 3 represents diagrammatically embryonic tissue of which to begin with the whole animal consists the cells are all living capable of dividing and similar but as development proceeds they differentiate some take on one kind of duty function and some another like boys taking to different trades on leaving school and wide differences in structure and interdependence become apparent   section 57 it is convenient to divide tissues into three classes though the divisions are by no means clearly marked nor have they any scientific value the first of these comprises tissues composed wholly or with the exception of an almost imperceptible cementing substance of cells the second division includes the skeletal tissues the tissue of mesentery and the connective and basement tissue of most of the organs tissues which generally speaking consist of a matrix or embedding substance formed by the cells and outside of them as well as the cells themselves and thirdly muscular and nervous tissue we shall study the former two in this chapter and defer the third division until later   section 58 the outer layer of the skin the epidermis the inmost lining of the alimentary canal the lining of the body cavity and the inner linings of bloodvessels glands and various ducts constitute our first division the general name for such tissues is epithelium when the cells are more or less flattened they form squamous epithelium figure vi such as we find lining the inside of a mans cheek from which the cells sqep were taken or covering the mesentery of various types sqend are from the mesentery section 16 of a frog a short cylindroidal form of cell makes up columnar epithelium seen typically in the cells covering the villi of the duodenum figure v this epithelium of the villi has the outer border curiously striated and this is usually spoken of as leading towards ciliated epithelium to be described immediately the epithelium of the epididermis is stratified that is to say has many thicknesses of cells the deeper layers are alive and dividing stratum mucosum while the more superficial are increasingly flattened and drier as the surface is approached stratum corneum and are continually being rubbed off and replaced from below   section 59 in the branching airtubes of the lung the central canal of the spinal cord and in the ureters of the rabbit and in most other types in various organs we find ciliated epithelium figure vii this is columnar or cubical in form and with the free edge curiously modified and beset with a number of hairlike processes the cilia by which during the life of the cell a waving motion is sustained in one direction this motion assists in maintaining a current in the contents of ducts which are lined with this tissue the motion is independent of the general life of the animal so long as the constituent cell still lives and so it is easy for the student to witness it himself with a microscope having a 14inch or 16inch objective very fine cilia may be seen by gently scraping the roof of a frogs mouth the cells figured are from this source or the gill of a recently killed mussel and mounting at once in water or better in a very weak solution of common salt   section 60 the lining of glands is secretory epithelium the cells are usually cubical or polygonal 8 gep and they display in the most characteristic form what is called metabolism anaboly see section 14 we have defined as a chemical change in an upward direction less stable and more complex compounds are built up in the processes of vegetable and animal activity towards protoplasm kataboly is a chemical running down metaboly is a more general term covering all vital chemical changes the products of the action of a glandular epithelium are metabolic products material derived from the blood is worked up within the cell not necessarily with conspicuous gain or loss of energy and discharged into the gland space the most striking case of this action is in the goblet cells that are found among the villi these are simply glands of one cell unicellular glands and in figure v we see three stages in their action at gc1 material secretion is seen forming in the cell at gc2 it approaches the outer border and at gc3 it has been discharged leaving a hollowed cell usually however the escape of secreted matter is not so conspicuous and the glandcells are collected as the lining of pits simple as in the gastric pyloric and lieberkuhnian glands figure viii sections 23 29 or branching like a tree or a bunch of grapes figure rg as in brunners glands section 29 the pancreas and the salivary glands the salivary glands we may mention are a pair internal to the posterior ventral angle of the jaw the submaxillary a pair anterior to these the sublingual a pair posterior to the jaw beneath the ear the parotid and a pair beneath the eye the infra orbital   section 61 the liver is the most complicated gland in the body figure x the bile duct bd branches again and again and ends at last in the final pits the lobuli lb which are lined with secretory epithelium and tightly packed and squeeze each other into polygonal forms the blood supply from which the bile would appear to be mainly extracted is brought by the portal vein but this blood is altogether unfit for the nutrition of the liver tissue for this latter purpose a branch of the coeliac artery the hepatic serves hence in the tissue of the liver we have branching and interweaving among the lobuli the small branches of the bile duct bd which carries away the bile formed the portal vein pv the hepatic artery ha and the hepatic vein hv compare section 45 figure xb shows a lobule the portal vein and the artery ramify round the lobules are interlobular that is inter between the hepatic vein begins in the middle of the lobules intralobular and receives their blood compare xa besides its function in the manufacture of the excretory digestive and auxiliary bile the liver performs other duties it appears to act as an inspector of the assimilation material brought in by the portal vein the villi for instance will absorb arsenic but this is arrested and thrown down in the liver a third function is the formation of what would seem to be a store of carbohydrate glycogen mainly it would appear from the sugar in the portal vein though also very probably from nitrogenous material though this may occur only under exceptional conditions finally the nitrogenous katastates formed in the working of muscle and nerve and returned by them to the blood for excretion are not at that stage in the form of urea whatever form they assume they undergo a further metabolism into urea before leaving the body and the presence of considerable quantities of this latter substance in the liver suggests this as a fourth function of this organ the elaboration of urea   section 62 similar from a physiological point of view to the secretory glands which form the digestive fluids are those which furnish lubricating fluids the lachrymal gland and harderian glands in the orbit internally to the eye and posterior and anterior to it respectively the sebaceous glands oil glands connected with the hair and the anal and perineal glands the secretions of excretory glands are removed from the body chief among them are the sweat glands and kidneys the sweat glands are microscopic tubular glands terminating internally in a small coil figure viii sg and are scattered thickly over the body the water of their secretion being constantly removed by evaporation and the small percentage of salt and urea remaining to accumulate as dirt and the chief reasonable excuse for washing the kidney structure is shown diagrammatically in figure 5 sheet 7 a great number of branching and straight looped tubuli little tubes converge on an open space the pelvis towards the outer layers cortex of the kidney these tubuli terminate in little dilatations into which tangled knots of bloodvessels project the dilatations are called bowmans capsules bc and each coil of bloodvessel a glomerulus gl in the capsules water is drained from the blood in the tubuli urea and other salts in the urine are secreted from a branching network of vessels   section 63 in all the epithelial tissues that we have considered we have one feature in common they are cells each equivalent to the amoeba that have taken on special duties in a word they are specialists the amoeba is jack of all trades and a free lance the protective epidermal cell the currentmaking ciliated cell the bile or ureamaking secretory cell is master of one trade and a soldier in a vast and wonderfully organized host we will now consider our second kind of cell in this organization the cell of which the especial aim is the building round it of a tissue   section 64 the simplest variety in this group is hyaline ie glassy cartilage gristle in this the formative cells the cartilage corpuscles are enjellied in a clear structureless matrix figure xii consisting entirely of organic compounds accumulated by their activity immediately round the cell lies a capsule of newer material some of the cells have recently divided 1 others have done so less recently and there has been time for the interpolation of matrix as at 2 in this way the tissue grows and is repaired a thin layer of connective tissue see below the perichondrium clothes the cartilaginous structure   section 65 connective tissue figure xiii is a general name for a group of tissues of very variable character it is usually described as consisting typically in the mammals of three chief elements felted together of comparatively unmodified corpuscles cc more or less amoeboid and of fibres which are elongated altered and distorted cells the fibres are of two kinds yellow branching and highly elastic yef in consequence of which they fall into sinuous lines in a preparation and white and inelastic ones wif lying in parallel bundles where the latter element is entirely dominant the connective tissue is tendon found especially at the point of attachment of muscles to the parts they work some elastic ligaments are almost purely yellow fibrous tissue a loose interweaving of the three elements is areolar tissue the chief fabric of mesentery membrane and the dermis beneath the epidermis with muscle it is the material of the walls of the alimentary canal and bloodvessels and generally it enters into binds together and holds in place other tissue the connective tissue of fishes displays the differentiation of fibres in a far less distinct manner   section 66 through connective tissues wander the phagocytes cells that are difficult to distinguish if really distinct from the white blood corpuscles these cells possess a remarkable freedom they show an initiative of their own and seem endowed with a subordinate individuality they occur in great numbers in a tissue called botryoidal tissue figure xiv which occurs especially in masses and patches along the course of the alimentary canal in its walls the tonsils swellings on either side of the throat are such masses and aggregates occur as visible patches the peyers patches on the ileum it also constitutes the mass of the vermiform appendix and the wall of the sacculus rotundus and in the young animal the thymus gland ventral to the heart and less entirely the thyroid gland ventral to the larynx are similar structures which are reduced or disappear as development proceeds it is evident that in these two latter cases the term gland is somewhat of a misnomer the matrix of botryoidal tissue is a network of stretched and hollowed connective tissue cells it is not a secretion as cartilage matrix appears to be during digestion the phagocytes prowl into the intestine and ingest and devour bacteria that might otherwise give rise to disease in inflammation we may note here they converge from all directions upon the point wounded or irritated they appear to be the active agents in all processes of absorption see osteoclasts under bone and for instance migrate into and devour the tissue of the tadpoles tail during its metamorphosis to the adult frog   section 67 within the connective tissue cells fat drops may be formed as in figure xv adipose tissue is simply connective tissue loaded with fatdistended cells the tissue is of course a store form of hydrocarbon section 17 provided against the possible misadventure of starvation with the exception of some hybernating animals such store forms would seem to be of accidental importance only among animals whereas among plants they are of invariable and necessary occurrence   section 68 we now come to bone a tissue confined to the vertebrata and typically shown only in the higher types as we descend in the scale from birds and mammals to lizards amphibia frogs and toads and fish we find cartilage continually more important and the bony constituent of the skeleton correspondingly less so in such a type as the dogfish the skeleton is entirely cartilaginous bone only occurs in connection with the animals scales it must have been in connection with scales that bone first appeared in the vertebrate subkingdom in the frog we have a cartilaginous skeleton overlaid by numerous bony scutes shieldlike plates which when the student comes to study that type he will perceive are equivalent to the bony parts of such scales as occur in the dogfish sunk inward and plating over the cartilage and in the frog the cartilage also is itself in a few places replaced by bony tissue in the adult rabbit these two kinds of bone the bone overlying what was originally cartilage membrane bone and the bone replacing the cartilage cartilage bone have between them practically superseded the cartilage altogether the structure of the most characteristic kind of bone will be understood by reference to figure xvi it is a simplified diagram of the transverse section of such a bone as the thigh bone mc is the central marrow cavity hv hv are cross sections of small bloodvessels the haversian vessels running more or less longitudinally through the bone in canals the haversian canals arranged round these vessels are circles of the formative elements the bone corpuscles or osteoblasts bc each embedded in bony matrix in a little bed the lacuna and communicating one with another by fine processes through canaliculi in the matrix which processes are only to be seen clearly in decalcified bone see section 70 the osteoblasts are arranged in concentric series and the matrix is therefore in concentric layers or lamellae cl without and within the zone of haversian systems are ol and il the outer and inner lamellae the bone is surrounded by connective tissue the periosteum in addition to this compact bone there is a lighter and looser variety in which spicules and bars of bony tissue are loosely interwoven many flat bones the bones of the skull for instance consist of this spongy bone plated as an electro spoon is plated with compact bone   section 69 among the bony bars and spicules of spongy bone occurs the red marrow which must not be confused with the yellow marrow the fatty substance in the central cavity of long bones in this red marrow are numerous large colourless cells which appear to form within their substance and then liberate red blood corpuscles this occurs especially in the spongy bone within the ribs   section 70 the matrix of bone differs from that of cartilage or of most other tissues in consisting chiefly of inorganic salts the chief of these is calcium phosphate with which much smaller quantities of calcium carbonate and magnesium phosphate and carbonate occur these inorganic salts can be removed by immersion of the bone in weak hydrochloric acid and a flexible network of connecting tissue haversian vessels bone corpuscles and their processes remains this is decalcified bone alluded to above   section 71 in the very young rabbit the limb bones vertebral column and many of the skull bones are simply plates and bars of cartilage the future membrane bones however are planned out in connective tissue the development of the latter is simple the connective tissue corpuscles functioning by a simple change of product as osteoblast the development of the cartilage bones however is more complicated figure xvii represents in a diagrammatic way the stages in the conversion of a cartilaginous bar to bone to begin with the previously sporadicallyarranged scattered anyhow corpuscles ucc are gathered into groups in single file or in other words into columnar groups as at cc the matrix becomes clouded with inorganic salts of lime and it is then said to be calcified this calcified cartilage then undergoes absorption it must not be imagined for a moment that bone is calcified cartilage simultaneous with the formation of the cavities s due to this absorption connective tissue pci from the surrounding perichondrium pc grows into the ossifying bar it is from this connective tissue that the osteoblasts ob arise and bone is built up throughout life a bone is continually being absorbed and reformed by the activity of the osteoblasts an osteoblast engaged in the absorption instead of the formation of bone is called an osteoclast   the formation of bone is called ossification to ossify is to become bony   section 72 the great thing to notice about this is that cartilage does not become bone but is eaten into and ousted by it the osteoblasts and osteoclasts replace entirely the cartilage corpuscles and are not derived from them   section 73 we may mention here the structure of the spleen figure 1 sheet 1 it consists of a connective tissue and muscular coating with an internal soft matrix much resembling botryoidal tissue traversed by fibrous trabeculne  beams planks containing bloodvessels and the whole organ is gorged with blood particularly after meals the consideration of its function the student may conveniently defer for the present   section 74 here also we may notice the lymphatics a series of small vessels which return the overflow of the blood serum from the capillaries in the nutrition of the tissues in all parts of the body to the thoracic duct see section 36 and the general circulation at intervals their course is interrupted by glandlike dilatations the lymphatic glands in which masses of rapidly dividing and growing proliferating cells occur of which doubtless many are detached and become first lymph corpuscles and when they reach the veins white blood corpuscles    5 the skeleton  section 75 we are now in a position to study the rabbits skeleton we strongly recommend the student to do this with the actual bones at hand they may be cleared very easily in a wellboiled rabbit this recommendation may appear superfluous to some readers but as a matter of fact the marked proclivity of the average schoolmaster for mere bookwork has put such a stamp on study that in nine cases out of ten a student unless he is expressly instructed to the contrary will go to the tortuous and possibly inexact descriptions of a book for a knowledge of things that lie at his very fingertips we have not written this chapter to give a complete knowledge of the skeleton but simply as an aid in the actual examination of the bones   section 76 we may take the skeleton under five headings there is the central axis the chain of little bones the vertebrae threaded on the spinal cord see figure 1 and section 1 the thorax the box enclosed by ribs and sternum the forelimb and bones connected with it pectoral girdle and limb and the hindlimb and bones connected with it pelvic girdle finally there is the skull but following the london university syllabus we shall substitute the skull of the dog for of that of the rabbit as more typically mammalian section 4   section 77 in section 3 which the student should refer to we have a division of the vertebrae into four varieties of these most representative is the thoracic a thoracic vertebra figure 4 sheet 5 tv consists of a central bony mass the body or centrum b from which there arises dorsally an arch the neural arch na completed by a keystone the neural spine ns and coming off laterally from the arch is the transverse process trp looking at the vertebra sideways we see that the arch is notched for the exit of nerves jointed to the thoracic vertebrae on either side are the ribs r each rib has a process the tuberculum going up to articulate with the transverse process and one the capitulum articulating between the bodies of two contiguous vertebrae the facets for the articulation of the capitulum are indicated in the side view by shading at either end of the body of a vertebra of a young rabbit are bony caps the epiphyses ep separated from the body by a plane of unossified cartilage indicated by the dots these epiphyses to the vertebral bodies occur only among mammals and are even absent in some cases within the class in the adult rabbit they have ossified continuously with the rest of the body   section 78 a cervical vertebra cv seems upon cursory inspection to have no rib the transverse processes differ from those of thoracic series in having a perforation the vertebrarterial canal through which the vertebral artery runs up the neck a study of the development of these bones shows that the part marked fr ossifies separately from the rest of the transverse process and the form of the equivalent structures in certain peculiar lower mammals and in reptiles leaves no doubt that fr is really an abbreviated rib fused up with the transverse process and body the two anterior cervical vertebrae are peculiar the first at is called the atlas the figure shows the anterior view and has great articular faces for the condyles section 86 of the skull and a deficient centrum the next is the axis and it is distinguished by an odontoid peg odp which fits into the space where the body of the atlas is deficient in development the centrum of the axis ossifies from one centre and the odontoid peg from another which at that time occupies the position of centrum of the atlas so that it would seem that the atlas is a vertebra minus a centrum and the axis is a vertebra plus a centrum added at the expense of the atlas   section 79 the lumbar vertebrae lv are larger and have cleft transverse processes each giving rise to an ascending limb the metapophyses and a descending one the latter generally spoken of as the transverse processes point steeply downward and are considerably longer than those of thoracic series the sacral vertebrae sv have great flattened transverse propcesses for articulation with the ilia the caudal vertebrae cv are gradually reduced to the mere elongated centra as we proceed towards the tip of the tail   section 80 all the vertebrae join with their adjacent fellows through the intermediation of certain intervertebral pads and also articulate by small processes at either end at the upper side of the arch the zygapophyses the normals to the polished facets of these point in the case of the anterior zygapophyses up and in mnemonic antupin and in the case of the posterior down and out the student should make this and the other features of vertebrae out upon actual specimens   section 81 the thorax is bounded dorsally by the vertebral column and ventrally by the sternum the sternum consists of segments the sternebrae st anteriorly there is a bony manubrium mb posteriorly a thin cartilaginous plate the xiphisternum xi seven pairs of ribs articulate by cartilaginous ends sternal ribs with the sternum directly as indicated in the figure five false ribs are joined to each other and to the seventh and not to the sternum directly the last four ribs have no tuberculum section 77   section 82 the forelimb pectoral limb consists of an upper arm bone the humerus hum the distal end of which is deeply excavated by the olecranon fossa of as indicated by the dotted lines of two bones the ulna u and radius r which are firmly bound by ligament in the position of the figure ie with the palm of the hand downward prone of a number of small bones carpalia the carpus c of a series of metacarpals mc and of three digits  fingers each except the first or pollex of three small bones the phalanges only the proximal of which appear in the figure the ulna has a hooklike head the olecranon o which distinguishes it easily from the distally thickened radius the limb is attached to the body through the intermediation of the shoulderblade scapula sc a flattened bone with a median external ridge with a hooklike termination the acromion acr there is also a process overhanging the glenoid cavity g wherein the humerus articulates which process is called coracoid co it is ossified from two separate centres and represents a very considerable bone in the bird reptile and frog along the dorsal edge of the scapula of the rabbit is unossified cartilage which is called the suprascapula ssc in man there runs from the acromion to the manubrium of the sternum a bone the collarbone or clavicle this is represented by a very imperfectly ossified rudiment in the rabbit the scapula and clavicle the bones of the body connected with the forelimb are frequently styled the pectoral girdle or shouldergirdle this name of girdle will appear less of a misnomer when lower vertebrate types are studied   section 83 the hind limb and its body bones pelvic limb and girdle are shown in figure 2 the limb skeleton corresponds closely with that of the forelimb the femur fe answers to the humerus and is to be distinguished from it by the greater distinctness of its proximal head hd and by the absence of an olecranon fossa from its distal end the tibia ti  the radius is fused for the distal half of its length with the fibula fb  ulna a tarsus tarsalia equals the carpus two of the proximal tarsalia may be noted one working like a pulley under the tibia is the astragalus as one forming the bony support of the heel is the calcaneum ca there is a series of metatarsals and then come four digits of three phalanges each   such a resemblance as exists between one vertebra and another in the rabbit or between the humerus and the femur is called serial homology the two things correspond with each other to the extent of imperfect reduplication homology simply is commonly used to indicate the resemblance between any two structures in different animals in origin and position as regards other parts thus the heart of the rabbit and of the frog are homologous structures corresponding in position and resembling each other much as two memory sketches of one picture might do   section 84 the pelvic girdle differs from the pectoral in most land vertebrata in being articulated with the vertebral column this difference does not exist in fishes it consist in the rabbit of four bones the ilium i the ischium is the pubis pb and the small cotyloid bone the first two and the latter one meeting in the acetabular fossa ac in which the head of the femur works the pubes and ischia are fused along the midventral line many morphologists regard the ilium as equivalent to that is strictly corresponding in its relation to the scapula the pubis to the cartilaginous substratum of the clavicle and the ischium to the coracoid   section 85 these bones will be studied at the greatest advantage when dissected out from a boiled rabbit prepared and wired skeletons disarticulated skeletons plates of figures and written descriptions are in succession more tedious and less satisfactory ways to a real comprehension of this matter this chapter directs the students attention to the most important points in the study of the skeleton but it is in no way intended to mitigate the necessity of practical work it is a guide simply   section 86 the mammalian skull will be better understood after the study of that of some lower vertebrate we shall describe its main features now but their meaning will be much clearer after the lower type is read our figures are of canis in section figure vi sheet 6 we perceive a brain case cranium opening behind by a large aperture the foramen magnum fm in front of this is an extensive passage the nasal passage en to pn which is divided from the mouth by a bony floor the palate and which opens into the pharynx behind at the posterior nares pn and to the exterior by the anterior or external nares en it is divided into right and left passages by a middle partition the nasal septum outside the skull on its wings is a flasklike bone the bulla tympani b in figures 2 and 3 protecting the middle ear and from above this there passes an arch the cheek bone ju in figures 1 2 and 3 to the upper jaw forming in front the bony lower protection of the cavity containing the eye the orbit the cheek arch nasal passage and jaws form collectively the facial apparatus as distinguished from the cranium and the whole skull is sometimes referred to as the craniofacial apparatus two eminences for articulation with the atlas vertebra the condyles c lie one on each side of the lower boundary of the foramen magnum   section 87 the floor of the cranium consists of a series of cartilage bones the basioccipital bo basisphenoid bsp presphenoid psp and in front the ethmoid eth which sends down a median plate not shown in the figure to form the nasal septum between right and left nasal passages like extended wings on either side of the basioccipital are the exoccipital eo the bone is marked in figure 4 but the letters are a little obscured by shading similarly the alisphenoids as are wings to the basi and the orbitosphenoids os to the presphenoid bone psp between the exoccipital and alisphenoid there is wedged in a bone the periotic po containing the internal ear section 115 above the foramen magnum the median supraoccipital bone completes what is called the occipital arch a pair of parietals pa come above the alisphenoids and a pair of frontals f above the orbitosphenoids at the side the brain case is still incomplete and here the aquamosal sq enters into its wall in the external view figure 3 the bulla hides the periotic bone from without the student should examine all four figures for these bones before proceeding   section 88 the outer edge of the upper jaw and the cheek arch are made up of three paired bones first comes the premaxilla pm not pm1 or pm4 containing in the dog the three incisors of either side then comes the maxilla bearing the rest of the teeth the jugal or malar ju reaches over from the maxilla to meet a zygomatic process  connecting outgrowth zp of the squamosal bone   in the dog a sabrelike canine c four premolars pm1 and pm4 and two molars m1 and m2   section 89 in the under view of the skull figure 2 it will be seen that the maxilla sends in a plate to form the front part of the hard palate behind the hard palate is completed by the pair of palatine bones pal which conceal much of the pre and orbitosphenoid in the ventral view and which run back as ridges to terminate in two small angular bones the pterygoids pt which we shall find represent much more important structures in the lower vertebrata   section 90 the premaxillae and maxillae bound the sides of the nasal passage and it is completed above by a pair of splints the nasals along the floor of the nasal passage on the middle line lies a splint of bone formed by the coalescence of two halves it embraces in a vlike groove the mesethmoid nasal septum above and lies on the palate     lines from first edition only    its position is indicated by a heavy black line in 4 and it is    called the vomer bone vo     lines from second edition only    in the frog it is represented by two laterally situated bones    this is the vomer bone vo  the nasal passages are partially blocked by foliated bony outgrowths from the inner aspect of their walls which in life are covered with mucous membrane and increase the surface sensitive to smell the ethmoid ends in the ethmoturbinal et the nasal the nasoturbinal nt and the maxilla the maxilloturbinal mt in the anterior corner of the orbit there is a bone the lachrymal lc figure 1 which is hidden by the maxilla in the side view of the skull   section 91 the lower jaw mandible is one continuous bone in the mammal three incisors bite against the three of the upper jaw then comes a canine four premolars and three molars the first of which is bladelike sectorial tooth and bites against the similar sectorial tooth last premolar of the upper jaw the third molar is small the arrangement of tooth is indicated in the following dental formula i 3333 c 1111 pm 4444 m 2233   section 92 attached just behind the bulla above and passing round on either side of the throat to meet at the base of the tongue is the hyoid apparatus figure 6 the stylohyal sh epihyal eh and ceratohyal ch form the anterior cornu of the hyoid the body of the hyoid bh forms a basis for the tongue the posterior coruna th of the hyoid are also called the thyrohyals   section 93 the following table presents these bones in something like their relative positions a closer approximation to the state of the case will be reached if the student will imagine the maxilla raised up so as to overlie and hide the palatine and presphenoid the squamosal similarly overlying the periotic bone and the jugal reaching between them membrane bones are distinguished by capital letters     cranium        nasal paired ethmoid bone median vomer       frontal paired lachrymal

the incus malleus os orbiculare and stapes these will be more explicitly treated when we discuss the ear   section 95 when we come to the study of the nerves we shall revert to the skull and treat of its perforations the student should not fail before proceeding to copy and recopy our figures and to make himself quite familiar with them and he should also obtain and handle an actual skull for all practical purposes the skull of a sheep or cat will be almost as useful as that of the dog    6 muscle and nerve  section 96 we have in the skeleton a complicated apparatus of parts hinged and movable upon one another the agent moving these parts is the same agent that we find in the heart walls propelling the blood through the circulation in the alimentary canal squeezing the food along its course and universally in the body where motion occurs except in the case of the creeping phagocytes and the ciliary waving of ciliated epithelium this agent is muscle we have in muscular tissue a very wide departure from the structure of the primordial cell to use a common biological expression a very great amount of modification  differentiation sheet 7 represents the simpler kind of muscular tissue unstriated muscle in which the cell character is still fairly obvious the cells are fusiform spindleshaped have a distinct nucleus and faint longitudinal striations striations along their length but no transverse striations   section 97 in striated muscle extensive modifications mask the cell character under a 14 inch objective transverse striations of the fibres are also distinctly visible and under a much higher power we discern in a fibre sheet 7 transverse columns of rodlike sarcous elements se the columns separated by lines of dots the membranes of krause km and nuclei n flattened and separated into portions and lying in some cases close to the sarcolemma sc the connective tissue enclosing the fibre in others scattered throughout the substance of the fibre the figure shows the fibre ruptured in order to display the sarcolemma ep is the end plate of a nerve nv and fb are the fibrillae into which a fibre may be teased   section 98 in the heart we have an intermediate kind of muscle cardiac muscle figure 2 in which the muscle fibres branch there is apparently no sarcolemma and the undivided nuclei lie in the centre of the cell   section 99 unstriated muscle is sometimes called involuntary and striated voluntary muscle but there is really not the connexion with the will that these terms suggest we have just mentioned that the heartmuscle is striated but who can alter the beating of the heart by force of will and the striated muscles of the limbs perform endless involuntary acts it would seem that unstriated muscle contracts slowly and we find it especially among the viscera in the intestine for instance where it controls that peristaltic movement which pushes the food forward voluntary muscle on the other hand has a sharp contraction the muscle of the slowmoving snails slugs and mussels is unstriated all the muscle of the active insects and crustacea crabs lobsters and crayfish is striated still if the student bears the exception of the heart in mind and considers muscles as voluntary that his will can reach the terms voluntary and involuntary will serve to give him an idea of the distribution of these two types of muscle in his own body and in that of the rabbit   section 100 muscular contraction and generally all activity in the body is accompanied by kataboly the medium by which these katabolic changes are set going and controlled is the nervous system the nervous system holds the whole body together in one harmonious whole it is the governing organization of the multicellular community section 55 and the supreme head of the government resides in the brain and is called the mind but just as in a political state only the most important and most exceptional duties are performed by the imperial body and minor matters and questions of routine are referred to boards and local authorities so the mind takes cognisance only of a few of the higher concerns of the animal and a large amount of the work of the nervous system goes on insensibly in a perfectly automatic way even much that occurs in the brain   section 101 the primary elements in the tissue of the nervous system are three nerve fibres which are simply conducting threads telegraph wires ganglion cells which are the officials of the system and neuroglia a fine variety of connective tissue which holds these other elements together and may also possibly exercise a function in affecting impressions a message along a nerve to a ganglion cell is an afferent impression from a cell to a muscle or other external end is an efferent impression the passage of an impression may be defined as a flash of kataboly along the nerve and so every feeling thought and determination involves the formation of a certain quantity of katastases and the necessity for air and nutrition   section 102 unlike telegraph wires to which they are often compared nervous fibres usually convey impressions only in one direction either centrally afferent or sensory nerve fibres or outwardly efferent or motor nerve fibres but the socalled motor nerve fibres include not only those that set muscles in motion but those that excite secretion check impulsive movements and govern nutrition   section 103 figure 7 sheet 8 shows the typical structure of nervous tissues the nerve fibres there figured are bound together by endoneurium into small ropes the nerves encased in perineurium there is always a grey axis cylinder ac which may in medullated nerves or may not in nonmedullated or grey nerves have a medullary sheath ss interrupted at intervals by the nodes of ranvier nr nuclei n at intervals under the sheath indicate the cells from which nerve fibres are derived by a process of elongation the nerves of invertebrata where they possess nerves are mostly grey and so are those of the sympathetic system of vertebrata to be presently described gc gc are ganglion cells they may have many hairlike processes usually running into continuity with the axis cylinders of nerve fibres in which case they are called multipolar cells or they may be uni or bipolar   section 104 the simplest example of the action of the nervous system is reflex action for instance when the foot of a frog or the hand of a soundly sleeping person is tickled very gently the limb is moved away from the irritation without any mental action and entirely without will being exercised and when we go from light into darkness the pupil of the eye enlarges without any direct consciousness of the change of its shape on our part similarly the presence or food in the pharynx initiates a series of movements swallowing the digestive movements and so on which in health are entirely beyond our mental scope   section 105 a vast amount of our activities are reflex and in such action an efferent stimulus follows an afferent promptly and quite mechanically it is only where efferent stimuli do not immediately become entirely transmuted into outwardly moving impulses that mental action comes in and an animal feels there appears to be a direct relation between sensation and motion for instance the shrieks and other instinctive violent motions produced by pain shunt off a certain amount of nervous impression that would otherwise register itself as additional painful sensation similarly most women and children understand the comfort of a good cry and its benefit in shifting off a disagreeable mental state   section 106 the mind receives and stores impressions and these accumulated experiences are the basis of memory comparison imagination thought and apparently spontaneous will voluntary actions differ from reflex by the interposition of this previously stored factor for instance when a frog sees a small object in front of him that may or may not be an edible insect the direct visual impression does not directly determine his subsequent action it revives a number of previous experiences an image already stored of similar insects and associated with painful or pleasurable gustatory experiences with these arise an emotional effect of desire or repulsion which passes into action of capture or the reverse   section 107 voluntary actions may by constant repetition become quasireflex in character the intellectual phase is abbreviated away habits are once voluntary and deliberated actions becoming mechanical in this way and slipping out of the sphere of mind for instance many of the detailed movements of writing and walking are performed without any attention to the details an excessive concentration of the attention upon one thing leads to absentmindedness and to its consequent absurdities of inappropriate because imperfectly acquired reflexes   section 108 this fluctuating scope of mind should be remembered more especially when we are considering the probable mental states of the lower animals an habitual or reflex action may have all the outward appearance of deliberate adjustment we cannot tell in any particular case how far the mental comes in or whether it comes in at all seeing that in our own case consciousness does not enter into our commonest and most necessary actions into breathing and digestion for instance and scarcely at all in the details of such acts as walking and talking we might infer that nature was economical in its use and that in the case of such an animal as the rabbit which follows a very limited routine and in which scarcely any versatility in emergencies is evident it must be relatively inconsiderable perhaps after all pain is not scattered so needlessly and lavishly throughout the world as the enemies of the vivisectionist would have us believe    7 the nervous system  section 109 a little more attention must now be given to the detailed anatomy of the peripheral and central nerve ends a nerve as we have pointed out terminates centrally in some ganglion cell either in a ganglion or in the spinal cord or brain peripherally there is a much greater variety of ending we may have tactile touch ends of various kinds and the similar olfactory and gustatory end organs or the nerve may conduct efferent impressions and terminate in a gland which it excites to secretion in a muscle endplate or in fact anywhere where kataboly can be set going and energy disengaged we may now briefly advert to the receptive nerve ends   section 110 many sensory nerves doubtless terminate in fine ends among the tissues there are also special touch corpuscles ovoid bodies around which a nerve twines or within which it terminates   section 111 the eye figure 8 has a tough dense outer coat the sclerotic sc within which is a highly vascular and internally pigmented layer the choroid upon which the percipient nervous layer the retina r rests the chief chamber of the eye is filled with a transparent jelly the vitreous humour vh in front of the eye the white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea c the epidermis is continued over the outer face of this as a thin transparent epithelium the choroid coat is continued in front by a ringshaped muscle the iris ir the coloured portion of the eyes this iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture the black pupil by reflex action as the amount of light diminishes or increases immediately behind this curtain is the crystalline lens l the curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the ciliary muscle cm in front of the lens is the aqueous humour ah the description of the action of this apparatus involves the explanation of several of the elementary principles of optics and will be found by the student in any textbook of that subject here it would have no very instructive bearing either on general physiological considerations or upon anatomical fact   section 112 the structure of the retina demands fuller notice figure 9 shows an enlarged diagram of a small portion of this the percipient part of the eye the optic nerve on in figure 8 enters the eye at a spot called the blind spot bs and the nerve fibres spread thence over the inner retinal surface from this layer of nerve fibres on in figure 9 threads run outward through certain clear and granular layers to an outermost stratum of little rods r and fusiform bodies called cones c lying side by side the whole of the retina consists of quite transparent matter and it is this outermost layer of rods and cones r and c that receives and records the visual impression this turning of the recipient ends away from the light is hardly what one would at first expect it seems such a roundabout arrangement but it obtains in all vertebrata and it is a striking point of comparison with the ordinary invertebrate eye   section 113 we may pause to call the students attention to a little point in the physiology of nerves very happily illustrated here the function of a nerve fibre is the conduction of impressions pure and simple the light radiates through the fibrous layer of the retina without producing the slightest impression and at the blind spot where the rods and cones are absent and the nerve fibres are gathered together no visual impressions are recorded if there is any doubt as to the existence of a blind spot in the retinal picture the proof is easy let the reader shut his left eye and regard these two asterisks fixing his gaze intently upon the lefthand one of them          at a distance of three or four inches from the paper both spots will be focussed on his retina the left one in the centre of vision and the right one at some spot internal to this and he will see them both distinctly now if he withdraws his head slowly the right spot will of course appear to approach the left and at a distance of ten or twelve inches it will in its approach pass over the blind spot and vanish to reappear as he continues to move his head away from the paper the function of nerve fibres is simply conduction and the nature of the impressions they convey is entirely determined by the nature of their distal and proximal terminations   section 114 certain small muscles in the orbit eyesocket move the eye and by their action contribute to our perception of the relative position of objects there is a leash of four muscles rising from a spot behind the exit of the optic nerve from the cranium to the upper under anterior and posterior sides of the eyeball these are the superior inferior anterior and posterior recti running from the front of the orbit obliquely to the underside of the eyeball is the inferior oblique muscle corresponding to it above is a superior oblique a lachrymal gland lies in the posteroinferior angle of the orbit and a handerian gland in the corresponding position in front in addition to the upper and lower eyelids of the human subject the rabbit has a third the nictitating lid in the anterior corner of the eye   section 115 the ear sheet vii consists of an essential organ of hearing and of certain superadded parts the essential part is called the internal ear and is represented in all the true vertebrata ie excluding the lancelet and its allies in the lower forms it is a hollow membranous structure embedded in a mass of cartilage the otic capsule in the mammal the latter is entirely ossified to form the periotic bone the internal ear consists of a central sac from which three semicircular canals spring the planes of the three canals are mutually at right angles two are vertical the anterior and posterior pvc vertical canals and one is horizontal the horizontal canal hc there are dilatations called ampullae at the anterior base of the anterior and at the posterior base of the posterior and horizontal canals indirectly connected with the main sac is a spirallytwisted portion resembling a snail shell in form the cochlea this last part is distinctive of the mammalia but the rest of the internal ear is represented in all vertebrata with one or two exceptions the whole of the labyrinth is membranous and contains a fluid the endolymph between the membranous wall of the labyrinth and the enclosing bone is a space containing the perilymph strange as it may appear at first the entire lining of the internal ear is at an early stage continuous with the general epidermis of the animal it grows in just as a gland might grow in and is finally cut off from the exterior but a considerable relic of this former communication remains as a thin vertical blind tube not shown in the figure the ductus endolymphaticus   section 116 the eighth nerve runs from the brain case cr into the periotic bone and is distributed to the several portions of this labyrinth in an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find the soundwaves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves but in all airfrequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air a receiving apparatus is needed and is supplied by the eardrum middle ear or tympanic cavity t in the mammal there is also a collecting ear trumpet the ear commonly socalled the external ear and external auditory meatus eam a tightly stretched membrane the tympanic membrane separates this from the drum a chain of small bones the malleus m the incus i the os orbiculare oor a very small bone and a stirrupshaped stapes swing across the tympanum from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear at two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete at the fenestra rotunda fr and at the fenestra ovalis fo into which latter the end of the stapes fits and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph a passage the eustachian tube communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx ph and serves to equalize the pressure on either side of the drumhead a comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that as we descend in the animal scale the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw and the drum and eustachian tube by a gill slit we have in fact in the ear as the student will perceive in the sequel an essentially aquatic auditory organ added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water   section 117 the impressions of smell are conducted through the first nerve to the brain and are first received by special hairbearing cells in the olfactory mucous membrane of the upper part of the nasal passage the sense of taste has a special nerve in the ninth the fibres of which terminate in special cells and cell aggregates in the little papillae velvet pilelike processes that cover the tongue   section 118 at an early stage in development the brain of a mammal consists of a linear arrangement of three hollow vesicles figure 5 sheet viii 1 2 and 3 which are the fore mid and hindbrain respectively the cavities in these in these vesicles are continuous with a hollow running through the spinal cord on the dorsal side of the forebrain is a structure to be dealt with more fully later the pineal gland pg while on its under surface is the pituitary body pt   section 119 the lower figure of 5 shows in a diagrammatic manner the derivation of the adult brain from this primitive state from the forebrain vesicle a hollow outgrowth on either side gives rises to the paired cerebral hemisphere ch which is prolonged forward as the olfactory lobe ol from the forebrain the retina of the eye and the optic nerve also originate as an at first hollow outgrowth op the roof of the midbrain is also thickened and bulges up to form two pairs of thickenings the corpora quadrigemina cq the hindbrain sends up in front a median outgrowth which develops lateral wings the cerebellum cbm behind which the remainder of the hindbrain is called the medulla oblongata and passes without any very definite demarcation into the spinal cord   section 120 figure 1 is a corresponding figure of the actual state of affairs in the adult the brain is seen in median vertical section ch is the right cerebral hemisphere an inflated vesicle which in the mammal but not in our lower types reaches back over the rest of the forebrain and also over the midbrain and hides these and the pineal gland in the dorsal view of the brain figure 2 the hollow of the hemisphere on either side communicates with the third ventricle the original cavity of the forebrain 1 in figure 5 by an aperture the foramen of monro indicated by a black arrow fm besides their original communication through the intermediation of the forebrain the hemispheres are also united above its roof by a broad bridge of fibre the corpus callosum cc which is distinctive of the mammalian animals the original forebrain vesicle has its lateral walls thickened to form the optic thalami oth between which a middle commissure mc absent in lower types stretches like a great beam across the third ventricle the original forebrain is often called the thalamencephalon the hemisphere the prosencephalon the olfactory lobes the rhinencephalon   section 121 the parts of midbrain mesencephalon will be easily recognised its cavity is in the adult mammal called the iter its floor is differentiated into bundles of fibres the crura cerebri ccb figured also in figure 4   section 122 the cerebellum metencephalon consists of a central mass the vermis vcbm and it also has lateral lobes ll prolonged into flocculi fcbm which lastare embedded in pits in the periotic bone and on that account render the extraction of the brain from the cranium far more difficult than it would otherwise be the roof of the hindbrain before and behind the cerebellum consists of extremely thin plates of nervous matter its floor is greatly thickened to form the mass of the medulla and in front a great transverse track of fibres is specialized the pons varolii pv its cavity is called the fourth ventricle   section 123 figure 2 gives a dorsal view of the rabbits brain a horizontal slice has been taken at the level of the corpus callosum the lateral ventricle ie the hollows of the hemisphere is not yet opened a lower cut figure 3 exposes this vl the level of these slices is approximately indicated in figure 1 by the lines a and b this latter figure will repay careful examination the arrow ar plunges into the third ventricle behind the great middle commissure mc and the barb is supposed to lie under the roof of the midbrain the corpora quadrigemina cq the position of ar is also indicated in figure 1 before reading on the beginner should stop a while here he should carefully copy or trace our figures and putting the book aside name the parts and he should then recopy on an enlarged scale and finally draw from memory correct and again draw by doing this before the brain is dissected a considerable saving of time is possible   section 124 proceeding from the brain are twelve pairs of cranial nerves from the forebrain spring two pairs which differ from the rest of the cranial nerves in being first of all hollow outgrowths of the brain the others are from the beginning solid the first nerve is the olfactory lobe which sends numerous filaments through the ethmoid bone to the olfactory organ the second is the optic nerve the visual sensory nerve   section 125 the midbrain gives rise to only one nerve the third which supplies all the small muscles of the eye see section 114 except the superior oblique and external rectus   section 126 the remainder of the nerves spring from the hindbrain the fourth pair supply the superior obliques and the sixth the external recti so that iii iv and vi are alike purely motor nerves small and distributed to the orbit the fifth nerve the trigeminal is a much larger and more important one it is a mixed nerve having three main branches of which the first two are chiefly sensory the third almost entirely motor it lies deeply in the orbit v1 see sheet 9 runs up over the recti behind the eyeball it is the ophthalmic branch v2 the maxillary branch runs deeply under the eyeball and emerges in front of the malar and v3 the mandibular branch runs down on the inner side of the jawbone to the jaw muscles and tongue   section 127 if the student will now recur to the figures of the dogs skull sheet 6 he will see certain apertures indicated in the cranial wall of these of is the optic foramen for the exit of nerve ii perforating the orbitosphenoid behind this there comes an irregular aperture fla the foramen lacerum anterius giving exit to iii iv vi and v1 v2 emerges from the foramen rotundum and v3 from the foramen ovale two apertures uniting behind a bony screen just in front of the bulla is a foramen lacerum medium flm through which no nerve passes   in the rabbits skull fl anterius the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale are not distinct and there are two condylar foramina instead of one through each of which a moiety of xii passes   section 128 the eighth nerve auditory is purely sensory the nerve of the special sense of hearing it runs into the periotic bone and breaks up on the labyrinth the seventh nerve facial is almost entirely motor it passes through the periotic anterior to viii and emerges by the stylomastoid foramen smf behind the bulla to run outside the great jaw muscle across the cheek immediately under the skin figure 1   section 129 the ninth glossopharyngeal nerve is chiefly sensory it is the special nerve of taste and is distributed to the tongue the tenth nerve vagus arises by a number of roots and passes out of the skull together with ix and xi by the foramen lacerum posterium posterius flp it is a conspicuous white nerve and runs down the neck by the side of the common carotid artery it sends a superior laryngeal branch xa to the larynx the left vagus passes ventral to the aortic arch and sends a branch lxb under this along the trachea to the larynx the recurrent laryngeal nerve the corresponding nerve on the right rxb loops under the subclavian artery the main vagus after this branching passes behind the heart to the oesophagus and along it to the stomach xi the spinal accessory supplies certain of the neck nerves xii the hypoglossal runs out of the skull by the condylar foramen cf is motor crosses the roots of xi x and ix passes ventral to the carotid and breaks up among the muscles of the tongue and neck   section 130 of the functions of the several parts of the brain there is still very considerable doubt with disease or willful destruction of the cerebral tissue the personal initiative is affected the animal becomes more distinctly a mechanism the cerebellum is probably concerned in the coordination of muscular movements and the medulla is a centre for the higher and more complicated respiratory reflexes yawning coughing and so on the great majority of reflex actions centre however in the spinal cord and do not affect the brain   section 131 a cross section of the spinal cord is shown in figure 6 sheet 8 it is a cylinder almost bisected by a dorsal df and a ventral vf fissure through its centre runs a central canal cc continuous with the brain ventricles and lined by ciliated epithelium the spinal cord consists of an outer portion mainly of nervous fibres the white matter and of inner ganglionated and more highly vascular grey matter in the cerebrum the grey matter is external and the white internal the cord like the brain is surrounded by a vascular fibrous investment and protected from concussion by a serous fluid the nerves which emerge from the vertebral column between the vertebrae arise unlike the cranial nerves by two roots the dorsal of these the sensory root dn has a swelling upon it the dorsal ganglion and by experiments upon living animals has been shown to contain only afferent fibres the ventral the motor root is without a ganglion and entirely or mainly motor the two unite outside the cord and thereafter the spinal nerves are both sensory and motor   section 132 besides the great mass of brain and spinal cord cerebrospinal axis there is on either side of the dorsal wall of the body cavity a sympathetic nervous chain the nerve fibres of this system like the nerve fibres of invertebrates are nonmedullated it may be seen as a greyish thread running close by the common carotid in the neck sym figure 1 it then runs over the heads of the ribs in the thorax and close beside the dorsal aorta in the abdominal region in the anterior region of the neck it dilates to form a superior cervical ganglion and opposite the first rib it forms an inferior cervical ganglion thence backwards there is a ganglion on each sympathetic chain opposite each spinal nerve and the two exchange fibres through a thread the ramus communicans to the sympathetic chain is delegated much of the routine work of reflex control of the bloodvessels and other viscera which would otherwise fall upon the spinal cord   section 133 there are eight cervical spinal nerves one in front of the atlas and one behind each of the cervical vertebrae the last four and the first thoracic spinal contribute to a leash of nerves running out to the fore limb the brachial plexus plexus literally network but here meaning a plaited cord the fourth cervical also sends down a phrenic nerve pn figure 1 along by the external jugular vein and the superior caval vein to the diaphragm the last three lumbar and the sacral nerves form a sacral plexus supplying the hind limb   section 134 from the sympathetic in the hinder region of the thorax a nerve the great splanchnic nerve arises and runs back to a ganglionated nervous network just behind the coeliac artery into which the vagus also enters this is the coeliac ganglion and together with a similar superior mesenteric ganglion around the corresponding artery makes up a subsidiary visceral nervous network the solar plexus a similar and smaller nervous tangle bearing an inferior mesenteric ganglion lies near the inferior mesenteric artery   section 135 finally we may note the pineal gland and the pituitary body as remarkable appendages above and below the thalamencephalon their function if they have a function is altogether unknown probably they are inherited from ancestors to whom they were of value such structures are called reduced or vestigial structures and among other instances are the clavicles of the rabbit the hair on human limbs the little pulpy nodule in the corner of the human eye representing the rabbits third eyelid and the caudal vertebrae at the end of the human spinal column in certain lowly reptiles in the lampreys and especially in a peculiar new zealand lizard the pineal gland has the most convincing resemblance to an eye both in its general build and in the microscopic structure of its elements and it seems now more than probable that this little vascular pimple in our brains is a relic of a third and median eye possessed by ancestral vertebrata the pituitary body is probably equivalent to a ciliated pit we shall describe in the lacelet amphioxus    8 renal and reproductive organs  section 136 we have now really completed our survey of the individual animals mechanism but no animal that was merely complete in itself would be long sanctioned by nature for an animal species to survive there must evidently also be proper provision for the production of young and the preservation of the species as well as of the individual hence in an animals physiology and psychology we meet with a vast amount of unselfish provision and its structure and happiness are more essentially dependent on the good of its kind than on its narrow personal advantage the mammalia probably owe their present dominant position in the animal kingdom to the exceptional sacrifices made by them for their young instead of laying eggs and abandoning them before or soon after hatching the females retain the eggs within their bodies until the development of the young is complete and thereafter associate with them for the purposes of nourishment protection and education in the matter of the tail for instance already noted the individual rabbit incurs the disadvantage of conspicuousness for the rear in order to further the safety of the young   section 137 the female organs of reproduction are shown in sheet 10 the essential organ is the ovary ov in which the ova eggs are formed figure 3 gives an enlarged and still more diagrammatic rendering of the ovary there is a supporting ground mass or stroma into which numerous bloodvessels and nerves enter and break up the ova appear first as small cells in the external substance of the ovary as at 1 and move inward 2 and 3 surrounded by a number of sister cells which afford them nourishment at 4 an ovum with its surrounding group of cells is more distinct and near the centre of the ovary a fluid is appearing within the ovisac as the development proceeds 5 is a much more mature ovisac or graafian follicle  section 138 the ovum ov is now large and its nucleus and nucleolus the germinal vesicle and spot are very distinct the wall of the follicle consists in the mammal of several layers of cells the membrana granulosa or granulosa simply the ovum lies on its outer side embedded in a mass of cells discus proligerus separated from actual contact with the ovum by a zona pellucida the ripening follicle moves to the surface of the ovary and bursts the ovum falls into the body cavity in figure 2 a ripe graafian follicle gf projects upon the ovary   section 139 the liberated ovum is caught up by the funnelshaped opening of the fallopian tube which passes without any very conspicuous demarcation into the cornu uteri cut of its side the two uterine cornua meeting together in the middle line form the vagina v which runs out into a vestibule vb opening between tumid lips to the exterior the urinary bladder urb also opens into the vestibule and receives the two ureters from the kidney   section 140 in the male we find in the position of the female uterus a uterus masculinus um the essential sexual organ is the testis t a compact mass of coiling tubuli which opens by a number of ducts the vasa efferentia into a looser and softer epididymis ep which sends the sexual product onward through a vas deferens vd to open at the base of the uterus masculinus the urinary bladder and ureters correspond with those of the female and the common urogenital duct  vestibule the urethra is prolonged into an erectile penis p surrounded by a fold of skin the prepuce a prostate gland pr contributes to the male sexual fluid the character of the essential male element the spermatozoon the general nature of the reproductive process will be conveniently deferred until the chapters upon development are reached    9 classificatory points  section 141 the following facts of classificatory importance may now be considered but their full force will be better appreciated after the study of other vertebrate types they are such as come prominently forward in the comparison of the rabbit with other organisms   section 142 in the first place the rabbit is a metazoon one of the metazoa ie a multicellular organism as compared with the amoeba which belongs to the protozoa or onecell animals section 55 in the next place it is externally bilaterally symmetrical its parts balance and where in its internal anatomy it departs from this symmetry as in the case of the aorta the stomach and intestines and the kidneys the departure has an appearance of being the results of partial reductions and distortions of an originally quite symmetrical plan and the facts of development strengthen this idea in the very earliest stages we have paired aortic arches of which the left only remains a straight alimentary canal and less asymmetrical kidneys in the vast majority of animals the same bilateral symmetry is to be seen but in the starfish and seaurchins and in the jellyfish corals sea anemones and hydra the general form of the animal is instead arranged round a centre like a star and its rays and the symmetry is called radial   section 143 we also see in various organs of the rabbit and especially in the case of the limbs and vertebral column what is called metameric segmentation that is a repetition of parts one behind the other along the axis of the body thus the bodies and arches of the vertebrae repeat each other and so do the spinal nerves the renal organ of the rabbit some time before birth displays a metameric arrangement of its parts but this disappears as development proceeds into the compact kidney of the adult but the metameric segmentation in the rabbits organism is not nearly so marked as that of an earthworm for instance which is visibly a chain of rings if the student wants a perfect figure of metameric segmentation he should think of a train of precisely similar carriages or a string of beads one bead one carriage one vertebra would be a metamere   section 144 in contrast to metameric segmentation is the antimeric repetition of radial symmetry section 142 in which each ray of the star is called an antimere it is possible to have bilateral symmetry without a metameric arrangement of parts as in the mussel and the cuttlefish but metameric segmentation without complete or reduced bilateral symmetry does not occur   section 145 we are now in a position to appreciate the fact that the old and more popularly know division of animals into vertebrata and invertebrata scarcely represents the facts of the case that the primary division should be into protozoa and metazoa and that the vertebrata are one of several groups of metazoa with a fundamental bilateral symmetry and imperfect metameric segmentation  the rabbit is one of the vertebrata and in common with all the other animals collected under this head it has     a a skeletal axis the vertebral column between its central    nervous system and its body cavity in the adult rabbit this    consists of a chain of vertebrae but in the embryo ie the    young rabbit before birth it is represented by a continuous chord    the notochord and it remains as such in some of the lowest    vertebrata throughout life in other words in these lower    vertebrata the vertebral axis is not metameric     b a dorsal and tubular nervous axis section 131 the central    canal     c it has though in the embryo only certain slits between the    throat and the exterior like the gill slits of a fish such    slits are with one or two remarkable exceptions outside the    subkingdom distinctly vertebrate features and remain of course    in fishes throughout life  the presence of true cartilage and bone mark a vertebrate but vertebrata occur in which these tissues bone are is absent   section 146 the rabbit shares the following features with all the vertebrata except the true fishes which do not possess any of them     a lungs but many fish have a swimming bladder which answers    to the lungs in its anatomical relations     b limbs which consist of a proximal joint of one bone an    intermediate part of two and a distal portion which has five    digits or is evidently a reduced form of the fivedigit limb     c the absence of a median fin supported by fin rays      the frog shows indications of a sixth digit     the frogs tadpole has a median fin but no fin rays   section 147 the rabbit shares the following features with all the vertebrata above the fishes and amphibia  frogs toads newts and etc     a absence of gills not gill slits note at any stage in    development     b an amnion and     c an allantois in development  the meaning of b and c we shall explain to the student in the chapters on embryology we simply mention them here to render our table complete   section 148 the rabbit shares with all mammals and differs from all other vertebrata ie birds reptiles amphibia and fishes in having     a hair     b a diaphragm     c only one aortic arch and that on the left side of the body     d its young born alive but two very reptilelike mammals of    australia the duckbilled platypus and the echidna lay eggs and    certain fish and reptiles bear living young     e epiphyses to its vertebral centre centra     f the cerebral hemispheres covering the midbrain     g corpora quadrigemina instead of bigemina     h a corpus callosum     i a spirally coiled cochlea to the internal ear     in respect to h and i also the echidna and platypus are scarcely    mammalinan      but certain mammals have no such epiphyses   section 149 the rabbit together with the hares and conies rats and mice voles squirrels beavers cavies guineapigs is included in that order of the class of mammals which is called the rodentia and is distinguished by the character of the incisor teeth from other orders of the class    10 questions and exercises  1 describe the venous

  many of the above questions were actually set at london    university examinations in biology in both editions    the frog  1 general anatomy  section 1 we will now study the adult anatomy of the frog and throughout we shall make constant comparisons with that of the rabbit in the rabbit we have a distinctly landloving burrowing animal it eats purely vegetable food and drinks but little in the frog we have a mainly insectivorous type living much in the water this involves the moister skin the shorter alimentary canal and the abbreviated neck rabbit section 2 of the frog the tail is absent in a fish it would do the work the frog accomplishes with his hind legs and the apertures which are posterior in the rabbit run together into one dorsal opening the cloaca there is of course rabbit section 4 no hair the skin is smooth and an external ear is also absent the remarkable looseness of the frogs skin is due to great lymph spaces between it and the body wall   section 2 if we now compare the general anatomy of the frog vide sheet 11 with that of the rabbit we notice that the diaphragm is absent rabbit section 4 and the body cavity or coelom is with the exception of the small bag of the pericardium round the heart one continuous space the forked tongue is attached in front of the lower jaw and can be flicked out and back with great rapidity in the capture of the small insects upon which the frog lives the posterior nares open into the front of the mouth there is no long nasal chamber and no palate and there is no long trachea between the epiglottis and the lungs the oesophagus is less distinct and passes gradually so far as external appearances go into the baglike stomach which is much less inflated and transverse than that of the rabbit the duodenum is not a ushaped loop but makes one together with the stomach the pancreas lies between it and the stomach and is more compact than the rabbits there is no separate pancreatic duct but the bile duct runs through the pancreas and receives a series of ducts from that gland as it does so the ileum is shorter there is no sacculus rotundus and the large intestine has no caecum none of the characteristic sacculations of the rabbits colon and does not loop back to the stomach before the rectum section commences the anus opens not upon the exterior but into a cloacal chamber the urinary and genital ducts open separately into this cloaca and dorsally and posteriorly to the anus the socalled urinary bladder is ventral to the intestine in a position answering to that of the rabbit but it has no connection with the ureters and it is twohorned   section 3 the spleen is a small round body not so intimately bound to the stomach as in the rabbit but in essentially the same position   section 4 much that we knew of the physiology of the frog is arrived at mainly by inferences from our mammalian knowledge its histology is essentially similar ciliated epithelium is commoner and occurs more abundantly than in the rabbit in the roof of the mouth for instance and its red blood corpuscles are much larger oval and nucleated   section 5 the lungs of the frog are baglike shelves and spongy partitions project into their cavities but this structure is much simpler than that of the rabbits lung in which the branching bronchi the imperfect cartilaginous rings supporting them alveoli arteries and veins form together a quasisolid mass   section 6 the mechanism of respiration is fundamentally different from that of the mammal the method is as follows the frog opens its anterior nares and depresses the floor of the mouth which therefore fills with air the anterior nares are then closed and the floor mouth rises and forces the air into the lungs the frog therefore swallows its air rather than inhales it the respiratory instrument of the rabbit is a suction pump while that of the frog is a buccal force pump   section 7 the heart is not quadrilocular ie of four chambers but trilocular of three and two structures not seen in lepus the truncus arteriosus and the sinus venosus into the latter of which the venous blood runs before entering the right auricle are to be noted the single ventricle is blocked with bars of tissue that render its interior not an open cavity but a spongy mass figure 2 sheet 11 shows the heart opened lau and rau are the left and right auricles respectively the truncus arteriosus is seen to be imperfectly divided by a great longitudinospiral valve lsv pc is the pulmocutaneous artery going to the lungs supplying skin and lungs dao the dorsal aorta furnishing the supply of the body and limbs and ca the carotid artery going to the head all of which vessels compare figure 1 are paired   section 8 it might be inferred from this that pure and impure blood mix in the ventricle and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs head and extremities but this is not so the spongy nature of the ventricle sufficiently retards this mixing it will be noted that the opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart next come the aortic and carotid arches which have a common opening at a furthermore at cgl the carotid artery repeatedly divides to form a close meshwork of arterioles the carotid gland forming a spongelike plug in this vessel is a spongy mass of matter the carotid gland inserted upon the carotid hence the pulmonary arteries yawn nearest for the blood and being short wide vessels present the least resistance to the first rush of blood mainly venous blood for the right auricle as they fill up the back resistance in them becomes equal and then greater than the resistance at a and the rush of blood now of a mixed quality passes through that aperture it selects the dorsal aorta because the carotid arch plugged by the carotid gland offers the greater resistance presently however the back resistance of the filled dorsal aorta rises above this and the last flow of blood from the ventricular systole almost purely oxygenated blood for the left auricle goes on towards the head   section 9 at the carotid gland the carotid artery splits into an a external carotid lingual ec and a deeper internal carotid the dorsal aorta passes round on each side of the oesophagus as indicated by the dotted lines in figure 2 sheet 11 and meets its fellow dorsal to the liver each arch gives off subclavian arteries to the limbs and the left immediately before meeting the right gives off the coeliacomesenteric artery to the alimentary canal this origin of the coeliacomesenteric artery a little to the left is the only asymmetry want of balance in the arterial system of the frog as contrasted with the very extensive asymmetry of the great vessels near the heart of the rabbit posteriorly the dorsal aorta forks into two common iliac arteries right and left supplying the hind limbs   section 10 figure 3 gives a side view of the frog to display the circulation     lines from second edition only    the venous return to the heart as in the rabbit is by paired venae    cavae anteriores and by a single vena cava inferior the factors of the    anterior cava on either side are an external jugular exj an    innominate vein inv and subclavian sclv the last receives not    only the brachial vein bv from the fore limb but also a large vein    bringing blood for the skin the cutaneous pv the innominate vein    has also two chief factors the internal jugular lijv and the    subscapular ssv the blood returns from each hind limb by a    sciatic lsc or femoral fm vein and either passes to a renal portal    vein lrp which breaks into capillaries in the kidney or by a paired    pelvic vein lpv in figures 1 and 3 which meets its fellow in the    middle line to form the anterior abdominal vein aabv going forward    and uniting with the median portal vein pv to enter the liver  the vessels are named in the references to the figure which should be carefully copied and mastered here we need only comparing with the rabbit we would especially call attention to the fact that the vena cava inferior extends posteriorly only to the kidney and that there is a renal portal system the blood from the hind limbs either flows by the anterior abdominal vein to the portal vein and liver or it passes by the renal portal vein to the kidney there the vein breaks up and we find in the frogs kidney just as we find in the frogs and rabbits liver a triple system of a nutritive arterial b afferent venous and c efferent venous vessels   a ad  to  e ex  out of   this section missing from second edition section 11 it is not very improbable that the kidney of the frog shares or performs some of the functions of the rabbits liver or parallel duties in addition to the simply excretory function since specialization of cells must be mainly the relatively excessive exaggeration of some one of the general properties of the undifferentiated cell it is not a difficult thing to imagine a gradual transition as we move from one organism to another of the functions of glands and other cellular organs it is probable that the mammalian kidney is physiologically a much less important though still quite essential organ than the structures which correspond to it in position and development in the lower vertebrate types   section 12 the lymphatic system is extensively developed in the frog but in the place of a complete system of distinctly organized vessels there are great lymph sinuses compare section 1 in figure 5 sheet 12 the position of two lymph hearts lh lh which pump lymph into the adjacent veins is shown   section 13 the skull of the frog will repay a full treatment and will be dealt with by itself later the vertebral column sheet 12 consists of nine vertebrae the centra of which have faces not flat but hollow in front procoelous and evidently without epiphyses compare the rabbit the anterior is sometimes called the atlas but it is evidently not the homologue of the atlas of the rabbit since the first spinal nerve has a corresponding distribution to the twelfth cranial of the mammal and since therefore it is probable that the mammalian skull  the frogs skull  one or more vertebrae incorporated with it posteriorly the vertebral column terminates in the urostyle a calcified unsegmented rod the vertebrae have transverse processes but no ribs   section 14 the forelimb figure 6 sheet 12 consists of an upper segment of one bone the humerus as in the rabbit a middle section the radius and ulna fused here into one bone and not as in the mammalian type separable of a carpus and of five digits of which the fourth is the longest the shoulder girdle is more important and complete than that of the higher type there is a scapula sc with an unossified cartilaginous suprascapula ssc the anterior border of the scapula answers to the acromion on the ventral side a cartilaginous rod embraced by the clavicle cl a membrane bone in this type runs to the sternum and answers to the clavicle of the rabbit in the place of the rabbits coracoid process is a coracoid bone co which reaches from the glenoid cavity to the sternum it is hidden on the right side of figure 6 which is a dorsal view of the shoulder girdle there is a preomosternum ost and a postomosternum sometimes termed a xiphisternum x   section 15 figure 7 shows the pelvic girdle and limb of the frog there is a femur f tibia and fibula t and f are completely fused the proximal bones of the tarsus the astragalus as and calcaneum cal are elongated there are five long digits and in the calcar c an indication of a sixth with considerable modifications of form the three leading constituents of the rabbits pelvic girdle occur in relatively identical positions the greatly elongated ilium il articulates with the single compare rabbit sacral vertebra sv in figure 5 the ischium is is relatively smaller than in the rabbit and the pubis pu is a ventral wedge of unossified cartilage the shape of the pelvic girdle of the frog is a wide departure from that found among related forms in connection with the leaping habit the ilia are greatly elongated and the pubes and ischia much reduced generally throughout the airfrequenting vertebrata we find the same arrangement of these three bones usually in the form of an inverted y the ilium above the ischium and pubis below and the acetabulum at the junction of the three   section 16 the urogenital organs of the frog and especially those of the male correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit in this sex the testes t sheet 13 lie in the body cavity and are white bodies usually dappled with black pigment vasa efferentia ve run to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney which answers therefore to the rabbits epididymis the hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ there is a common urogenital duct into which a seminal vesicle which is especially large in early spring opens this is the permanent condition of the frog in the rabbit for urogenital duct we have ureter and vas deferens the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney the epididymis shift back into the scrotal sacs and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder carrying the genital ducts looped over them the oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina as they do in the rabbit in front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum cad which acts as a fat store and is peculiar to the frogs and toads the distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season early march enormously distended with ova and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves the distal end of the oviduct is therefore not unfrequently styled the uterus there is no penis in the male fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male the male has a pad black in winter shown in figure 1 which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex   section 17 the spinal cord has a general similarity to that of the rabbit the ratio of its size to that of the brain is larger and the nerves number ten pairs altogether the first of these sp 1 in figure 2 sheet 12  first edition error 13 corresponds in distribution with the rabbits hypoglossal nerve a point we shall refer to again when we speak of the skull the second and third constitute the brachial plexus the last three form the sciatic plexus going to the hind limb   section 18 the same essential parts are to be found in the brain of both frog and rabbit but in the former the adult is not so widely modified from the primitive condition as in the latter the forebrain consists of a thalamencephalon thc and 1 which is exposed in the dorsal view of the brain and which has no middle commissure the cerebral hemispheres ch are not convoluted do not extend back to cover parts behind them as they do in the rabbit and are not connected above the roof of the thalamencephalon by a corpus callosum moreover the parts usually regarded as the olfactory lobes rh fuse in the middle line the midbrain gives rise to the third nerve and has the optic lobes on its dorsal side but these are hollow and they are not subdivided by a transverse groove into corpora quadrigemina as in the rabbit in the hindbrain the cerebellum is a mere band of tissue without lateral lobes or flocculi and the medulla gives origin only to nerves four to ten there is no eleventh nerve and the hypoglossal is the first spinal from which it has been assumed that the rabbits medulla equals that of the frog plus a portion of the spinal cord incorporated with it the hypoglossal is very distinctly seen on opening the skin beneath the hyoid plate   section 19 the first second third and fourth cranial nerves of the frog correspond with those of the rabbit in origin and distribution so do five six and eight the seventh nerve forks over the eardrum the larger branch emerging behind it and running superficially as shown in figure 4 there is also a deeper palatine branch of vii p running under v2 and v3 below the orbit and to be seen together with v1 and v2 after removal of the eyeball the ninth nerve similarly forks over the first branchial slit of the tadpole and evidence of the fork remains in the frog it is seen curving round anterior to the hypoglossal nerve and lying rather deeper in dissection the vagus tenth nerve is distributed to heart lungs and viscera in the tadpole it also sends for forking branches over the second third and fourth branchial slits it lies deeper than ix and internal to the veins and runs close beside the cutaneous artery most of these nerves are easily dissected and no student should rest satisfied until he has actually seen them   section 20 the sympathetic chain is closely connected with the aorta it is of course paired and is easily found in dissection by lifting the dorsal aorta and looking at its mesentery in the presence of ganglia corresponding to the spinal nerves and of rami communicantes it resembles that of the rabbit   section 21 the whole of this chapter is simply a concise comparison of frog and rabbit in addition to reading it the student should very carefully follow the annotations to the figures and should copy and recopy these side by side with the corresponding diagrams of the other types    2 the skull of the frog and the vertebrate skull generally  section 22 we have already given a description of the mammalian skull and we have stated where the origin of the several bones was in membrane and where in cartilage but a more complete comprehension of the mammalian skull becomes possible with the handling of a lower type we propose now first to give some short account of the development and structure of the skull of the frog and then to show briefly how its development and adult arrangement demonstrate the mammalian skull to be a fundamentally similar structure complicated and disguised by further development and readjustment   section 23 figure 1i sheet 14 shows a dorsal view of a young tadpole cranium the brain has been removed and it is seen that it was supported simply upon two cartilaginous rods the trabeculae cranii trc behind these trabeculae comes the notochord nc and around its anterior extremity is a paired tract of cartilage the parachordals pc these structures underlying the skull are all that appears at first of the brain box in front and separate from the cranium are the nasal organs nc the eyes lie laterally to the trabeculae and laterally to the parachordals are two tracts of cartilage enclosing the internal ear the otic capsules   section 24 figure 1 ii is a more advanced phase of the same structures the trabeculae have met in front and sent forward a median ct and lateral parts ao to support the nasal organs they have also flattened out very considerably and have sent up walls on either side of the brain to meet above it and form an incomplete roof t over it the parachordals have similarly grown up round the hindbrain and formed a complete ring the roof of which is indicated by b further the otic capsules are fusing with the braincase with certain differences of form these elements the trabeculae the parachordals and the otic capsules are also the first formed structures of the mammalian cranium   section 25 in figures 1i and ii there appears beneath the eye a bar of cartilage pp the palatopterygoid cartilage which is also to be seen from the side in figures 8i and iii it will be learnt from these latter that this bar is joined in front to the cranium behind the nasal organ and behind to the otic capsule the cartilaginous bar from the palatopterygoid to the otic capsule is called the quadrate and at the point of junction at the posteroventral angle of the palatopterygoid articulates with the cartilaginous bar which is destined to form the substratum of the lower jaw meckels cartilage mc in figure 8i   section 26 figure 2 shows a dorsal view of these structures in a young frog the parts corresponding to these in 1ii will be easily made out but now ossification has set in at various points of this cartilaginous cranium in front of the otic capsule is the paired prootic bone po behind it at the sides of the parachordal ring is the paired exoccipital eo in front of the cranium box and behind the nasal capsules is a ring of bone the median but originally paired sphenethmoid se a paired ossification appears in the palatopterygoid cartilage the pterygoid bone pt while a splint of bone the quadratojugal appears at the angle of articulation with the lower jaw these are all the cartilage bones that appear in the cranium and upper jaw of the frog   section 27 but another series of bones developed first chiefly in dermal connective tissue and coming to plate over the cranium of cartilage are not shown in figure 2 they are however in figure 3 these membrane bones are along the dorsal middle line the parietofrontals pf originally two pairs of bones which fuse in development and the nasals na round the edge of the jaw and bearing the teeth are premaxillae pm and maxillae mx and overlying the quadrate cartilage and lateral to the otic capsules are the tshaped squamosal bones sq in the ventral view of the skull figure 4 we see a pair of vomers vo bearing teeth a pair of palatines pal and a pair of pterygoids pt which palatines and pterygoids we may note unlike those of the rabbit are stated to be membrane bones and a great median daggershaped parasphenoid psp these two figures and 5 which shows the same bones in side view should be carefully mastered before the student proceeds with this chapter the cartilage bones are distinguished from membrane bones by crossshading   section 28 turning now to figure 8i we have a side view of a tadpoles skull on the ventral side of the head is a series of vertical cartilaginous bars the visceral arches supporting the walls of the tadpoles gill slits the first of these is called the hyoid arch ch and the four following this the first br1 second third and fourth br4 branchial arches altogether there are four gill slits and between the hyoid arch and the jaw arch as it is called  meckels cartilage  the palatopterygoid is an imperforate slit which becomes the eardrum the frog no longer breathes by gills but by lungs and the gills are lost the gill slits closed and the branchial arches consequently much reduced figures 8 ii and 8 iii show stages in this reduction the hyoid arch becomes attached to the otic capsule and its median ventral plate including also the vestiges of the first second and fourth branchial arches is called the hyoid apparatus in figure 5 the apparatus is seen from the side ch is called the right anterior cornu of the hyoid the function of the hyoid apparatus in the frog is to furnish a basis of attachment to the tongue muscles it remains cartilaginous with the exception of the relic of one branchial arch which ossifies as the thyrohyal figure 7 thh it will be noted that as development proceeds the angle of the jaw swings backward and the hyoid apparatus shifts relatively forward these changes of position are indicated in figure 8 iii by little arrowheads   we may note here that comparing the ear of the frog with that of the rabbit there is no external ear there is moreover no bulla supporting the middle ear and the tympanic membrane stretches between the squamosal in front and the anterior cornu of the hyoid behind a rodlike columella auris replaces the chain of ear ossicles and may or may not answer to the stapes alone or even possibly to the entire series in the internal ear there is no cochlea and the otic mass is largely cartilaginous instead of entirely bony   plural cornua   section 29 before proceeding to the comparison of the mammalian skull with this we would strongly recommend the student thoroughly to master this portion of the work and in no way can he do this more thoroughly and quickly than by taking a parboiled frog picking off the skin muscle and connective tissue from its skull and making out the various bones with the help of our diagrams   section 30 figure 9 represents in the most diagrammatic way the main changes in form of the essential constituents of the craniofacial apparatus as we pass from the amphibian to the mammalian skull f is the frog from the side and behind bc is the braincase oc the otic capsule e the eye nc the nasal capsule pp the palatopterygoid cartilage mx the maxillary membrane bones sq the squamosal and mb the mandible the student should compare with figure 5 and convince himself that he appreciates the diagrammatic rendering of these parts now all the distinctive differences in form from this of the dogs skull d are reducible to two primary causes     1 the brain is enormously larger and the braincase is vastly    inflated so that        a the otic capsule becomes embedded in the braincase wall        b the palatopterygoid rod lies completely underneath the       braincase instead of laterally to it        c the squamosal tilts down and in instead of down and out       and the lower jaw articulates with its outer surface instead       of below its inner and moreover with the enormous distention       of the braincase it comes about that the squamosal is       incorporated with its wall     2 the maxilla anteriorly and the palatine posteriorly send down    palatine plates that grow in to form the bony palate cutting off    a nasal passage np from the mouth cavity mp and carrying the    posterior nares from the front part of the mouth as they are in the    frog to the pharynx hence the vomers of the dog lie not in the    ceiling of the mouth but in the floor of this nasal passage   section 31 the quadrate cartilage of the frog is superseded by the squamosal as the suspensorium of the lower jaw it is greatly reduced therefore but it is not entirely absent in the young mammal a quadrate cartilage can be traced connected with the palatopterygoid cartilage and articulating with meckels cartilage its position is of course beneath the squamosal and just outside the otic capsule as development proceeds the increase in size of the quadrate does not keep pace with that of the skull structures it loses its connection with the palatopterygoid and apparently ossifies as a small ossicle the incus of the middle ear a small nodule of cartilage cut off from the proximal end of meckels cartilage becomes the malleus the stapes would appear to be derived from the hyoid arch hence these small bones seem to be the relics of the discarded jaw suspensorium of the frog utilized in a new function considerable doubt however attaches to this interpretation doubt that if anything is gaining ground   section 32 the tympanic bulla of the dog is not indicated in diagram 9 and it would appear to be a new structure neomorph not represented in the frog   section 33 besides these great differences in form there are important differences in the amount and distribution of centres of ossification of the skull of frog and mammal there is no parasphenoid in the mammal and instead a complete series of ossifications the median basi and presphenoids and the lateral ali and orbitosphenoids occur the points can be rendered much more luminously in a diagram than in the text and we would counsel the student to compare this very carefully with that of the rabbit   faint vestigeal indications occur in the developing skulls of some insectivora   section 34     cranium        nasal paired vomer paired       frontoparietal sphenethmoid

the adult mammal     3 the frog has no lachrymal bone   section 36 we are now in a position to notice without any danger of misconception what is called the segmental theory of the skull older anatomists working from adult structure only conceived the idea that the braincase of the mammal represented three inflated vertebrae the most anterior had the presphenoid for its body the orbitosphenoids for its neural processes and the arch was completed above by the frontals frontal segment similarly the basisphenoids alisphenoids and parietals formed a second arch parietal segment and the ex basi and supraoccipitals a third occipital segment if this were correct in the frog which is a more primitive rendering of the vertebrate plan we should find the vertebral characters more distinct but as a matter of fact as the student will perceive frontal segment parietal segment and occipital segment can no longer be traced and the mode of origin from trabeculae and parachordals show very clearly the falsity of this view the vertebrate cranium is entirely different in nature from vertebrae the origin of the parietals and frontals as paired bones in membrane reinforces this conclusion   section 37 but as certainly as we have no such metameric segmentation as this older view implies in the braincase of the frog so quite as certainly is metameric segmentation evident in its branchial arches we have the four gill slits of the tadpole and their bars repeating one another the hyoid bar in front of these is evidently of a similar nature and that the ear drum is derived from an imperforate gill slit is enforced by the presence of an open slit the spiracle in the rays and dogfish in an entirely equivalent position does the mouth answer to a further pair of gill slits and is the jaw arch palatopterygoid  meckels cartilage equivalent to the arches that come behind it this question has been asked and answered in the affirmative by many morphologists but not by any means by all the cranial nerves have a curious similarity of arrangement with regard to the gill slits and the mouth the fifth nerve forks over the mouth the seventh forks over the ear drum the ninth in the tadpole and fish forks over the first branchial slit and the tenth is as it were a leash of nerves each forking over one of the remaining gill slits but this matter will be more intelligible when the student has worked over a fish type and need not detain us any further now   section 38 see also section 13 again in which is the suggestion that the occipital part of the skull is possibly a fusion of vertebrae a new view with much in its favour and obviously an entirely different one from the old segmental view of the entire skull discussed in section 36   questions on the frog     all these questions were actually set at london university    examinations in both editions  1 give an account with illustrative sketches of the digestive organs of the common frog specifying particularly

another in the two animals compared c what bone in the rabbit is generally regarded as corresponding to the quadrate cartilage of the frog    the dogfish  1 general anatomy  section 1 in the dogfish we have a far more antique type of structure than in any of the forms we have hitherto considered forms closely related to it occur among the earliest remains of vertebrata that are to be found in the geological record since the immeasurably remote silurian period sharks and dogfish have probably remained without any essential changes of condition and consequently without any essential changes of structure down to the present day then as now they dominated the seas they probably branched off from the other vertebrata before bone had become abundant in the inner skeleton which is consequently in their case cartilaginous with occasional calcification and no distinct bones at all unlike the majority of fish they possess no swimming bladder the precursor of the lungs but in many other respects notably in the urogenital organs they have in common with the higher vertebrata preserved features which may have been disguised or lost in the perfecting of such modern and specialized fish as for instance the cod salmon or herring   section 2 comparing the general build of a dogfish with that of a rabbit we notice the absence of a distinct neck and the general conical form the presence of a large tail as considerable at first in diameter as the hind portion of the body and of the first importance in progression in which function the four paddleshaped limbs the lateral fins simply cooperate with the median fin along the back for the purpose of steering and as a consequence of the size of the tail we note also the ventral position of the apertures of the body the anus and urinary and genital ducts unite in one common chamber the cloaca behind the head and in front of the fore fin pectoral fin are five gill slits gs leading from the pharynx to the exterior just behind the eye is a smaller and more dorsal opening of the same kind the spiracle sp on the under side of the head in front of the mouth is the nasal aperture olf the opening of the nasal sac which unlike the corresponding organ of the airfrequenting vertebrata has no internal narial opening there is however a groove running from olf to the corner of the mouth and this closing in the vertebrate types that live in air and are exposed to incessant evaporation of their lubricating secretions constitutes the primitive nasal passage the limbs are undifferentiated into upper lower and digital portions and are simply jointed flattened expansions   section 3 the skin of the dogfish is closely set with pointed toothlike scales the placoid scales and these are continued over the lips into the mouth as teeth each scale consists of a base of true bone with a little tubercle of a harder substance dentine capped by a still denser covering the enamel the enamel is derived from the outer layer of the embryonic dogfish the epiblast which also gives rise to the epidermis while the dentine and bony base arise in the underlying mesoblast the dermis a mammalian tooth has essentially the same structure an outer coat of enamel derived from epiblast overlies a mass of dentine resting on bone but the dentine is excavated internally to form a pulpcavity containing bloodvessels and nerves most land animals however have teeth only in their mouths and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute the armour of the dogfish besides the teeth there perhaps remain relics of the placoid scales in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata in the membrane bones how placoid scales may have given rise to these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as the vomer of the frog this bone lies on the roof of the frogs mouth and bears a number of denticles and altogether there is a very strong resemblance in it to a number of placoid scales the bony bases of which have become confluent in the salamander behind the teethbearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone the same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog but without teeth in some tailed amphibians the vomers and splenials are known to arise by the fusion of small denticles these facts seem to point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases and their withdrawal from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as membrane bones a process entirely completed in the mammalian type   section 4 the alimentary canal of the dogfish is a simple tube thrown into a z shape the mouth is rough with denticles and has a fleshy immovable tongue on its floor in the position of the eustachian tube there is a passage the spiracle sp running out to the exterior just external to the cartilage containing the ear the pharynx communicates with the exterior through five gill slits gs and has of course no glottis or other lung opening there is a wide oesophagus passing into a ushaped stomach st having like the rabbits the spleen sp on its outer curvature there is no coiling small intestine but the short portion receiving the bile duct bd and duct of the pancreas pan is called the duodenum ddum the liver has large left llv and right lobes and a median lobe mlv in which the gall bladder gbl is embedded the next segment of the intestine is fusiform containing a spiral valve figure 4 the shelf of which points steeply forward it is sometimes called the colon co it is absorptive in function and probably represents morphologically as it does physiologically the greater portion of the small intestine a rectal gland rg opens from the dorsal side into the final portion of the canal rectum   section 5 the circulation presents in many respects an approximation to the state of affairs in the developing embryos of the higher types the heart figure 3 sheet 14 error in first edition 16 is roughly z shape and transmits only venous blood it lies in a cavity the pericardial cavity pcc cut off by a partition from the general coelome at one point this partition is imperfect and the two spaces communicate through a pericardioperitoneal canal ppc which is also indicated by an arrow pp in the position and direction in which the student when dissecting should thrust his seeker in figure 1 sheet 15 a sinus venosus sv in figure 3 sheet 16 receives the venous trunks and carries the blood through a valve into the baggy and transversely extended auricle atrium au whence it passes into the muscular ventricle vn and thence into the truncus arteriosus this truncus consists of two parts the first the conus or pylangium ca muscular contractile and containing a series of valves the second the bulbus or synangium ba without valves and pulsatile in the rabbit both sinus and truncus are absent or merged in the adjacent parts of the heart   section 6 from the bulbus there branch on either side four arterial trunks the first of which forks so that altogether there are five afferent branchials abr taking blood to be aerated in the gills here highly vascular filamentary outgrowths of the internal walls of the gill slits     lines from second edition only    there are altogether nine vascular outgrowths demibranchs one    on each wall of each gill slit except the last on the hind wall of    which there is none in the spiracle is a miniature demibranch the    pseudobranch this suggests that the spiracle is really a somewhat    modified gill slit  four efferent branchials ebr carry the aerated blood on to the dorsal aorta dao a carotid artery runs forward to the head and a hypobranchial artery supplies the ventral side of the pharyngeal region there are subclavian coeliac mesenteric and pelvic arteries and the dorsal aorta is continued through the length of the tail as the caudal artery cda   section 7 a caudal vein cdv bringing blood back from the tail splits behind the kidneys k and forms the paired renal portal veins rpv breaking up into a capillary system in the renal organ a portal vein brings blood from the intestines to the liver   section 8 instead of being tubular vessels the chief veins of the dogfish are in many cases irregular baggy sinuses three main venous trunks flow into the sinus venosus in the median line from behind comes the hepatic sinus hs and laterally from a dorsal direction the cuvierian sinuses cs enter it these as the student will presently perceive are the equivalents of the rabbits superior cavae they receive near their confluence with the sinus venosus the inferior jugular vein ijv at their dorsal origin they are formed by the meeting of the anterior acs and posterior pcs cardinal sinuses the anterior cardinal sinus is roughly the equivalent of the internal jugular vein lies along dorsal to the gill slits gs and receives an orbital sinus from the eye the posterior cardinal sinus receives a subclavian vein scv and a lateral vein lv and fuses posteriorly with its fellow in the middle line this median fusion is a departure from the normal fish type it must not be confused with the inferior cava which is not found in the dogfish the right posterior cardinals representing the rabbits azygos vein a simplified diagram of the circulation of a fish is given in figure 2 sheet 16 and this should be carefully compared with the corresponding small figure given of the vascular system of our other types     lines from second edition only    the blood of the dogfish resembles that of the frog   section 9 the internal skeleton as we have said is entirely cartilaginous and only those parts which are preformed in cartilage in the skeletons of the higher types are represented here the spinal column consists of two types of vertebrae the trunk bearing short distinct horizontallyprojecting ribs r and the caudal the diagrams of figure 5 sheet 18 are to illustrate the structure of the centrum of a dogfish vertebra c is a side view d a horizontal median section a and b are transverse sections at the points indicated by b and a a and b respectively in figure c by an unfortunate slip of the pen in the figure a was substituted for b section a corresponds to line b and vice versa the vertebrae are hollowed out both anteriorly and posteriorly amphicoelous and a jellylike notochord runs through the entire length of the vertebral column being constricted at the centres of the centra and dilated between them the neural arch above the centrum and containing the spinal cord is made up of neural plates np and interneural plates inp completed above by a median neural spine ns in the caudal region instead of ribs projecting outwardly there are haemal processes inclined downwards and meeting below forming an arch the haemal arch containing the caudal artery and vein the vein ventral to the artery and resembling the neural arch which contains the spinal cord above in shape and size   section 10 the pectoral limb and girdle figure 4 sheet 16 have only a very vague resemblance to the corresponding structures in the rabbit the girdle g is a transverse bar lying ventral to the pericardial wall and sending up a portion sc dorsal to the attachment of the limb which answers to the scapula and suprascapula of the forms above the fish three main cartilages named respectively the pro pp meso mp and metapterygium form the base of the limb with these smaller cartilaginous plates rods and nodules articulate and form a flattened skeletal support for the fin   section 11 the pelvic girdle and limb figure 2 sheet 15 are similar in structure but the propterygium and mesopterygium are absent and the cartilage answering to the metapterygium goes by the name of the basipterygium in the male but not in the female the pelvic fins are united behind the cloaca and there are two stiff grooved copulatory organs the claspers cl in figure 1 which have a cartilaginous support clc these claspers form the readiest means of determining the sex of a specimen before dissection   section 12 the skull consists of a cartilaginous cranium and of jaw and visceral arches the cranium persists throughout life in what closely resembles a transitory embryonic condition of the higher types there is a nasal capsule nac a brain case proper and lateral otic auditory capsules otc containing the internal ear this should be compared with the frogs embryonic skull the upper jaw has a great bar of cartilage the palatopterygoid as its sole support the arch of premaxilla maxilla jugal and squamosal all membrane bones is of course not represented in the frog this bar of cartilage is joined directly to the otic capsule by a quadrate portion but this is only doubtfully represented in the dogfish by a nodule of cartilage in the prespiracular ligament ps the lower jaw is supported by meckels cartilage mc the hyoid arch consists of two main masses of cartilage the hyomandibular hm and the ceratohyal ch the former of these is tilted slightly forward so that the gill slit between it and the jaw arch is obliterated below and the cartilage comes to serve as the intermediary in the suspension of the jaw from the otic mass there are five branchial arches made up pharyngo epi and ceratobranchials and the ventral elements fuse in the middle line to form a common plate of cartilage outside these arches are certain small cartilages the extra branchials exb which together with certain small labials by the nostrils and at the sides of the gape probably represent structures of considerably greater importance in that still more primitive fish the lamprey the deep groove figured lateral to the otic capsule is the connecting line of the orbital and anterior cardinal sinuses the outline of the anterior cardinal sinus in this figure and in figure 1 is roughly indicated by a dotted line   section 13 figure 3a is a rough diagram of the internal ear the only auditory structure of our type compare rabbit sheet 7 to dissect out the auditory labyrinth without injury is a difficult performance but its structure may be made out very satisfactorily by paring away successive slices of the otic mass such a section is shown by figure 3b through the translucent hyaline cartilage the utriculus and horizontal canal can be darkly seen the ductus endolymphaticus vide rabbit is indicated by a dotted line in our figure it is situated internal to the rightangle between the two vertical canals and reaches to the surface of the otic capsule   section 14 the brain shows the three primary vesicles much more distinctly than do our higher types the forebrain has large laterally separated olfactory lobes rh there are relatively small hemispheres prc the stalk of the pineal gland tilts forward and the gland itself is much nearer the surface being embedded in the cartilage of the brain case and the pituitary body is relatively very large and has lateral vascular lobes on either side following the usual interpretation of the parts we find optic lobes opl as the roof of the midbrain and behind a very large median hollow tongueshaped cerebellum cb the medulla is large and certain lateral restiform tracts rt therein which also occur in the higher types are here exceptionally conspicuous   section 15 the dogfish has ten pairs of cranial nerves corresponding to the anterior ten of the rabbit very closely when we allow for the modification the latter has suffered through the conversion of some part of the spiracular cleft to an eardrum and the obliteration of the posthyoid branchial slits  the first and second nerves are really brain lobes and nerves of the special senses of smell and sight respectively  the third oculomotor the fourth patheticus and the sixth abducens are distributed to exactly the same muscles of the eyeball as they are in the rabbit  the fifth nerve has in the dogfish as in the rabbit three chief branches v2 and v3 fork over the mouth just as they do in the mammal v1 passes out of the cranium by a separate and more dorsal opening and runs along a groove along the dorsal internal wall of the orbit immediately beneath a similar branch of vii which is not distinct in the rabbit the grooves are shown in the figure of the cranium sheet 18 the joint nerve thus compounded of v and vii is called the ophthalmic oph it is distributed to the skin above the nose and orbit when the student commences to dissect the head of a dogfish he notices over the dorsal surface of the snout an exudation of a yellowish jellylike substance and on removing the tough skin over this region and over the centre of the skull he finds lying beneath it a quantity of coiling simple tubuli full of such yellowish matter these tubuli open on the surface by small pores and the nerves terminate in hairlike extremities in their lining these sense tubes are peculiar to aquatic forms allied structures are found over the head and along a lateral line see below in the tadpole but when the frog emerges from the water they are lost they doubtless indicate some unknown sense entirely beyond our experience and either only possible or only necessary when the animal is submerged  in addition to the ophthalmic moiety mentioned above the seventh nerve has a vidian branch vid running over the roof of the mouth and besides this its main branches fork over the spiracle just as v forks over the mouth and as ix and x fork over gill clefts this nerve in the rabbit is evidently considerably modified from this more primitive condition  the eighth is the auditory nerve as in the rabbit  the ninth nerve forks over the first branchial cleft  the tenth nerve is easily exposed by cutting down through the body wall muscles over the gill clefts into the anterior cardinal sinus acs it gives off a branches forking over the posterior four gill slits b a great lateral nerve running inward and back through the bodywall muscle and connected with a line of sense organs similar to those in the head the lateral line and c a visceral nerve curving round to the oesophagus and stomach in dissection it becomes very evident that the tenth nerve is really a leash of nerves each one equivalent to the ninth  we may here call the attention of the reader to the fact of the singular resemblance of v vii ix and the factors of x that each has a ventral fork we have already noticed each also ix has a dorsal constituent connected with the sense organs of the skin the vidian branch of vii however is not evidently represented in the others   section 16 the coelom of the dogfish is peculiar among the types we treat of in the possession of two direct communications with the exterior in addition to the customary indirect way through the oviduct these are the abdominal pores ap on either side of the cloaca in either sex they can always be readily demonstrated by probing out from the body cavity in the direction indicated by the arrow ap in figure 1 sheet 15 they probably serve to equalize the internal and external pressure of the fish as it changes its depth in the water just as the eustachian tubes equalize the pressure on either side of the mammals tympanic membrane   section 17 the musculature of the dogfish body is cut into vshaped segments the point of the v being directed forward the segments alternate with the vertebrae and are called myomeres such a segmentation is evident though less marked in the body wall muscles of the frog and in the abdominal musculature of the rabbit and other mammals it is still to be traced   section 18 the urogenital organs of the female dogfish figure 1 sheet 17 consist of an unpaired ovary ov paired oviducts od enlarged at one point to form an oviducal gland odg kidneys k with ureters ur uniting to form a urinary sinus us opening into the cloaca by a median urinary papilla separate from the oviducal openings the eggs contain much yolk and like those of the fowl are very large like the fowl too one of the ovaries is suppressed and it is the right ovary that alone remains the two oviducts meet in front of the liver ventral to the oesophagus and have there a common opening by which the ova are received after being shed into the body cavity the eggs receive an oblong horny case in the oviduct in the figure such a case is figured as distending the duct at e the testes of the male t in figure 2 are partially confluent in the middle line they communicate through vasa efferentia ve with the modified anterior part of the kidney the epididymis ep from which the vas deferens v runs to the median urogenital sinus ugs into which the ureters ur also open the silvery peritoneum lining of the body cavity covers over the reddish kidneys and hides them in dissection   section 19 figure 3 sheet 17 is a generalized diagram of the urogenital organs in the vertebrata ml is the middle line of the body g is the genital organ pr is the pronephros or fore kidney a structure which is never developed in the dogfish but which has functional importance in the tadpole and cod and appears as a transitory rudiment in the chick a duct which is often spoken of as the pronephric duct pd and which we have figured under that name is always developed anteriorly it opens into the body cavity it is also called the mullerian duct and in the great majority of vertebrata it becomes the oviduct uniting with its fellow in the case of the dogfish ventral to the oesophagus in the male it usually disappears the uterus masculinus of the rabbit is still very generally regarded as a vestige of it kolliker has shown however that this interpretation is improbable ms is the mesonephros some or all of which becomes the epididymis in the male of types possessing that organ and is connected with g by the vasa efferentia mt the metanephros is in actual fact the frog indistinguishably continuous with ms and is the functional kidney its duct metanephric duct being either undifferentiated from the mesonephric as is the case with the frog or largely split off from it as in the dogfish to form the ureter   section 20 the correspondence of the male organs of the dogfish with those of the rabbit will be more evident if the student imagine     a the testes vasa efferentia and epididymis of each side to    shift posteriorly until they reach a position on either side of    the cloaca and     b the urogenital apertures instead of meeting dorsally and    posteriorly to the anus to shift round that opening and meet    anteriorly and ventrically to it   section 21 this completes our survey of this type except where we have specified differences the general plan of its anatomy follows the lines of the other vertebrate types described    questions on the dogfish  1 describe the alimentary canal of the dogfish and compare it with that of the rabbit in detail  2

tenth cranial nerves in the dogfish  14 compare one by one the cranial nerves of the dogfish with those of any higher vertebrate as regards their origin and their distribution  15 describe the auditory organ of the dogfish what parts are added to this in the higher type  16 draw the cloaca a of a male b a female dogfish  17 practical demonstrate in a dogfish the pathetic nerve the opening between pericardium and coelom the abdominal pores and the ureter    amphioxus  1 anatomy  section 1 we find in amphioxus the essential vertebrate features reduced to their simplest expression and in addition somewhat distorted there are wide differences from that vertebrate plan with which the reader may now be considered familiar there are no limbs there is an unbroken fin along the median dorsal line and coming round along the ventral middle line for about half the animals length but two lowly vertebrates the hagfish and lamprey have no limbs and a continuous fin there is as we shall see more clearly a structure the respiratory atrium not apparently represented in the true vertebrate types at least in their adult stages there is no distinct heart only a debateable brain quite without the typical division into three primary vesicles no skull no structures whatever of cartilage or bone no genital ducts no kidneys at all resembling those of the vertebrata no pancreas no spleen apparently no sympathetic chain no paired sense organs eyes ears or nasal sacs in all of which points we have striking differences from all true vertebrata and such a characteristic vertebrate peculiarity as the pineal gland we can only say is represented very doubtfully by the eye spot   section 2 the vertebral column is devoid of vertebrae it is throughout life a rod of gelatinous tissue the notochord figure 1 nc surrounded by a cellular sheath such a rod is precursor to the vertebral column in the true vertebrates but except in such lowly forms as the lamprey is usually replaced partially eg dogfish or wholly as in the rabbit by at first cartilaginous vertebrae whose bodies are derived from its sheath further while in all true vertebrata the notochord of the developing young reaches anteriorly at most to the midbrain and is there at its termination enclosed by the middle portion of the skull in amphioxus it reaches far in front of the anterior extremity of the nervous system to the end of the animals body on this account the following classification is sometimes made of those animals which have a notochord     chordata  vertebrata as used by lankester        1 having the notochord reaching in front of the brain       cephalochorda  amphioxus        2 having the notochord reaching anteriorly to the midbrain a       brain of three primary vesicles and a skull       craniata  all true vertebrata fishes amphibia reptiles       birds and mammals vertebrata of balfour        3 having the notochord confined to the tail       urochorda  the ascidians or seasquirts certain forms of life       only recently recognised as relatives of the vertebrata   the anterior end of the notochord in the developing rabbit or dog lies where the middle of the basisphenoid bone is destined to be   section 3 figure 1 sheet 19 shows the general anatomy of amphioxus we recognise four important points of resemblance to the earlier phases of the higher and the permanent structure of the lower members of the vertebrata and it is these that justify the inclusion of amphioxus in this volume in the first place there is the     notochord    in the next just above it at sc we find     a dorsal tubular nervous axis    the spinal cord thirdly the pharynx ph is perforated by     respiratory slits    though these instead of being straight slashes are modified from    a ushape slant very much forward and are much more numerous than    in any true vertebrate and fourthly there is as we shall    see a     vertebrate type of circulation    and finally the bodywall muscles are divided into     myomers   section 4 the alimentary canal of amphioxus commences with an oral cavity not represented in our vertebrata surrounded by a number of cirri or tentacles supported by a horny substance which seems to be chitin a common skeletal material among invertebrates a velum v forms a curtain perforated by the mouth and by two smaller hyoidean apertures between the oral cavity and the pharynx ph pharyux is here used in a wider sense than in the true vertebrata it reaches back close to the liver and is therefore equivalent to pharynx  oesophagus  a portion or all of the stomach the socalled hyoidean apertures are not equivalent to the similarlynamed parts of the vertebrata behind the pharynx the intestine int runs straight out to the anus an which opens not in the middle line as one might expect but in the left side the liver lies usually on the creatures right and instead of being a compact gland is simply baglike   section 5 the circulation is peculiarly reduced figure 2 the cardiac aorta cao lies along the ventral side of the pharynx and sends branches up along the complete bars between the gill slits there is no distinct heart but the whole of the cardiac aorta is contractile and at the bases of the aortic arches that run up the bars there are contractile dilatations that assist in the propulsion of the blood dorsal to the pharynx as in fishes there is a pair of dorsal aorta dao that unite above the liver compare the frog for instance and thence run backward as a median dorsal aorta dao a portal vein pv bring blood back from the intestine and apparently from the whole posterior portion of the animal to the liver thence hepatic veins hep take it to the cardiac aorta     lines from first edition only    when we remember that in the embryonic vertebrate the heart is at    first a straight tube this circulation appears even more strikingly    vertebrate in its character than before   section 6 the coelom or body cavity of amphioxus lies of course as in the vertebrata between the intestinal wall and the body walls and just as in the vertebrata it is largely reduced where gill slits occur but matters are rather complicated by the presence of an atrial cavity round the pharynx which is not certainly represented in the vertebrata and which the student is at first apt to call the body cavity although it is entirely distinct and different from that space the mutual relation of the two will become apparent after a study of figures 10 11 12 sheet 21 figure 10 gives diagrammatically a section of a very young stage of amphioxus p is the pharynx portion of the alimentary canal coe is the coelom surrounding it at this stage here as elsewhere mtc are certain lymph spaces the metapleural canals between which a small invagination ie a pushingin at of the outer epidermis occurs nc is the notochord and sc the spinal cord the gill slits by which p communicates with the exterior are not shown next figure 11 shows the invagination at pushing its way in and cut off from the exterior by a meeting of the body wall below note that at is a portion of the animals exterior thus embraced by its body and that its lining is therefore of the same material as the external integument in figure 12 at is developing upward so that the true body hangs into it now imagine the gill slits perforated as shown by the doubleheaded arrow in figure 12 figure 3 on sheet 20 is a less diagrammatic representation of a crosssection of the pharyngeal region vide figure 1 sheet 19 the student should compare figure 3 sheet 20 and figure 12 sheet 21 the atrium and metapleural canals are easily recognised in both in figure 3 the coelom is much cut up by the gill slits and we have remaining of it a the dorsal coelomic canals dcc and b the branchial canals brc in the bars between the slits the atrial cavity remains open to the exterior at one point the atrial pore atp   section 7 the method of examining crosssections is an extremely convenient one in the study of such a type as amphioxus the student should very carefully go over and copy the six sections on sheet 20 comparing figure 1 as he goes he should do this before reading what follows one little matter must be borne in mind these figures are merely intended to convey the great structural ideas and they are considerably simplified they must not be regarded as a substitute for the examination of microscopic sections he will notice a number of rounded masses from the body wall the for instance the bodywall muscles of amphioxus are arranged in bundles bent sharply in an arrow shape the point forward a number of these bundles are cut in any one section and so the even shading of our diagrams if they professed to be anything more than diagrams should be broken up into masses these bundles we may mention are called myomeres and they are indicated in figure 1 by lines pointing acutely forward several are consequently cut in any transverse section sheet 20 and these are the rounded masses he sees similar myomeres similarly situated are found in fish behind the head and less obviously they occur with diminishing importance as the scale of the vertebrata is ascended   section 8 if we compare the nervous system of amphioxus with that of any vertebrate we find at once a number of striking differences in the first place the skeletal covering of it the cranium and the neural arches of vertebrae are represented only by a greatly simplified connective tissue in the next a simple and slight anterior dilatation alone represents the brain a patch of black pigment anterior to this es may or may not be what its name implies an eyespot there is a ciliated funnel cf figure 1 sheet 19 opening on the left side which has been assumed to be olfactory in its functions and in the mouth chamber a ciliated pit cp which may or may not be an organ of taste the ventral fissure of the spinal cord is absent the dorsal nerves are without ganglia and do not come off in pairs but alternately one to the left then one to the right one to the left one to the right and so on the ventral nerves are very short more numerous than the dorsal and never unite with these latter to form mixed nerves  the student will observe that here just as in the case of the ciliated funnel and anus the amphioxus is not strictly symmetrical but twisted as it were and so departs from the general rule of at least external bilateral symmetry obtaining among the vertebrates it habitually lies on one side in the mud of the sea bottom and it is probable that this external asymmetry is due to this habit so that too much classificatory importance must not be attached to it the soles and other related fish for instance are twisted and asymmetrical through a similar specific habit to such an extent that both eyes lie on one side of the animal   section 9 no kidney on the vertebrate pattern is found but the following structures have among others been suggested as renal organs     a certain canals the brown tubes of lankester btl figure 2    sheet 19 a pair of pigmented tubes opening into the atrium at the    hind end of the pharynx lying forward along by the dorsal coelomic    canals and having an internal opening also     b certain tubuli described by weiss as situated in a series along    the upper corners of the atrial cavity and communicating after the    fashion of the nephridia of the earthworm with the coelom and with    the exterior or rather with that portion of the animals exterior    enclosed in by the atrial wall compare section 6     c the general epithelial lining of the atrium  the reproductive organs figure 4 sheet 20 g are masses of cells situated in an isolated part of the coelom in the atrial folds and having no ducts their contents must escape into the atrium by rupture of the bodywall thence they escape either by gillslits pharynx and mouth or more generally through the atrial pore the animals like all the vertebrata are dioecious ie male or female   section 10 the endostyle end in figures 3 and 4 is a ciliated path or groove on the under side of the pharynx which is generally supposed to represent the thyroid gland of vertebrates the vertebrate thyroid early in development is certainly an open and long narrow groove in the ventral side of the pharynx the hyperpharyngeal groove hp has been in the past compared to the pituitary body but there is little doubt now that this structure is represented by the ciliated pit   section 11 the student is advised to revise this chapter before proceeding and to schedule carefully the anatomical features under the headings of 1 distinctly vertebrate characters 2 characters contrasting with the normal vertebrate structure 3 facts of doubtful import with the suggestions given in the text written against them    2 the development of amphioxus  section 12 the development of amphioxus studied completely is at once one of the most alluring and difficult tasks in the way of the zoologist but certain of its earlier and most obvious fasts may very conveniently be taken into consideration now  section 13 the phenomena of the extrusion of polar bodies and fertilization are treated of later and will therefore not be considered now we will start our description with an eggcell which has escaped of course since there are no genital ducts by rupture of the parent has been fertilized by the male element and is about to develop into a young amphioxus it is simply a single cell with some power of amoeboid motion a single nucleus and nucleolus and in amphioxus its protoplasm is clear and transparent frequently ova are loaded with granules of food store yolk which enable the young animal to go far with its development before it is hatched and has to begin fending for itself such an ovum as that of our present type however being devoid of such yolk alecithal  without yolk necessitates a very early start in life and for reasons too complicated to state fully here the development in such a case is considered particularly instructive and primitive by zoologists   section 14 the first thing to be seen in the developing cell is a deepening circular groove figure 1 sheet 21 which divides the ovum into two parts another groove then cuts at right angles to this subdividing the two into four figure 2 another groove at right angles to both the former follows making the four eight figure 3 and so subdivision goes on the whole process is called segmentation or cleavage   section 15 at the end of segmentation we get a hollow sphere of small cells the cells separating from one another centrally and enclosing a cavity as the process proceeds this is the blastosphere shown diagrammatically in figure 4 and of which an internal view rather truer to the facts of the case as regards shape is given as figure 5 the central cavity is the segmentation cavity sc   section 16 invagination follows figure 6 in this process a portion of the blastosphere wall is the tucked into the rest as indicated by the arrow so that a twolayered sack is formed the space ar is the archenteron the primordial intestine and its mouth is called the blastopore bp the outer layer of this doublewalled sac is called the epiblast for the present we will give the inner lining no special term the young amphioxus has at this stage which is called the gastrula stage a curious parallelism with such a lowly form as the hydra of our ditches this latter creature like the gastrula consists essentially of two layers of cells an outer protective and sensory layer and an inner digestive one it has a primordial intestine or archenteron and its mouth is sometimes regarded as being a blastopore all animals that have little yolk and start early in life for themselves pass through a gastrula stage substantially the same as this of amphioxus   section 17 the anus is perforated later near the region occupied at this stage by the blastopore hence the anterior end of the future amphioxus the head end is pointing towards the figure 6 and the letters ep are marked on the side which will be dorsal   section 18 figure 7 i is a dorsal view of the gastrula at a somewhat later stage and here indications of distinctly vertebrate relationships already appear figure 7 ii is a crosssection its position being shown by crosslines in 7 i and 6 note first that the epiblast along the middorsal line is sinking in to form what is called the neural plate np and simultaneously on either side of it rise the neural folds nf now at figure 8 a slightly later stage is represented and at 9 i the inturned part is separated from the general external epiblast as the spinal cord the remainder of the epiblast constitutes the epidermis   section 19 reverting to figure 7 ii along the dorsal side of the archenteron a thickening of its wall appears and is gradually pinched off from it to form a cellular rod lying along under the nervous axis and above the intestine this is the notochord compare figures 8 and 9   section 20 finally we note two series of buds of cells one on either side of the archenteron in figure 7 ii in 8 these buds have become hollow vesicles growing out from it the coelomic pouches they are further developed in 9 and in 9 ii which is a diagrammatic figure they are indicated by dotted lines they finally appear to  entirely obliterate the segmentation cavity they certainly do so throughout the body and their cavities are in time cut off from the mesenteron by the gradual constriction of their openings in this way the coelom body cavity arises as a series of hollow archenteric outgrowths and ms becomes the alimentary canal mtc the metapleural canals probably arise subsequently to and independently of the general coelomic space by a splitting in the bodywall substance   section 21 hence in considering the structure of amphioxus we have three series of cells from which its tissues are developed     1 the epiblast     2 walls of the coelomic pouches which form a an inner lining    to the epiblast b an outer coating to the hypoblast and c the    mesentery m by which the intestine is supported this is the    mesoblast     3 the lining of the mesenteron or hypoblast  from the epiblast the epidermis not the dermis the nervous system including the nerves and the sensory part of all sense organs are derived from the mesoblast the muscles the dermis genital and excretory organs circulatory fluid and apparatus any skeletal structures and all connective tissue are derived the mass of the body is thus evidently made of mesoblast the hypoblast is the lining of the intestine and of the glands which open into it and the material of the notochord is also regarded as hypoblast   section 22 figure 9 ii shows all the essential points of the structure of amphioxus epiblast is indicated by a line of dashes mesoblast by dots and hypoblast dark or black the true mouth is formed late by a tuckingin of epiblast the stomodaeum sd which meets and fuses with the hypoblast and is then perforated the position of this mouth is at the velum the formation of the atrium has been described the metapleural folds run forward in front of the velum as the epipleurs ep in sections 1 and 2 and form an oral hood bc around which the tentacles appear and which is evidently not equivalent to the vertebrate mouth cavity but in front of and outside it the anus is formed by a tucking in the proctodaeum similar to the stomodaeum   section 23 the formation of the respiratory slits is complicated and difficult to describe but since investigators have still to render its meaning apparent it need not detain the elementary student   see balfours embryology volume 2 and quarterly journal of microscopical science march 1891    questions on amphioxus  1 draw diagrams with the parts named of the alimentary canal of a amphioxus b any craniate c indicate very shortly the

vertebrate  8 compare the genital organs of amphioxus with those of a higher vertebrate  9 what structures have been regarded as renal organs in amphioxus  10 what is a gastrula with what lower type has the gastrula been compared discuss the comparison    development  the development of the frog  section 1 we have now to consider how the body of the frog is built up out of the egg cell but previously to doing so we must revert to the reproductive organs of our type   section 2 in the testes of the male is found an intricate network of tubuli the lining of which is of course an epithelium the cells of this epithelium have their internal borders differentiated into spermatozoa which at a subsequent stage are liberated a spermatozoon figure 3 sheet 13 sp is a rodshaped cell containing a nucleus in fact consisting chiefly of nucleus with a tail the flagellum which is vibratile and forces the spermatozoon forward by its lashing the spermatozoa float in a fluid which is the joint product of the testes anterior part of the kidney and perhaps the prostate glands   section 3 in the ovary the ova are formed and grow to a considerable size they are nucleated cells the nucleus going by the special name of the germinal vesicle and the nucleolus the germinal spot the ova prey upon the adjacent cells as they develop the protoplasm of the ovum except at that part of the surface where the germinal vesicle lies is packed with a great amount of food material the yolk granules this yolk is nonliving inert matter an ovum such as this in which the protoplasm is concentrated towards one pole is called telolecithal   section 4 after the ovum has finished its growth and elaborated the yolk within itself a peculiar change occurs in the small area free from yolk the animal pole in which the germinal vesicle lies this germinal vesicle divides and one moiety is budded off from the ovum the ovum has in fact undergone cell division into a very large cell containing most of its substance and a small protoplasmic pimple surrounding half of its nucleus the disproportion is so great between the two cells that the phenomenon does not at first suggest the idea of cell division and it is usually described as the extrusion of the first polar body there follows a second and similar small cell behind the first the second polar body since the nucleus of the ovum has divided twice it is evident that the nucleus remaining now in the ovum is a quarter of the original nucleus very little protoplasm is given off with the polar bodies they play no further part in development but simply drop off and disappear not only in the frogs ovum but in all vertebrata two polar bodies are given off in this way before the sexual process occurs their exact meaning has been widely discussed it is fairly evident that some material is removed from the nucleus which would be detrimental to further developments and the point debated is what is the precise nature of this excreted material this burning question we can scarcely deal with here   section 5 but here we may point out that in all cells the function of the nucleus appears to be to determine growth and division it is the centre of directive energy in the cell   section 6 fertilization is effected by a spermatozoon meeting with the ovum it fuses with it its nucleus becoming the male pronucleus this and the female pronucleus left after the extrusion of the polar cells move towards each other and unite to form the first segmentation nucleus   section 7 the ovum next begins to divide a furrow cutting deeper and deeper divides it into two another follows at right angles to this making the two four and another equatorial furrow cuts off the animal pole from the yolk or vegetative pole see sheet 22 figures 1 2 and 3 and so segmentation  cleavage proceeds and at last a hollow sphere the blastosphere figure 4 is formed with a segmentation cavity sc but because of the presence of the yolk at the vegetative pole of ovum and of the mechanical resistance it offers to the force of segmentation the protoplasm there is not nearly so finely divided the cells that is to say are much larger than at the animal pole the blastosphere of the frog is like what the blastosphere of amphioxus would be if the future hypoblast cells were enormously larger through their protoplasm being diluted with yolk   section 8 the next phase of development has an equally curious resemblance to and difference from what occurs in the case of the ova of animals which do not contain yolk in such types eg amphioxus a part of the blastosphere wall is tucked into the rest and a gastrula formed by this process of invagination in the frog figure 5 there is a tuckingin but the part that should lie within the gastrula the yolkcontaining cells are far larger than the epiblast ep which should form the outer layer of cells hence the epiblast can only by continual growth accommodate what it must embrace and the process of tuckingin is accompanied by one of growth of the epiblast as shown by the unbarbed arrow over the yolk this stage is called the gastrula stage ar is the cavity of the gastrula the archenteron bp is its opening or blastopore such a gastrula formed mainly by overgrowth of the epiblast is called an epibolic gastrula as distinguished from the invaginate gastrula of amphioxus the difference is evidently entirely due to the presence of yolk and the consequent modification of invagination in the former case   section 9 comparing the two gastrulas it is not difficult to see that if we imagine the ventral wall of the archenteron of amphioxus to have its cells enormously enlarged through the mixing of yolk with their protoplasm we should have a gastrula essentially like that of the frog   section 10 figure 6 shows a slightly later ovum than figure 5 seen from the dorsal side bp is the blastopore in front of that appears a groove the neural groove bordered on either side by a ridge the neural fold nf this is seen in section in figure 7 sc is the neural groove nf as before the neural fold the neural folds ultimately bend over and meet above so that sc becomes a canal and is finally separated from the epiblast to form the spinal cord below the neural groove a thickening of the dorsal wall of the archenteron appears and is pinched off to form a longitudinal rod the precursor of the vertebral column the notochord shown in figure 7 nc as imperfectly pinched off   section 11 simultaneously on either side of the notochord appear a series of solid masses of cells derived mainly by cell division from the cells of the wall of the archenteron and filling up and obliterating the segmentation cavity these masses increase in number by the addition of fresh ones behind during development and are visible in the dorsal view as bricklike masses the mesoblastic somites or protovertebrae figure 6 i ii iii in figure 7 these masses are indicated by dotting in such a primitive type as amphioxus these mesoblastic somites masses contain a cavity destined to be the future body cavity from the first in the frog the cavity is not at first apparent the mesoblast at first seems quite solid but subsequently what is called the splitting of the mesoblast occurs and the body cavity bc in figure 7 appears the outer mesoblast lying immediately under the epiblast constitutes the substance of the somatopleur and from it will be formed the dermis the muscles of the body wall almost all the cartilage and bone of the skeleton the substance of the limbs the kidneys genital organs heart and bloodvessels and in short everything between the dermis and the coelom except the nervous system and nerves and the notochord the inner mesoblast the mass of the splanchnopleur will form the muscle and connective tissue of the wall of the alimentary canal and the binding substance of the liver and other glands that open into the canal   section 12 figure 8 is one which we reproduce with the necessary changes in each plate of embryological figures given in this book so that the student will find it a convenient one for the purpose of comparison the lines of dashes in all cases signify epiblast hypoblast  the unbroken black line is hypoblast epiblast dotting shows mesoblast and the shaded rod nc is the notochord cs is the spinal cord br1 br2 br3 are the three primary vesicles which constitute the brain and which form fore mid and hind brain respectively i is the intestine and y the yolk cells that at this early stage constitute its ventral wall   section 13 figure 9 gives a similar diagram of a later stage but here the blastopore is closed an epiblastic tuckingin at st the stomodaeum prefigures the mouth pr the proctodaeum is a similar posterior invagination which will become the anus y the yolk is evidently much absorbed figure 10 is a young tadpole seen from the side the still unabsorbed yolk in the ventral wall of the mesentery gives the creature a big belly its mouth is suctorial at this stage and behind it is a sucker s by which the larvae attach themselves to floating reeds and wood as shown in the three black figures below   section 14 we may now consider the development of the different organs slightly more in detail though much of this has already been approached the nervous system before the closure of the neural groove has three anterior dilatations the fore mid and hindbrains the first of which gives rise by hollow outgrowths to two pairs of lateral structures the hemispheres and the optic vesicles the latter give rise to the retina and optic nerve as described in development section 40   section 15 the hypoblastic notochord is early embraced by a mesoblastic sheath derived from the protovertebrae this becomes truly cartilaginous and at regular intervals is alternately thicker and thinner compressing the notochord at the thicker parts hence the notochord has a beaded form within this at first continuous cartilaginous sheath this sheath is soon cut into a series of vertebral bodies by jointings appearing through the points where the cartilage is thickest and the notochord most constricted hence what remains of the notochord lies within the vertebral bodies in the frog while in a cartilaginous fish such as the dogfish or in the embryonic rabbit the lines of separation appear where the notochord is thickest and it comes to lie between hollowfaced vertebrae cartilaginous neural arches and spines formed outside the notochordal sheath enclose the spinal cord in an arcade the final phase is ossification as the tadpole approaches the frog stage the vertebral column in the tail is rapidly absorbed and its vestiges appear in the adult as the urostyle   section 16 the development of the skull is entirely dissimilar to that of the vertebral column it is shown on figures 1 and 8 sheet 14 and in the section devoted to the frogs skull a very complete account of the process is given the process of ossification is described under the histology of the rabbit   section 17 the origin of the circulatory and respiratory organs is of especial interest in the frog in the tadpole we have essentially the necessities and organization of the fish in the adult frog we have a clear exposition of the structure of pigeon and rabbit the tadpole has at first a straight tubular heart burrowed out in somatic mesoblast and produced forward into a truncus arteriosus from this arise four afferent branchial arteries running up along the sides of the four branchial arches and supplying gills they unite above on either side in paired hyperbranchial arteries which meet behind dorsal to the liver to form a median dorsal aorta internal and external carotid arteries supply the head these four afferent branchial arches are equivalent to the first four of the five vessels of the dogfish at first the paired gills are three in number external and treelike covered by epiblast figures 10 and 11 eg and not to be compared to fish gills in structure or in fact with to any other gills within the limits of the vertebrata subsequently hypoblastic internal gills intg figure 12 strictly homologous with the gills of a fish appear then a flap of skin outside the hyoid arch grows back to cover over the gills this is the operculum op in figures 11 and 12 sheet 22 and it finally encloses them in a gill chamber open only by a pore on the left which resembles in structure and physiological meaning but differs evidently very widely in development from the amphioxus atrium at this time the lungs are developing as paired hollow outgrowths on the ventral side of the throat figure 12 l as the limbs develop and the tail dwindles the gill chamber is obliterated the capillary interruptions of the gills on the branchial arches aortic arches are also obliterated the carotid gland occupies the position of the first of these in the adult the front branchial arch here as in all higher vertebrata becomes the carotid arch the lingual represents the base of a prebranchial vessel the second branchial becomes the aortic arch the fourth loses its connection with the dorsal aorta and sends a branch to the developing lung which becomes the pulmonary artery the third disappears a somewhat different account to this is still found in some textbooks of the fate of this third branchial arch balfour would appear to have been of opinion that it gave rise to the cutaneous artery and that the third and fourth vessels coalesced to form the pulmocutaneous the fourth arch moving forward so as to arise from the base of the third and most elementary works follow him this opinion was strengthened by the fact that in the higher types reptiles birds and mammals no fourth branchial arch was observed and the apparent third becomes the pulmonary but it has since been shown that a transitory third arch appears and disappears in these types   section 18 the origin of the renal organ and duct has very considerable controversial interest in figure 13 sheet 22 a diagrammatic crosssection of an embryo is shown i is the intestine coe the coelom sc the spinal cord nc the notochord surrounded by ns the notochordal sheath ao is the dorsal aorta in the masses of somatic mesoblast on either side a longitudinal canal appears which in the torpedo a fish related to the dogfish and in the rabbit and possibly in all other cases is epiblastic in origin this is the segmental duct which persists apparently as the wolffian duct wd ventral to this appears a parallel canal the mullerian duct md which is often described as being split off from the segmental duct but which is very probably an independent structure in the frog a number of tubuli at first metamerically arranged now appear each opening on the one hand into the coelom by a ciliated mouth the nephrostome ns and on the other into the segmental duct these tubuli are the segmental tubes or nephridia there grows out from the aorta towards each a bunch of bloodvessels the glomerulus compare section 62 rabbit these tubuli ultimately become in part the renal tubuli so that the primitive kidney stretches at first along the length of the body cavity from the region of the gillslits backward the anterior part of the kidney called the pronephros disappears in the later larval stages internal to the kidney on either side there has appeared a longitudinal ridge the genital ridge gr which gives rise to testes or ovary as the case may be   in the discussion whether the vertebrata have arisen from some ancestral type like the earthworm metamerically segmented and of fairly high organization or from a much lower form possibly even from a coelenterate such a discussion is entirely outside the scope of the book though its mention is necessary to explain the importance given to these organs   section 19 the student should now compare the figures on sheet 17 in the male tubular connections are established between the testes and the middle part of the primitive kidney mesonephros these connections are the vasa efferentia ve and the mesonephros is now equivalent to the epididymis of the rabbit the wolffian duct is the urogenital duct of the adult and the mullerian duct is entirely absorbed or remains more or less in exceptional cases  in the female the mullerian duct increases greatly in length so that at sexual maturity its white coils appear thicker and longer than the intestine and becomes the oviduct the wolffian duct is the ureter and the mesonephros is not perverted in function from its primary renal duty   section 20 tabulating these facts     in the adult male       pronephros disappears       the mullerian duct   pronephric duct disappears       mesonephros  epididymis its duct the urogenital       metanephros and duct not clearly marked off from       mesonephros       compare dogfish section 19     in the adult female       pronephros disappears       the mullerian duct the oviduct       mesonephros and metanephros the kidney and their unseparated          ducts the ureters   section 21 hermaphrodism ie cases of common sex is occasionally found among frogs the testis produces ova in places and the mullerian duct is retained and functional the ciliated nephrostomata remain open to a late stage of development in the frog and in many amphibia throughout life their connection with the renal tubuli is however lost   section 22 the alimentary canal is at first a straight tube its disproportionate increase in length throws it into a spiral in the tadpole int figure 11 and accounts for its coiling in the frog the liver and other digestive glands are first formed like the lungs as hollow outgrowths and their lining is therefore hypoblastic the greatest relative length of intestine is found in the tadpole which being a purely vegetable feeder must needs effect the maximum amount of preparatory change in its food    the development of the fowl  section 23 the frog has an ovum with a moderate allowance of yolk but the quantity is only sufficient to start the little animal a part of its way towards the adult state the fowl on the contrary has an enormous ovum gorged excessively with yolk and as a consequence the chick is almost perfected when it is hatched the socalled yolk the yellow of an egg is the ovum proper around that is a coating of white albumen in a shell membrane and a shell at either end of the yolk figure 1 y twisted strands of albuminous matter the chalazae ch keep the yolk in place the animal pole is a small grey protoplasmic area the germinal area ga on the yolk   section 24 we pointed out that the presence of the yolk in the frogs egg led to a difference in the size of the cells at the animal and vegetable poles the late fm balfour borrowing a mathematical technicality suggested that the rate of segmentation in any part of an ovum varies inversely with the amount of yolk in the fowls egg except just at the germinal area the active protoplasm is at a minimum the inert yolk at a maximum the ratio of yolk to protoplasm is practically infinity and the yolk therefore does not segment at all the yolk has diluted the active protoplasm so much as to render its influence inappreciable the germinal area segments and lies upon the yolk which has defeated the efforts of its small mingling of protoplasm to divide such a type of segmentation in which only part of the ovum segments is called meroblastic if we compare this with the typical blastosphere of the lower type we see that it is as it were flattened out on the yolk this stage is shown in section in the lower figure of figure 1 bd the blastoderm is from this point of view a part of the ripped and flattened blastosphere spread out on the yolk sc is the segmentation cavity and y the yolk   section 25 there is no open invagination of an archenteron in the fowl as in the frog the gastrula like the blastosphere stage is also masked but in the hinder region of the germinal area a thick mass of cells grows inward and forward and appearing in the dorsal view of the egg as a white streak is called the primitive streak ps by a comparison of the figures of frog and fowl the student will easily perceive the complete correspondence of the position of this with the blastopore of the frog the relation of the two will be easily understood if we compare the fowls archenteron to a glovefinger under pressure its cavity is obliterated and the frogs to the glovefinger blown out the tension of the protoplasm straining over the enormous yolk answers to the pressure the gastrula in the fowl is solid the primitive streak is in fact the scar of a closed blastopore as we should expect from this view of its homology at the primitive streak the three embryonic layers are continuous and indistinguishable figure 2 elsewhere in the blastoderm they are distinctly separate just as the yolk cells of the frog form the ventral wall of the intestine so nuclei appear along the upper side of the yolk of the fowl where some protoplasm still exists and give rise to the ventral hypoblastic cells by conceiving a gradually increasing amount of yolk in the hypoblastic cells in the ventral side of the archenteron the substantial identity of the gastrula stage in the three types which at first appear so strikingly different will be perceived carry figures 4 and 5 of the frog one step further by increasing the size of the shaded yolk and leaving it unsegmented and instead of ar in 5 show a solid mass of cells and the condition of things in the fowl would at once be rendered   section 26 figure 3a of the fowl will conveniently serve for comparison with figure 7 of the frog the inturning of the medullary groove is entirely similar in the two cases the mesoblast appears as solid mesoblastic somites in the section above figure 4 this layer is shown as having split into somatopleur so and splanchnopleur spch figure 3 answers to figure 6 of the frog and figure 4 is a later stage in which the medullary groove is beginning to close at its middle part the clear clubshaped area around the embryo ap is the area pellucida the larger area without this is the area opaca ao in which the first bloodvessels arise by a running together and a specialization of cells the entire germinal area grows steadily at its edges to creep over and enclose the yolk   section 27 so far the essential differences between the development of fowl and frog the meroblastic segmentation absence of a typical gastrula and the primitive streak seem comprehensible on the theory that such differences are due to the presence of an enormous amount of yolk another difference that appears later is that while the tadpole has an efficient pronephros the fowl which has no larval free imperfect stages in its life history has the merest indication of such a structure   section 28 another striking contrast due to or connected with this plethora of yolk is the differentiation of a yolk sac  umbilical vesicle and the development of two new structures the amnion and allantois in the fowl if the student will compare figure 10 of the frog he will see that the developing tadpole encloses in its abdomen all the yolk provided for it this is a physical impossibility in the fowl in the fowl figure 2 sheet 24 the enormous yolk y lies outside of the embryo and as the cells of the germinal area grow slowly over it umbilical bloodvessels are developed to absorb and carry the material to the embryo in the case of an embryo sinking in upon as it absorbs this mass of nutritive material a necessity for some respiratory structure is evident from the hinder end of the fowls intestine in a position corresponding to the socalled urinary bladder of the frog a solid outgrowth the allantois which speedily becomes hollow appears early stages are shown in figures 1 and 2 sheet 24 al while the same thing is shown more diagrammatically on sheet 23 figure 6 all this becomes at last a great hollow sac which is applied closely to the porous shell and the extent of which will be appreciated by looking at figure 5 sheet 24 where the allantois is shaded allantoic bloodvessels ramify thickly over its walls and aeration occurs through the permeable shell   section 29 the nature of the amnion will be understood by following figures 4b 5 and 6 on sheet 23 the three embryonic layers are indicated by broken lines dots and black lines just as they are in the frog diagrams not only is the embryo slowly pinched off from the yolk sac ys but as the yolk is absorbed beneath it and it grows in size it sinks into the space thus made the extraembryonic somatopleur and epiblast rise up round it as two folds which are seen closing in 5 and closed in 6 over the dorsal side of the young chick in this way a cavity a lined by epiblast and called the amniotic cavity is formed dorsal to this in 6 comes a space lined by somatic mesoblast and continuous with pp the pleuroperitoneal cavity or body cavity of the embryo outside this again is a layer of somatopleur internally and epiblast externally the false amnion fa which is continuous with the serous membrane sm enclosing the rest of the egg the student should carefully copy these diagrams with coloured pencils or inks for the different layers and should compare them with the more realistic renderings of figures 2 5 and 8 sheet 24   section 30 the heart in the fowl appears first as a pair of vessels which unite to form a straight trunk in the median line as the flattenedout embryo closes in from the yolk the way in which this straight trunk is thrown first of all into the s shape of the fish heart and then gradually assumes the adult form is indicated roughly by figure 3 in one respect the development of the heart does not follow the lines one would expect since between the fish and the higher form comes the condition of such an animal as the frog in which the auricles are divided while there is only one ventricle we might expect a stage in which the developing chicks heart would have one ventricle and a septum between the auricles but as a matter of fact the ventricles in fowl and rabbit are separated first and the separation of the auricles follows and is barely complete at birth   section 31 two vitelline veins from the yolk sac vv flow into the heart from behind as shown in figure 1 a later more complete and more diagrammatic figure of the circulation is seen in figure 7 at first there are two anterior cardinal ac and two posterior cardinal veins pc uniting to form cuvierian sinuses cs that open into the heart just as in the dogfish but later the inferior cava is developed and extends backward the posterior cardinals atrophy the cuvierian sinuses become the superior cavae and the anterior cardinals the internal jugular veins the vitelline veins vv flow at first uninterruptedly through the liver to the inferior cava but as development proceeds a capillary system is established in the liver and the through communication the ductus venosus is reduced at last completely bearing in mind that the yolk is outside the body in the fowl and inside it in the frog the vitelline veins of the former have a considerable resemblance in position and in their relation to the portal vein to a portion of the single anterior abdominal vein blood is taken out to the allantois however by the arteries of the latter type   section 32 five aortic arches are generally stated to appear altogether in the fowl but not simultaneously the first two the mandibular and the hyoid vascular arches early disappear and are not comparable to any in the frog the third is the first branchial arch and like the corresponding arch in the frog forms the carotid artery the second branchial is the aortic arch and what has hitherto been regarded as the third the fifth arch ie the pulmonary artery a transitory arch it is now known however appears between the second branchial and the last and it is therefore the fourth branchial arch which is the pulmonary just as it is in the frog   section 33 blood it may be mentioned first appears in the area vasculosa the outer portion of the area opaca embryonic cells send out processes and so become multipolar the processes of adjacent cells coalesce the nucleus divides and empty spaces appear in the substance of each of the cells  in this way the cavities of the smaller vessels and capillaries are formed and the products of the internal divisions of the cells become the corpuscles within the vessels the red blood corpuscles of the rabbit it may be added are nucleated for a considerable portion of embryonic life larger vessels and the heart are burrowed as it were out of masses of mesoblast cells the course of the blood in the embryo is by the veins to the right auricle thence through the imperfection of the auricular septum already alluded to into the left auricle then the left ventricle aortic arches for the future pulmonary artery is in communication by a part presently blocked the ductus arterious with the systemic aorta arteries capillaries veins the liver capillary system and the pulmonary system only become inserted upon the circulation at a comparatively late stage   section 34 with the exception of the reduction of the pronephros what has been said of the development of the frogs nervous system renal and reproductive organs and skeleton applies sufficiently to the fowl for our present purposes the entire separation of wolffian and mullerian ducts from the very beginning of development is here beyond all question vide section 18 but the notochord in the fowl is not so distinctly connected with the hypoblast and so distinct from the mesoblast as it is in the lower type and no gills internal or external are ever developed the gill slits occur with a modification due to the slitting and flattening out of the embryo already insisted upon for whereas in the tadpole they may be described as perforations in the fowl they appear as four notches between ingrowing processes that are endeavouring to meet in the middle line    the development of the rabbit  section 35 the early development of the rabbit is apt to puzzle students a little at first we have an ovum practically free from yolk alecithal and therefore we find it dividing completely and almost equally we naturally assume from what we have learnt that the next stages will be the formation of a hollow blastosphere invagination a gastrula forming mesoblast by hollow outgrowths from the archenteron and so on there is no yolk here to substitute epiboly section 9 for invagination nor to obliterate the archenteron and the blastopore through its pressure  yet none of these things we have anticipated occur  we find solid mesoblastic somites we find primitive streak allantois and amnion features we have just been explaining as the consequence of an excess of yolk in the egg we even find a yolk sac with no yolk in it   section 36 a solid mass of cells is formed at the beginning called a morula figure 1 in this we are able to distinguish rather smaller outer layer cells olc and rather larger inner layer cells ilc but these cells in their later development do not answer at all to the two primitive layers of the gastrula and the name of van benedens blastopore vbb for a point where the outer layer of cells is incomplete over the inner only commemorates the authorship of a misnomer the uniformity or agreement in the development of our other vertebrate types is apparently departed from here  illustration development section 36   section 37 as the egg develops however we are astonished to find an increasing resemblance to that of the fowl a split occurs at one point between outer layer and inner layer cells and the space resulting y in figure 2 is filled by an increasing amount of fluid and rapidly enlarges so that presently we have the state of affairs shown in 3 in which the inner layer cells are gathered together at one point on the surface of the ovum and constitute the germinal area if with hubrecht we regard the outer layer cells as an egg membrane there is a curious parallelism between this egg and the fowls the fluid y representing the yolk and the inner layer cells the cells of the fowls germinal area  at any rate the subsequent development goes far to justify such a view the inner cells split into epi meso and hypoblast like the blastoderm in the fowl there is a primitive streak and no blastopore an amnion arises the yolk sac small and full of serous fluid is cut off just as the enormous yolk of the fowl is cut off and an allantois arises in the same way there is no need to give special diagrams figures 3 4b 5 and 6 of the fowl will do in all respects except proportion for the development of the rabbit the differences are such as we may account for not on the supposition that the rabbits ovum never had any yolk but that an abundant yolk has been withdrawn from it the nutrition of the embryo by yolk has been superseded by some better method the supposition that the rabbit is descended from ancestors which like the birds and reptiles laid eggs with huge quantities of yolk meets every circumstance of the case   section 38 but the allantois and yolk sac of the rabbit though they correspond in development differ entirely in function from the similar organs of the fowl the yolk sac is of the very smallest nutritive value instead of being the sole source of food its contents scarcely avail the young rabbit at all as nourishment its presence in development is difficult to account for except on the supposition that it was once of far greater importance at an early stage the outgrowing allantois pushing in front of it the serous membrane is closely applied to the lining of the mothers uterus the maternal uterus and the embryonic allantois send out fingerlike processes into each other which interlock and the tissue between the abundant bloodvessels in them thins down to such an extent that nutritive material peptones and carbohydrates and oxygen also diffuse freely through it from mother to foetus and carbon dioxide water and urea from the foetus to the mother the structure thus formed by the union of the wall of the maternal uterus allantois and the intermediate structures is called the placenta through its intermediation the young rabbit becomes as it were rooted and parasitic on the mother and utilizes her organs for its own alimentation respiration and excretion it gives off co2 h2o and urea by the placenta and it receives o and elaborated food material through the same organ this is the better method that has superseded the yolk   the embryo   section 39 in its later development the general facts already enunciated with regard to the organs of frog and fowl hold and where frog and fowl are stated to differ the rabbit follows the fowl in the circulation the left fourth vascular arch second branchial gives rise to the aortic arch in the right the corresponding arch disappears except so much of it as remains as the innominate artery the azygos vein chapter 3 is a vestige of is derived from the right posterior cardinal sinus both pulmonary arteries in the rabbit are derived from the left sixth vascular arch  fourth branchial compare section 32 the allantois altogether disappears in the adult fowl in the adult mammal a portion of its hollow stalk remains as the urinary bladder and the point where it left the body is marked by the umbilicus or navel the umbilical arteries become the small hypogastric arteries on either side of the urinary bladder there is no trace of a pronephros at all in the rabbit   section 40 we may note here the development of the eye this is shown in figure 4 sheet 24 a hollow cupshaped vesicle from the brain grows out towards an at first hollow cellular ingrowth from the epidermis the cavity within the wall of the cup derived from the brain is obliterated and the stalk withers the cup becomes the retina and its stalk thence fibres grow back to the brain to form the optic nerve the cellular ingrowth is the lens the remainder of the eyestructures are of mesoblastic origin except the superficial epithelium of the cornea the retinal cup is not complete at first along the ventral line so that the rim of the cup viewed as in figure 1 r is horseshoe shaped hence the optic nerve differs from other nerves in being primitively hollow in all other sense organs as for instance the olfactory sacs and the ears the percipient epithelium is derived from the epiblast directly and not indirectly through the nervous system these remarks apply to all vertebrate types   section 41 the supposition that the general characters of the rabbits ovum were stamped upon it as an heritage from a period when the ancestors of the mammals were egglaying reptiles is strengthened by the fact that the two lowest and most reptilelike of all the mammalia the duckbilled platypus and the echidna have been shown to depart from the distinctive mammalian character and to lay eggs and in further confirmation of this supposition we find in tracing the mammals and reptiles back through the geological record that in the permian and triassic rocks there occur central forms which combine in a most remarkable way reptilian and mammalian characteristics   section 42 in conclusion we would earnestly recommend the student to see more of embryological fact than what is given him here it is seeing and thinking much more than reading which will enable him to clothe the bare terms and phrases of embryology with coherent knowledge in howes atlas of biology there is a much fuller series of figures of the frogs development than can be given here and they are drawn by an abler hand than mine can pretend to be there is also an atlas dembryologie by mathias duval that makes the study of the fowls development entertaining and altogether delightful such complete series as these are from the nature of the case impossible with the rabbit many students who take up the subject of biology do so only as an accessory to more extended work in other departments of science to such practical work in embryology is either altogether impossible or only possibly to a very limited extent the time it will consume is much greater and the intellectual result is likely to be far less than the study of such plates as we have named    the theory of evolution  section 43 we have now considered our types both from the standpoint of adult anatomy and from embryological data and we have seen through the vertebrate series a common structure underlying wide diversity in external appearance and detailed anatomy we have seen a certain intermediateness of structure in the frog as compared with the rabbit and dogfish notably in the skull and skeleton in the circulation in the ear and in the reduced myomeres and we have seen that the rabbit passes in these respects and in others through dogfish and froglike stages in its development and this alone would be quite sufficient to suggest that the similarities of structure are due to other causes than a primordial adaptation to certain conditions of life   section 44 it has been suggested by very excellent people that these resemblances are due to some unexplained necessity of adherence to type as though the power that they assume created these animals originally as they are now coupled creative ability with a plentiful lack of ideas and so perforce repeated itself with impotent variations on the other hand we have the supposition that these are family likenesses and the marks of a common ancestry this is the opinion now accepted by all zoologists of repute   section 45 it must not be for a moment imagined that it is implied that rabbits are descended from frogs or frogs from dogfish but that these three forms are remote cousins derived from some ancient and far simpler progenitor but since both rabbit and frog pass through phases like the adult condition of the dogfish it seems probable that the dogfish has remained more like the primordial form than these two and similarly the frog than the rabbit   section 46 hence we may infer that the mammals were the last of the three groups of which we have taken types to appear upon the earth and that the fishes preceded the amphibia workers in an entirely independent province that of palaeontology completely endorse this supposition the first vertebrata to appear in the fossil history of the world are fishes fish spines and placoid scales compare dogfish appear in the ordovician rocks in the coal measures come the amphibia and in the permotriassic strata reptilelike mammals in the devonian rocks which come between the silurian and the coal measures we find very plentiful remains of certain fish called the dipnoi of which group three genera still survive they display in numberless features of their anatomy transitional characters between true fish and amphibia similarly in the permian come mammallike reptiles that point also downward to the amphibia we find therefore the story told by the ovum written also in the rocks   section 47 now when this fact of a common ancestry is considered it becomes necessary to explain how this gradual change of animal forms may have been brought about   section 48 two subcontrary propositions hold of the young of any animal it resembles in many points its parent it differs in many points from its parent the general scheme of structure and the greater lines of feature are parental inherited there are also novel and unique details that mark the individual the first fact is the law of inheritance the second of variation   section 49 now the parent or parents since they live and breed must be more or less but sufficiently adapted to their conditions of living more or less fitted to the needs of life the variation in the young animal will be one of three kinds it will fit the animal still better to the conditions under which its kind live or it will be a change for the worse or it is possible to imagine that the variation as in the colour variations of domesticated cats will affect its prospects in life very little in the first case the probability is that the new animal will get on in life and breed and multiply above the average in the second it is probable that in the competition for food and other amenities of life the disadvantage whatever it is under which the animal suffers will shorten its career and abbreviate the tale of its offspring while in the third case an average career may be expected hence disregarding accidents which may be eliminated from the problem by taking many cases there is a continual tendency among the members of a species of animals in favour of the proportionate increase of the individuals most completely adapted to the conditions under which the species lives that is while the conditions remain unchanged the animals considered as one group are continually more highly perfected to live under those conditions and under changed conditions the specific form will also change   section 50 the idea of this process of change may be perhaps rendered more vivid by giving an imaginary concrete instance of its working in the jungles of india which preserve a state of things which has existed for immemorial years we find the tiger his stripes simulating jungle reeds his noiseless approach learnt from nature in countless millions of lessons of success and failure his perfectly powerful claws and execution methods and living in the same jungle and with him as one of the conditions of life are small deer alert swift light of build inconspicuous of colour sharp of hearing keeneyed keenscented because any downward variation from these attributes means swift and certain death to capture the deer is a condition of the tigers life to escape the tiger a condition of the deers and they play a great contest under these conditions with life as the stake the most alert deer almost always escape the least so perish   section 51 but conditions may alter for instance while most of these deer still live in the jungle with tigers over a considerable area of their habitat some change may be at work that thins the jungle destroys the tigers in it and brings in let us say wolves as an enemy to the deer instead of tigers now against the wolves which do not creep but hunt noisily and which do not spring suddenly upon prey but follow by scent and run it down in packs keen eyes sharp ears acute perceptions will be far less important than endurance in running the deer under the new conditions will need coarser and more powerful limbs and a larger chest it will be an advantage to be rough and big instead of frail and inconspicuous and the ears and eyes need not be so large the old refinements will mean weakness and death any variation along the line of size and coarseness will be advantageous slight and delicate deer will be continually being killed rougher and stronger deer continually escaping and so gradually under the new circumstances if they are not sufficient to exterminate the species the finer characteristics will be eliminated and a new variety of our old jungle deer will arise and if the separation and contrast of the conditions is sufficiently great and permanent we may at last in the course of ages get a new kind of deer specifically different in its limbs body sense organs colour and instincts from the deer that live in the jungle and these latter will on their side be still continually more perfected to the jungle life they are leading   section 52 take a wider range of time and vaster changes of condition than this and it becomes possible to imagine how the social cattle with their united front against an enemy fierce onslaught and their general adaptation to prairie life have differentiated from the ancestors of the slight and timid deer how the patient camel with his storage hump water storage and feet padded against hot sand has been moulded by the necessity of desert life from the same ancestral form and so we may work back and link these forms and other purely vegetarian feeders with remoter cousins the ancestral hogs working in this way we presently get a glimpse of a possible yet remoter connection of all these hoofed and mainly vegetarian animals with certain central types that carry us across to the omnivorous and in some cases almost entirely vegetarian bears and to the great and prosperous family of clawed meateaters and thus we elucidate at last a thread of blood relationship between the at present strongly contrasted and antagonistic deer and tiger and passing thence into still wider generalizations it would be possible to connect the rabbit playing in the sunshine with the frog in the ditch the dogfish in the seawaters and the lancelet in the sand for the transition from dogfish to rabbit differs from the transition from one species of deer to another only in magnitude it is an affair of vast epochs instead merely of thousands of years   section 53 it would however be beyond the design of this book to carry our demonstration of the credibility of a common ancestry of animals still further back but we may point out here that it is not a theory based merely upon one set of facts but one singularly rich in confirmation we can construct on purely anatomical grounds a theoretical pedigree now the independent study of embryology suggests exactly the same pedigree and the entirely independent testimony of palaeontology is precisely in harmony with the already confirmed theory arrived at in this way   section 54 it is in the demonstration of this wonderful unity in life only the more confirmed the more exhaustive our analysis becomes that the educational value and human interest of biology chiefly lies in the place of disconnected species of animals arbitrarily created and a belief in the settled inexplicable the student finds an enlightening realization of uniform and active causes beneath an apparent diversity and the world is not made and dead like a cardboard model or a childs toy but a living equilibrium and every day and every hour every living thing is being weighed in the balance and found sufficient or wanting  our little book is the merest beginning in zoology we have stated one or two groups of facts and made one or two suggestions the great things of the science of darwin huxley wallace and balfour remain mainly untold in the book of nature there are written for instance the triumphs of survival the tragedy of death and extinction the tragicomedy of degradation and inheritance the gruesome lesson of parasitism and the political satire of colonial organisms zoology is indeed a philosophy and a literature to those who can read its symbols in the contemplation of beauty of form and of mechanical beauty and in the intellectual delight of tracing and elucidating relationships and criticising appearances there is also for many a great reward in zoological study with an increasing knowledge of the facts of the form of life there gradually appears to the student the realization of an entire unity shaped out by their countless and often beautiful diversity and at last in the place of the manifoldness of a fair or a marine store the student of science perceives the infinite variety of one consistent and comprehensive being a realization to which no other study leads him at present so surely  to the student who feels inclined to amplify this brief outline of vertebrate anatomy we may mention the following books wiedersheims and parkers vertebrates huxleys anatomy of the vertebrata flowers osteology of the mammalia wallaces distribution nicholson and lyddekers palaeontology volume 2 the summaries in rollestons forms of animal life where a

structure of typical organisms the principle of repetition of similar parts    note on making comparisons  students preparing for examinations are frequently troubled by comparison questions tabulation is often recommended but we are inclined to favour a rather more flexible plan of marking off differences and resemblances in tabulation a considerable loss of time is occasioned by writing down the features of both the things compared and this is a serious consideration for the examinee we advise him therefore first if he possibly can to draw side by side and in corresponding positions the two things under consideration and then going over them in a methodical way to state simply the difference between each homologous part we append as examples three test answers actually submitted with figures in correspondence work  1 compare the brain of the frog with that of the rabbit     in the frogs forebrain        the olfactory lobes are fused in the middle line        there is no

amphicoelous    ie hollow at either end     the centra of the rabbit are flatfaced     the centra of the frog are procoelous hollow in front     the notochord persists between the centra in the dogfish and    rabbit within the centra in frog     the centra of the rabbit have epiphyses absent in the dogfish    and frog     the transverse processes of the rabbit typically bear ribs    short ribs occur in the dogfish but their homology with those    of the rabbit is doubtful the frog has no ribs     the interneural plates are peculiar to the dogfish in this    comparison  3 compare the skull of the dog with that of the frog     the brain case        of the frog is a cylindrical box from which the otic capsules       project conspicuously on either side it contains only two       ossifications in its cartilaginous substance the sphenethmoid       and the exoccipital being protected by the membrane bones       the parietofrontals above and the parasphenoid below        in the mammal it is enormously inflated and the otic capsules       are imbedded in its wall there are supra and basi as well as       exoccipital bones the parasphenoid is  entirely gone and       its place is taken by the basi and presphenoids and the       lateral walls contain fresh paired ossifications the ali and       orbitosphenoids all cartilage bones the sphenethmoid is       perhaps represented in part by the ethmoid        as a result of the inflation of the braincase the squamosal       which slopes downward and outward in the frog and overlies the       cartilaginous suspensorium quadrate cartilage has become a       constituent of the braincase wall and slopes downwardly and in     jaw suspension        the point of attachment of the jaw has shifted outward and the       original suspensorial cartilage the quadrate has taken on a new       and minor function as the incus of the middle ear the squamosal       superseding it as the suspensory part     lower jaw        distinct bones in the frog one mass in the dog     otic capsule        position as specified one centre of ossification in the frog       forming prootic several fuse together and form periotic of the       dog        there is no bulla and no external ear in the frog     palate        in the frog the posterior nares open into the front of the mouth       in the dog the maxillae and palatines send plates down and in the       palatine plates to cut off a nasal passage from the rest of the       buccal chamber and carry the posterior nares back to the pharynx       thus cutting the vomers off from the mouth roof        the pterygoids in the dog are much reduced and do not reach back       to the suspensorium        the frog has no lachrymal bone    syllabus of practical work  we would impress upon the student at the outset the importance of some preliminary reading before dissection is undertaken no one would dream of attempting to explore a deserted city without some previous study of maps and guidebooks but we find again and again students undertaking to explore the complicated anatomy of a vertebrated animal without the slightest or only the slightest preparatory reading this is entirely a mistake a student should be familiar with the nomenclature of the structures he contemplates examining he should have some idea of their mutual relations and functions or his attention will inevitably be diverted by the difficulty of new names and physiological questionings to the neglect of his dissection and that careful observation of form and mutual position which is the essential object of dissection on the other hand it is equally necessary perhaps more so to warn students against the bookish fallacy and to assure them of the absolute impossibility of realizing biological facts from reading alone practical work can alone confirm and complete the knowledge to which the textbook is the guide in scientific teaching it may sometimes be convenient for the thought to precede the thing but until the thing has been dealt with the knowledge gained is an unsatisfactory and unstable possession  for such dissection as the subjectmatter of this book requires the following appliances will be needed     a two or three scalpels of various sizes     b scissors which must taper gradually have straight blades and    be pointed at the ends and which must bite right up to the tips or    they are useless two pairs small and large are advisable     c forceps which must hold firmly and meet truly at the points     d two needles set in wooden handles     e an ordinary watchmakers eyeglass is very helpful but not    indispensable     f a dissecting dish an ordinary pie dish will do into which    melted paraffin wax has been poured to the depth of say    threequarters of an inch and allowed to solidify this wax may    be blackened by mixture with lampblack if the wax floats up at any    time it can of course be remelted or it may be loaded with    lead     g a rough table or board for the rabbit and dogfish     h blanket pins and ordinary pins     i a pickle or other widemouthed jar and some common methylated    spirit     j a microscope with low power of 1 inch or 12 inch and high    power 16 inch or 14 inch glass slips and cover glasses and a    bottle of very weak 1 per cent solution of salt  animals for dissection may be obtained from the recognised dealers who usually advertise in such scientific periodicals as nature natural science and knowledge sinel naturalist jersey is the most satisfactory dealer in dogfish in our experience bolton malvern will supply amphioxus through the post frogs and rabbits may be obtained anywhere the tame variety of rabbit is quite satisfactory for the purpose of dissection  the following notes may possibly be of some use to the student they follow the lines of work arranged by the author for the evening classes of the university tutorial college classes considerably restricted as regards time when compared with ordinary laboratory workers most of the sections below occupied about three hours but for a student working alone they are more likely to take four or five and even then it is not probable that they will be so satisfactory as if performed under skilled supervision there are many points extremely difficult to convey verbally which are elucidated at once by actual demonstration upon a specimen each of these dissections should be repeated and it is well if a different condition of the type is selected for the repetition an old one if the first specimen was immature a female if the first was a male   the rabbit  may be killed by chloroform or potassium cyanide or drowned it may also be readily suffocated with household gas it should be killed immediately before use as otherwise the gastric juice attacks the wall of the stomach and the dissection is in consequence rendered extremely disagreeable a very young rabbit is unsatisfactory as regards the genitalia but otherwise there is no objection to a little one and it has this advantage that it may be immersed more conveniently under water in a large pie dish for purposes of fine dissection the external features of the animal should be examined eyelids whiskers and teeth toes anus perineal space on either side of the same urogenital opening and position of the ribs vertebral column and limb girdles beneath the skin should be made out then the animal should be pinned out through the legs the ventral surface uppermost the skin opened up along the middle line from pelvic girdle to symphyses of jaw separated from the body wall below by means of the handle of a scalpel and turned back and then the abdominal wall should be cut into and two flaps pinned back to expose its contents note the xiphisternum the caecum and colon will be recognised section 16 the stomach the right and left central and left lateral lobes of the liver will probably be apparent and the urinary bladder especially if distended in the middle line behind without any further dissection but simply by turning the parts over all the structures of the abdomen in figure 1 sheet 1 will be identified seek especially for and note particularly the gall bladder bile duct and portal vein pancreatic duct sacculus rotundus vermiform appendix ureters by pulling urinary bladder forward genital ducts looping over ureters spleen kidneys and adrenals the vena cava inferior is seen dorsally the genital duct guides the student to the genital gland if the subject is a male the testes may be exposed by dissection or by pulling the vas deferens gently the scrotal sac will be turned inside out and the testes brought into view the ovary lies exposed without dissection posterior to the kidney examine all this carefully and make small sketches of points of interest the duodenal loop and the pyloric end of the stomach for instance the meeting of colon caecum and sacculus rotundus again or the urinary bladder and adjacent parts note the dorsal aorta and vena cava and their connexions behind compare figure of circulation cut through pelvic girdle and remove one hind leg to see bladder and genital ducts better compare sheet 10 wash away any blood that may flow turn all the intestines over to the animals right and see the dorsal aorta and vena cava inferior of the abdomen the inferior mesenteric artery and the spermatic or ovarian artery compare of course with figure in book in front immediately dorsal to the spleen is a variable quantity of lymphoidal tissue which must be very carefully cleared to see the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries separate spigelian lobe from stomach and look for vagus nerve descending by oesophagus solar plexus around the superior mesenteric artery and thrown up very distinctly by the purple vena cava inferior beneath and the splanchnic nerve to see the abdominal sympathetic behind gently remove the peritoneum that lies on either side of the aorta bloodvessels will be seen running in between the vertebral bodies and the sympathetic chain with its ganglia made out very distinctly as it runs across them longitudinally now cut oesophagus just in front of stomach and cut the rectum cut through the mesentery supporting the intestine and remove and unravel alimentary canal cut open wash out and examine caecum and stomach bleeding to a considerable extent is inevitable chiefly from the portal vein the liver had better remain if the same rabbit is to serve for the second dissection  second dissection skin front of thorax and neck note subclavian veins running out to fore limbs avoid cutting these cut through ribs and remove front of thorax to expose its contents cut up middle line of neck and clear off small muscle bands to expose bloodvessels pick away carefully whatever is left of thymus gland make out structure of heart and bloodvessels as described in chapter 3 note larynx and trachea now proceed to the examination of the nerves of this region see phrenic nerve by vena cava inferior and between heart and lungs and sympathetic running over the heads of the ribs by the common carotids will be found the large white vagus nerve the greyish sympathetic and a small branch of x the depressor make out branches of x named in text the big white cervical spinal nerves will be evident dorsally clear forward into the angle between the jaw and the bulla tympani to see xii and xi ix will be found lying deeper dorsal to the carotid artery and body of the hyoid compare with figure given of this skin the cheek and see vii running over it cut through malar and remove it cut through lower jawbone and turn it back to see the third branch of the fifth nerve on its inner side examine the muscles of eyeball and remove it to expose the first and second branches of v the latter is especially deep within orbit remove open wash out and examine the heart shave off the dorsal wall of cranium to expose hemispheres of brain and then put the head in strong spirit for a week or so with a second rabbit this dissection may advantageously be varied by removing the lower jaw cutting up through soft palate and observing openings of the eustachian tubes the tonsils on the ventral side of the soft palate must not confused with these the heart should also be cut out washed out and examined compare sections 38 44  third dissection before this is performed the mammalian skull should have been studied and examined take the head of a rabbit the brain of which has been hardened by spirit and carefully remove cranium be particularly careful in picking away the periotic bone on account of the flocculi of cerebellum it is difficult to avoid injury to the pituitary body embedded in the basisphenoid bone examine with the help of sheet 8 make the sections there indicated   the frog  may be killed by drowning in dilute methylated spirit or by chloroform take a recentlykilled frog and examine a drop of its blood spread out on a glass slip under the microscope compare it with your own before using the high power put a cover glass over the object of course scrape the roof of the mouth of the frog gently to obtain ciliated epithelium and mount in very weak salt solution the cilia will still be active squamous epithelium may be seen by the student similarly scraping the interior of his own cheek take a piece of muscle from one of the frogs limbs tease out with needles upon a glass slip and examine to see the striations clearly the high power will be needed compare a piece of muscle from the wall of the alimentary canal similarly examine nerve and connective tissue  first dissection pin out the frog in a dissecting dish ventral surface uppermost and cover with water open up the skin along the midventral line note the large subcutaneous lymph spaces the pelvic and pectoral girdles and the anterior abdominal vein cut into the body cavity on one side of this latter cut across in front of where the vein dips down to liver and peel the body wall away from it the xiphisternum will probably be cut in this operation in early spring the females are greatly distended with ova and the greater portion of the ovary may with advantage be removed the oviduct is dead white then and larger and much more in evidence than the pinkish intestine even turn over the viscera and compare with sheet 11 one lung is often found greatly inflated and then projects back into the body cavity the stomach is in some cases pushed forward and hidden behind the shoulder girdle observe the allantoic bladder the spleen gall bladder portal vein and pancreas by squeezing the gall bladder gently the bile duct will be injected with bile and will be apparent if the stomach is turned over the oesophagus just in front of the stomach should be cut through and the rectum and the mesentery and alimentary canal supported by it removed this will expose the urogenital organs vide figures given these vary greatly especially in the females at different seasons the condition figured would be seen in late autumn or winter in spring females are often found copulating with males and then the ovary itself is inconspicuous while the lower part of the oviduct is enormously distended with ova so as to be mistaken sometimes for the ovary by those who fail to note that the ova are enclosed by a thin semitransparent skin wall of oviduct the vena cava inferior is seen between the kidneys and the renal portal vein beside the ureter cutting through the mesentery supporting the kidney laterally the dorsal aorta is exposed and on either side of it the sympathetic chain and rami communicantes often tinged with black pigment this black pigment is a frequent but variable feature of the frogs anatomy and usually dapples or blackens the testes and also sometimes darkens the otherwise pale pink arteries behind the kidneys the sciatic plexus also becomes visible careful drawings should be made cut off the head of the frog shave off top of brain case and put the head in strong spirit  second dissection a fresh frog is required pin out under water as before and open up body cavity now carefully remove the muscle from the ventral portion of the shoulder girdle to expose the clavicles and coracoids cut away xiphisternum and then cut through clavicles and coracoids on either side and remove ventral part of shoulder girdle to expose the heart open out the cut portions of body wall and pin the veins going towards the heart should now with a little examination be evident make out the external jugular the innominate and its two branches and the pulmocutaneous and vena cava superior clear by carefully picking away any shreds of semitransparent tissue make out by feeling the position of the hyoid body and of its anterior cornua note the hypoglossal nerve first spinal running ventral to this and the ninth cranial nerve running parallel to it but dorsal to the hyoid hidden therefore by the hyoid and reappearing in front the vagus may also be made out less distinctly running posteroventrally towards the heart by clearing the muscle by the rumus of the jaw vii may be seen and the third branch of v running across the jaw at about the middle of its length pick off the thin transparent pericardium from the heart very carefully and proceed to cut away all the veins made out the truncus arteriosus may then be followed up as it branches note all the branches shown in the figures in this book the precise position of the vessels will vary to a certain extent with the attitude in which the frog is pinned the cutaneous artery will prevent the student following up the aortic arch until it is cut then the arch may be followed round until it meets its fellow to form the dorsal aorta note the sympathetic again make careful drawings of all this cut off lower jaw and note posterior nares and eustachian openings if time allows remove the heart and examine by cutting open and washing compare section 44 remove eyeball to see the first and second branches of the fifth nerve and the vidian ie palatial branch of the seventh  third dissection read the account of the frogs skull carefully take the head of a recently killed frog and drop into boiling water for a minute then pick off very carefully muscle connective tissue nerves and etc to clear the craniofacial apparatus examine the bones compare with figures given in this book and draw take the head which has been in spirit a fortnight or so pick away cranium and compare brain with figures given examine ventricles by taking sections after drawings have been made   the dogfish  first dissection examine external characters nasal grooves no internal nares fins spiracle scales passing over lips and cloaca cut off tail below the cloacal opening the males are distinguished by the large claspers along the inner edge of the pelvic fin open up body cavity usually this is in a terrible mess in the fish supplied by dealers through the postmortem digestion of the stomach wash out all this under a stream of water from a tap or waterbottle frequently the testes are washed out of the male in this operation and ova from the loose ovaries in the female now compare with figure given in this book allowing for the collapse of the stomach if it has occurred cut through the oesophagus and rectum and remove alimentary canal from body cut open and wash out the intestine and examine spiral valve now make a careful examination of the cloaca and its apertures and dissect away the peritoneum hiding the kidney in the female find the opening of the oviducts in front of the liver remove liver and cut off body now behind pectoral fin before throwing tail and hinder part of body away note the myotomes of body wall the notochord and vertebral body neural canal and in the tail the haemal canal see section 9 the dogfish     lines from first edition only    the relation of the vertebral bodies to the notochord may be very    well seen by taking successive slices about onetenth of an inch    thick through the vertebral body the cartilage is hard and    semitransparent the notochord jellylike least at the centres    of the centra and at a maximum intervertebrally  the notochord is a soft jelly cut away the ventral part of the pectoral girdle to open pericardium with a seeker make out the pericardio peritoneal opening cut into the sinus venous and run seekers into the cuvierian and hepatic sinuses cut open the cuvierian and posterior cardinal sinuses and run seekers into their affluents dissect along the truncus arteriosus to afferent branchials cut away the heart and oesophagus run a seeker up the dorsal aorta and cut along it from the ventral side to subclavian and efferent branchial arteries skin the top of the head note while doing this the yellow jellylike sensetubuli beneath the skin shave off top of braincase and leave the head in spirit for a week or so  second dissection place the head with the ventral side downward skin all the dorsal surface as yet unskinned refer to book for precise position of the anterior cardinal sinus and then cut down through body wall into this just over gill slits the tenth nerve will become visible with its slit branches athwart the floor of the sinus clear to make this more evident and make out its lateral line and visceral branches and the ninth nerve     lines from second edition only    the pharyngobranchials may be felt beneath the sinus run a    seeker from the dorsal aorta to the efferent branchials  proceed now to orbit and without any dissection beyond the removal of skin make out recti and oblique muscles of eyeball and the optic third and fourth nerves cut through these structures carefully and remove exposing nerves seven and five as described and figured in the text examine the otic capsule by taking successive slices through it to show the labyrinth of the ear remove the dorsal wall of the skull to obtain a dorsal view of brain if this is sufficiently hard examine it if not return it to spirit for a more convenient occasion examine brain   amphioxus  two specimens of this type should be obtained it should be examined entire by the naked eye and with the low power of the microscope immersion in glycerine will render it more transparent or it may be cleared with oil of cloves put up temporarily in that or permanently in canada balsam one specimen should then be pinned out in the dissecting dish ventral side uppermost and the atrium opened to expose liver and pharynx a part of the pharynx may be examined with the low power to see the form of the gill slits the second specimen should be soaked in turpentine for some time and then dropped into melted paraffin wax transverse sections may then be cut with a razor the paraffin wax removed from these by solution in turpentine the turpentine in its turn dissolved out by alcohol and the sections after immersion in oil of cloves may be transferred to canada balsam for examination and preservation this work should not be attempted until some practical histological work has been done in botany and it may be altogether avoided by the purchase of stained and mounted sections   development  laboratory work in this portion of the science is not usually undertaken by elementary students of biology but the reader will probably find it helpful in the realization of the facts given in this book to look out for frog spawn in february and march and to catch and examine tadpoles of various sizes a small dissecting dish may be made by pouring melted paraffin wax into one of those shallow china pots chemists use for coldcream and tadpoles may be pinned out with entemologists pins and dissected with needles but this is a work of supererogation partially incubated hens eggs may be obtained at a small cost almost anywhere and the later stages profitably examined and dissected under warm water for a clear understanding of the allantois and amnion this last is almost indispensable a few microscopic slides of sections of embryonic chicks should also be compared with our rough diagrams     key for dissection sheets and
