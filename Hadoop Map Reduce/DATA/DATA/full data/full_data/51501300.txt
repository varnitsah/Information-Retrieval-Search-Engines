tendencies which i distrusted in america had at  that time any existence but in my imagination  they can examine  for themselves whether there has been anything in the public career  of that country since at home or abroad which suggests that those  influences and tendencies really did exist  as they find the fact  they will judge me  if they discern any evidences of wronggoing  in any direction that i have indicated they will acknowledge that  i had reason in what i wrote  if they discern no such indications  they will consider me altogether mistaken  but not wilfully  prejudiced i am not and never have been otherwise than in favour  of the united states  i have many friends in america i feel a  grateful interest in the country i hope and believe it will  successfully work out a problem of the highest importance to the  whole human race  to represent me as viewing america with ill nature coldness or animosity is merely to do a very foolish  thing  which is always a very easy one    chapter i  going away    i shall never forget the onefourth serious and threefourths  comical astonishment with which on the morning of the third of  january eighteenhundredandfortytwo i opened the door of and  put my head into a stateroom on board the britannia steam packet twelve hundred tons burthen per register bound for halifax  and boston and carrying her majestys mails  that this stateroom had been specially engaged for charles  dickens esquire and lady was rendered sufficiently clear even  to my scared intellect by a very small manuscript announcing the  fact which was pinned on a very flat quilt covering a very thin  mattress spread like a surgical plaster on a most inaccessible  shelf  but that this was the stateroom concerning which charles  dickens esquire and lady had held daily and nightly conferences  for at least four months preceding  that this could by any  possibility be that small snug chamber of the imagination which  charles dickens esquire with the spirit of prophecy strong upon  him had always foretold would contain at least one little sofa  and which his lady with a modest yet most magnificent sense of its  limited dimensions had from the first opined would not hold more  than two enormous portmanteaus in some odd corner out of sight  portmanteaus which could now no more be got in at the door not to  say stowed away than a giraffe could be persuaded or forced into a  flowerpot  that this utterly impracticable thoroughly hopeless  and profoundly preposterous box had the remotest reference to or  connection with those chaste and pretty not to say gorgeous  little bowers sketched by a masterly hand in the highly varnished  lithographic plan hanging up in the agents countinghouse in the  city of london  that this room of state in short could be  anything but a pleasant fiction and cheerful jest of the captains  invented and put in practice for the better relish and enjoyment of  the real stateroom presently to be disclosed these were truths  which i really could not for the moment bring my mind at all to  bear upon or comprehend  and i sat down upon a kind of horsehair  slab or perch of which there were two within and looked without  any expression of countenance whatever at some friends who had  come on board with us and who were crushing their faces into all  manner of shapes by endeavouring to squeeze them through the small  doorway  we had experienced a pretty smart shock before coming below which  but that we were the most sanguine people living might have  prepared us for the worst  the imaginative artist to whom i have  already made allusion has depicted in the same great work a  chamber of almost interminable perspective furnished as mr  robins would say in a style of more than eastern splendour and  filled but not inconveniently so with groups of ladies and  gentlemen in the very highest state of enjoyment and vivacity   before descending into the bowels of the ship we had passed from  the deck into a long narrow apartment not unlike a gigantic hearse  with windows in the sides having at the upper end a melancholy  stove at which three or four chilly stewards were warming their  hands while on either side extending down its whole dreary  length was a long long table over each of which a rack fixed to  the low roof and stuck full of drinkingglasses and cruetstands  hinted dismally at rolling seas and heavy weather  i had not at  that time seen the ideal presentment of this chamber which has  since gratified me so much but i observed that one of our friends  who had made the arrangements for our voyage turned pale on  entering retreated on the friend behind him smote his forehead  involuntarily and said below his breath impossible it cannot  be or words to that effect  he recovered himself however by a  great effort and after a preparatory cough or two cried with a  ghastly smile which is still before me looking at the same time  round the walls ha the breakfastroom steward  eh  we all  foresaw what the answer must be  we knew the agony he suffered   he had often spoken of the saloon had taken in and lived upon the  pictorial idea had usually given us to understand at home that  to form a just conception of it it would be necessary to multiply  the size and furniture of an ordinary drawingroom by seven and  then fall short of the reality  when the man in reply avowed the  truth the blunt remorseless naked truth this is the saloon  sir  he actually reeled beneath the blow  in persons who were so soon to part and interpose between their  else daily communication the formidable barrier of many thousand  miles of stormy space and who were for that reason anxious to cast  no other cloud not even the passing shadow of a moments  disappointment or discomfiture upon the short interval of happy  companionship that yet remained to them  in persons so situated  the natural transition from these first surprises was obviously  into peals of hearty laughter and i can report that i for one  being still seated upon the slab or perch before mentioned roared  outright until the vessel rang again  thus in less than two  minutes after coming upon it for the first time we all by common  consent agreed that this stateroom was the pleasantest and most  facetious and capital contrivance possible and that to have had it  one inch larger would have been quite a disagreeable and  deplorable state of things  and with this and with showing how   by very nearly closing the door and twining in and out like  serpents and by counting the little washing slab as standingroom   we could manage to insinuate four people into it all at one  time and entreating each other to observe how very airy it was in  dock and how there was a beautiful porthole which could be kept  open all day weather permitting and how there was quite a large  bullseye just over the lookingglass which would render shaving a  perfectly easy and delightful process when the ship didnt roll  too much we arrived at last at the unanimous conclusion that it  was rather spacious than otherwise  though i do verily believe  that deducting the two berths one above the other than which  nothing smaller for sleeping in was ever made except coffins it  was no bigger than one of those hackney cabriolets which have the  door behind and shoot their fares out like sacks of coals upon  the pavement  having settled this point to the perfect satisfaction of all  parties concerned and unconcerned we sat down round the fire in  the ladies cabin  just to try the effect  it was rather dark  certainly but somebody said of course it would be light at  sea a proposition to which we all assented echoing of course  of course though it would be exceedingly difficult to say why we  thought so  i remember too when we had discovered and exhausted  another topic of consolation in the circumstance of this ladies  cabin adjoining our stateroom and the consequently immense  feasibility of sitting there at all times and seasons and had  fallen into a momentary silence leaning our faces on our hands and  looking at the fire one of our party said with the solemn air of  a man who had made a discovery what a relish mulled claret will  have down here which appeared to strike us all most forcibly as  though there were something spicy and highflavoured in cabins  which essentially improved that composition and rendered it quite  incapable of perfection anywhere else  there was a stewardess too actively engaged in producing clean  sheets and tablecloths from the very entrails of the sofas and  from unexpected lockers of such artful mechanism that it made  ones head ache to see them opened one after another and rendered  it quite a distracting circumstance to follow her proceedings and  to find that every nook and corner and individual piece of  furniture was something else besides what it pretended to be and  was a mere trap and deception and place of secret stowage whose  ostensible purpose was its least useful one  god bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of  january voyages  god bless her for her clear recollection of the  companion passage of last year when nobody was ill and everybody  dancing from morning to night and it was a run of twelve days  and a piece of the purest frolic and delight and jollity  all  happiness be with her for her bright face and her pleasant scotch  tongue which had sounds of old home in it for my fellowtraveller  and for her predictions of fair winds and fine weather all wrong  or i shouldnt be half so fond of her and for the ten thousand  small fragments of genuine womanly tact by which without piecing  them elaborately together and patching them up into shape and form  and case and pointed application she nevertheless did plainly show  that all young mothers on one side of the atlantic were near and  close at hand to their little children left upon the other and  that what seemed to the uninitiated a serious journey was to  those who were in the secret a mere frolic to be sung about and  whistled at  light be her heart and gay her merry eyes for  years  the stateroom had grown pretty fast but by this time it had  expanded into something quite bulky and almost boasted a bay window to view the sea from  so we went upon deck again in high  spirits and there everything was in such a state of bustle and  active preparation that the blood quickened its pace and whirled  through ones veins on that clear frosty morning with involuntary  mirthfulness  for every gallant ship was riding slowly up and  down and every little boat was splashing noisily in the water and  knots of people stood upon the wharf gazing with a kind of dread  delight on the farfamed fast american steamer and one party of  men were taking in the milk or in other words getting the cow  on board and another were filling the icehouses to the very throat  with fresh provisions with butchersmeat and gardenstuff pale  suckingpigs calves heads in scores beef veal and pork and  poultry out of all proportion and others were coiling ropes and  busy with oakum yarns and others were lowering heavy packages into  the hold and the pursers head was barely visible as it loomed in  a state of exquisite perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of  passengers luggage and there seemed to be nothing going on  anywhere or uppermost in the mind of anybody but preparations for  this mighty voyage  this with the bright cold sun the bracing  air the crisplycurling water the thin white crust of morning ice  upon the decks which crackled with a sharp and cheerful sound  beneath the lightest tread was irresistible  and when again upon  the shore we turned and saw from the vessels mast her name  signalled in flags of joyous colours and fluttering by their side  the beautiful american banner with its stars and stripes  the  long three thousand miles and more and longer still the six  whole months of absence so dwindled and faded that the ship had  gone out and come home again and it was broad spring already in  the coburg dock at liverpool  i have not inquired among my medical acquaintance whether turtle  and cold punch with hock champagne and claret and all the  slight et cetera usually included in an unlimited order for a good  dinner  especially when it is left to the liberal construction of  my faultless friend mr radley of the adelphi hotel  are  peculiarly calculated to suffer a seachange or whether a plain  muttonchop and a glass or two of sherry would be less likely of  conversion into foreign and disconcerting material  my own opinion  is that whether one is discreet or indiscreet in these  particulars on the eve of a seavoyage is a matter of little  consequence and that to use a common phrase it comes to very  much the same thing in the end  be this as it may i know that  the dinner of that day was undeniably perfect that it comprehended  all these items and a great many more and that we all did ample  justice to it  and i know too that bating a certain tacit  avoidance of any allusion to tomorrow such as may be supposed to  prevail between delicateminded turnkeys and a sensitive prisoner  who is to be hanged next morning we got on very well and all  things considered were merry enough  when the morning  the morning  came and we met at breakfast it  was curious to see how eager we all were to prevent a moments  pause in the conversation and how astoundingly gay everybody was   the forced spirits of each member of the little party having as  much likeness to his natural mirth as hothouse peas at five  guineas the quart resemble in flavour the growth of the dews and  air and rain of heaven  but as one oclock the hour for going  aboard drew near this volubility dwindled away by little and  little despite the most persevering efforts to the contrary until  at last the matter being now quite desperate we threw off all  disguise openly speculated upon where we should be this time to morrow this time next day and so forth and entrusted a vast  number of messages to those who intended returning to town that  night which were to be delivered at home and elsewhere without  fail within the very shortest possible space of time after the  arrival of the railway train at euston square  and commissions and  remembrances do so crowd upon one at such a time that we were  still busied with this employment when we found ourselves fused as  it were into a dense conglomeration of passengers and passengers  friends and passengers luggage all jumbled together on the deck  of a small steamboat and panting and snorting off to the packet  which had worked out of dock yesterday afternoon and was now lying  at her moorings in the river  and there she is all eyes are turned to where she lies dimly  discernible through the gathering fog of the early winter  afternoon every finger is pointed in the same direction and  murmurs of interest and admiration  as how beautiful she looks  how trim she is  are heard on every side  even the lazy  gentleman with his hat on one side and his hands in his pockets  who has dispensed so much consolation by inquiring with a yawn of  another gentleman whether he is going across  as if it were a  ferry  even he condescends to look that way and nod his head as  who should say no mistake about that and not even the sage lord  burleigh in his nod included half so much as this lazy gentleman  of might who has made the passage as everybody on board has found  out already its impossible to say how thirteen times without a  single accident  there is another passenger very much wrappedup  who has been frowned down by the rest and morally trampled upon  and crushed for presuming to inquire with a timid interest how  long it is since the poor president went down  he is standing  close to the lazy gentleman and says with a faint smile that he  believes she is a very strong ship to which the lazy gentleman  looking first in his questioners eye and then very hard in the  winds answers unexpectedly and ominously that she need be  upon  this the lazy gentleman instantly falls very low in the popular  estimation and the passengers with looks of defiance whisper to  each other that he is an ass and an impostor and clearly dont  know anything at all about it  but we are made fast alongside the packet whose huge red funnel is  smoking bravely giving rich promise of serious intentions   packingcases portmanteaus carpetbags and boxes are already  passed from hand to hand and hauled on board with breathless  rapidity  the officers smartly dressed are at the gangway  handing the passengers up the side and hurrying the men  in five  minutes time the little steamer is utterly deserted and the  packet is beset and overrun by its late freight who instantly  pervade the whole ship and are to be met with by the dozen in  every nook and corner  swarming down below with their own baggage  and stumbling over other peoples disposing themselves comfortably  in wrong cabins and creating a most horrible confusion by having  to turn out again madly bent upon opening locked doors and on  forcing a passage into all kinds of outoftheway places where  there is no thoroughfare sending wild stewards with elfin hair  to and fro upon the breezy decks on unintelligible errands  impossible of execution  and in short creating the most  extraordinary and bewildering tumult  in the midst of all this  the lazy gentleman who seems to have no luggage of any kind  not  so much as a friend even  lounges up and down the hurricane deck  coolly puffing a cigar and as this unconcerned demeanour again  exalts him in the opinion of those who have leisure to observe his  proceedings every time he looks up at the masts or down at the  decks or over the side they look there too as wondering whether  he sees anything wrong anywhere and hoping that in case he  should he will have the goodness to mention it  what have we here  the captains boat and yonder the captain  himself  now by all our hopes and wishes the very man he ought  to be  a wellmade tightbuilt dapper little fellow with a  ruddy face which is a letter of invitation to shake him by both  hands at once and with a clear blue honest eye that it does one  good to see ones sparkling image in  ring the bell  ding  ding ding the very bell is in a hurry  now for the shore   whos for the shore  these gentlemen i am sorry to say  they  are away and never said good bye  ah now they wave it from the  little boat  good bye good bye  three cheers from them  three more from us three more from them  and they are gone  to and fro to and fro to and fro again a hundred times  this  waiting for the latest mailbags is worse than all  if we could  have gone off in the midst of that last burst we should have  started triumphantly  but to lie here two hours and more in the  damp fog neither staying at home nor going abroad is letting one  gradually down into the very depths of dulness and low spirits  a  speck in the mist at last  thats something  it is the boat we  wait for  thats more to the purpose  the captain appears on the  paddlebox with his speaking trumpet the officers take their  stations all hands are on the alert the flagging hopes of the  passengers revive the cooks pause in their savoury work and look  out with faces full of interest  the boat comes alongside the  bags are dragged in anyhow and flung down for the moment anywhere   three cheers more  and as the first one rings upon our ears the  vessel throbs like a strong giant that has just received the breath  of life the two great wheels turn fiercely round for the first  time and the noble ship with wind and tide astern breaks proudly  through the lashed and roaming water    chapter ii  the passage out    we all dined together that day and a rather formidable party we  were  no fewer than eightysix strong  the vessel being pretty  deep in the water with all her coals on board and so many  passengers and the weather being calm and quiet there was but  little motion so that before the dinner was half over even those  passengers who were most distrustful of themselves plucked up  amazingly and those who in the morning had returned to the  universal question are you a good sailor a very decided  negative now either parried the inquiry with the evasive reply  oh i suppose im no worse than anybody else or reckless of all  moral obligations answered boldly yes and with some irritation  too as though they would add i should like to know what you see  in me sir particularly to justify suspicion  notwithstanding this high tone of courage and confidence i could  not but observe that very few remained long over their wine and  that everybody had an unusual love of the open air and that the  favourite and most coveted seats were invariably those nearest to  the door  the teatable too was by no means as well attended as  the dinnertable and there was less whistplaying than might have  been expected  still with the exception of one lady who had  retired with some precipitation at dinnertime immediately after  being assisted to the finest cut of a very yellow boiled leg of  mutton with very green capers there were no invalids as yet and  walking and smoking and drinking of brandyandwater but always  in the open air went on with unabated spirit until eleven  oclock or thereabouts when turning in  no sailor of seven  hours experience talks of going to bed  became the order of the  night  the perpetual tramp of bootheels on the decks gave place  to a heavy silence and the whole human freight was stowed away  below excepting a very few stragglers like myself who were  probably like me afraid to go there  to one unaccustomed to such scenes this is a very striking time on  shipboard  afterwards and when its novelty had long worn off it  never ceased to have a peculiar interest and charm for me  the  gloom through which the great black mass holds its direct and  certain course the rushing water plainly heard but dimly seen  the broad white glistening track that follows in the vessels  wake the men on the lookout forward who would be scarcely  visible against the dark sky but for their blotting out some score  of glistening stars the helmsman at the wheel with the  illuminated card before him shining a speck of light amidst the  darkness like something sentient and of divine intelligence the  melancholy sighing of the wind through block and rope and chain  the gleaming forth of light from every crevice nook and tiny  piece of glass about the decks as though the ship were filled with  fire in hiding ready to burst through any outlet wild with its  resistless power of death and ruin  at first too and even when  the hour and all the objects it exalts have come to be familiar  it is difficult alone and thoughtful to hold them to their proper  shapes and forms  they change with the wandering fancy assume the  semblance of things left far away put on the wellremembered  aspect of favourite places dearly loved and even people them with  shadows  streets houses rooms figures so like their usual  occupants that they have startled me by their reality which far  exceeded as it seemed to me all power of mine to conjure up the  absent have many and many a time at such an hour grown suddenly  out of objects with whose real look and use and purpose i was as  well acquainted as with my own two hands  my own two hands and feet likewise being very cold however on  this particular occasion i crept below at midnight  it was not  exactly comfortable below  it was decidedly close and it was  impossible to be unconscious of the presence of that extraordinary  compound of strange smells which is to be found nowhere but on  board ship and which is such a subtle perfume that it seems to  enter at every pore of the skin and whisper of the hold  two  passengers wives one of them my own lay already in silent  agonies on the sofa and one ladys maid my ladys was a mere  bundle on the floor execrating her destiny and pounding her curl papers among the stray boxes  everything sloped the wrong way   which in itself was an aggravation scarcely to be borne  i had  left the door open a moment before in the bosom of a gentle  declivity and when i turned to shut it it was on the summit of a  lofty eminence  now every plank and timber creaked as if the ship  were made of wickerwork and now crackled like an enormous fire  of the driest possible twigs  there was nothing for it but bed so  i went to bed  it was pretty much the same for the next two days with a tolerably  fair wind and dry weather  i read in bed but to this hour i dont  know what a good deal and reeled on deck a little drank cold  brandyandwater with an unspeakable disgust and ate hard biscuit  perseveringly  not ill but going to be  it is the third morning  i am awakened out of my sleep by a dismal  shriek from my wife who demands to know whether theres any  danger  i rouse myself and look out of bed  the waterjug is  plunging and leaping like a lively dolphin all the smaller  articles are afloat except my shoes which are stranded on a  carpetbag high and dry like a couple of coalbarges  suddenly i  see them spring into the air and behold the lookingglass which  is nailed to the wall sticking fast upon the ceiling  at the same  time the door entirely disappears and a new one is opened in the  floor  then i begin to comprehend that the stateroom is standing  on its head  before it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible  with this novel state of things the ship rights  before one can  say thank heaven she wrongs again  before one can cry she is  wrong she seems to have started forward and to be a creature  actually running of its own accord with broken knees and failing  legs through every variety of hole and pitfall and stumbling  constantly  before one can so much as wonder she takes a high  leap into the air  before she has well done that she takes a deep  dive into the water  before she has gained the surface she throws  a summerset  the instant she is on her legs she rushes backward   and so she goes on staggering heaving wrestling leaping diving  jumping pitching throbbing rolling and rocking  and going  through all these movements sometimes by turns and sometimes  altogether  until one feels disposed to roar for mercy  a steward passes  steward  sir  what is the matter what do  you call this  rather a heavy sea on sir and a headwind  a headwind  imagine a human face upon the vessels prow with  fifteen thousand samsons in one bent upon driving her back and  hitting her exactly between the eyes whenever she attempts to  advance an inch  imagine the ship herself with every pulse and  artery of her huge body swollen and bursting under this  maltreatment sworn to go on or die  imagine the wind howling the  sea roaring the rain beating  all in furious array against her   picture the sky both dark and wild and the clouds in fearful  sympathy with the waves making another ocean in the air  add to  all this the clattering on deck and down below the tread of  hurried feet the loud hoarse shouts of seamen the gurgling in and  out of water through the scuppers with every now and then the  striking of a heavy sea upon the planks above with the deep dead  heavy sound of thunder heard within a vault  and there is the  headwind of that january morning  i say nothing of what may be called the domestic noises of the  ship  such as the breaking of glass and crockery the tumbling  down of stewards the gambols overhead of loose casks and truant  dozens of bottled porter and the very remarkable and far from  exhilarating sounds raised in their various staterooms by the  seventy passengers who were too ill to get up to breakfast  i say  nothing of them  for although i lay listening to this concert for  three or four days i dont think i heard it for more than a  quarter of a minute at the expiration of which term i lay down  again excessively seasick  not seasick be it understood in the ordinary acceptation of the  term  i wish i had been  but in a form which i have never seen or  heard described though i have no doubt it is very common  i lay  there all the day long quite coolly and contentedly with no  sense of weariness with no desire to get up or get better or  take the air with no curiosity or care or regret of any sort or  degree saving that i think i can remember in this universal  indifference having a kind of lazy joy  of fiendish delight if  anything so lethargic can be dignified with the title  in the fact  of my wife being too ill to talk to me  if i may be allowed to  illustrate my state of mind by such an example i should say that i  was exactly in the condition of the elder mr willet after the  incursion of the rioters into his bar at chigwell  nothing would  have surprised me  if in the momentary illumination of any ray of  intelligence that may have come upon me in the way of thoughts of  home a goblin postman with a scarlet coat and bell had come into  that little kennel before me broad awake in broad day and  apologising for being damp through walking in the sea had handed  me a letter directed to myself in familiar characters i am  certain i should not have felt one atom of astonishment  i should  have been perfectly satisfied  if neptune himself had walked in  with a toasted shark on his trident i should have looked upon the  event as one of the very commonest everyday occurrences  once  once  i found myself on deck  i dont know how i got  there or what possessed me to go there but there i was and  completely dressed too with a huge peacoat on and a pair of  boots such as no weak man in his senses could ever have got into   i found myself standing when a gleam of consciousness came upon  me holding on to something  i dont know what  i think it was  the boatswain  or it may have been the pump  or possibly the cow   i cant say how long i had been there whether a day or a minute   i recollect trying to think about something about anything in the  whole wide world i was not particular without the smallest  effect  i could not even make out which was the sea and which the  sky for the horizon seemed drunk and was flying wildly about in  all directions  even in that incapable state however i  recognised the lazy gentleman standing before me  nautically clad  in a suit of shaggy blue with an oilskin hat  but i was too  imbecile although i knew it to be he to separate him from his  dress and tried to call him i remember pilot  after another  interval of total unconsciousness i found he had gone and  recognised another figure in its place  it seemed to wave and  fluctuate before me as though i saw it reflected in an unsteady  lookingglass but i knew it for the captain and such was the  cheerful influence of his face that i tried to smile  yes even  then i tried to smile  i saw by his gestures that he addressed me  but it was a long time before i could make out that he remonstrated  against my standing up to my knees in water  as i was of course i  dont know why  i tried to thank him but couldnt  i could only  point to my boots  or wherever i supposed my boots to be  and say  in a plaintive voice cork soles at the same time endeavouring  i am told to sit down in the pool  finding that i was quite  insensible and for the time a maniac he humanely conducted me  below  there i remained until i got better  suffering whenever i was  recommended to eat anything an amount of anguish only second to  that which is said to be endured by the apparently drowned in the  process of restoration to life  one gentleman on board had a  letter of introduction to me from a mutual friend in london  he  sent it below with his card on the morning of the headwind and i  was long troubled with the idea that he might be up and well and  a hundred times a day expecting me to call upon him in the saloon   i imagined him one of those castiron images  i will not call them  men  who ask with red faces and lusty voices what seasickness  means and whether it really is as bad as it is represented to be   this was very torturing indeed and i dont think i ever felt such  perfect gratification and gratitude of heart as i did when i heard  from the ships doctor that he had been obliged to put a large  mustard poultice on this very gentlemans stomach  i date my  recovery from the receipt of that intelligence  it was materially assisted though i have no doubt by a heavy gale  of wind which came slowly up at sunset when we were about ten  days out and raged with gradually increasing fury until morning  saving that it lulled for an hour a little before midnight  there  was something in the unnatural repose of that hour and in the  after gathering of the storm so inconceivably awful and  tremendous that its bursting into full violence was almost a  relief  the labouring of the ship in the troubled sea on this night i shall  never forget  will it ever be worse than this was a question i  had often heard asked when everything was sliding and bumping  about and when it certainly did seem difficult to comprehend the  possibility of anything afloat being more disturbed without  toppling over and going down  but what the agitation of a steam vessel is on a bad winters night in the wild atlantic it is  impossible for the most vivid imagination to conceive  to say that  she is flung down on her side in the waves with her masts dipping  into them and that springing up again she rolls over on the  other side until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a  hundred great guns and hurls her back  that she stops and  staggers and shivers as though stunned and then with a violent  throbbing at her heart darts onward like a monster goaded into  madness to be beaten down and battered and crushed and leaped  on by the angry sea  that thunder lightning hail and rain and  wind are all in fierce contention for the mastery  that every  plank has its groan every nail its shriek and every drop of water  in the great ocean its howling voice  is nothing  to say that all  is grand and all appalling and horrible in the last degree is  nothing  words cannot express it  thoughts cannot convey it   only a dream can call it up again in all its fury rage and  passion  and yet in the very midst of these terrors i was placed in a  situation so exquisitely ridiculous that even then i had as strong  a sense of its absurdity as i have now and could no more help  laughing than i can at any other comical incident happening under  circumstances the most favourable to its enjoyment  about midnight  we shipped a sea which forced its way through the skylights burst  open the doors above and came raging and roaring down into the  ladies cabin to the unspeakable consternation of my wife and a  little scotch lady  who by the way had previously sent a message  to the captain by the stewardess requesting him with her  compliments to have a steel conductor immediately attached to the  top of every mast and to the chimney in order that the ship might  not be struck by lightning  they and the handmaid before  mentioned being in such ecstasies of fear that i scarcely knew  what to do with them i naturally bethought myself of some  restorative or comfortable cordial and nothing better occurring to  me at the moment than hot brandyandwater i procured a tumbler  full without delay  it being impossible to stand or sit without  holding on they were all heaped together in one corner of a long  sofa  a fixture extending entirely across the cabin  where they  clung to each other in momentary expectation of being drowned   when i approached this place with my specific and was about to  administer it with many consolatory expressions to the nearest  sufferer what was my dismay to see them all roll slowly down to  the other end  and when i staggered to that end and held out the  glass once more how immensely baffled were my good intentions by  the ship giving another lurch and their all rolling back again  i  suppose i dodged them up and down this sofa for at least a quarter  of an hour without reaching them once and by the time i did catch  them the brandyandwater was diminished by constant spilling to  a teaspoonful  to complete the group it is necessary to recognise  in this disconcerted dodger an individual very pale from sea sickness who had shaved his beard and brushed his hair last at  liverpool  and whose only article of dress linen not included  were a pair of dreadnought trousers a blue jacket formerly  admired upon the thames at richmond no stockings and one slipper  of the outrageous antics performed by that ship next morning which  made bed a practical joke and getting up by any process short of  falling out an impossibility i say nothing  but anything like  the utter dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when i  literally tumbled up on deck at noon i never saw  ocean and sky  were all of one dull heavy uniform lead colour  there was no  extent of prospect even over the dreary waste that lay around us  for the sea ran high and the horizon encompassed us like a large  black hoop  viewed from the air or some tall bluff on shore it  would have been imposing and stupendous no doubt but seen from  the wet and rolling decks it only impressed one giddily and  painfully  in the gale of last night the lifeboat had been  crushed by one blow of the sea like a walnutshell and there it  hung dangling in the air  a mere faggot of crazy boards  the  planking of the paddleboxes had been torn sheer away  the wheels  were exposed and bare and they whirled and dashed their spray  about the decks at random  chimney white with crusted salt  topmasts struck stormsails set rigging all knotted tangled  wet and drooping  a gloomier picture it would be hard to look  upon  i was now comfortably established by courtesy in the ladies cabin  where besides ourselves there were only four other passengers   first the little scotch lady before mentioned on her way to join  her husband at new york who had settled there three years before   secondly and thirdly an honest young yorkshireman connected with  some american house domiciled in that same city and carrying  thither his beautiful young wife to whom he had been married but a  fortnight and who was the fairest specimen of a comely english  country girl i have ever seen  fourthly fifthly and lastly  another couple  newly married too if one might judge from the  endearments they frequently interchanged  of whom i know no more  than that they were rather a mysterious runaway kind of couple  that the lady had great personal attractions also and that the  gentleman carried more guns with him than robinson crusoe wore a  shootingcoat and had two great dogs on board  on further  consideration i remember that he tried hot roast pig and bottled  ale as a cure for seasickness and that he took these remedies  usually in bed day after day with astonishing perseverance  i  may add for the information of the curious that they decidedly  failed  the weather continuing obstinately and almost unprecedentedly bad  we usually straggled into this cabin more or less faint and  miserable about an hour before noon and lay down on the sofas to  recover during which interval the captain would look in to  communicate the state of the wind the moral certainty of its  changing tomorrow the weather is always going to improve to morrow at sea the vessels rate of sailing and so forth   observations there were none to tell us of for there was no sun to  take them by  but a description of one day will serve for all the  rest  here it is  the captain being gone we compose ourselves to read if the place  be light enough and if not we doze and talk alternately  at one  a bell rings and the stewardess comes down with a steaming dish of  baked potatoes and another of roasted apples and plates of pigs  face cold ham salt beef or perhaps a smoking mess of rare hot  collops  we fall to upon these dainties eat as much as we can we  have great appetites now and are as long as possible about it   if the fire will burn it will sometimes we are pretty cheerful   if it wont we all remark to each other that its very cold rub  our hands cover ourselves with coats and cloaks and lie down  again to doze talk and read provided as aforesaid until  dinnertime  at five another bell rings and the stewardess  reappears with another dish of potatoes  boiled this time  and  store of hot meat of various kinds  not forgetting the roast pig  to be taken medicinally  we sit down at table again rather more  cheerfully than before prolong the meal with a rather mouldy  dessert of apples grapes and oranges and drink our wine and  brandyandwater  the bottles and glasses are still upon the  table and the oranges and so forth are rolling about according to  their fancy and the ships way when the doctor comes down by  special nightly invitation to join our evening rubber   immediately on whose arrival we make a party at whist and as it is  a rough night and the cards will not lie on the cloth we put the  tricks in our pockets as we take them  at whist we remain with  exemplary gravity deducting a short time for tea and toast until  eleven oclock or thereabouts when the captain comes down again  in a souwester hat tied under his chin and a pilotcoat  making  the ground wet where he stands  by this time the cardplaying is  over and the bottles and glasses are again upon the table and  after an hours pleasant conversation about the ship the  passengers and things in general the captain who never goes to  bed and is never out of humour turns up his coat collar for the  deck again shakes hands all round and goes laughing out into the  weather as merrily as to a birthday party  as to daily news there is no dearth of that commodity  this  passenger is reported to have lost fourteen pounds at vingtetun  in the saloon yesterday and that passenger drinks his bottle of  champagne every day and how he does it being only a clerk  nobody knows  the head engineer has distinctly said that there  never was such times  meaning weather  and four good hands are  ill and have given in dead beat  several berths are full of  water and all the cabins are leaky  the ships cook secretly  swigging damaged whiskey has been found drunk and has been played  upon by the fireengine until quite sober  all the stewards have  fallen downstairs at various dinnertimes and go about with  plasters in various places  the baker is ill and so is the  pastrycook  a new man horribly indisposed has been required to  fill the place of the latter officer and has been propped and  jammed up with empty casks in a little house upon deck and  commanded to roll out piecrust which he protests being highly  bilious it is death to him to look at  news  a dozen murders on  shore would lack the interest of these slight incidents at sea  divided between our rubber and such topics as these we were  running as we thought into halifax harbour on the fifteenth  night with little wind and a bright moon  indeed we had made the  light at its outer entrance and put the pilot in charge  when  suddenly the ship struck upon a bank of mud  an immediate rush on  deck took place of course the sides were crowded in an instant  and for a few minutes we were in as lively a state of confusion as  the greatest lover of disorder would desire to see  the  passengers and guns and watercasks and other heavy matters  being all huddled together aft however to lighten her in the  head she was soon got off and after some driving on towards an  uncomfortable line of objects whose vicinity had been announced  very early in the disaster by a loud cry of breakers ahead and  much backing of paddles and heaving of the lead into a constantly  decreasing depth of water we dropped anchor in a strange  outlandishlooking nook which nobody on board could recognise  although there was land all about us and so close that we could  plainly see the waving branches of the trees  it was strange enough in the silence of midnight and the dead  stillness that seemed to be created by the sudden and unexpected  stoppage of the engine which had been clanking and blasting in our  ears incessantly for so many days to watch the look of blank  astonishment expressed in every face  beginning with the officers  tracing it through all the passengers and descending to the very  stokers and furnacemen who emerged from below one by one and  clustered together in a smoky group about the hatchway of the  engineroom comparing notes in whispers  after throwing up a few  rockets and firing signal guns in the hope of being hailed from the  land or at least of seeing a light  but without any other sight  or sound presenting itself  it was determined to send a boat on  shore  it was amusing to observe how very kind some of the  passengers were in volunteering to go ashore in this same boat   for the general good of course  not by any means because they  thought the ship in an unsafe position or contemplated the  possibility of her heeling over in case the tide were running out   nor was it less amusing to remark how desperately unpopular the  poor pilot became in one short minute  he had had his passage out  from liverpool and during the whole voyage had been quite a  notorious character as a teller of anecdotes and cracker of jokes   yet here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his  jests now flourishing their fists in his face loading him with  imprecations and defying him to his teeth as a villain  the boat soon shoved off with a lantern and sundry blue lights on  board and in less than an hour returned the officer in command  bringing with him a tolerably tall young tree which he had plucked  up by the roots to satisfy certain distrustful passengers whose  minds misgave them that they were to be imposed upon and  shipwrecked and who would on no other terms believe that he had  been ashore or had done anything but fraudulently row a little way  into the mist specially to deceive them and compass their deaths   our captain had foreseen from the first that we must be in a place  called the eastern passage and so we were  it was about the last  place in the world in which we had any business or reason to be  but a sudden fog and some error on the pilots part were the  cause  we were surrounded by banks and rocks and shoals of all  kinds but had happily drifted it seemed upon the only safe speck  that was to be found thereabouts  eased by this report and by the  assurance that the tide was past the ebb we turned in at three  oclock in the morning  i was dressing about halfpast nine next day when the noise above  hurried me on deck  when i had left it overnight it was dark  foggy and damp and there were bleak hills all round us  now we  were gliding down a smooth broad stream at the rate of eleven  miles an hour  our colours flying gaily our crew rigged out in  their smartest clothes our officers in uniform again the sun  shining as on a brilliant april day in england the land stretched  out on either side streaked with light patches of snow white  wooden houses people at their doors telegraphs working flags  hoisted wharfs appearing ships quays crowded with people  distant noises shouts men and boys running down steep places  towards the pier  all more bright and gay and fresh to our unused  eyes than words can paint them  we came to a wharf paved with  uplifted faces got alongside and were made fast after some  shouting and straining of cables darted a score of us along the  gangway almost as soon as it was thrust out to meet us and before  it had reached the ship  and leaped upon the firm glad earth  again  i suppose this halifax would have appeared an elysium though it  had been a curiosity of ugly dulness  but i carried away with me a  most pleasant impression of the town and its inhabitants and have  preserved it to this hour  nor was it without regret that i came  home without having found an opportunity of returning thither and  once more shaking hands with the friends i made that day  it happened to be the opening of the legislative council and  general assembly at which ceremonial the forms observed on the  commencement of a new session of parliament in england were so  closely copied and so gravely presented on a small scale that it  was like looking at westminster through the wrong end of a  telescope  the governor as her majestys representative  delivered what may be called the speech from the throne  he said  what he had to say manfully and well  the military band outside  the building struck up god save the queen with great vigour  before his excellency had quite finished the people shouted the  ins rubbed their hands the outs shook their heads the  government party said there never was such a good speech the  opposition declared there never was such a bad one the speaker and  members of the house of assembly withdrew from the bar to say a  great deal among themselves and do a little  and in short  everything went on and promised to go on just as it does at home  upon the like occasions  the town is built on the side of a hill the highest point being  commanded by a strong fortress not yet quite finished  several  streets of good breadth and appearance extend from its summit to  the waterside and are intersected by cross streets running  parallel with the river  the houses are chiefly of wood  the  market is abundantly supplied and provisions are exceedingly  cheap  the weather being unusually mild at that time for the  season of the year there was no sleighing  but there were plenty  of those vehicles in yards and byplaces and some of them from  the gorgeous quality of their decorations might have gone on  without alteration as triumphal cars in a melodrama at astleys   the day was uncommonly fine the air bracing and healthful the  whole aspect of the town cheerful thriving and industrious  we lay there seven hours to deliver and exchange the mails  at  length having collected all our bags and all our passengers  including two or three choice spirits who having indulged too  freely in oysters and champagne were found lying insensible on  their backs in unfrequented streets the engines were again put in  motion and we stood off for boston  encountering squally weather again in the bay of fundy we tumbled  and rolled about as usual all that night and all next day  on the  next afternoon that is to say on saturday the twentysecond of  january an american pilotboat came alongside and soon afterwards  the britannia steampacket from liverpool eighteen days out was  telegraphed at boston  the indescribable interest with which i strained my eyes as the  first patches of american soil peeped like molehills from the green  sea and followed them as they swelled by slow and almost  imperceptible degrees into a continuous line of coast can hardly  be exaggerated  a sharp keen wind blew dead against us a hard  frost prevailed on shore and the cold was most severe  yet the  air was so intensely clear and dry and bright that the  temperature was not only endurable but delicious  how i remained on deck staring about me until we came alongside  the dock and how though i had had as many eyes as argus i should  have had them all wide open and all employed on new objects  are  topics which i will not prolong this chapter to discuss  neither  will i more than hint at my foreignerlike mistake in supposing  that a party of most active persons who scrambled on board at the  peril of their lives as we approached the wharf were newsmen  answering to that industrious class at home whereas despite the  leathern wallets of news slung about the necks of some and the  broad sheets in the hands of all they were editors who boarded  ships in person as one gentleman in a worsted comforter informed  me because they liked the excitement of it  suffice it in this  place to say that one of these invaders with a ready courtesy for  which i thank him here most gratefully went on before to order  rooms at the hotel and that when i followed as i soon did i  found myself rolling through the long passages with an involuntary  imitation of the gait of mr t p cooke in a new nautical  melodrama  dinner if you please said i to the waiter  when said the waiter  as quick as possible said i  right away said the waiter  after a moments hesitation i answered no at hazard  not right away cried the waiter with an amount of surprise that  made me start  i looked at him doubtfully and returned no i would rather have  it in this private room  i like it very much  at this i really thought the waiter must have gone out of his  mind  as i believe he would have done but for the interposition  of another man who whispered in his ear directly  well and thats a fact said the waiter looking helplessly at  me  right away  i saw now that right away and directly were one and the same  thing  so i reversed my previous answer and sat down to dinner in  ten minutes afterwards and a capital dinner it was  the hotel a very excellent one is called the tremont house  it  has more galleries colonnades piazzas and passages than i can  remember or the reader would believe    chapter iii  boston    in all the public establishments of america the utmost courtesy  prevails  most of our departments are susceptible of considerable  improvement in this respect but the customhouse above all others  would do well to take example from the united states and render  itself somewhat less odious and offensive to foreigners  the  servile rapacity of the french officials is sufficiently  contemptible but there is a surly boorish incivility about our  men alike disgusting to all persons who fall into their hands and  discreditable to the nation that keeps such illconditioned curs  snarling about its gates  when i landed in america i could not help being strongly impressed  with the contrast their customhouse presented and the attention  politeness and good humour with which its officers discharged their  duty  as we did not land at boston in consequence of some detention at  the wharf until after dark i received my first impressions of the  city in walking down to the customhouse on the morning after our  arrival which was sunday  i am afraid to say by the way how  many offers of pews and seats in church for that morning were made  to us by formal note of invitation before we had half finished  our first dinner in america but if i may be allowed to make a  moderate guess without going into nicer calculation i should say  that at least as many sittings were proffered us as would have  accommodated a score or two of grownup families  the number of  creeds and forms of religion to which the pleasure of our company  was requested was in very fair proportion  not being able in the absence of any change of clothes to go to  church that day we were compelled to decline these kindnesses one  and all and i was reluctantly obliged to forego the delight of  hearing dr channing who happened to preach that morning for the  first time in a very long interval  i mention the name of this  distinguished and accomplished man with whom i soon afterwards had  the pleasure of becoming personally acquainted that i may have  the gratification of recording my humble tribute of admiration and  respect for his high abilities and character and for the bold  philanthropy with which he has ever opposed himself to that most  hideous blot and foul disgrace  slavery  to return to boston  when i got into the streets upon this sunday  morning the air was so clear the houses were so bright and gay   the signboards were painted in such gaudy colours the gilded  letters were so very golden the bricks were so very red the stone  was so very white the blinds and area railings were so very green  the knobs and plates upon the street doors so marvellously bright  and twinkling and all so slight and unsubstantial in appearance   that every thoroughfare in the city looked exactly like a scene in  a pantomime  it rarely happens in the business streets that a  tradesman if i may venture to call anybody a tradesman where  everybody is a merchant resides above his store so that many  occupations are often carried on in one house and the whole front  is covered with boards and inscriptions  as i walked along i kept  glancing up at these boards confidently expecting to see a few of  them change into something and i never turned a corner suddenly  without looking out for the clown and pantaloon who i had no  doubt were hiding in a doorway or behind some pillar close at  hand  as to harlequin and columbine i discovered immediately that  they lodged they are always looking after lodgings in a pantomime  at a very small clockmakers one story high near the hotel which  in addition to various symbols and devices almost covering the  whole front had a great dial hanging out  to be jumped through  of course  the suburbs are if possible even more unsubstantiallooking than  the city  the white wooden houses so white that it makes one wink  to look at them with their green jalousie blinds are so  sprinkled and dropped about in all directions without seeming to  have any root at all in the ground and the small churches and  chapels are so prim and bright and highly varnished that i  almost believed the whole affair could be taken up piecemeal like a  childs toy and crammed into a little box  the city is a beautiful one and cannot fail i should imagine to  impress all strangers very favourably  the private dwellinghouses  are for the most part large and elegant the shops extremely  good and the public buildings handsome  the state house is built  upon the summit of a hill which rises gradually at first and  afterwards by a steep ascent almost from the waters edge  in  front is a green enclosure called the common  the site is  beautiful  and from the top there is a charming panoramic view of  the whole town and neighbourhood  in addition to a variety of  commodious offices it contains two handsome chambers in one the  house of representatives of the state hold their meetings  in the  other the senate  such proceedings as i saw here were conducted  with perfect gravity and decorum and were certainly calculated to  inspire attention and respect  there is no doubt that much of the intellectual refinement and  superiority of boston is referable to the quiet influence of the  university of cambridge which is within three or four miles of the  city  the resident professors at that university are gentlemen of  learning and varied attainments and are without one exception  that i can call to mind men who would shed a grace upon and do  honour to any society in the civilised world  many of the  resident gentry in boston and its neighbourhood and i think i am  not mistaken in adding a large majority of those who are attached  to the liberal professions there have been educated at this same  school  whatever the defects of american universities may be they  disseminate no prejudices rear no bigots dig up the buried ashes  of no old superstitions never interpose between the people and  their improvement exclude no man because of his religious  opinions above all in their whole course of study and  instruction recognise a world and a broad one too lying beyond  the college walls  it was a source of inexpressible pleasure to me to observe the  almost imperceptible but not less certain effect wrought by this  institution among the small community of boston and to note at  every turn the humanising tastes and desires it has engendered the  affectionate friendships to which it has given rise the amount of  vanity and prejudice it has dispelled  the golden calf they  worship at boston is a pigmy compared with the giant effigies set  up in other parts of that vast countinghouse which lies beyond the  atlantic and the almighty dollar sinks into something  comparatively insignificant amidst a whole pantheon of better  gods  above all i sincerely believe that the public institutions and  charities of this capital of massachusetts are as nearly perfect  as the most considerate wisdom benevolence and humanity can make  them  i never in my life was more affected by the contemplation of  happiness under circumstances of privation and bereavement than  in my visits to these establishments  it is a great and pleasant feature of all such institutions in  america that they are either supported by the state or assisted by  the state or in the event of their not needing its helping hand  that they act in concert with it and are emphatically the  peoples  i cannot but think with a view to the principle and its  tendency to elevate or depress the character of the industrious  classes that a public charity is immeasurably better than a  private foundation no matter how munificently the latter may be  endowed  in our own country where it has not until within these  later days been a very popular fashion with governments to display  any extraordinary regard for the great mass of the people or to  recognise their existence as improvable creatures private  charities unexampled in the history of the earth have arisen to  do an incalculable amount of good among the destitute and  afflicted  but the government of the country having neither act  nor part in them is not in the receipt of any portion of the  gratitude they inspire and offering very little shelter or relief  beyond that which is to be found in the workhouse and the jail has  come not unnaturally to be looked upon by the poor rather as a  stern master quick to correct and punish than a kind protector  merciful and vigilant in their hour of need  the maxim that out of evil cometh good is strongly illustrated by  these establishments at home as the records of the prerogative  office in doctors commons can abundantly prove  some immensely  rich old gentleman or lady surrounded by needy relatives makes  upon a low average a will aweek  the old gentleman or lady  never very remarkable in the best of times for good temper is full  of aches and pains from head to foot full of fancies and caprices  full of spleen distrust suspicion and dislike  to cancel old  wills and invent new ones is at last the sole business of such a  testators existence and relations and friends some of whom have  been bred up distinctly to inherit a large share of the property  and have been from their cradles specially disqualified from  devoting themselves to any useful pursuit on that account are so  often and so unexpectedly and summarily cut off and reinstated  and cut off again that the whole family down to the remotest  cousin is kept in a perpetual fever  at length it becomes plain  that the old lady or gentleman has not long to live and the  plainer this becomes the more clearly the old lady or gentleman  perceives that everybody is in a conspiracy against their poor old  dying relative wherefore the old lady or gentleman makes another  last will  positively the last this time  conceals the same in a  china teapot and expires next day  then it turns out that the  whole of the real and personal estate is divided between halfa dozen charities and that the dead and gone testator has in pure  spite helped to do a great deal of good at the cost of an immense  amount of evil passion and misery  the perkins institution and massachusetts asylum for the blind at  boston is superintended by a body of trustees who make an annual  report to the corporation  the indigent blind of that state are  admitted gratuitously  those from the adjoining state of  connecticut or from the states of maine vermont or new  hampshire are admitted by a warrant from the state to which they  respectively belong or failing that must find security among  their friends for the payment of about twenty pounds english for  their first years board and instruction and ten for the second   after the first year say the trustees an account current will  be opened with each pupil he will be charged with the actual cost  of his board which will not exceed two dollars per week a trifle  more than eight shillings english and he will be credited with  the amount paid for him by the state or by his friends also with  his earnings over and above the cost of the stock which he uses so  that all his earnings over one dollar per week will be his own  by  the third year it will be known whether his earnings will more than  pay the actual cost of his board if they should he will have it  at his option to remain and receive his earnings or not  those  who prove unable to earn their own livelihood will not be retained  as it is not desirable to convert the establishment into an alms house or to retain any but working bees in the hive  those who by  physical or mental imbecility are disqualified from work are  thereby disqualified from being members of an industrious  community and they can be better provided for in establishments  fitted for the infirm  i went to see this place one very fine winter morning  an italian  sky above and the air so clear and bright on every side that even  my eyes which are none of the best could follow the minute lines  and scraps of tracery in distant buildings  like most other public  institutions in america of the same class it stands a mile or two  without the town in a cheerful healthy spot and is an airy  spacious handsome edifice  it is built upon a height commanding  the harbour  when i paused for a moment at the door and marked  how fresh and free the whole scene was  what sparkling bubbles  glanced upon the waves and welled up every moment to the surface  as though the world below like that above were radiant with the  bright day and gushing over in its fulness of light  when i gazed  from sail to sail away upon a ship at sea a tiny speck of shining  white the only cloud upon the still deep distant blue  and  turning saw a blind boy with his sightless face addressed that  way as though he too had some sense within him of the glorious  distance  i felt a kind of sorrow that the place should be so very  light and a strange wish that for his sake it were darker  it was  but momentary of course and a mere fancy but i felt it keenly  for all that  the children were at their daily tasks in different rooms except a  few who were already dismissed and were at play  here as in many  institutions no uniform is worn and i was very glad of it for  two reasons  firstly because i am sure that nothing but senseless  custom and want of thought would reconcile us to the liveries and  badges we are so fond of at home  secondly because the absence of  these things presents each child to the visitor in his or her own  proper character with its individuality unimpaired not lost in a  dull ugly monotonous repetition of the same unmeaning garb   which is really an important consideration  the wisdom of  encouraging a little harmless pride in personal appearance even  among the blind or the whimsical absurdity of considering charity  and leather breeches inseparable companions as we do requires no  comment  good order cleanliness and comfort pervaded every corner of the  building  the various classes who were gathered round their  teachers answered the questions put to them with readiness and  intelligence and in a spirit of cheerful contest for precedence  which pleased me very much  those who were at play were gleesome  and noisy as other children  more spiritual and affectionate  friendships appeared to exist among them than would be found among  other young persons suffering under no deprivation but this i  expected and was prepared to find  it is a part of the great  scheme of heavens merciful consideration for the afflicted  in a portion of the building set apart for that purpose are work shops for blind persons whose education is finished and who have  acquired a trade but who cannot pursue it in an ordinary  manufactory because of their deprivation  several people were at  work here making brushes mattresses and so forth and the  cheerfulness industry and good order discernible in every other  part of the building extended to this department also  on the ringing of a bell the pupils all repaired without any  guide or leader to a spacious musichall where they took their  seats in an orchestra erected for that purpose and listened with  manifest delight to a voluntary on the organ played by one of  themselves  at its conclusion the performer a boy of nineteen or  twenty gave place to a girl and to her accompaniment they all  sang a hymn and afterwards a sort of chorus  it was very sad to  look upon and hear them happy though their condition  unquestionably was and i saw that one blind girl who being for  the time deprived of the use of her limbs by illness sat close  beside me with her face towards them wept silently the while she  listened  it is strange to watch the faces of the blind and see how free  they are from all concealment of what is passing in their thoughts  observing which a man with eyes may blush to contemplate the mask  he wears  allowing for one shade of anxious expression which is  never absent from their countenances and the like of which we may  readily detect in our own faces if we try to feel our way in the  dark every idea as it rises within them is expressed with the  lightnings speed and natures truth  if the company at a rout or  drawingroom at court could only for one time be as unconscious of  the eyes upon them as blind men and women are what secrets would  come out and what a worker of hypocrisy this sight the loss of  which we so much pity would appear to be  the thought occurred to me as i sat down in another room before a  girl blind deaf and dumb destitute of smell and nearly so of  taste  before a fair young creature with every human faculty and  hope and power of goodness and affection inclosed within her  delicate frame and but one outward sense  the sense of touch   there she was before me built up as it were in a marble cell  impervious to any ray of light or particle of sound with her poor  white hand peeping through a chink in the wall beckoning to some  good man for help that an immortal soul might be awakened  long before i looked upon her the help had come  her face was  radiant with intelligence and pleasure  her hair braided by her  own hands was bound about a head whose intellectual capacity and  development were beautifully expressed in its graceful outline and  its broad open brow her dress arranged by herself was a pattern  of neatness and simplicity the work she had knitted lay beside  her her writingbook was on the desk she leaned upon  from the  mournful ruin of such bereavement there had slowly risen up this  gentle tender guileless gratefulhearted being  like other inmates of that house she had a green ribbon bound  round her eyelids  a doll she had dressed lay near upon the  ground  i took it up and saw that she had made a green fillet  such as she wore herself and fastened it about its mimic eyes  she was seated in a little enclosure made by schooldesks and  forms writing her daily journal  but soon finishing this pursuit  she engaged in an animated conversation with a teacher who sat  beside her  this was a favourite mistress with the poor pupil  if  she could see the face of her fair instructress she would not love  her less i am sure  i have extracted a few disjointed fragments of her history from an  account written by that one man who has made her what she is  it  is a very beautiful and touching narrative and i wish i could  present it entire  her name is laura bridgman  she was born in hanover new  hampshire on the twentyfirst of december 1829  she is described  as having been a very sprightly and pretty infant with bright blue  eyes  she was however so puny and feeble until she was a year  and a half old that her parents hardly hoped to rear her  she was  subject to severe fits which seemed to rack her frame almost  beyond her power of endurance  and life was held by the feeblest  tenure  but when a year and a half old she seemed to rally the  dangerous symptoms subsided and at twenty months old she was  perfectly well  then her mental powers hitherto stinted in their growth rapidly  developed themselves and during the four months of health which  she enjoyed she appears making due allowance for a fond mothers  account to have displayed a considerable degree of intelligence  but suddenly she sickened again her disease raged with great  violence during five weeks when her eyes and ears were inflamed  suppurated and their contents were discharged  but though sight  and hearing were gone for ever the poor childs sufferings were  not ended  the fever raged during seven weeks for five months she  was kept in bed in a darkened room it was a year before she could  walk unsupported and two years before she could sit up all day   it was now observed that her sense of smell was almost entirely  destroyed and consequently that her taste was much blunted  it was not until four years of age that the poor childs bodily  health seemed restored and she was able to enter upon her  apprenticeship of life and the world  but what a situation was hers  the darkness and the silence of  the tomb were around her  no mothers smile called forth her  answering smile no fathers voice taught her to imitate his  sounds they brothers and sisters were but forms of matter which  resisted her touch but which differed not from the furniture of  the house save in warmth and in the power of locomotion and not  even in these respects from the dog and the cat  but the immortal spirit which had been implanted within her could  not die nor be maimed nor mutilated and though most of its  avenues of communication with the world were cut off it began to  manifest itself through the others  as soon as she could walk she  began to explore the room and then the house she became familiar  with the form density weight and heat of every article she  could lay her hands upon  she followed her mother and felt her  hands and arms as she was occupied about the house and her  disposition to imitate led her to repeat everything herself  she  even learned to sew a little and to knit  the reader will scarcely need to be told however that the  opportunities of communicating with her were very very limited  and that the moral effects of her wretched state soon began to  appear  those who cannot be enlightened by reason can only be  controlled by force and this coupled with her great privations  must soon have reduced her to a worse condition than that of the  beasts that perish but for timely and unhopedfor aid  at this time i was so fortunate as to hear of the child and  immediately hastened to hanover to see her  i found her with a  wellformed figure a stronglymarked nervoussanguine  temperament a large and beautifullyshaped head and the whole  system in healthy action  the parents were easily induced to  consent to her coming to boston and on the 4th of october 1837  they brought her to the institution  for a while she was much bewildered and after waiting about two  weeks until she became acquainted with her new locality and  somewhat familiar with the inmates the attempt was made to give  her knowledge of arbitrary signs by which she could interchange  thoughts with others  there was one of two ways to be adopted  either to go on to build  up a language of signs on the basis of the natural language which  she had already commenced herself or to teach her the purely  arbitrary language in common use  that is to give her a sign for  every individual thing or to give her a knowledge of letters by  combination of which she might express her idea of the existence  and the mode and condition of existence of any thing  the former  would have been easy but very ineffectual the latter seemed very  difficult but if accomplished very effectual  i determined  therefore to try the latter  the first experiments were made by taking articles in common use  such as knives forks spoons keys c and pasting upon them  labels with their names printed in raised letters  these she felt  very carefully and soon of course distinguished that the crooked  lines spoon differed as much from the crooked lines key as the  spoon differed from the key in form  then small detached labels with the same words printed upon them  were put into her hands and she soon observed that they were  similar to the ones pasted on the articles  she showed her  perception of this similarity by laying the label key upon the key  and the label spoon upon the spoon  she was encouraged here by the  natural sign of approbation patting on the head  the same process was then repeated with all the articles which she  could handle and she very easily learned to place the proper  labels upon them  it was evident however that the only  intellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory  she  recollected that the label book was placed upon a book and she  repeated the process first from imitation next from memory with  only the motive of love of approbation but apparently without the  intellectual perception of any relation between the things  after a while instead of labels the individual letters were  given to her on detached bits of paper  they were arranged side by  side so as to spell book key c then they were mixed up in a  heap and a sign was made for her to arrange them herself so as to  express the words book key c and she did so  hitherto the process had been mechanical and the success about  as great as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks  the  poor child had sat in mute amazement and patiently imitated  everything her teacher did but now the truth began to flash upon  her  her intellect began to work  she perceived that here was a  way by which she could herself make up a sign of anything that was  in her own mind and show it to another mind and at once her  countenance lighted up with a human expression  it was no longer a  dog or parrot  it was an immortal spirit eagerly seizing upon a  new link of union with other spirits  i could almost fix upon the  moment when this truth dawned upon her mind and spread its light  to her countenance i saw that the great obstacle was overcome and  that henceforward nothing but patient and persevering but plain  and straightforward efforts were to be used  the result thus far is quickly related and easily conceived but  not so was the process for many weeks of apparently unprofitable  labour were passed before it was effected  when it was said above that a sign was made it was intended to  say that the action was performed by her teacher she feeling his  hands and then imitating the motion  the next step was to procure a set of metal types with the  different letters of the alphabet cast upon their ends also a  board in which were square holes into which holes she could set  the types so that the letters on their ends could alone be felt  above the surface  then on any article being handed to her for instance a pencil  or a watch she would select the component letters and arrange  them on her board and read them with apparent pleasure  she was exercised for several weeks in this way until her  vocabulary became extensive and then the important step was taken  of teaching her how to represent the different letters by the  position of her fingers instead of the cumbrous apparatus of the  board and types  she accomplished this speedily and easily for  her intellect had begun to work in aid of her teacher and her  progress was rapid  this was the period about three months after she had commenced  that the first report of her case was made in which it was stated  that she has just learned the manual alphabet as used by the deaf  mutes and it is a subject of delight and wonder to see how  rapidly correctly and eagerly she goes on with her labours  her  teacher gives her a new object for instance a pencil first lets  her examine it and get an idea of its use then teaches her how to  spell it by making the signs for the letters with her own fingers   the child grasps her hand and feels her fingers as the different  letters are formed she turns her head a little on one side like a  person listening closely her lips are apart she seems scarcely to  breathe and her countenance at first anxious gradually changes  to a smile as she comprehends the lesson  she then holds up her  tiny fingers and spells the word in the manual alphabet next she  takes her types and arranges her letters and last to make sure  that she is right she takes the whole of the types composing the  word and places them upon or in contact with the pencil or  whatever the object may be  the whole of the succeeding year was passed in gratifying her  eager inquiries for the names of every object which she could  possibly handle in exercising her in the use of the manual  alphabet in extending in every possible way her knowledge of the  physical relations of things and in proper care of her health  at the end of the year a report of her case was made from which  the following is an extract  it has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt that she  cannot see a ray of light cannot hear the least sound and never  exercises her sense of smell if she have any  thus her mind  dwells in darkness and stillness as profound as that of a closed  tomb at midnight  of beautiful sights and sweet sounds and  pleasant odours she has no conception nevertheless she seems as  happy and playful as a bird or a lamb and the employment of her  intellectual faculties or the acquirement of a new idea gives her  a vivid pleasure which is plainly marked in her expressive  features  she never seems to repine but has all the buoyancy and  gaiety of childhood  she is fond of fun and frolic and when  playing with the rest of the children her shrill laugh sounds  loudest of the group  when left alone she seems very happy if she have her knitting or  sewing and will busy herself for hours if she have no occupation  she evidently amuses herself by imaginary dialogues or by  recalling past impressions she counts with her fingers or spells  out names of things which she has recently learned in the manual  alphabet of the deaf mutes  in this lonely selfcommunion she  seems to reason reflect and argue if she spell a word wrong with  the fingers of her right hand she instantly strikes it with her  left as her teacher does in sign of disapprobation if right  then she pats herself upon the head and looks pleased  she  sometimes purposely spells a word wrong with the left hand looks  roguish for a moment and laughs and then with the right hand  strikes the left as if to correct it  during the year she has attained great dexterity in the use of  the manual alphabet of the deaf mutes and she spells out the words  and sentences which she knows so fast and so deftly that only  those accustomed to this language can follow with the eye the rapid  motions of her fingers  but wonderful as is the rapidity with which she writes her  thoughts upon the air still more so is the ease and accuracy with  which she reads the words thus written by another grasping their  hands in hers and following every movement of their fingers as  letter after letter conveys their meaning to her mind  it is in  this way that she converses with her blind playmates and nothing  can more forcibly show the power of mind in forcing matter to its  purpose than a meeting between them  for if great talent and skill  are necessary for two pantomimes to paint their thoughts and  feelings by the movements of the body and the expression of the  countenance how much greater the difficulty when darkness shrouds  them both and the one can hear no sound  when laura is walking through a passageway with her hands  spread before her she knows instantly every one she meets and  passes them with a sign of recognition  but if it be a girl of her  own age and especially if it be one of her favourites there is  instantly a bright smile of recognition a twining of arms a  grasping of hands and a swift telegraphing upon the tiny fingers  whose rapid evolutions convey the thoughts and feelings from the  outposts of one mind to those of the other  there are questions  and answers exchanges of joy or sorrow there are kissings and  partings just as between little children with all their senses  during this year and six months after she had left home her  mother came to visit her and the scene of their meeting was an  interesting one  the mother stood some time gazing with overflowing eyes upon her  unfortunate child who all unconscious of her presence was  playing about the room  presently laura ran against her and at  once began feeling her hands examining her dress and trying to  find out if she knew her but not succeeding in this she turned  away as from a stranger and the poor woman could not conceal the  pang she felt at finding that her beloved child did not know her  she then gave laura a string of beads which she used to wear at  home which were recognised by the child at once who with much  joy put them around her neck and sought me eagerly to say she  understood the string was from her home  the mother now sought to caress her but poor laura repelled her  preferring to be with her acquaintances  another article from home was now given her and she began to look  much interested she examined the stranger much closer and gave me  to understand that she knew she came from hanover she even endured  her caresses but would leave her with indifference at the  slightest signal  the distress of the mother was now painful to  behold for although she had feared that she should not be  recognised the painful reality of being treated with cold  indifference by a darling child was too much for womans nature to  bear  after a while on the mother taking hold of her again a vague  idea seemed to flit across lauras mind that this could not be a  stranger she therefore felt her hands very eagerly while her  countenance assumed an expression of intense interest she became  very pale and then suddenly red hope seemed struggling with doubt  and anxiety and never were contending emotions more strongly  painted upon the human face  at this moment of painful  uncertainty the mother drew her close to her side and kissed her  fondly when at once the truth flashed upon the child and all  mistrust and anxiety disappeared from her face as with an  expression of exceeding joy she eagerly nestled to the bosom of her  parent and yielded herself to her fond embraces  after this the beads were all unheeded the playthings which were  offered to her were utterly disregarded her playmates for whom  but a moment before she gladly left the stranger now vainly strove  to pull her from her mother and though she yielded her usual  instantaneous obedience to my signal to follow me it was evidently  with painful reluctance  she clung close to me as if bewildered  and fearful and when after a moment i took her to her mother  she sprang to her arms and clung to her with eager joy  the subsequent parting between them showed alike the affection  the intelligence and the resolution of the child  laura accompanied her mother to the door clinging close to her  all the way until they arrived at the threshold where she paused  and felt around to ascertain who was near her  perceiving the  matron of whom she is very fond she grasped her with one hand  holding on convulsively to her mother with the other and thus she  stood for a moment  then she dropped her mothers hand put her  handkerchief to her eyes and turning round clung sobbing to the  matron while her mother departed with emotions as deep as those  of her child         it has been remarked in former reports that she can distinguish  different degrees of intellect in others and that she soon  regarded almost with contempt a newcomer when after a few  days she discovered her weakness of mind  this unamiable part of  her character has been more strongly developed during the past  year  she chooses for her friends and companions those children who are  intelligent and can talk best with her and she evidently dislikes  to be with those who are deficient in intellect unless indeed  she can make them serve her purposes which she is evidently  inclined to do  she takes advantage of them and makes them wait  upon her in a manner that she knows she could not exact of others  and in various ways shows her saxon blood  she is fond of having other children noticed and caressed by the  teachers and those whom she respects but this must not be carried  too far or she becomes jealous  she wants to have her share  which if not the lions is the greater part and if she does not  get it she says my mother will love me  her tendency to imitation is so strong that it leads her to  actions which must be entirely incomprehensible to her and which  can give her no other pleasure than the gratification of an  internal faculty  she has been known to sit for half an hour  holding a book before her sightless eyes and moving her lips as  she has observed seeing people do when reading  she one day pretended that her doll was sick and went through all  the motions of tending it and giving it medicine she then put it  carefully to bed and placed a bottle of hot water to its feet  laughing all the time most heartily  when i came home she  insisted upon my going to see it and feel its pulse and when i  told her to put a blister on its back she seemed to enjoy it  amazingly and almost screamed with delight  her social feelings and her affections are very strong and when  she is sitting at work or at her studies by the side of one of  her little friends she will break off from her task every few  moments to hug and kiss them with an earnestness and warmth that  is touching to behold  when left alone she occupies and apparently amuses herself and  seems quite contented and so strong seems to be the natural  tendency of thought to put on the garb of language that she often  soliloquizes in the finger language slow and tedious as it is   but it is only when alone that she is quiet  for if she becomes  sensible of the presence of any one near her she is restless until  she can sit close beside them hold their hand and converse with  them by signs  in her intellectual character it is pleasing to observe an  insatiable thirst for knowledge and a quick perception of the  relations of things  in her moral character it is beautiful to  behold her continual gladness her keen enjoyment of existence her  expansive love her unhesitating confidence her sympathy with  suffering her conscientiousness truthfulness and hopefulness  such are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and  instructive history of laura bridgman  the name of her great  benefactor and friend who writes it is dr howe  there are not  many persons i hope and believe who after reading these  passages can ever hear that name with indifference  a further account has been published by dr howe since the report  from which i have just quoted  it describes her rapid mental  growth and improvement during twelve months more and brings her  little history down to the end of last year  it is very  remarkable that as we dream in words and carry on imaginary  conversations in which we speak both for ourselves and for the  shadows who appear to us in those visions of the night so she  having no words uses her finger alphabet in her sleep  and it has  been ascertained that when her slumber is broken and is much  disturbed by dreams she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and  confused manner on her fingers  just as we should murmur and  mutter them indistinctly in the like circumstances  i turned over the leaves of her diary and found it written in a  fair legible square hand and expressed in terms which were quite  intelligible without any explanation  on my saying that i should  like to see her write again the teacher who sat beside her bade  her in their language sign her name upon a slip of paper twice  or thrice  in doing so i observed that she kept her left hand  always touching and following up her right in which of course  she held the pen  no line was indicated by any contrivance but  she wrote straight and freely  she had until now been quite unconscious of the presence of  visitors but having her hand placed in that of the gentleman who  accompanied me she immediately expressed his name upon her  teachers palm  indeed her sense of touch is now so exquisite  that having been acquainted with a person once she can recognise  him or her after almost any interval  this gentleman had been in  her company i believe but very seldom and certainly had not seen  her for many months  my hand she rejected at once as she does  that of any man who is a stranger to her  but she retained my  wifes with evident pleasure kissed her and examined her dress with  a girls curiosity and interest  she was merry and cheerful and showed much innocent playfulness in  her intercourse with her teacher  her delight on recognising a  favourite playfellow and companion  herself a blind girl  who  silently and with an equal enjoyment of the coming surprise took  a seat beside her was beautiful to witness  it elicited from her  at first as other slight circumstances did twice or thrice during  my visit an uncouth noise which was rather painful to hear  but  of her teacher touching her lips she immediately desisted and  embraced her laughingly and affectionately  i had previously been into another chamber where a number of blind  boys were swinging and climbing and engaged in various sports   they all clamoured as we entered to the assistantmaster who  accompanied us look at me mr hart  please mr hart look at  me evincing i thought even in this an anxiety peculiar to  their condition that their little feats of agility should be seen   among them was a small laughing fellow who stood aloof  entertaining himself with a gymnastic exercise for bringing the  arms and chest into play which he enjoyed mightily especially  when in thrusting out his right arm he brought it into contact  with another boy  like laura bridgman this young child was deaf  and dumb and blind  dr howes account of this pupils first instruction is so very  striking and so intimately connected with laura herself that i  cannot refrain from a short extract  i may premise that the poor  boys name is oliver caswell that he is thirteen years of age and  that he was in full possession of all his faculties until three  years and four months old  he was then attacked by scarlet fever  in four weeks became deaf in a few weeks more blind in six  months dumb  he showed his anxious sense of this last  deprivation by often feeling the lips of other persons when they  were talking and then putting his hand upon his own as if to  assure himself that he had them in the right position  his thirst for knowledge says dr howe proclaimed itself as  soon as he entered the house by his eager examination of  everything he could feel or smell in his new location  for  instance treading upon the register of a furnace he instantly  stooped down and began to feel it and soon discovered the way in  which the upper plate moved upon the lower one but this was not  enough for him so lying down upon his face he applied his tongue  first to one then to the other and seemed to discover that they  were of different kinds of metal  his signs were expressive  and the strictly natural language  laughing crying sighing kissing embracing c was perfect  some of the analogical signs which guided by his faculty of  imitation he had contrived were comprehensible such as the  waving motion of his hand for the motion of a boat the circular  one for a wheel c  the first object was to break up the use of these signs and to  substitute for them the use of purely arbitrary ones  profiting by the experience i had gained in the other cases i  omitted several steps of the process before employed and commenced  at once with the finger language  taking therefore several  articles having short names such as key cup mug c and with  laura for an auxiliary i sat down and taking his hand placed it  upon one of them and then with my own made the letters key  he  felt my hands eagerly with both of his and on my repeating the  process he evidently tried to imitate the motions of my fingers   in a few minutes he contrived to feel the motions of my fingers  with one hand and holding out the other he tried to imitate them  laughing most heartily when he succeeded  laura was by interested  even to agitation and the two presented a singular sight  her  face was flushed and anxious and her fingers twining in among ours  so closely as to follow every motion but so slightly as not to  embarrass them while oliver stood attentive his head a little  aside his face turned up his left hand grasping mine and his  right held out  at every motion of my fingers his countenance  betokened keen attention there was an expression of anxiety as he  tried to imitate the motions then a smile came stealing out as he  thought he could do so and spread into a joyous laugh the moment  he succeeded and felt me pat his head and laura clap him heartily  upon the back and jump up and down in her joy  he learned more than a halfdozen letters in half an hour and  seemed delighted with his success at least in gaining approbation   his attention then began to flag and i commenced playing with him   it was evident that in all this he had merely been imitating the  motions of my fingers and placing his hand upon the key cup c  as part of the process without any perception of the relation  between the sign and the object  when he was tired with play i took him back to the table and he  was quite ready to begin again his process of imitation  he soon  learned to make the letters for key pen pin and by having the  object repeatedly placed in his hand he at last perceived the  relation i wished to establish between them  this was evident  because when i made the letters pin or pen or cup he would  select the article  the perception of this relation was not accompanied by that  radiant flash of intelligence and that glow of joy which marked  the delightful moment when laura first perceived it  i then placed  all the articles on the table and going away a little distance  with the children placed olivers fingers in the positions to  spell key on which laura went and brought the article  the little  fellow seemed much amused by this and looked very attentive and  smiling  i then caused him to make the letters bread and in an  instant laura went and brought him a piece  he smelled at it put  it to his lips cocked up his head with a most knowing look seemed  to reflect a moment and then laughed outright as much as to say  aha  i understand now how something may be made out of this  it was now clear that he had the capacity and inclination to  learn that he was a proper subject for instruction and needed  only persevering attention  i therefore put him in the hands of an  intelligent teacher nothing doubting of his rapid progress  well may this gentleman call that a delightful moment in which  some distant promise of her present state first gleamed upon the  darkened mind of laura bridgman  throughout his life the  recollection of that moment will be to him a source of pure  unfading happiness nor will it shine less brightly on the evening  of his days of noble usefulness  the affection which exists between these two  the master and the  pupil  is as far removed from all ordinary care and regard as the  circumstances in which it has had its growth are apart from the  common occurrences of life  he is occupied now in devising means  of imparting to her higher knowledge and of conveying to her some  adequate idea of the great creator of that universe in which dark  and silent and scentless though it be to her she has such deep  delight and glad enjoyment  ye who have eyes and see not and have ears and hear not ye who  are as the hypocrites of sad countenances and disfigure your faces  that ye may seem unto men to fast learn healthy cheerfulness and  mild contentment from the deaf and dumb and blind  selfelected  saints with gloomy brows this sightless earless voiceless child  may teach you lessons you will do well to follow  let that poor  hand of hers lie gently on your hearts for there may be something  in its healing touch akin to that of the great master whose  precepts you misconstrue whose lessons you pervert of whose  charity and sympathy with all the world not one among you in his  daily practice knows as much as many of the worst among those  fallen sinners to whom you are liberal in nothing but the  preachment of perdition  as i rose to quit the room a pretty little child of one of the  attendants came running in to greet its father  for the moment a  child with eyes among the sightless crowd impressed me almost as  painfully as the blind boy in the porch had done two hours ago   ah how much brighter and more deeply blue glowing and rich though  it had been before was the scene without contrasting with the  darkness of so many youthful lives within         at south boston as it is called in a situation excellently  adapted for the purpose several charitable institutions are  clustered together  one of these is the state hospital for the  insane admirably conducted on those enlightened principles of  conciliation and kindness which twenty years ago would have been  worse than heretical and which have been acted upon with so much  success in our own pauper asylum at hanwell  evince a desire to  show some confidence and repose some trust even in mad people  said the resident physician as we walked along the galleries his  patients flocking round us unrestrained  of those who deny or  doubt the wisdom of this maxim after witnessing its effects if  there be such people still alive i can only say that i hope i may  never be summoned as a juryman on a commission of lunacy whereof  they are the subjects for i should certainly find them out of  their senses on such evidence alone  each ward in this institution is shaped like a long gallery or  hall with the dormitories of the patients opening from it on  either hand  here they work read play at skittles and other  games and when the weather does not admit of their taking exercise  out of doors pass the day together  in one of these rooms  seated calmly and quite as a matter of course among a throng of  madwomen black and white were the physicians wife and another  lady with a couple of children  these ladies were graceful and  handsome and it was not difficult to perceive at a glance that  even their presence there had a highly beneficial influence on the  patients who were grouped about them  leaning her head against the chimneypiece with a great assumption  of dignity and refinement of manner sat an elderly female in as  many scraps of finery as madge wildfire herself  her head in  particular was so strewn with scraps of gauze and cotton and bits  of paper and had so many queer odds and ends stuck all about it  that it looked like a birdsnest  she was radiant with imaginary  jewels wore a rich pair of undoubted gold spectacles and  gracefully dropped upon her lap as we approached a very old  greasy newspaper in which i dare say she had been reading an  account of her own presentation at some foreign court  i have been thus particular in describing her because she will  serve to exemplify the physicians manner of acquiring and  retaining the confidence of his patients  this he said aloud taking me by the hand and advancing to the  fantastic figure with great politeness  not raising her suspicions  by the slightest look or whisper or any kind of aside to me   this lady is the hostess of this mansion sir  it belongs to her   nobody else has anything whatever to do with it  it is a large  establishment as you see and requires a great number of  attendants  she lives you observe in the very first style  she  is kind enough to receive my visits and to permit my wife and  family to reside here for which it is hardly necessary to say we  are much indebted to her  she is exceedingly courteous you  perceive on this hint she bowed condescendingly and will permit  me to have the pleasure of introducing you  a gentleman from  england maam  newly arrived from england after a very  tempestuous passage  mr dickens  the lady of the house  we exchanged the most dignified salutations with profound gravity  and respect and so went on  the rest of the madwomen seemed to  understand the joke perfectly not only in this case but in all  the others except their own and be highly amused by it  the  nature of their several kinds of insanity was made known to me in  the same way and we left each of them in high good humour  not  only is a thorough confidence established by those means between  the physician and patient in respect of the nature and extent of  their hallucinations but it is easy to understand that  opportunities are afforded for seizing any moment of reason to  startle them by placing their own delusion before them in its most  incongruous and ridiculous light  every patient in this asylum sits down to dinner every day with a  knife and fork and in the midst of them sits the gentleman whose  manner of dealing with his charges i have just described  at  every meal moral influence alone restrains the more violent among  them from cutting the throats of the rest but the effect of that  influence is reduced to an absolute certainty and is found even  as a means of restraint to say nothing of it as a means of cure a  hundred times more efficacious than all the straitwaistcoats  fetters and handcuffs that ignorance prejudice and cruelty have  manufactured since the creation of the world  in the labour department every patient is as freely trusted with  the tools of his trade as if he were a sane man  in the garden  and on the farm they work with spades rakes and hoes  for  amusement they walk run fish paint read and ride out to take  the air in carriages provided for the purpose  they have among  themselves a sewing society to make clothes for the poor which  holds meetings passes resolutions never comes to fistycuffs or  bowieknives as sane assemblies have been known to do elsewhere  and conducts all its proceedings with the greatest decorum  the  irritability which would otherwise be expended on their own flesh  clothes and furniture is dissipated in these pursuits  they are  cheerful tranquil and healthy  once a week they have a ball in which the doctor and his family  with all the nurses and attendants take an active part  dances  and marches are performed alternately to the enlivening strains of  a piano and now and then some gentleman or lady whose proficiency  has been previously ascertained obliges the company with a song   nor does it ever degenerate at a tender crisis into a screech or  howl wherein i must confess i should have thought the danger  lay  at an early hour they all meet together for these festive  purposes at eight oclock refreshments are served and at nine  they separate  immense politeness and good breeding are observed throughout  they  all take their tone from the doctor and he moves a very  chesterfield among the company  like other assemblies these  entertainments afford a fruitful topic of conversation among the  ladies for some days and the gentlemen are so anxious to shine on  these occasions that they have been sometimes found practising  their steps in private to cut a more distinguished figure in the  dance  it is obvious that one great feature of this system is the  inculcation and encouragement even among such unhappy persons of  a decent selfrespect  something of the same spirit pervades all  the institutions at south boston  there is the house of industry  in that branch of it which is  devoted to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers  these words are painted on the walls  worthy of notice  self government quietude and peace are blessings  it is not assumed  and taken for granted that being there they must be evildisposed  and wicked people before whose vicious eyes it is necessary to  flourish threats and harsh restraints  they are met at the very  threshold with this mild appeal  all withindoors is very plain  and simple as it ought to be but arranged with a view to peace  and comfort  it costs no more than any other plan of arrangement  but it speaks an amount of consideration for those who are reduced  to seek a shelter there which puts them at once upon their  gratitude and good behaviour  instead of being parcelled out in  great long rambling wards where a certain amount of weazen life  may mope and pine and shiver all day long the building is  divided into separate rooms each with its share of light and air   in these the better kind of paupers live  they have a motive for  exertion and becoming pride in the desire to make these little  chambers comfortable and decent  i do not remember one but it was clean and neat and had its plant  or two upon the windowsill or row of crockery upon the shelf or  small display of coloured prints upon the whitewashed wall or  perhaps its wooden clock behind the door  the orphans and young children are in an adjoining building  separate from this but a part of the same institution  some are  such little creatures that the stairs are of lilliputian  measurement fitted to their tiny strides  the same consideration  for their years and weakness is expressed in their very seats  which are perfect curiosities and look like articles of furniture  for a pauper dollshouse  i can imagine the glee of our poor law  commissioners at the notion of these seats having arms and backs  but small spines being of older date than their occupation of the  boardroom at somerset house i thought even this provision very  merciful and kind  here again i was greatly pleased with the inscriptions on the  wall which were scraps of plain morality easily remembered and  understood  such as love one another  god remembers the  smallest creature in his creation and straightforward advice of  that nature  the books and tasks of these smallest of scholars  were adapted in the same judicious manner to their childish  powers  when we had examined these lessons four morsels of girls  of whom one was blind sang a little song about the merry month  of may which i thought being extremely dismal would have suited  an english november better  that done we went to see their  sleepingrooms on the floor above in which the arrangements were  no less excellent and gentle than those we had seen below  and  after observing that the teachers were of a class and character  well suited to the spirit of the place i took leave of the infants  with a lighter heart than ever i have taken leave of pauper infants  yet  connected with the house of industry there is also an hospital  which was in the best order and had i am glad to say many beds  unoccupied  it had one fault however which is common to all  american interiors  the presence of the eternal accursed  suffocating redhot demon of a stove whose breath would blight  the purest air under heaven  there are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood   one is called the boylston school and is an asylum for neglected  and indigent boys who have committed no crime but who in the  ordinary course of things would very soon be purged of that  distinction if they were not taken from the hungry streets and sent  here  the other is a house of reformation for juvenile offenders   they are both under the same roof but the two classes of boys  never come in contact  the boylston boys as may be readily supposed have very much the  advantage of the others in point of personal appearance  they were  in their schoolroom when i came upon them and answered correctly  without book such questions as where was england how far was it  what was its population its capital city its form of government  and so forth  they sang a song too about a farmer sowing his  seed  with corresponding action at such parts as tis thus he  sows he turns him round he claps his hands which gave it  greater interest for them and accustomed them to act together in  an orderly manner  they appeared exceedingly welltaught and not  better taught than fed for a more chubbylooking fullwaistcoated  set of boys i never saw  the juvenile offenders had not such pleasant faces by a great deal  and in this establishment there were many boys of colour  i saw  them first at their work basketmaking and the manufacture of  palmleaf hats afterwards in their school where they sang a  chorus in praise of liberty  an odd and one would think rather  aggravating theme for prisoners  these boys are divided into four  classes each denoted by a numeral worn on a badge upon the arm   on the arrival of a newcomer he is put into the fourth or lowest  class and left by good behaviour to work his way up into the  first  the design and object of this institution is to reclaim the  youthful criminal by firm but kind and judicious treatment to make  his prison a place of purification and improvement not of  demoralisation and corruption to impress upon him that there is  but one path and that one sober industry which can ever lead him  to happiness to teach him how it may be trodden if his footsteps  have never yet been led that way and to lure him back to it if  they have strayed  in a word to snatch him from destruction and  restore him to society a penitent and useful member  the  importance of such an establishment in every point of view and  with reference to every consideration of humanity and social  policy requires no comment  one other establishment closes the catalogue  it is the house of  correction for the state in which silence is strictly maintained  but where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of  seeing each other and of working together  this is the improved  system of prison discipline which we have imported into england  and which has been in successful operation among us for some years  past  america as a new and not overpopulated country has in all her  prisons the one great advantage of being enabled to find useful  and profitable work for the inmates whereas with us the  prejudice against prison labour is naturally very strong and  almost insurmountable when honest men who have not offended  against the laws are frequently doomed to seek employment in vain   even in the united states the principle of bringing convict labour  and free labour into a competition which must obviously be to the  disadvantage of the latter has already found many opponents whose  number is not likely to diminish with access of years  for this very reason though our best prisons would seem at the  first glance to be better conducted than those of america  the  treadmill is conducted with little or no noise five hundred men  may pick oakum in the same room without a sound and both kinds of  labour admit of such keen and vigilant superintendence as will  render even a word of personal communication amongst the prisoners  almost impossible  on the other hand the noise of the loom the  forge the carpenters hammer or the stonemasons saw greatly  favour those opportunities of intercourse  hurried and brief no  doubt but opportunities still  which these several kinds of work  by rendering it necessary for men to be employed very near to each  other and often side by side without any barrier or partition  between them in their very nature present  a visitor too  requires to reason and reflect a little before the sight of a  number of men engaged in ordinary labour such as he is accustomed  to out of doors will impress him half as strongly as the  contemplation of the same persons in the same place and garb would  if they were occupied in some task marked and degraded everywhere  as belonging only to felons in jails  in an american state prison  or house of correction i found it difficult at first to persuade  myself that i was really in a jail  a place of ignominious  punishment and endurance  and to this hour i very much question  whether the humane boast that it is not like one has its root in  the true wisdom or philosophy of the matter  i hope i may not be misunderstood on this subject for it is one in  which i take a strong and deep interest  i incline as little to  the sickly feeling which makes every canting lie or maudlin speech  of a notorious criminal a subject of newspaper report and general  sympathy as i do to those good old customs of the good old times  which made england even so recently as in the reign of the third  king george in respect of her criminal code and her prison  regulations one of the most bloodyminded and barbarous countries  on the earth  if i thought it would do any good to the rising  generation i would cheerfully give my consent to the disinterment  of the bones of any genteel highwayman the more genteel the more  cheerfully and to their exposure piecemeal on any signpost  gate or gibbet that might be deemed a good elevation for the  purpose  my reason is as well convinced that these gentry were as  utterly worthless and debauched villains as it is that the laws  and jails hardened them in their evil courses or that their  wonderful escapes were effected by the prisonturnkeys who in  those admirable days had always been felons themselves and were  to the last their bosomfriends and potcompanions  at the same  time i know as all men do or should that the subject of prison  discipline is one of the highest importance to any community and  that in her sweeping reform and bright example to other countries  on this head america has shown great wisdom great benevolence  and exalted policy  in contrasting her system with that which we  have modelled upon it i merely seek to show that with all its  drawbacks ours has some advantages of its own  the house of correction which has led to these remarks is not  walled like other prisons but is palisaded round about with tall  rough stakes something after the manner of an enclosure for  keeping elephants in as we see it represented in eastern prints  and pictures  the prisoners wear a particoloured dress and those  who are sentenced to hard labour work at nailmaking or stone cutting  when i was there the latter class of labourers were  employed upon the stone for a new customhouse in course of  erection at boston  they appeared to shape it skilfully and with  expedition though there were very few among them if any who had  not acquired the art within the prison gates  the women all in one large room were employed in making light  clothing for new orleans and the southern states  they did their  work in silence like the men and like them were overlooked by the  person contracting for their labour or by some agent of his  appointment  in addition to this they are every moment liable to  be visited by the prison officers appointed for that purpose  the arrangements for cooking washing of clothes and so forth are  much upon the plan of those i have seen at home  their mode of  bestowing the prisoners at night which is of general adoption  differs from ours and is both simple and effective  in the centre  of a lofty area lighted by windows in the four walls are five  tiers of cells one above the other each tier having before it a  light iron gallery attainable by stairs of the same construction  and material  excepting the lower one which is on the ground   behind these back to back with them and facing the opposite wall  are five corresponding rows of cells accessible by similar means   so that supposing the prisoners locked up in their cells an  officer stationed on the ground with his back to the wall has  half their number under his eye at once the remaining half being  equally under the observation of another officer on the opposite  side and all in one great apartment  unless this watch be  corrupted or sleeping on his post it is impossible for a man to  escape for even in the event of his forcing the iron door of his  cell without noise which is exceedingly improbable the moment he  appears outside and steps into that one of the five galleries on  which it is situated he must be plainly and fully visible to the  officer below  each of these cells holds a small truckle bed in  which one prisoner sleeps never more  it is small of course and  the door being not solid but grated and without blind or curtain  the prisoner within is at all times exposed to the observation and  inspection of any guard who may pass along that tier at any hour or  minute of the night  every day the prisoners receive their  dinner singly through a trap in the kitchen wall and each man  carries his to his sleeping cell to eat it where he is locked up  alone for that purpose one hour  the whole of this arrangement  struck me as being admirable and i hope that the next new prison  we erect in england may be built on this plan  i was given to understand that in this prison no swords or fire arms or even cudgels are kept nor is it probable that so long  as its present excellent management continues any weapon  offensive or defensive will ever be required within its bounds  such are the institutions at south boston  in all of them the  unfortunate or degenerate citizens of the state are carefully  instructed in their duties both to god and man are surrounded by  all reasonable means of comfort and happiness that their condition  will admit of are appealed to as members of the great human  family however afflicted indigent or fallen are ruled by the  strong heart and not by the strong though immeasurably weaker  hand  i have described them at some length firstly because their  worth demanded it and secondly because i mean to take them for a  model and to content myself with saying of others we may come to  whose design and purpose are the same that in this or that respect  they practically fail or differ  i wish by this account of them imperfect in its execution but in  its just intention honest i could hope to convey to my readers  onehundredth part of the gratification the sights i have  described afforded me         to an englishman accustomed to the paraphernalia of westminster  hall an american court of law is as odd a sight as i suppose an  english court of law would be to an american  except in the  supreme court at washington where the judges wear a plain black  robe there is no such thing as a wig or gown connected with the  administration of justice  the gentlemen of the bar being  barristers and attorneys too for there is no division of those  functions as in england are no more removed from their clients  than attorneys in our court for the relief of insolvent debtors  are from theirs  the jury are quite at home and make themselves  as comfortable as circumstances will permit  the witness is so  little elevated above or put aloof from the crowd in the court  that a stranger entering during a pause in the proceedings would  find it difficult to pick him out from the rest  and if it chanced  to be a criminal trial his eyes in nine cases out of ten would  wander to the dock in search of the prisoner in vain for that  gentleman would most likely be lounging among the most  distinguished ornaments of the legal profession whispering  suggestions in his counsels ear or making a toothpick out of an  old quill with his penknife  i could not but notice these differences when i visited the courts  at boston  i was much surprised at first too to observe that the  counsel who interrogated the witness under examination at the time  did so sitting  but seeing that he was also occupied in writing  down the answers and remembering that he was alone and had no  junior i quickly consoled myself with the reflection that law  was not quite so expensive an article here as at home and that  the absence of sundry formalities which we regard as indispensable  had doubtless a very favourable influence upon the bill of costs  in every court ample and commodious provision is made for the  accommodation of the citizens  this is the case all through  america  in every public institution the right of the people to  attend and to have an interest in the proceedings is most fully  and distinctly recognised  there are no grim doorkeepers to dole  out their tardy civility by the sixpennyworth nor is there i  sincerely believe any insolence of office of any kind  nothing  national is exhibited for money and no public officer is a  showman  we have begun of late years to imitate this good example   i hope we shall continue to do so and that in the fulness of time  even deans and chapters may be converted  in the civil court an action was trying for damages sustained in  some accident upon a railway  the witnesses had been examined and  counsel was addressing the jury  the learned gentleman like a few  of his english brethren was desperately longwinded and had a  remarkable capacity of saying the same thing over and over again   his great theme was warren the engine driver whom he pressed  into the service of every sentence he uttered  i listened to him  for about a quarter of an hour and coming out of court at the  expiration of that time without the faintest ray of enlightenment  as to the merits of the case felt as if i were at home again  in the prisoners cell waiting to be examined by the magistrate on  a charge of theft was a boy  this lad instead of being committed  to a common jail would be sent to the asylum at south boston and  there taught a trade and in the course of time he would be bound  apprentice to some respectable master  thus his detection in this  offence instead of being the prelude to a life of infamy and a  miserable death would lead there was a reasonable hope to his  being reclaimed from vice and becoming a worthy member of society  i am by no means a wholesale admirer of our legal solemnities many  of which impress me as being exceedingly ludicrous  strange as it  may seem too there is undoubtedly a degree of protection in the  wig and gown  a dismissal of individual responsibility in dressing  for the part  which encourages that insolent bearing and language  and that gross perversion of the office of a pleader for the truth  so frequent in our courts of law  still i cannot help doubting  whether america in her desire to shake off the absurdities and  abuses of the old system may not have gone too far into the  opposite extreme and whether it is not desirable especially in  the small community of a city like this where each man knows the  other to surround the administration of justice with some  artificial barriers against the hail fellow well met deportment  of everyday life  all the aid it can have in the very high  character and ability of the bench not only here but elsewhere it  has and well deserves to have but it may need something more   not to impress the thoughtful and the wellinformed but the  ignorant and heedless a class which includes some prisoners and  many witnesses  these institutions were established no doubt  upon the principle that those who had so large a share in making  the laws would certainly respect them  but experience has proved  this hope to be fallacious for no men know better than the judges  of america that on the occasion of any great popular excitement  the law is powerless and cannot for the time assert its own  supremacy  the tone of society in boston is one of perfect politeness  courtesy and good breeding  the ladies are unquestionably very  beautiful  in face  but there i am compelled to stop  their  education is much as with us neither better nor worse  i had  heard some very marvellous stories in this respect but not  believing them was not disappointed  blue ladies there are in  boston but like philosophers of that colour and sex in most other  latitudes they rather desire to be thought superior than to be so   evangelical ladies there are likewise whose attachment to the  forms of religion and horror of theatrical entertainments are  most exemplary  ladies who have a passion for attending lectures  are to be found among all classes and all conditions  in the kind  of provincial life which prevails in cities such as this the  pulpit has great influence  the peculiar province of the pulpit in  new england always excepting the unitarian ministry would appear  to be the denouncement of all innocent and rational amusements   the church the chapel and the lectureroom are the only means of  excitement excepted and to the church the chapel and the  lectureroom the ladies resort in crowds  wherever religion is resorted to as a strong drink and as an  escape from the dull monotonous round of home those of its  ministers who pepper the highest will be the surest to please   they who strew the eternal path with the greatest amount of  brimstone and who most ruthlessly tread down the flowers and  leaves that grow by the wayside will be voted the most righteous  and they who enlarge with the greatest pertinacity on the  difficulty of getting into heaven will be considered by all true  believers certain of going there  though it would be hard to say  by what process of reasoning this conclusion is arrived at  it is  so at home and it is so abroad  with regard to the other means of  excitement the lecture it has at least the merit of being always  new  one lecture treads so quickly on the heels of another that  none are remembered and the course of this month may be safely  repeated next with its charm of novelty unbroken and its interest  unabated  the fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption  out of  the rottenness of these things there has sprung up in boston a  sect of philosophers known as transcendentalists  on inquiring  what this appellation might be supposed to signify i was given to  understand that whatever was unintelligible would be certainly  transcendental  not deriving much comfort from this elucidation i  pursued the inquiry still further and found that the  transcendentalists are followers of my friend mr carlyle or i  should rather say of a follower of his mr ralph waldo emerson   this gentleman has written a volume of essays in which among much  that is dreamy and fanciful if he will pardon me for saying so  there is much more that is true and manly honest and bold   transcendentalism has its occasional vagaries what school has  not but it has good healthful qualities in spite of them not  least among the number a hearty disgust of cant and an aptitude to  detect her in all the million varieties of her everlasting  wardrobe  and therefore if i were a bostonian i think i would be  a transcendentalist  the only preacher i heard in boston was mr taylor who addresses  himself peculiarly to seamen and who was once a mariner himself   i found his chapel down among the shipping in one of the narrow  old waterside streets with a gay blue flag waving freely from  its roof  in the gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little  choir of male and female singers a violoncello and a violin  the  preacher already sat in the pulpit which was raised on pillars  and ornamented behind him with painted drapery of a lively and  somewhat theatrical appearance  he looked a weatherbeaten hard featured man of about six or eight and fifty with deep lines  graven as it were into his face dark hair and a stern keen eye   yet the general character of his countenance was pleasant and  agreeable  the service commenced with a hymn to which succeeded  an extemporary prayer  it had the fault of frequent repetition  incidental to all such prayers but it was plain and comprehensive  in its doctrines and breathed a tone of general sympathy and  charity which is not so commonly a characteristic of this form of  address to the deity as it might be  that done he opened his  discourse taking for his text a passage from the song of solomon  laid upon the desk before the commencement of the service by some  unknown member of the congregation  who is this coming up from  the wilderness leaning on the arm of her beloved  he handled his text in all kinds of ways and twisted it into all  manner of shapes but always ingeniously and with a rude  eloquence well adapted to the comprehension of his hearers   indeed if i be not mistaken he studied their sympathies and  understandings much more than the display of his own powers  his  imagery was all drawn from the sea and from the incidents of a  seamans life and was often remarkably good  he spoke to them of  that glorious man lord nelson and of collingwood and drew  nothing in as the saying is by the head and shoulders but  brought it to bear upon his purpose naturally and with a sharp  mind to its effect  sometimes when much excited with his subject  he had an odd way  compounded of john bunyan and balfour of  burley  of taking his great quarto bible under his arm and pacing  up and down the pulpit with it looking steadily down meantime  into the midst of the congregation  thus when he applied his text  to the first assemblage of his hearers and pictured the wonder of  the church at their presumption in forming a congregation among  themselves he stopped short with his bible under his arm in the  manner i have described and pursued his discourse after this  manner  who are these  who are they  who are these fellows where do  they come from  where are they going to  come from  whats the  answer  leaning out of the pulpit and pointing downward with  his right hand  from below  starting back again and looking  at the sailors before him  from below my brethren  from under  the hatches of sin battened down above you by the evil one   thats where you came from  a walk up and down the pulpit  and  where are you going  stopping abruptly  where are you going   aloft  very softly and pointing upward  aloft  louder   aloft  louder still  thats where you are going  with a fair  wind  all taut and trim steering direct for heaven in its glory  where there are no storms or foul weather and where the wicked  cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  another walk   thats where youre going to my friends  thats it  thats the  place  thats the port  thats the haven  its a blessed harbour   still water there in all changes of the winds and tides no  driving ashore upon the rocks or slipping your cables and running  out to sea there  peace  peace  peace  all peace  another  walk and patting the bible under his left arm  what  these  fellows are coming from the wilderness are they  yes  from the  dreary blighted wilderness of iniquity whose only crop is death   but do they lean upon anything  do they lean upon nothing these  poor seamen  three raps upon the bible  oh yes  yes  they  lean upon the arm of their beloved  three more raps  upon the  arm of their beloved  three more and a walk  pilot guiding star and compass all in one to all hands  here it is  three  more  here it is  they can do their seamans duty manfully and  be easy in their minds in the utmost peril and danger with this   two more  they can come even these poor fellows can come from  the wilderness leaning on the arm of their beloved and go up  up   up  raising his hand higher and higher at every repetition  of the word so that he stood with it at last stretched above his  head regarding them in a strange rapt manner and pressing the  book triumphantly to his breast until he gradually subsided into  some other portion of his discourse  i have cited this rather as an instance of the preachers  eccentricities than his merits though taken in connection with his  look and manner and the character of his audience even this was  striking  it is possible however that my favourable impression  of him may have been greatly influenced and strengthened firstly  by his impressing upon his hearers that the true observance of  religion was not inconsistent with a cheerful deportment and an  exact discharge of the duties of their station which indeed it  scrupulously required of them and secondly by his cautioning them  not to set up any monopoly in paradise and its mercies  i never  heard these two points so wisely touched if indeed i have ever  heard them touched at all by any preacher of that kind before  having passed the time i spent in boston in making myself  acquainted with these things in settling the course i should take  in my future travels and in mixing constantly with its society i  am not aware that i have any occasion to prolong this chapter   such of its social customs as i have not mentioned however may be  told in a very few words  the usual dinnerhour is two oclock  a dinner party takes place  at five and at an evening party they seldom sup later than  eleven so that it goes hard but one gets home even from a rout  by midnight  i never could find out any difference between a party  at boston and a party in london saving that at the former place  all assemblies are held at more rational hours that the  conversation may possibly be a little louder and more cheerful and  a guest is usually expected to ascend to the very top of the house  to take his cloak off that he is certain to see at every dinner  an unusual amount of poultry on the table and at every supper at  least two mighty bowls of hot stewed oysters in any one of which a  halfgrown duke of clarence might be smothered easily  there are two theatres in boston of good size and construction  but sadly in want of patronage  the few ladies who resort to them  sit as of right in the front rows of the boxes  the bar is a large room with a stone floor and there people stand  and smoke and lounge about all the evening  dropping in and out  as the humour takes them  there too the stranger is initiated into  the mysteries of ginsling cocktail sangaree mint julep  sherrycobbler timber doodle and other rare drinks  the house is  full of boarders both married and single many of whom sleep upon  the premises and contract by the week for their board and lodging   the charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost   a public table is laid in a very handsome hall for breakfast and  for dinner and for supper  the party sitting down together to  these meals will vary in number from one to two hundred  sometimes  more  the advent of each of these epochs in the day is proclaimed  by an awful gong which shakes the very windowframes as it  reverberates through the house and horribly disturbs nervous  foreigners  there is an ordinary for ladies and an ordinary for  gentlemen  in our private room the cloth could not for any earthly  consideration have been laid for dinner without a huge glass dish  of cranberries in the middle of the table and breakfast would have  been no breakfast unless the principal dish were a deformed beef steak with a great flat bone in the centre swimming in hot butter  and sprinkled with the very blackest of all possible pepper  our  bedroom was spacious and airy but like every bedroom on this side  of the atlantic very bare of furniture having no curtains to the  french bedstead or to the window  it had one unusual luxury  however in the shape of a wardrobe of painted wood something  smaller than an english watchbox or if this comparison should be  insufficient to convey a just idea of its dimensions they may be  estimated from the fact of my having lived for fourteen days and  nights in the firm belief that it was a showerbath    chapter iv  an american railroad  lowell and its factory system    before leaving boston i devoted one day to an excursion to lowell   i assign a separate chapter to this visit not because i am about  to describe it at any great length but because i remember it as a  thing by itself and am desirous that my readers should do the  same  i made acquaintance with an american railroad on this occasion  for the first time  as these works are pretty much alike all  through the states their general characteristics are easily  described  there are no first and second class carriages as with us but there  is a gentlemans car and a ladies car  the main distinction  between which is that in the first everybody smokes and in the  second nobody does  as a black man never travels with a white  one there is also a negro car which is a great blundering  clumsy chest such as gulliver put to sea in from the kingdom of  brobdingnag  there is a great deal of jolting a great deal of  noise a great deal of wall not much window a locomotive engine  a shriek and a bell  the cars are like shabby omnibuses but larger  holding thirty  forty fifty people  the seats instead of stretching from end to  end are placed crosswise  each seat holds two persons  there is  a long row of them on each side of the caravan a narrow passage up  the middle and a door at both ends  in the centre of the carriage  there is usually a stove fed with charcoal or anthracite coal  which is for the most part redhot  it is insufferably close and  you see the hot air fluttering between yourself and any other  object you may happen to look at like the ghost of smoke  in the ladies car there are a great many gentlemen who have  ladies with them  there are also a great many ladies who have  nobody with them  for any lady may travel alone from one end of  the united states to the other and be certain of the most  courteous and considerate treatment everywhere  the conductor or  checktaker or guard or whatever he may be wears no uniform  he  walks up and down the car and in and out of it as his fancy  dictates leans against the door with his hands in his pockets and  stares at you if you chance to be a stranger or enters into  conversation with the passengers about him  a great many  newspapers are pulled out and a few of them are read  everybody  talks to you or to anybody else who hits his fancy  if you are an  englishman he expects that that railroad is pretty much like an  english railroad  if you say no he says yes  interrogatively and asks in what respect they differ  you  enumerate the heads of difference one by one and he says yes  still interrogatively to each  then he guesses that you dont  travel faster in england and on your replying that you do says  yes again still interrogatively and it is quite evident  dont believe it  after a long pause he remarks partly to you  and partly to the knob on the top of his stick that yankees are  reckoned to be considerable of a goahead people too upon which  you say yes and then he says yes again affirmatively this  time and upon your looking out of window tells you that behind  that hill and some three miles from the next station there is a  clever town in a smart location where he expects you have  concluded to stop  your answer in the negative naturally leads to  more questions in reference to your intended route always  pronounced rout and wherever you are going you invariably learn  that you cant get there without immense difficulty and danger and  that all the great sights are somewhere else  if a lady take a fancy to any male passengers seat the gentleman  who accompanies her gives him notice of the fact and he  immediately vacates it with great politeness  politics are much  discussed so are banks so is cotton  quiet people avoid the  question of the presidency for there will be a new election in  three years and a half and party feeling runs very high  the  great constitutional feature of this institution being that  directly the acrimony of the last election is over the acrimony of  the next one begins which is an unspeakable comfort to all strong  politicians and true lovers of their country  that is to say to  ninetynine men and boys out of every ninetynine and a quarter  except when a branch road joins the main one there is seldom more  than one track of rails so that the road is very narrow and the  view where there is a deep cutting by no means extensive  when  there is not the character of the scenery is always the same   mile after mile of stunted trees  some hewn down by the axe some  blown down by the wind some half fallen and resting on their  neighbours many mere logs half hidden in the swamp others  mouldered away to spongy chips  the very soil of the earth is made  up of minute fragments such as these each pool of stagnant water  has its crust of vegetable rottenness on every side there are the  boughs and trunks and stumps of trees in every possible stage of  decay decomposition and neglect  now you emerge for a few brief  minutes on an open country glittering with some bright lake or  pool broad as many an english river but so small here that it  scarcely has a name now catch hasty glimpses of a distant town  with its clean white houses and their cool piazzas its prim new  england church and schoolhouse when whirrrr almost before you  have seen them comes the same dark screen  the stunted trees the  stumps the logs the stagnant water  all so like the last that  you seem to have been transported back again by magic  the train calls at stations in the woods where the wild  impossibility of anybody having the smallest reason to get out is  only to be equalled by the apparently desperate hopelessness of  there being anybody to get in  it rushes across the turnpike road  where there is no gate no policeman no signal  nothing but a  rough wooden arch on which is painted when the bell rings look  out for the locomotive  on it whirls headlong dives through the  woods again emerges in the light clatters over frail arches  rumbles upon the heavy ground shoots beneath a wooden bridge which  intercepts the light for a second like a wink suddenly awakens all  the slumbering echoes in the main street of a large town and  dashes on haphazard pellmell neckornothing down the middle of  the road  there  with mechanics working at their trades and  people leaning from their doors and windows and boys flying kites  and playing marbles and men smoking and women talking and  children crawling and pigs burrowing and unaccustomed horses  plunging and rearing close to the very rails  there  on on on   tears the mad dragon of an engine with its train of cars  scattering in all directions a shower of burning sparks from its  wood fire screeching hissing yelling panting until at last the  thirsty monster stops beneath a covered way to drink the people  cluster round and you have time to breathe again  i was met at the station at lowell by a gentleman intimately  connected with the management of the factories there and gladly  putting myself under his guidance drove off at once to that  quarter of the town in which the works the object of my visit  were situated  although only just of age  for if my recollection  serve me it has been a manufacturing town barely oneandtwenty  years  lowell is a large populous thriving place  those  indications of its youth which first attract the eye give it a  quaintness and oddity of character which to a visitor from the old  country is amusing enough  it was a very dirty winters day and  nothing in the whole town looked old to me except the mud which  in some parts was almost kneedeep and might have been deposited  there on the subsiding of the waters after the deluge  in one  place there was a new wooden church which having no steeple and  being yet unpainted looked like an enormous packingcase without  any direction upon it  in another there was a large hotel whose  walls and colonnades were so crisp and thin and slight that it  had exactly the appearance of being built with cards  i was  careful not to draw my breath as we passed and trembled when i saw  a workman come out upon the roof lest with one thoughtless stamp  of his foot he should crush the structure beneath him and bring it  rattling down  the very river that moves the machinery in the  mills for they are all worked by water power seems to acquire a  new character from the fresh buildings of bright red brick and  painted wood among which it takes its course and to be as light headed thoughtless and brisk a young river in its murmurings and  tumblings as one would desire to see  one would swear that every  bakery grocery and bookbindery and other kind of store  took its shutters down for the first time and started in business  yesterday  the golden pestles and mortars fixed as signs upon the  sunblind frames outside the druggists appear to have been just  turned out of the united states mint and when i saw a baby of  some week or ten days old in a womans arms at a street corner i  found myself unconsciously wondering where it came from  never  supposing for an instant that it could have been born in such a  young town as that  there are several factories in lowell each of which belongs to  what we should term a company of proprietors but what they call in  america a corporation  i went over several of these such as a  woollen factory a carpet factory and a cotton factory  examined  them in every part and saw them in their ordinary working aspect  with no preparation of any kind or departure from their ordinary  everyday proceedings  i may add that i am well acquainted with our  manufacturing towns in england and have visited many mills in  manchester and elsewhere in the same manner  i happened to arrive at the first factory just as the dinner hour  was over and the girls were returning to their work indeed the  stairs of the mill were thronged with them as i ascended  they  were all well dressed but not to my thinking above their  condition for i like to see the humbler classes of society careful  of their dress and appearance and even if they please decorated  with such little trinkets as come within the compass of their  means  supposing it confined within reasonable limits i would  always encourage this kind of pride as a worthy element of self respect in any person i employed and should no more be deterred  from doing so because some wretched female referred her fall to a  love of dress than i would allow my construction of the real  intent and meaning of the sabbath to be influenced by any warning  to the welldisposed founded on his backslidings on that  particular day which might emanate from the rather doubtful  authority of a murderer in newgate  these girls as i have said were all well dressed  and that  phrase necessarily includes extreme cleanliness  they had  serviceable bonnets good warm cloaks and shawls and were not  above clogs and pattens  moreover there were places in the mill  in which they could deposit these things without injury and there  were conveniences for washing  they were healthy in appearance  many of them remarkably so and had the manners and deportment of  young women  not of degraded brutes of burden  if i had seen in  one of those mills but i did not though i looked for something of  this kind with a sharp eye the most lisping mincing affected  and ridiculous young creature that my imagination could suggest i  should have thought of the careless moping slatternly degraded  dull reverse i have seen that and should have been still well  pleased to look upon her  the rooms in which they worked were as well ordered as themselves   in the windows of some there were green plants which were trained  to shade the glass in all there was as much fresh air  cleanliness and comfort as the nature of the occupation would  possibly admit of  out of so large a number of females many of  whom were only then just verging upon womanhood it may be  reasonably supposed that some were delicate and fragile in  appearance  no doubt there were  but i solemnly declare that  from all the crowd i saw in the different factories that day i  cannot recall or separate one young face that gave me a painful  impression not one young girl whom assuming it to be a matter of  necessity that she should gain her daily bread by the labour of her  hands i would have removed from those works if i had had the  power  they reside in various boardinghouses near at hand  the owners of  the mills are particularly careful to allow no persons to enter  upon the possession of these houses whose characters have not  undergone the most searching and thorough inquiry  any complaint  that is made against them by the boarders or by any one else is  fully investigated and if good ground of complaint be shown to  exist against them they are removed and their occupation is  handed over to some more deserving person  there are a few  children employed in these factories but not many  the laws of  the state forbid their working more than nine months in the year  and require that they be educated during the other three  for this  purpose there are schools in lowell and there are churches and  chapels of various persuasions in which the young women may  observe that form of worship in which they have been educated  at some distance from the factories and on the highest and  pleasantest ground in the neighbourhood stands their hospital or  boardinghouse for the sick  it is the best house in those parts  and was built by an eminent merchant for his own residence  like  that institution at boston which i have before described it is  not parcelled out into wards but is divided into convenient  chambers each of which has all the comforts of a very comfortable  home  the principal medical attendant resides under the same roof  and were the patients members of his own family they could not be  better cared for or attended with greater gentleness and  consideration  the weekly charge in this establishment for each  female patient is three dollars or twelve shillings english but  no girl employed by any of the corporations is ever excluded for  want of the means of payment  that they do not very often want the  means may be gathered from the fact that in july 1841 no fewer  than nine hundred and seventyeight of these girls were depositors  in the lowell savings bank  the amount of whose joint savings was  estimated at one hundred thousand dollars or twenty thousand  english pounds  i am now going to state three facts which will startle a large  class of readers on this side of the atlantic very much  firstly there is a jointstock piano in a great many of the  boardinghouses  secondly nearly all these young ladies subscribe  to circulating libraries  thirdly they have got up among  themselves a periodical called the lowell offering a repository  of original articles written exclusively by females actively  employed in the mills  which is duly printed published and  sold and whereof i brought away from lowell four hundred good  solid pages which i have read from beginning to end  the large class of readers startled by these facts will exclaim  with one voice how very preposterous  on my deferentially  inquiring why they will answer these things are above their  station  in reply to that objection i would beg to ask what  their station is  it is their station to work  and they do work  they labour in  these mills upon an average twelve hours a day which is  unquestionably work and pretty tight work too  perhaps it is  above their station to indulge in such amusements on any terms   are we quite sure that we in england have not formed our ideas of  the station of working people from accustoming ourselves to the  contemplation of that class as they are and not as they might be   i think that if we examine our own feelings we shall find that the  pianos and the circulating libraries and even the lowell  offering startle us by their novelty and not by their bearing  upon any abstract question of right or wrong  for myself i know no station in which the occupation of today  cheerfully done and the occupation of tomorrow cheerfully looked  to any one of these pursuits is not most humanising and laudable   i know no station which is rendered more endurable to the person in  it or more safe to the person out of it by having ignorance for  its associate  i know no station which has a right to monopolise  the means of mutual instruction improvement and rational  entertainment or which has ever continued to be a station very  long after seeking to do so  of the merits of the lowell offering as a literary production i  will only observe putting entirely out of sight the fact of the  articles having been written by these girls after the arduous  labours of the day that it will compare advantageously with a  great many english annuals  it is pleasant to find that many of  its tales are of the mills and of those who work in them that they  inculcate habits of selfdenial and contentment and teach good  doctrines of enlarged benevolence  a strong feeling for the  beauties of nature as displayed in the solitudes the writers have  left at home breathes through its pages like wholesome village  air and though a circulating library is a favourable school for  the study of such topics it has very scant allusion to fine  clothes fine marriages fine houses or fine life  some persons  might object to the papers being signed occasionally with rather  fine names but this is an american fashion  one of the provinces  of the state legislature of massachusetts is to alter ugly names  into pretty ones as the children improve upon the tastes of their  parents  these changes costing little or nothing scores of mary  annes are solemnly converted into bevelinas every session  it is said that on the occasion of a visit from general jackson or  general harrison to this town i forget which but it is not to the  purpose he walked through three miles and a half of these young  ladies all dressed out with parasols and silk stockings  but as i  am not aware that any worse consequence ensued than a sudden  lookingup of all the parasols and silk stockings in the market  and perhaps the bankruptcy of some speculative new englander who  bought them all up at any price in expectation of a demand that  never came i set no great store by the circumstance  in this brief account of lowell and inadequate expression of the  gratification it yielded me and cannot fail to afford to any  foreigner to whom the condition of such people at home is a subject  of interest and anxious speculation i have carefully abstained  from drawing a comparison between these factories and those of our  own land  many of the circumstances whose strong influence has  been at work for years in our manufacturing towns have not arisen  here and there is no manufacturing population in lowell so to  speak  for these girls often the daughters of small farmers come  from other states remain a few years in the mills and then go  home for good  the contrast would be a strong one for it would be between the  good and evil the living light and deepest shadow  i abstain from  it because i deem it just to do so  but i only the more earnestly  adjure all those whose eyes may rest on these pages to pause and  reflect upon the difference between this town and those great  haunts of desperate misery  to call to mind if they can in the  midst of party strife and squabble the efforts that must be made  to purge them of their suffering and danger  and last and  foremost to remember how the precious time is rushing by  i returned at night by the same railroad and in the same kind of  car  one of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at  great length to my companion not to me of course the true  principles on which books of travel in america should be written by  englishmen i feigned to fall asleep  but glancing all the way out  at window from the corners of my eyes i found abundance of  entertainment for the rest of the ride in watching the effects of  the wood fire which had been invisible in the morning but were now  brought out in full relief by the darkness  for we were travelling  in a whirlwind of bright sparks which showered about us like a  storm of fiery snow    chapter v  worcester  the connecticut river  hartford  new  haven  to new york    leaving boston on the afternoon of saturday the fifth of february  we proceeded by another railroad to worcester  a pretty new  england town where we had arranged to remain under the hospitable  roof of the governor of the state until monday morning  these towns and cities of new england many of which would be  villages in old england are as favourable specimens of rural  america as their people are of rural americans  the welltrimmed  lawns and green meadows of home are not there and the grass  compared with our ornamental plots and pastures is rank and  rough and wild  but delicate slopes of land gentlyswelling  hills wooded valleys and slender streams abound  every little  colony of houses has its church and schoolhouse peeping from among  the white roofs and shady trees every house is the whitest of the  white every venetian blind the greenest of the green every fine  days sky the bluest of the blue  a sharp dry wind and a slight  frost had so hardened the roads when we alighted at worcester that  their furrowed tracks were like ridges of granite  there was the  usual aspect of newness on every object of course  all the  buildings looked as if they had been built and painted that  morning and could be taken down on monday with very little  trouble  in the keen evening air every sharp outline looked a  hundred times sharper than ever  the clean cardboard colonnades  had no more perspective than a chinese bridge on a teacup and  appeared equally well calculated for use  the razorlike edges of  the detached cottages seemed to cut the very wind as it whistled  against them and to send it smarting on its way with a shriller  cry than before  those slightlybuilt wooden dwellings behind  which the sun was setting with a brilliant lustre could be so  looked through and through that the idea of any inhabitant being  able to hide himself from the public gaze or to have any secrets  from the public eye was not entertainable for a moment  even  where a blazing fire shone through the uncurtained windows of some  distant house it had the air of being newly lighted and of  lacking warmth and instead of awakening thoughts of a snug  chamber bright with faces that first saw the light round that same  hearth and ruddy with warm hangings it came upon one suggestive  of the smell of new mortar and damp walls  so i thought at least that evening  next morning when the sun  was shining brightly and the clear church bells were ringing and  sedate people in their best clothes enlivened the pathway near at  hand and dotted the distant thread of road there was a pleasant  sabbath peacefulness on everything which it was good to feel  it  would have been the better for an old church better still for some  old graves but as it was a wholesome repose and tranquillity  pervaded the scene which after the restless ocean and the hurried  city had a doubly grateful influence on the spirits  we went on next morning still by railroad to springfield  from  that place to hartford whither we were bound is a distance of  only fiveandtwenty miles but at that time of the year the roads  were so bad that the journey would probably have occupied ten or  twelve hours  fortunately however the winter having been  unusually mild the connecticut river was open or in other  words not frozen  the captain of a small steamboat was going to  make his first trip for the season that day the second february  trip i believe within the memory of man and only waited for us  to go on board  accordingly we went on board with as little  delay as might be  he was as good as his word and started  directly  it certainly was not called a small steamboat without reason  i  omitted to ask the question but i should think it must have been  of about half a pony power  mr paap the celebrated dwarf might  have lived and died happily in the cabin which was fitted with  common sashwindows like an ordinary dwellinghouse  these windows  had brightred curtains too hung on slack strings across the  lower panes so that it looked like the parlour of a lilliputian  publichouse which had got afloat in a flood or some other water  accident and was drifting nobody knew where  but even in this  chamber there was a rockingchair  it would be impossible to get  on anywhere in america without a rockingchair  i am afraid to  tell how many feet short this vessel was or how many feet narrow   to apply the words length and width to such measurement would be a  contradiction in terms  but i may state that we all kept the  middle of the deck lest the boat should unexpectedly tip over and  that the machinery by some surprising process of condensation  worked between it and the keel  the whole forming a warm sandwich  about three feet thick  it rained all day as i once thought it never did rain anywhere but  in the highlands of scotland  the river was full of floating  blocks of ice which were constantly crunching and cracking under  us and the depth of water in the course we took to avoid the  larger masses carried down the middle of the river by the current  did not exceed a few inches  nevertheless we moved onward  dexterously and being well wrapped up bade defiance to the  weather and enjoyed the journey  the connecticut river is a fine  stream and the banks in summertime are i have no doubt  beautiful at all events i was told so by a young lady in the  cabin and she should be a judge of beauty if the possession of a  quality include the appreciation of it for a more beautiful  creature i never looked upon  after two hours and a half of this odd travelling including a  stoppage at a small town where we were saluted by a gun  considerably bigger than our own chimney we reached hartford and  straightway repaired to an extremely comfortable hotel  except as  usual in the article of bedrooms which in almost every place we  visited were very conducive to early rising  we tarried here four days  the town is beautifully situated in a  basin of green hills the soil is rich wellwooded and carefully  improved  it is the seat of the local legislature of connecticut  which sage body enacted in bygone times the renowned code of  blue laws in virtue whereof among other enlightened provisions  any citizen who could be proved to have kissed his wife on sunday  was punishable i believe with the stocks  too much of the old  puritan spirit exists in these parts to the present hour but its  influence has not tended that i know to make the people less hard  in their bargains or more equal in their dealings  as i never  heard of its working that effect anywhere else i infer that it  never will here  indeed i am accustomed with reference to great  professions and severe faces to judge of the goods of the other  world pretty much as i judge of the goods of this and whenever i  see a dealer in such commodities with too great a display of them  in his window i doubt the quality of the article within  in hartford stands the famous oak in which the charter of king  charles was hidden  it is now inclosed in a gentlemans garden   in the state house is the charter itself  i found the courts of  law here just the same as at boston the public institutions  almost as good  the insane asylum is admirably conducted and so  is the institution for the deaf and dumb  i very much questioned within myself as i walked through the  insane asylum whether i should have known the attendants from the  patients but for the few words which passed between the former  and the doctor in reference to the persons under their charge  of  course i limit this remark merely to their looks for the  conversation of the mad people was mad enough  there was one little prim old lady of very smiling and good humoured appearance who came sidling up to me from the end of a  long passage and with a curtsey of inexpressible condescension  propounded this unaccountable inquiry  does pontefract still flourish sir upon the soil of england  he does maam i rejoined  when you last saw him sir he was    well maam said i extremely well  he begged me to present  his compliments  i never saw him looking better  at this the old lady was very much delighted  after glancing at  me for a moment as if to be quite sure that i was serious in my  respectful air she sidled back some paces sidled forward again  made a sudden skip at which i precipitately retreated a step or  two and said  i am an antediluvian sir  i thought the best thing to say was that i had suspected as much  from the first  therefore i said so  it is an extremely proud and pleasant thing sir to be an  antediluvian said the old lady  i should think it was maam i rejoined  the old lady kissed her hand gave another skip smirked and sidled  down the gallery in a most extraordinary manner and ambled  gracefully into her own bedchamber  in another part of the building there was a male patient in bed  very much flushed and heated  well said he starting up and pulling off his nightcap  its  all settled at last  i have arranged it with queen victoria  arranged what asked the doctor  why that business passing his hand wearily across his forehead  about the siege of new york  oh said i like a man suddenly enlightened  for he looked at me  for an answer  yes  every house without a signal will be fired upon by the  british troops  no harm will be done to the others  no harm at  all  those that want to be safe must hoist flags  thats all  theyll have to do  they must hoist flags  even while he was speaking he seemed i thought to have some faint  idea that his talk was incoherent  directly he had said these  words he lay down again gave a kind of a groan and covered his  hot head with the blankets  there was another  a young man whose madness was love and music   after playing on the accordion a march he had composed he was very  anxious that i should walk into his chamber which i immediately  did  by way of being very knowing and humouring him to the top of his  bent i went to the window which commanded a beautiful prospect  and remarked with an address upon which i greatly plumed myself  what a delicious country you have about these lodgings of yours  poh said he moving his fingers carelessly over the notes of his  instrument  well enough for such an institution as this  i dont think i was ever so taken aback in all my life  i come here just for a whim he said coolly  thats all  oh  thats all said i  yes  thats all  the doctors a smart man  he quite enters into  it  its a joke of mine  i like it for a time  you neednt  mention it but i think i shall go out next tuesday  i assured him that i would consider our interview perfectly  confidential and rejoined the doctor  as we were passing through  a gallery on our way out a welldressed lady of quiet and  composed manners came up and proffering a slip of paper and a  pen begged that i would oblige her with an autograph i complied  and we parted  i think i remember having had a few interviews like that with  ladies out of doors  i hope she is not mad  yes  on what subject  autographs  no  she hears voices in the air  well thought i it would be well if we could shut up a few  false prophets of these later times who have professed to do the  same and i should like to try the experiment on a mormonist or two  to begin with  in this place there is the best jail for untried offenders in the  world  there is also a very wellordered state prison arranged  upon the same plan as that at boston except that here there is  always a sentry on the wall with a loaded gun  it contained at  that time about two hundred prisoners  a spot was shown me in the  sleeping ward where a watchman was murdered some years since in  the dead of night in a desperate attempt to escape made by a  prisoner who had broken from his cell  a woman too was pointed  out to me who for the murder of her husband had been a close  prisoner for sixteen years  do you think i asked of my conductor that after so very long  an imprisonment she has any thought or hope of ever regaining her  liberty  oh dear yes he answered  to be sure she has  she has no chance of obtaining it i suppose  well i dont know which bythebye is a national answer   her friends mistrust her  what have they to do with it i naturally inquired  well they wont petition  but if they did they couldnt get her out i suppose  well not the first time perhaps nor yet the second but tiring  and wearying for a few years might do it  does that ever do it  why yes thatll do it sometimes  political friendsll do it  sometimes  its pretty often done one way or another  i shall always entertain a very pleasant and grateful recollection  of hartford  it is a lovely place and i had many friends there  whom i can never remember with indifference  we left it with no  little regret on the evening of friday the 11th and travelled that  night by railroad to new haven  upon the way the guard and i were  formally introduced to each other as we usually were on such  occasions and exchanged a variety of smalltalk  we reached new  haven at about eight oclock after a journey of three hours and  put up for the night at the best inn  new haven known also as the city of elms is a fine town  many of  its streets as its alias sufficiently imports are planted with  rows of grand old elmtrees and the same natural ornaments  surround yale college an establishment of considerable eminence  and reputation  the various departments of this institution are  erected in a kind of park or common in the middle of the town  where they are dimly visible among the shadowing trees  the effect  is very like that of an old cathedral yard in england and when  their branches are in full leaf must be extremely picturesque   even in the winter time these groups of wellgrown trees  clustering among the busy streets and houses of a thriving city  have a very quaint appearance  seeming to bring about a kind of  compromise between town and country as if each had met the other  halfway and shaken hands upon it which is at once novel and  pleasant  after a nights rest we rose early and in good time went down to  the wharf and on board the packet new york for new york  this was  the first american steamboat of any size that i had seen and  certainly to an english eye it was infinitely less like a steamboat  than a huge floating bath  i could hardly persuade myself indeed  but that the bathing establishment off westminster bridge which i  left a baby had suddenly grown to an enormous size run away from  home and set up in foreign parts as a steamer  being in america  too which our vagabonds do so particularly favour it seemed the  more probable  the great difference in appearance between these packets and ours  is that there is so much of them out of the water  the maindeck  being enclosed on all sides and filled with casks and goods like  any second or third floor in a stack of warehouses and the  promenade or hurricanedeck being atop of that again  a part of  the machinery is always above this deck where the connectingrod  in a strong and lofty frame is seen working away like an iron top sawyer  there is seldom any mast or tackle  nothing aloft but two  tall black chimneys  the man at the helm is shut up in a little  house in the fore part of the boat the wheel being connected with  the rudder by iron chains working the whole length of the deck  and the passengers unless the weather be very fine indeed usually  congregate below  directly you have left the wharf all the life  and stir and bustle of a packet cease  you wonder for a long time  how she goes on for there seems to be nobody in charge of her and  when another of these dull machines comes splashing by you feel  quite indignant with it as a sullen cumbrous ungraceful  unshiplike leviathan  quite forgetting that the vessel you are on  board of is its very counterpart  there is always a clerks office on the lower deck where you pay  your fare a ladies cabin baggage and stowage rooms engineers  room and in short a great variety of perplexities which render the  discovery of the gentlemens cabin a matter of some difficulty   it often occupies the whole length of the boat as it did in this  case and has three or four tiers of berths on each side  when i  first descended into the cabin of the new york it looked in my  unaccustomed eyes about as long as the burlington arcade  the sound which has to be crossed on this passage is not always a  very safe or pleasant navigation and has been the scene of some  unfortunate accidents  it was a wet morning and very misty and  we soon lost sight of land  the day was calm however and  brightened towards noon  after exhausting with good help from a  friend the larder and the stock of bottled beer i lay down to  sleep being very much tired with the fatigues of yesterday  but i  woke from my nap in time to hurry up and see hell gate the hogs  back the frying pan and other notorious localities attractive to  all readers of famous diedrich knickerbockers history  we were  now in a narrow channel with sloping banks on either side  besprinkled with pleasant villas and made refreshing to the sight  by turf and trees  soon we shot in quick succession past a light house a madhouse how the lunatics flung up their caps and roared  in sympathy with the headlong engine and the driving tide a  jail and other buildings  and so emerged into a noble bay whose  waters sparkled in the now cloudless sunshine like natures eyes  turned up to heaven  then there lay stretched out before us to the right confused  heaps of buildings with here and there a spire or steeple looking  down upon the herd below and here and there again a cloud of  lazy smoke and in the foreground a forest of ships masts cheery  with flapping sails and waving flags  crossing from among them to  the opposite shore were steam ferryboats laden with people  coaches horses waggons baskets boxes  crossed and recrossed by  other ferryboats  all travelling to and fro  and never idle   stately among these restless insects were two or three large  ships moving with slow majestic pace as creatures of a prouder  kind disdainful of their puny journeys and making for the broad  sea  beyond were shining heights and islands in the glancing  river and a distance scarcely less blue and bright than the sky it  seemed to meet  the citys hum and buzz the clinking of capstans  the ringing of bells the barking of dogs the clattering of  wheels tingled in the listening ear  all of which life and stir  coming across the stirring water caught new life and animation  from its free companionship and sympathising with its buoyant  spirits glistened as it seemed in sport upon its surface and  hemmed the vessel round and plashed the water high about her  sides and floating her gallantly into the dock flew off again to  welcome other comers and speed before them to the busy port     chapter vi  new york    the beautiful metropolis of america is by no means so clean a city  as boston but many of its streets have the same characteristics  except that the houses are not quite so freshcoloured the sign boards are not quite so gaudy the gilded letters not quite so  golden the bricks not quite so red the stone not quite so white  the blinds and area railings not quite so green the knobs and  plates upon the street doors not quite so bright and twinkling   there are many bystreets almost as neutral in clean colours and  positive in dirty ones as bystreets in london and there is one  quarter commonly called the five points which in respect of  filth and wretchedness may be safely backed against seven dials  or any other part of famed st giless  the great promenade and thoroughfare as most people know is  broadway a wide and bustling street which from the battery  gardens to its opposite termination in a country road may be four  miles long  shall we sit down in an upper floor of the carlton  house hotel situated in the best part of this main artery of new  york and when we are tired of looking down upon the life below  sally forth arminarm and mingle with the stream  warm weather  the sun strikes upon our heads at this open window  as though its rays were concentrated through a burningglass but  the day is in its zenith and the season an unusual one  was there  ever such a sunny street as this broadway  the pavement stones are  polished with the tread of feet until they shine again the red  bricks of the houses might be yet in the dry hot kilns and the  roofs of those omnibuses look as though if water were poured on  them they would hiss and smoke and smell like halfquenched  fires  no stint of omnibuses here  halfadozen have gone by  within as many minutes  plenty of hackney cabs and coaches too  gigs phaetons largewheeled tilburies and private carriages   rather of a clumsy make and not very different from the public  vehicles but built for the heavy roads beyond the city pavement   negro coachmen and white in straw hats black hats white hats  glazed caps fur caps in coats of drab black brown green blue  nankeen striped jean and linen and there in that one instance  look while it passes or it will be too late in suits of livery   some southern republican that who puts his blacks in uniform and  swells with sultan pomp and power  yonder where that phaeton with  the wellclipped pair of grays has stopped  standing at their  heads now  is a yorkshire groom who has not been very long in  these parts and looks sorrowfully round for a companion pair of  topboots which he may traverse the city half a year without  meeting  heaven save the ladies how they dress  we have seen  more colours in these ten minutes than we should have seen  elsewhere in as many days  what various parasols what rainbow  silks and satins what pinking of thin stockings and pinching of  thin shoes and fluttering of ribbons and silk tassels and display  of rich cloaks with gaudy hoods and linings  the young gentlemen  are fond you see of turning down their shirtcollars and  cultivating their whiskers especially under the chin but they  cannot approach the ladies in their dress or bearing being to say  the truth humanity of quite another sort  byrons of the desk and  counter pass on and let us see what kind of men those are behind  ye  those two labourers in holiday clothes of whom one carries in  his hand a crumpled scrap of paper from which he tries to spell out  a hard name while the other looks about for it on all the doors  and windows  irishmen both  you might know them if they were masked by their  longtailed blue coats and bright buttons and their drab trousers  which they wear like men well used to working dresses who are easy  in no others  it would be hard to keep your model republics going  without the countrymen and countrywomen of those two labourers   for who else would dig and delve and drudge and do domestic  work and make canals and roads and execute great lines of  internal improvement  irishmen both and sorely puzzled too to  find out what they seek  let us go down and help them for the  love of home and that spirit of liberty which admits of honest  service to honest men and honest work for honest bread no matter  what it be  thats well  we have got at the right address at last though it  is written in strange characters truly and might have been  scrawled with the blunt handle of the spade the writer better knows  the use of than a pen  their way lies yonder but what business  takes them there  they carry savings  to hoard up  no  they are  brothers those men  one crossed the sea alone and working very  hard for one half year and living harder saved funds enough to  bring the other out  that done they worked together side by side  contentedly sharing hard labour and hard living for another term  and then their sisters came and then another brother and lastly  their old mother  and what now  why the poor old crone is  restless in a strange land and yearns to lay her bones she says  among her people in the old graveyard at home  and so they go to  pay her passage back  and god help her and them and every simple  heart and all who turn to the jerusalem of their younger days and  have an altarfire upon the cold hearth of their fathers  this narrow thoroughfare baking and blistering in the sun is wall  street  the stock exchange and lombard street of new york  many a  rapid fortune has been made in this street and many a no less  rapid ruin  some of these very merchants whom you see hanging  about here now have locked up money in their strongboxes like  the man in the arabian nights and opening them again have found  but withered leaves  below here by the waterside where the  bowsprits of ships stretch across the footway and almost thrust  themselves into the windows lie the noble american vessels which  have made their packet service the finest in the world  they  have brought hither the foreigners who abound in all the streets   not perhaps that there are more here than in other commercial  cities but elsewhere they have particular haunts and you must  find them out here they pervade the town  we must cross broadway again gaining some refreshment from the  heat in the sight of the great blocks of clean ice which are being  carried into shops and barrooms and the pineapples and water melons profusely displayed for sale  fine streets of spacious  houses here you see  wall street has furnished and dismantled  many of them very often  and here a deep green leafy square  be  sure that is a hospitable house with inmates to be affectionately  remembered always where they have the open door and pretty show of  plants within and where the child with laughing eyes is peeping  out of window at the little dog below  you wonder what may be the  use of this tall flagstaff in the bystreet with something like  libertys headdress on its top  so do i  but there is a passion  for tall flagstaffs hereabout and you may see its twin brother in  five minutes if you have a mind  again across broadway and so  passing from the manycoloured  crowd and glittering shops  into another long main street the  bowery  a railroad yonder see where two stout horses trot along  drawing a score or two of people and a great wooden ark with ease   the stores are poorer here the passengers less gay  clothes  readymade and meat readycooked are to be bought in these parts  and the lively whirl of carriages is exchanged for the deep rumble  of carts and waggons  these signs which are so plentiful in shape  like river buoys or small balloons hoisted by cords to poles and  dangling there announce as you may see by looking up oysters in  every style  they tempt the hungry most at night for then dull  candles glimmering inside illuminate these dainty words and make  the mouths of idlers water as they read and linger  what is this dismalfronted pile of bastard egyptian like an  enchanters palace in a melodrama  a famous prison called the  tombs  shall we go in  so  a long narrow lofty building stoveheated as usual with  four galleries one above the other going round it and  communicating by stairs  between the two sides of each gallery  and in its centre a bridge for the greater convenience of  crossing  on each of these bridges sits a man  dozing or reading  or talking to an idle companion  on each tier are two opposite  rows of small iron doors  they look like furnacedoors but are  cold and black as though the fires within had all gone out  some  two or three are open and women with drooping heads bent down  are talking to the inmates  the whole is lighted by a skylight  but it is fast closed and from the roof there dangle limp and  drooping two useless windsails  a man with keys appears to show us round  a goodlooking fellow  and in his way civil and obliging  are those black doors the cells  yes  are they all full  well theyre pretty nigh full and thats a fact and no two ways  about it  those at the bottom are unwholesome surely  why we do only put coloured people in em  thats the truth  when do the prisoners take exercise  well they do without it pretty much  do they never walk in the yard  considerable seldom  sometimes i suppose  well its rare they do  they keep pretty bright without it  but suppose a man were here for a twelvemonth  i know this is  only a prison for criminals who are charged with grave offences  while they are awaiting their trial or under remand but the law  here affords criminals many means of delay  what with motions for  new trials and in arrest of judgment and what not a prisoner  might be here for twelve months i take it might he not  well i guess he might  do you mean to say that in all that time he would never come out  at that little iron door for exercise  he might walk some perhaps  not much  will you open one of the doors  all if you like  the fastenings jar and rattle and one of the doors turns slowly on  its hinges  let us look in  a small bare cell into which the  light enters through a high chink in the wall  there is a rude  means of washing a table and a bedstead  upon the latter sits a  man of sixty reading  he looks up for a moment gives an  impatient dogged shake and fixes his eyes upon his book again  as  we withdraw our heads the door closes on him and is fastened as  before  this man has murdered his wife and will probably be  hanged  how long has he been here  a month  when will he be tried  next term  when is that  next month  in england if a man be under sentence of death even he has air  and exercise at certain periods of the day  possible  with what stupendous and untranslatable coolness he says this and  how loungingly he leads on to the womens side  making as he  goes a kind of iron castanet of the key and the stairrail  each cell door on this side has a square aperture in it  some of  the women peep anxiously through it at the sound of footsteps  others shrink away in shame  for what offence can that lonely  child of ten or twelve years old be shut up here  oh that boy   he is the son of the prisoner we saw just now is a witness against  his father and is detained here for safe keeping until the trial  thats all  but it is a dreadful place for the child to pass the long days and  nights in  this is rather hard treatment for a young witness is  it not  what says our conductor  well it ant a very rowdy life and thats a fact  again he clinks his metal castanet and leads us leisurely away  i  have a question to ask him as we go  pray why do they call this place the tombs  well its the cant name  i know it is  why  some suicides happened here when it was first built  i expect it  come about from that  i saw just now that that mans clothes were scattered about the  floor of his cell  dont you oblige the prisoners to be orderly  and put such things away  where should they put em  not on the ground surely  what do you say to hanging them up  he stops and looks round to emphasise his answer  why i say thats just it  when they had hooks they would hang  themselves so theyre taken out of every cell and theres only  the marks left where they used to be  the prisonyard in which he pauses now has been the scene of  terrible performances  into this narrow gravelike place men are  brought out to die  the wretched creature stands beneath the  gibbet on the ground the rope about his neck and when the sign is  given a weight at its other end comes running down and swings him  up into the air  a corpse  the law requires that there be present at this dismal spectacle  the judge the jury and citizens to the amount of twentyfive   from the community it is hidden  to the dissolute and bad the  thing remains a frightful mystery  between the criminal and them  the prisonwall is interposed as a thick gloomy veil  it is the  curtain to his bed of death his windingsheet and grave  from  him it shuts out life and all the motives to unrepenting hardihood  in that last hour which its mere sight and presence is often all sufficient to sustain  there are no bold eyes to make him bold no  ruffians to uphold a ruffians name before  all beyond the  pitiless stone wall is unknown space  let us go forth again into the cheerful streets  once more in broadway  here are the same ladies in bright colours  walking to and fro in pairs and singly yonder the very same light  blue parasol which passed and repassed the hotelwindow twenty  times while we were sitting there  we are going to cross here   take care of the pigs  two portly sows are trotting up behind this  carriage and a select party of halfadozen gentlemen hogs have  just now turned the corner  here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself  he has only  one ear having parted with the other to vagrantdogs in the course  of his city rambles  but he gets on very well without it and  leads a roving gentlemanly vagabond kind of life somewhat  answering to that of our clubmen at home  he leaves his lodgings  every morning at a certain hour throws himself upon the town gets  through his day in some manner quite satisfactory to himself and  regularly appears at the door of his own house again at night like  the mysterious master of gil blas  he is a freeandeasy  careless indifferent kind of pig having a very large acquaintance  among other pigs of the same character whom he rather knows by  sight than conversation as he seldom troubles himself to stop and  exchange civilities but goes grunting down the kennel turning up  the news and smalltalk of the city in the shape of cabbagestalks  and offal and bearing no tails but his own  which is a very short  one for his old enemies the dogs have been at that too and have  left him hardly enough to swear by  he is in every respect a  republican pig going wherever he pleases and mingling with the  best society on an equal if not superior footing for every one  makes way when he appears and the haughtiest give him the wall if  he prefer it  he is a great philosopher and seldom moved unless  by the dogs before mentioned  sometimes indeed you may see his  small eye twinkling on a slaughtered friend whose carcase  garnishes a butchers doorpost but he grunts out such is life   all flesh is pork buries his nose in the mire again and waddles  down the gutter  comforting himself with the reflection that there  is one snout the less to anticipate stray cabbagestalks at any  rate  they are the city scavengers these pigs  ugly brutes they are  having for the most part scanty brown backs like the lids of old  horsehair trunks  spotted with unwholesome black blotches  they  have long gaunt legs too and such peaked snouts that if one of  them could be persuaded to sit for his profile nobody would  recognise it for a pigs likeness  they are never attended upon  or fed or driven or caught but are thrown upon their own  resources in early life and become preternaturally knowing in  consequence  every pig knows where he lives much better than  anybody could tell him  at this hour just as evening is closing  in you will see them roaming towards bed by scores eating their  way to the last  occasionally some youth among them who has over eaten himself or has been worried by dogs trots shrinkingly  homeward like a prodigal son  but this is a rare case  perfect  selfpossession and selfreliance and immovable composure being  their foremost attributes  the streets and shops are lighted now and as the eye travels down  the long thoroughfare dotted with bright jets of gas it is  reminded of oxford street or piccadilly  here and there a flight  of broad stone cellarsteps appears and a painted lamp directs you  to the bowling saloon or tenpin alley tenpins being a game of  mingled chance and skill invented when the legislature passed an  act forbidding ninepins  at other downward flights of steps are  other lamps marking the whereabouts of oystercellars  pleasant  retreats say i  not only by reason of their wonderful cookery of  oysters pretty nigh as large as cheeseplates or for thy dear  sake heartiest of greek professors but because of all kinds of  caters of fish or flesh or fowl in these latitudes the  swallowers of oysters alone are not gregarious but subduing  themselves as it were to the nature of what they work in and  copying the coyness of the thing they eat do sit apart in  curtained boxes and consort by twos not by two hundreds  but how quiet the streets are  are there no itinerant bands no  wind or stringed instruments  no not one  by day are there no  punches fantoccini dancingdogs jugglers conjurers  orchestrinas or even barrelorgans  no not one  yes i remember  one  one barrelorgan and a dancingmonkey  sportive by nature  but fast fading into a dull lumpish monkey of the utilitarian  school  beyond that nothing lively no not so much as a white  mouse in a twirling cage  are there no amusements  yes  there is a lectureroom across the  way from which that glare of light proceeds and there may be  evening service for the ladies thrice a week or oftener  for the  young gentlemen there is the countinghouse the store the bar room  the latter as you may see through these windows pretty  full  hark to the clinking sound of hammers breaking lumps of  ice and to the cool gurgling of the pounded bits as in the  process of mixing they are poured from glass to glass  no  amusements  what are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of  strong drinks whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety  of twist doing but amusing themselves  what are the fifty  newspapers which those precocious urchins are bawling down the  street and which are kept filed within what are they but  amusements  not vapid waterish amusements but good strong stuff  dealing in round abuse and blackguard names pulling off the roofs  of private houses as the halting devil did in spain pimping and  pandering for all degrees of vicious taste and gorging with coined  lies the most voracious maw imputing to every man in public life  the coarsest and the vilest motives scaring away from the stabbed  and prostrate bodypolitic every samaritan of clear conscience and  good deeds and setting on with yell and whistle and the clapping  of foul hands the vilest vermin and worst birds of prey  no  amusements  let us go on again and passing this wilderness of an hotel with  stores about its base like some continental theatre or the london  opera house shorn of its colonnade plunge into the five points   but it is needful first that we take as our escort these two  heads of the police whom you would know for sharp and welltrained  officers if you met them in the great desert  so true it is that  certain pursuits wherever carried on will stamp men with the same  character  these two might have been begotten born and bred in  bow street  we have seen no beggars in the streets by night or day but of  other kinds of strollers plenty  poverty wretchedness and vice  are rife enough where we are going now  this is the place  these narrow ways diverging to the right and  left and reeking everywhere with dirt and filth  such lives as  are led here bear the same fruits here as elsewhere  the coarse  and bloated faces at the doors have counterparts at home and all  the wide world over  debauchery has made the very houses  prematurely old  see how the rotten beams are tumbling down and  how the patched and broken windows seem to scowl dimly like eyes  that have been hurt in drunken frays  many of those pigs live  here  do they ever wonder why their masters walk upright in lieu  of going on allfours and why they talk instead of grunting  so far nearly every house is a low tavern and on the barroom  walls are coloured prints of washington and queen victoria of  england and the american eagle  among the pigeonholes that hold  the bottles are pieces of plateglass and coloured paper for  there is in some sort a taste for decoration even here  and as  seamen frequent these haunts there are maritime pictures by the  dozen  of partings between sailors and their ladyloves portraits  of william of the ballad and his blackeyed susan of will watch  the bold smuggler of paul jones the pirate and the like  on  which the painted eyes of queen victoria and of washington to  boot rest in as strange companionship as on most of the scenes  that are enacted in their wondering presence  what place is this to which the squalid street conducts us  a  kind of square of leprous houses some of which are attainable only  by crazy wooden stairs without  what lies beyond this tottering  flight of steps that creak beneath our tread  a miserable room  lighted by one dim candle and destitute of all comfort save that  which may be hidden in a wretched bed  beside it sits a man  his  elbows on his knees  his forehead hidden in his hands  what ails  that man asks the foremost officer  fever he sullenly  replies without looking up  conceive the fancies of a feverish  brain in such a place as this  ascend these pitchdark stairs heedful of a false footing on the  trembling boards and grope your way with me into this wolfish den  where neither ray of light nor breath of air appears to come  a  negro lad startled from his sleep by the officers voice  he  knows it well  but comforted by his assurance that he has not come  on business officiously bestirs himself to light a candle  the  match flickers for a moment and shows great mounds of dusty rags  upon the ground then dies away and leaves a denser darkness than  before if there can be degrees in such extremes  he stumbles down  the stairs and presently comes back shading a flaring taper with  his hand  then the mounds of rags are seen to be astir and rise  slowly up and the floor is covered with heaps of negro women  waking from their sleep  their white teeth chattering and their  bright eyes glistening and winking on all sides with surprise and  fear like the countless repetition of one astonished african face  in some strange mirror  mount up these other stairs with no less caution there are traps  and pitfalls here for those who are not so well escorted as  ourselves into the housetop where the bare beams and rafters meet  overhead and calm night looks down through the crevices in the  roof  open the door of one of these cramped hutches full of  sleeping negroes  pah  they have a charcoal fire within there is  a smell of singeing clothes or flesh so close they gather round  the brazier and vapours issue forth that blind and suffocate   from every corner as you glance about you in these dark retreats  some figure crawls halfawakened as if the judgmenthour were near  at hand and every obscene grave were giving up its dead  where  dogs would howl to lie women and men and boys slink off to  sleep forcing the dislodged rats to move away in quest of better  lodgings  here too are lanes and alleys paved with mud kneedeep  underground chambers where they dance and game the walls bedecked  with rough designs of ships and forts and flags and american  eagles out of number  ruined houses open to the street whence  through wide gaps in the walls other ruins loom upon the eye as  though the world of vice and misery had nothing else to show   hideous tenements which take their name from robbery and murder   all that is loathsome drooping and decayed is here  our leader has his hand upon the latch of almacks and calls to  us from the bottom of the steps for the assemblyroom of the five  point fashionables is approached by a descent  shall we go in  it  is but a moment  heyday the landlady of almacks thrives  a buxom fat mulatto  woman with sparkling eyes whose head is daintily ornamented with  a handkerchief of many colours  nor is the landlord much behind  her in his finery being attired in a smart blue jacket like a  ships steward with a thick gold ring upon his little finger and  round his neck a gleaming golden watchguard  how glad he is to  see us  what will we please to call for  a dance  it shall be  done directly sir  a regular breakdown  the corpulent black fiddler and his friend who plays the  tambourine stamp upon the boarding of the small raised orchestra  in which they sit and play a lively measure  five or six couple  come upon the floor marshalled by a lively young negro who is the  wit of the assembly and the greatest dancer known  he never  leaves off making queer faces and is the delight of all the rest  who grin from ear to ear incessantly  among the dancers are two  young mulatto girls with large black drooping eyes and head gear after the fashion of the hostess who are as shy or feign to  be as though they never danced before and so look down before the  visitors that their partners can see nothing but the long fringed  lashes  but the dance commences  every gentleman sets as long as he likes  to the opposite lady and the opposite lady to him and all are so  long about it that the sport begins to languish when suddenly the  lively hero dashes in to the rescue  instantly the fiddler grins  and goes at it tooth and nail there is new energy in the  tambourine new laughter in the dancers new smiles in the  landlady new confidence in the landlord new brightness in the  very candles  single shuffle double shuffle cut and crosscut snapping his  fingers rolling his eyes turning in his knees presenting the  backs of his legs in front spinning about on his toes and heels  like nothing but the mans fingers on the tambourine dancing with  two left legs two right legs two wooden legs two wire legs two  spring legs  all sorts of legs and no legs  what is this to him   and in what walk of life or dance of life does man ever get such  stimulating applause as thunders about him when having danced his  partner off her feet and himself too he finishes by leaping  gloriously on the barcounter and calling for something to drink  with the chuckle of a million of counterfeit jim crows in one  inimitable sound  the air even in these distempered parts is fresh after the  stifling atmosphere of the houses and now as we emerge into a  broader street it blows upon us with a purer breath and the stars  look bright again  here are the tombs once more  the city watch house is a part of the building  it follows naturally on the  sights we have just left  let us see that and then to bed  what do you thrust your common offenders against the police  discipline of the town into such holes as these  do men and  women against whom no crime is proved lie here all night in  perfect darkness surrounded by the noisome vapours which encircle  that flagging lamp you light us with and breathing this filthy and  offensive stench  why such indecent and disgusting dungeons as  these cells would bring disgrace upon the most despotic empire in  the world  look at them man  you who see them every night and  keep the keys  do you see what they are  do you know how drains  are made below the streets and wherein these human sewers differ  except in being always stagnant  well he dont know  he has had fiveandtwenty young women locked  up in this very cell at one time and youd hardly realise what  handsome faces there were among em  in gods name shut the door upon the wretched creature who is in  it now and put its screen before a place quite unsurpassed in all  the vice neglect and devilry of the worst old town in europe  are people really left all night untried in those black sties   every night  the watch is set at seven in the evening  the  magistrate opens his court at five in the morning  that is the  earliest hour at which the first prisoner can be released and if  an officer appear against him he is not taken out till nine  oclock or ten  but if any one among them die in the interval as  one man did not long ago  then he is halfeaten by the rats in an  hours time as that man was and there an end  what is this intolerable tolling of great bells and crashing of  wheels and shouting in the distance  a fire  and what that deep  red light in the opposite direction  another fire  and what these  charred and blackened walls we stand before  a dwelling where a  fire has been  it was more than hinted in an official report not  long ago that some of these conflagrations were not wholly  accidental and that speculation and enterprise found a field of  exertion even in flames  but be this as it may there was a fire  last night there are two tonight and you may lay an even wager  there will be at least one tomorrow  so carrying that with us  for our comfort let us say good night and climb upstairs to  bed         one day during my stay in new york i paid a visit to the  different public institutions on long island or rhode island  i  forget which  one of them is a lunatic asylum  the building is  handsome and is remarkable for a spacious and elegant staircase   the whole structure is not yet finished but it is already one of  considerable size and extent and is capable of accommodating a  very large number of patients  i cannot say that i derived much comfort from the inspection of  this charity  the different wards might have been cleaner and  better ordered i saw nothing of that salutary system which had  impressed me so favourably elsewhere and everything had a  lounging listless madhouse air which was very painful  the  moping idiot cowering down with long dishevelled hair the  gibbering maniac with his hideous laugh and pointed finger the  vacant eye the fierce wild face the gloomy picking of the hands  and lips and munching of the nails  there they were all without  disguise in naked ugliness and horror  in the diningroom a  bare dull dreary place with nothing for the eye to rest on but  the empty walls a woman was locked up alone  she was bent they  told me on committing suicide  if anything could have  strengthened her in her resolution it would certainly have been  the insupportable monotony of such an existence  the terrible crowd with which these halls and galleries were  filled so shocked me that i abridged my stay within the shortest  limits and declined to see that portion of the building in which  the refractory and violent were under closer restraint  i have no  doubt that the gentleman who presided over this establishment at  the time i write of was competent to manage it and had done all  in his power to promote its usefulness  but will it be believed  that the miserable strife of party feeling is carried even into  this sad refuge of afflicted and degraded humanity  will it be  believed that the eyes which are to watch over and control the  wanderings of minds on which the most dreadful visitation to which  our nature is exposed has fallen must wear the glasses of some  wretched side in politics  will it be believed that the governor  of such a house as this is appointed and deposed and changed  perpetually as parties fluctuate and vary and as their despicable  weathercocks are blown this way or that  a hundred times in every  week some new most paltry exhibition of that narrowminded and  injurious party spirit which is the simoom of america sickening  and blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach was  forced upon my notice but i never turned my back upon it with  feelings of such deep disgust and measureless contempt as when i  crossed the threshold of this madhouse  at a short distance from this building is another called the alms  house that is to say the workhouse of new york  this is a large  institution also  lodging i believe when i was there nearly a  thousand poor  it was badly ventilated and badly lighted was not  too clean  and impressed me on the whole very uncomfortably   but it must be remembered that new york as a great emporium of  commerce and as a place of general resort not only from all parts  of the states but from most parts of the world has always a large  pauper population to provide for and labours therefore under  peculiar difficulties in this respect  nor must it be forgotten  that new york is a large town and that in all large towns a vast  amount of good and evil is intermixed and jumbled up together  in the same neighbourhood is the farm where young orphans are  nursed and bred  i did not see it but i believe it is well  conducted and i can the more easily credit it from knowing how  mindful they usually are in america of that beautiful passage in  the litany which remembers all sick persons and young children  i was taken to these institutions by water in a boat belonging to  the island jail and rowed by a crew of prisoners who were dressed  in a striped uniform of black and buff in which they looked like  faded tigers  they took me by the same conveyance to the jail  itself  it is an old prison and quite a pioneer establishment on the plan  i have already described  i was glad to hear this for it is  unquestionably a very indifferent one  the most is made however  of the means it possesses and it is as well regulated as such a  place can be  the women work in covered sheds erected for that purpose  if i  remember right there are no shops for the men but be that as it  may the greater part of them labour in certain stonequarries near  at hand  the day being very wet indeed this labour was suspended  and the prisoners were in their cells  imagine these cells some  two or three hundred in number and in every one a man locked up  this one at his door for air with his hands thrust through the  grate this one in bed in the middle of the day remember and  this one flung down in a heap upon the ground with his head  against the bars like a wild beast  make the rain pour down  outside in torrents  put the everlasting stove in the midst hot  and suffocating and vaporous as a witchs cauldron  add a  collection of gentle odours such as would arise from a thousand  mildewed umbrellas wet through and a thousand buckbaskets full  of halfwashed linen  and there is the prison as it was that day  the prison for the state at sing sing is on the other hand a  model jail  that and auburn are i believe the largest and best  examples of the silent system  in another part of the city is the refuge for the destitute  an  institution whose object is to reclaim youthful offenders male and  female black and white without distinction to teach them useful  trades apprentice them to respectable masters and make them  worthy members of society  its design it will be seen is similar  to that at boston and it is a no less meritorious and admirable  establishment  a suspicion crossed my mind during my inspection of  this noble charity whether the superintendent had quite sufficient  knowledge of the world and worldly characters and whether he did  not commit a great mistake in treating some young girls who were  to all intents and purposes by their years and their past lives  women as though they were little children which certainly had a  ludicrous effect in my eyes and or i am much mistaken in theirs  also  as the institution however is always under a vigilant  examination of a body of gentlemen of great intelligence and  experience it cannot fail to be well conducted and whether i am  right or wrong in this slight particular is unimportant to its  deserts and character which it would be difficult to estimate too  highly  in addition to these establishments there are in new york  excellent hospitals and schools literary institutions and  libraries an admirable fire department as indeed it should be  having constant practice and charities of every sort and kind   in the suburbs there is a spacious cemetery  unfinished yet but  every day improving  the saddest tomb i saw there was the  strangers grave  dedicated to the different hotels in this city  there are three principal theatres  two of them the park and the  bowery are large elegant and handsome buildings and are i  grieve to write it generally deserted  the third the olympic is  a tiny showbox for vaudevilles and burlesques  it is singularly  well conducted by mr mitchell a comic actor of great quiet humour  and originality who is well remembered and esteemed by london  playgoers  i am happy to report of this deserving gentleman that  his benches are usually well filled and that his theatre rings  with merriment every night  i had almost forgotten a small summer  theatre called niblos with gardens and open air amusements  attached but i believe it is not exempt from the general  depression under which theatrical property or what is humorously  called by that name unfortunately labours  the country round new york is surpassingly and exquisitely  picturesque  the climate as i have already intimated is somewhat  of the warmest  what it would be without the sea breezes which  come from its beautiful bay in the evening time i will not throw  myself or my readers into a fever by inquiring  the tone of the best society in this city is like that of boston  here and there it may be with a greater infusion of the  mercantile spirit but generally polished and refined and always  most hospitable  the houses and tables are elegant the hours  later and more rakish and there is perhaps a greater spirit of  contention in reference to appearances and the display of wealth  and costly living  the ladies are singularly beautiful  before i left new york i made arrangements for securing a passage  home in the george washington packet ship which was advertised to  sail in june  that being the month in which i had determined if  prevented by no accident in the course of my ramblings to leave  america  i never thought that going back to england returning to all who  are dear to me and to pursuits that have insensibly grown to be a  part of my nature i could have felt so much sorrow as i endured  when i parted at last on board this ship with the friends who had  accompanied me from this city  i never thought the name of any  place so far away and so lately known could ever associate itself  in my mind with the crowd of affectionate remembrances that now  cluster about it  there are those in this city who would brighten  to me the darkest winterday that ever glimmered and went out in  lapland and before whose presence even home grew dim when they  and i exchanged that painful word which mingles with our every  thought and deed which haunts our cradleheads in infancy and  closes up the vista of our lives in age     chapter vii  philadelphia and its solitary prison    the journey from new york to philadelphia is made by railroad and  two ferries and usually occupies between five and six hours  it  was a fine evening when we were passengers in the train  and  watching the bright sunset from a little window near the door by  which we sat my attention was attracted to a remarkable appearance  issuing from the windows of the gentlemans car immediately in  front of us which i supposed for some time was occasioned by a  number of industrious persons inside ripping open featherbeds  and giving the feathers to the wind  at length it occurred to me  that they were only spitting which was indeed the case though how  any number of passengers which it was possible for that car to  contain could have maintained such a playful and incessant shower  of expectoration i am still at a loss to understand   notwithstanding the experience in all salivatory phenomena which i  afterwards acquired  i made acquaintance on this journey with a mild and modest young  quaker who opened the discourse by informing me in a grave  whisper that his grandfather was the inventor of colddrawn castor  oil  i mention the circumstance here thinking it probable that  this is the first occasion on which the valuable medicine in  question was ever used as a conversational aperient  we reached the city late that night  looking out of my chamber window before going to bed i saw on the opposite side of the  way a handsome building of white marble which had a mournful  ghostlike aspect dreary to behold  i attributed this to the  sombre influence of the night and on rising in the morning looked  out again expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with  groups of people passing in and out  the door was still tight  shut however the same cold cheerless air prevailed  and the  building looked as if the marble statue of don guzman could alone  have any business to transact within its gloomy walls  i hastened  to inquire its name and purpose and then my surprise vanished  it  was the tomb of many fortunes the great catacomb of investment  the memorable united states bank  the stoppage of this bank with all its ruinous consequences had  cast as i was told on every side a gloom on philadelphia under  the depressing effect of which it yet laboured  it certainly did  seem rather dull and out of spirits  it is a handsome city but distractingly regular  after walking  about it for an hour or two i felt that i would have given the  world for a crooked street  the collar of my coat appeared to  stiffen and the brim of my hat to expand beneath its quakery  influence  my hair shrunk into a sleek short crop my hands folded  themselves upon my breast of their own calm accord and thoughts of  taking lodgings in mark lane over against the market place and of  making a large fortune by speculations in corn came over me  involuntarily  philadelphia is most bountifully provided with fresh water which  is showered and jerked about and turned on and poured off  everywhere  the waterworks which are on a height near the city  are no less ornamental than useful being tastefully laid out as a  public garden and kept in the best and neatest order  the river  is dammed at this point and forced by its own power into certain  high tanks or reservoirs whence the whole city to the top stories  of the houses is supplied at a very trifling expense  there are various public institutions  among them a most excellent  hospital  a quaker establishment but not sectarian in the great  benefits it confers a quiet quaint old library named after  franklin a handsome exchange and post office and so forth  in  connection with the quaker hospital there is a picture by west  which is exhibited for the benefit of the funds of the institution   the subject is our saviour healing the sick and it is perhaps  as favourable a specimen of the master as can be seen anywhere   whether this be high or low praise depends upon the readers  taste  in the same room there is a very characteristic and lifelike  portrait by mr sully a distinguished american artist  my stay in philadelphia was very short but what i saw of its  society i greatly liked  treating of its general characteristics  i should be disposed to say that it is more provincial than boston  or new york and that there is afloat in the fair city an  assumption of taste and criticism savouring rather of those  genteel discussions upon the same themes in connection with  shakspeare and the musical glasses of which we read in the vicar  of wakefield  near the city is a most splendid unfinished marble  structure for the girard college founded by a deceased gentleman  of that name and of enormous wealth which if completed according  to the original design will be perhaps the richest edifice of  modern times  but the bequest is involved in legal disputes and  pending them the work has stopped so that like many other great  undertakings in america even this is rather going to be done one  of these days than doing now  in the outskirts stands a great prison called the eastern  penitentiary  conducted on a plan peculiar to the state of  pennsylvania  the system here is rigid strict and hopeless  solitary confinement  i believe it in its effects to be cruel  and wrong  in its intention i am well convinced that it is kind humane and  meant for reformation but i am persuaded that those who devised  this system of prison discipline and those benevolent gentlemen  who carry it into execution do not know what it is that they are  doing  i believe that very few men are capable of estimating the  immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment  prolonged for years inflicts upon the sufferers and in guessing  at it myself and in reasoning from what i have seen written upon  their faces and what to my certain knowledge they feel within i  am only the more convinced that there is a depth of terrible  endurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can fathom  and which no man has a right to inflict upon his fellowcreature   i hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the  brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body  and  because its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye  and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh because its wounds are  not upon the surface and it extorts few cries that human ears can  hear therefore i the more denounce it as a secret punishment  which slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay  i hesitated  once debating with myself whether if i had the power of saying  yes or no i would allow it to be tried in certain cases where  the terms of imprisonment were short but now i solemnly declare  that with no rewards or honours could i walk a happy man beneath  the open sky by day or lie me down upon my bed at night with the  consciousness that one human creature for any length of time no  matter what lay suffering this unknown punishment in his silent  cell and i the cause or i consenting to it in the least degree  i was accompanied to this prison by two gentlemen officially  connected with its management and passed the day in going from  cell to cell and talking with the inmates  every facility was  afforded me that the utmost courtesy could suggest  nothing was  concealed or hidden from my view and every piece of information  that i sought was openly and frankly given  the perfect order of  the building cannot be praised too highly and of the excellent  motives of all who are immediately concerned in the administration  of the system there can be no kind of question  between the body of the prison and the outer wall there is a  spacious garden  entering it by a wicket in the massive gate we  pursued the path before us to its other termination and passed  into a large chamber from which seven long passages radiate  on  either side of each is a long long row of low cell doors with a  certain number over every one  above a gallery of cells like  those below except that they have no narrow yard attached as  those in the ground tier have and are somewhat smaller  the  possession of two of these is supposed to compensate for the  absence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip  attached to each of the others in an hours time every day and  therefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells  adjoining and communicating with each other  standing at the central point and looking down these dreary  passages the dull repose and quiet that prevails is awful   occasionally there is a drowsy sound from some lone weavers  shuttle or shoemakers last but it is stifled by the thick walls  and heavy dungeondoor and only serves to make the general  stillness more profound  over the head and face of every prisoner  who comes into this melancholy house a black hood is drawn and in  this dark shroud an emblem of the curtain dropped between him and  the living world he is led to the cell from which he never again  comes forth until his whole term of imprisonment has expired  he  never hears of wife and children home or friends the life or  death of any single creature  he sees the prisonofficers but  with that exception he never looks upon a human countenance or  hears a human voice  he is a man buried alive to be dug out in  the slow round of years and in the mean time dead to everything  but torturing anxieties and horrible despair  his name and crime and term of suffering are unknown even to  the officer who delivers him his daily food  there is a number  over his celldoor and in a book of which the governor of the  prison has one copy and the moral instructor another  this is the  index of his history  beyond these pages the prison has no record  of his existence  and though he live to be in the same cell ten  weary years he has no means of knowing down to the very last  hour in which part of the building it is situated what kind of  men there are about him whether in the long winter nights there  are living people near or he is in some lonely corner of the great  jail with walls and passages and iron doors between him and the  nearest sharer in its solitary horrors  every cell has double doors  the outer one of sturdy oak the  other of grated iron wherein there is a trap through which his  food is handed  he has a bible and a slate and pencil and under  certain restrictions has sometimes other books provided for the  purpose and pen and ink and paper  his razor plate and can and  basin hang upon the wall or shine upon the little shelf  fresh  water is laid on in every cell and he can draw it at his pleasure   during the day his bedstead turns up against the wall and leaves  more space for him to work in  his loom or bench or wheel is  there and there he labours sleeps and wakes and counts the  seasons as they change and grows old  the first man i saw was seated at his loom at work  he had been  there six years and was to remain i think three more  he had  been convicted as a receiver of stolen goods but even after his  long imprisonment denied his guilt and said he had been hardly  dealt by  it was his second offence  he stopped his work when we went in took off his spectacles and  answered freely to everything that was said to him but always with  a strange kind of pause first and in a low thoughtful voice  he  wore a paper hat of his own making and was pleased to have it  noticed and commanded  he had very ingeniously manufactured a sort  of dutch clock from some disregarded odds and ends and his  vinegarbottle served for the pendulum  seeing me interested in  this contrivance he looked up at it with a great deal of pride  and said that he had been thinking of improving it and that he  hoped the hammer and a little piece of broken glass beside it  would play music before long  he had extracted some colours from  the yarn with which he worked and painted a few poor figures on  the wall  one of a female over the door he called the lady of  the lake  he smiled as i looked at these contrivances to while away the time  but when i looked from them to him i saw that his lip trembled  and could have counted the beating of his heart  i forget how it  came about but some allusion was made to his having a wife  he  shook his head at the word turned aside and covered his face with  his hands  but you are resigned now said one of the gentlemen after a short  pause during which he had resumed his former manner  he answered  with a sigh that seemed quite reckless in its hopelessness oh  yes oh yes  i am resigned to it  and are a better man you  think  well i hope so  im sure i hope i may be  and time  goes pretty quickly  time is very long gentlemen within these  four walls  he gazed about him  heaven only knows how wearily  as he said  these words and in the act of doing so fell into a strange stare  as if he had forgotten something  a moment afterwards he sighed  heavily put on his spectacles and went about his work again  in another cell there was a german sentenced to five years  imprisonment for larceny two of which had just expired  with  colours procured in the same manner he had painted every inch of  the walls and ceiling quite beautifully  he had laid out the few  feet of ground behind with exquisite neatness and had made a  little bed in the centre that looked bythebye like a grave   the taste and ingenuity he had displayed in everything were most  extraordinary and yet a more dejected heartbroken wretched  creature it would be difficult to imagine  i never saw such a  picture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind  my heart bled  for him and when the tears ran down his cheeks and he took one of  the visitors aside to ask with his trembling hands nervously  clutching at his coat to detain him whether there was no hope of  his dismal sentence being commuted the spectacle was really too  painful to witness  i never saw or heard of any kind of misery  that impressed me more than the wretchedness of this man  in a third cell was a tall strong black a burglar working at  his proper trade of making screws and the like  his time was  nearly out  he was not only a very dexterous thief but was  notorious for his boldness and hardihood and for the number of his  previous convictions  he entertained us with a long account of his  achievements which he narrated with such infinite relish that he  actually seemed to lick his lips as he told us racy anecdotes of  stolen plate and of old ladies whom he had watched as they sat at  windows in silver spectacles he had plainly had an eye to their  metal even from the other side of the street and had afterwards  robbed  this fellow upon the slightest encouragement would have  mingled with his professional recollections the most detestable  cant but i am very much mistaken if he could have surpassed the  unmitigated hypocrisy with which he declared that he blessed the  day on which he came into that prison and that he never would  commit another robbery as long as he lived  there was one man who was allowed as an indulgence to keep  rabbits  his room having rather a close smell in consequence they  called to him at the door to come out into the passage  he  complied of course and stood shading his haggard face in the  unwonted sunlight of the great window looking as wan and unearthly  as if he had been summoned from the grave  he had a white rabbit  in his breast and when the little creature getting down upon the  ground stole back into the cell and he being dismissed crept  timidly after it i thought it would have been very hard to say in  what respect the man was the nobler animal of the two  there was an english thief who had been there but a few days out  of seven years  a villainous lowbrowed thinlipped fellow with  a white face who had as yet no relish for visitors and who but  for the additional penalty would have gladly stabbed me with his  shoemakers knife  there was another german who had entered the  jail but yesterday and who started from his bed when we looked in  and pleaded in his broken english very hard for work  there was  a poet who after doing two days work in every fourandtwenty  hours one for himself and one for the prison wrote verses about  ships he was by trade a mariner and the maddening winecup  and his friends at home  there were very many of them  some  reddened at the sight of visitors and some turned very pale  some  two or three had prisoner nurses with them for they were very  sick and one a fat old negro whose leg had been taken off within  the jail had for his attendant a classical scholar and an  accomplished surgeon himself a prisoner likewise  sitting upon  the stairs engaged in some slight work was a pretty coloured boy   is there no refuge for young criminals in philadelphia then  said i  yes but only for white children  noble aristocracy in  crime  there was a sailor who had been there upwards of eleven years and  who in a few months time would be free  eleven years of solitary  confinement  i am very glad to hear your time is nearly out  what does he  say  nothing  why does he stare at his hands and pick the flesh  upon his fingers and raise his eyes for an instant every now and  then to those bare walls which have seen his head turn grey  it  is a way he has sometimes  does he never look men in the face and does he always pluck at  those hands of his as though he were bent on parting skin and  bone  it is his humour  nothing more  it is his humour too to say that he does not look forward to going  out that he is not glad the time is drawing near that he did look  forward to it once but that was very long ago that he has lost  all care for everything  it is his humour to be a helpless  crushed and broken man  and heaven be his witness that he has  his humour thoroughly gratified  there were three young women in adjoining cells all convicted at  the same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor  in the  silence and solitude of their lives they had grown to be quite  beautiful  their looks were very sad and might have moved the  sternest visitor to tears but not to that kind of sorrow which the  contemplation of the men awakens  one was a young girl not  twenty as i recollect whose snowwhite room was hung with the  work of some former prisoner and upon whose downcast face the sun  in all its splendour shone down through the high chink in the wall  where one narrow strip of bright blue sky was visible  she was  very penitent and quiet had come to be resigned she said and i  believe her and had a mind at peace  in a word you are happy  here said one of my companions  she struggled  she did struggle  very hard  to answer yes but raising her eyes and meeting that  glimpse of freedom overhead she burst into tears and said she  tried to be she uttered no complaint but it was natural that she  should sometimes long to go out of that one cell  she could not  help that she sobbed poor thing  i went from cell to cell that day and every face i saw or word i  heard or incident i noted is present to my mind in all its  painfulness  but let me pass them by for one more pleasant  glance of a prison on the same plan which i afterwards saw at  pittsburg  when i had gone over that in the same manner i asked the governor  if he had any person in his charge who was shortly going out  he  had one he said whose time was up next day but he had only been  a prisoner two years  two years  i looked back through two years of my own life  out of  jail prosperous happy surrounded by blessings comforts good  fortune  and thought how wide a gap it was and how long those two  years passed in solitary captivity would have been  i have the  face of this man who was going to be released next day before me  now  it is almost more memorable in its happiness than the other  faces in their misery  how easy and how natural it was for him to  say that the system was a good one and that the time went pretty  quick  considering and that when a man once felt that he had  offended the law and must satisfy it he got along somehow and  so forth  what did he call you back to say to you in that strange flutter  i asked of my conductor when he had locked the door and joined me  in the passage  oh  that he was afraid the soles of his boots were not fit for  walking as they were a good deal worn when he came in and that he  would thank me very much to have them mended ready  those boots had been taken off his feet and put away with the rest  of his clothes two years before  i took that opportunity of inquiring how they conducted themselves  immediately before going out adding that i presumed they trembled  very much  well its not so much a trembling was the answer  though they  do quiver  as a complete derangement of the nervous system  they  cant sign their names to the book sometimes cant even hold the  pen look about em without appearing to know why or where they  are and sometimes get up and sit down again twenty times in a  minute  this is when theyre in the office where they are taken  with the hood on as they were brought in  when they get outside  the gate they stop and look first one way and then the other not  knowing which to take  sometimes they stagger as if they were  drunk and sometimes are forced to lean against the fence theyre  so bad but they clear off in course of time  as i walked among these solitary cells and looked at the faces of  the men within them i tried to picture to myself the thoughts and  feelings natural to their condition  i imagined the hood just  taken off and the scene of their captivity disclosed to them in  all its dismal monotony  at first the man is stunned  his confinement is a hideous vision  and his old life a reality  he throws himself upon his bed and  lies there abandoned to despair  by degrees the insupportable  solitude and barrenness of the place rouses him from this stupor  and when the trap in his grated door is opened he humbly begs and  prays for work  give me some work to do or i shall go raving  mad  he has it and by fits and starts applies himself to labour but  every now and then there comes upon him a burning sense of the  years that must be wasted in that stone coffin and an agony so  piercing in the recollection of those who are hidden from his view  and knowledge that he starts from his seat and striding up and  down the narrow room with both hands clasped on his uplifted head  hears spirits tempting him to beat his brains out on the wall  again he falls upon his bed and lies there moaning  suddenly he  starts up wondering whether any other man is near whether there  is another cell like that on either side of him  and listens  keenly  there is no sound but other prisoners may be near for all that   he remembers to have heard once when he little thought of coming  here himself that the cells were so constructed that the prisoners  could not hear each other though the officers could hear them  where is the nearest man  upon the right or on the left or is  there one in both directions  where is he sitting now  with his  face to the light or is he walking to and fro  how is he dressed   has he been here long  is he much worn away  is he very white and  spectrelike  does he think of his neighbour too  scarcely venturing to breathe and listening while he thinks he  conjures up a figure with his back towards him and imagines it  moving about in this next cell  he has no idea of the face but he  is certain of the dark form of a stooping man  in the cell upon  the other side he puts another figure whose face is hidden from  him also  day after day and often when he wakes up in the middle  of the night he thinks of these two men until he is almost  distracted  he never changes them  there they are always as he  first imagined them  an old man on the right a younger man upon  the left  whose hidden features torture him to death and have a  mystery that makes him tremble  the weary days pass on with solemn pace like mourners at a  funeral and slowly he begins to feel that the white walls of the  cell have something dreadful in them  that their colour is  horrible  that their smooth surface chills his blood  that there  is one hateful corner which torments him  every morning when he  wakes he hides his head beneath the coverlet and shudders to see  the ghastly ceiling looking down upon him  the blessed light of  day itself peeps in an ugly phantom face through the unchangeable  crevice which is his prison window  by slow but sure degrees the terrors of that hateful corner swell  until they beset him at all times invade his rest make his dreams  hideous and his nights dreadful  at first he took a strange  dislike to it feeling as though it gave birth in his brain to  something of corresponding shape which ought not to be there and  racked his head with pains  then he began to fear it then to  dream of it and of men whispering its name and pointing to it   then he could not bear to look at it nor yet to turn his back upon  it  now it is every night the lurkingplace of a ghost  a  shadow a silent something horrible to see but whether bird or  beast or muffled human shape he cannot tell  when he is in his cell by day he fears the little yard without   when he is in the yard he dreads to reenter the cell  when night  comes there stands the phantom in the corner  if he have the  courage to stand in its place and drive it out he had once   being desperate it broods upon his bed  in the twilight and  always at the same hour a voice calls to him by name as the  darkness thickens his loom begins to live and even that his  comfort is a hideous figure watching him till daybreak  again by slow degrees these horrible fancies depart from him one  by one  returning sometimes unexpectedly but at longer  intervals and in less alarming shapes  he has talked upon  religious matters with the gentleman who visits him and has read  his bible and has written a prayer upon his slate and hung it up  as a kind of protection and an assurance of heavenly  companionship  he dreams now sometimes of his children or his  wife but is sure that they are dead or have deserted him  he is  easily moved to tears is gentle submissive and brokenspirited   occasionally the old agony comes back  a very little thing will  revive it even a familiar sound or the scent of summer flowers in  the air but it does not last long now  for the world without  has come to be the vision and this solitary life the sad reality  if his term of imprisonment be short  i mean comparatively for  short it cannot be  the last half year is almost worse than all  for then he thinks the prison will take fire and he be burnt in the  ruins or that he is doomed to die within the walls or that he  will be detained on some false charge and sentenced for another  term  or that something no matter what must happen to prevent  his going at large  and this is natural and impossible to be  reasoned against because after his long separation from human  life and his great suffering any event will appear to him more  probable in the contemplation than the being restored to liberty  and his fellowcreatures  if his period of confinement have been very long the prospect of  release bewilders and confuses him  his broken heart may flutter  for a moment when he thinks of the world outside and what it  might have been to him in all those lonely years but that is all   the celldoor has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares   better to have hanged him in the beginning than bring him to this  pass and send him forth to mingle with his kind who are his kind  no more  on the haggard face of every man among these prisoners the same  expression sat  i know not what to liken it to  it had something  of that strained attention which we see upon the faces of the blind  and deaf mingled with a kind of horror as though they had all  been secretly terrified  in every little chamber that i entered  and at every grate through which i looked i seemed to see the same  appalling countenance  it lives in my memory with the fascination  of a remarkable picture  parade before my eyes a hundred men  with one among them newly released from this solitary suffering  and i would point him out  the faces of the women as i have said it humanises and refines   whether this be because of their better nature which is elicited  in solitude or because of their being gentler creatures of  greater patience and longer suffering i do not know but so it is   that the punishment is nevertheless to my thinking fully as cruel  and as wrong in their case as in that of the men i need scarcely  add  my firm conviction is that independent of the mental anguish it  occasions  an anguish so acute and so tremendous that all  imagination of it must fall far short of the reality  it wears the  mind into a morbid state which renders it unfit for the rough  contact and busy action of the world  it is my fixed opinion that  those who have undergone this punishment must pass into society  again morally unhealthy and diseased  there are many instances on  record of men who have chosen or have been condemned to lives of  perfect solitude but i scarcely remember one even among sages of  strong and vigorous intellect where its effect has not become  apparent in some disordered train of thought or some gloomy  hallucination  what monstrous phantoms bred of despondency and  doubt and born and reared in solitude have stalked upon the  earth making creation ugly and darkening the face of heaven  suicides are rare among these prisoners  are almost indeed  unknown  but no argument in favour of the system can reasonably  be deduced from this circumstance although it is very often urged   all men who have made diseases of the mind their study know  perfectly well that such extreme depression and despair as will  change the whole character and beat down all its powers of  elasticity and selfresistance may be at work within a man and  yet stop short of selfdestruction  this is a common case  that it makes the senses dull and by degrees impairs the bodily  faculties i am quite sure  i remarked to those who were with me  in this very establishment at philadelphia that the criminals who  had been there long were deaf  they who were in the habit of  seeing these men constantly were perfectly amazed at the idea  which they regarded as groundless and fanciful  and yet the very  first prisoner to whom they appealed  one of their own selection  confirmed my impression which was unknown to him instantly and  said with a genuine air it was impossible to doubt that he  couldnt think how it happened but he was growing very dull of  hearing  that it is a singularly unequal punishment and affects the worst  man least there is no doubt  in its superior efficiency as a  means of reformation compared with that other code of regulations  which allows the prisoners to work in company without communicating  together i have not the smallest faith  all the instances of  reformation that were mentioned to me were of a kind that might  have been  and i have no doubt whatever in my own mind would  have been  equally well brought about by the silent system  with  regard to such men as the negro burglar and the english thief even  the most enthusiastic have scarcely any hope of their conversion  it seems to me that the objection that nothing wholesome or good  has ever had its growth in such unnatural solitude and that even a  dog or any of the more intelligent among beasts would pine and  mope and rust away beneath its influence would be in itself a  sufficient argument against this system  but when we recollect in  addition how very cruel and severe it is and that a solitary life  is always liable to peculiar and distinct objections of a most  deplorable nature which have arisen here and call to mind  moreover that the choice is not between this system and a bad or  illconsidered one but between it and another which has worked  well and is in its whole design and practice excellent there is  surely more than sufficient reason for abandoning a mode of  punishment attended by so little hope or promise and fraught  beyond dispute with such a host of evils  as a relief to its contemplation i will close this chapter with a  curious story arising out of the same theme which was related to  me on the occasion of this visit by some of the gentlemen  concerned  at one of the periodical meetings of the inspectors of this prison  a working man of philadelphia presented himself before the board  and earnestly requested to be placed in solitary confinement  on  being asked what motive could possibly prompt him to make this  strange demand he answered that he had an irresistible propensity  to get drunk that he was constantly indulging it to his great  misery and ruin that he had no power of resistance that he wished  to be put beyond the reach of temptation and that he could think  of no better way than this  it was pointed out to him in reply  that the prison was for criminals who had been tried and sentenced  by the law and could not be made available for any such fanciful  purposes he was exhorted to abstain from intoxicating drinks as  he surely might if he would and received other very good advice  with which he retired exceedingly dissatisfied with the result of  his application  he came again and again and again and was so very earnest and  importunate that at last they took counsel together and said he  will certainly qualify himself for admission if we reject him any  more  let us shut him up  he will soon be glad to go away and  then we shall get rid of him  so they made him sign a statement  which would prevent his ever sustaining an action for false  imprisonment to the effect that his incarceration was voluntary  and of his own seeking they requested him to take notice that the  officer in attendance had orders to release him at any hour of the  day or night when he might knock upon his door for that purpose  but desired him to understand that once going out he would not be  admitted any more  these conditions agreed upon and he still  remaining in the same mind he was conducted to the prison and  shut up in one of the cells  in this cell the man who had not the firmness to leave a glass of  liquor standing untasted on a table before him  in this cell in  solitary confinement and working every day at his trade of  shoemaking this man remained nearly two years  his health  beginning to fail at the expiration of that time the surgeon  recommended that he should work occasionally in the garden and as  he liked the notion very much he went about this new occupation  with great cheerfulness  he was digging here one summer day very industriously when the  wicket in the outer gate chanced to be left open  showing beyond  the wellremembered dusty road and sunburnt fields  the way was as  free to him as to any man living but he no sooner raised his head  and caught sight of it all shining in the light than with the  involuntary instinct of a prisoner he cast away his spade  scampered off as fast as his legs would carry him and never once  looked back    chapter viii  washington  the legislature  and the presidents  house    we left philadelphia by steamboat at six oclock one very cold  morning and turned our faces towards washington  in the course of this days journey as on subsequent occasions we  encountered some englishmen small farmers perhaps or country  publicans at home who were settled in america and were travelling  on their own affairs  of all grades and kinds of men that jostle  one in the public conveyances of the states these are often the  most intolerable and the most insufferable companions  united to  every disagreeable characteristic that the worst kind of american  travellers possess these countrymen of ours display an amount of  insolent conceit and cool assumption of superiority quite  monstrous to behold  in the coarse familiarity of their approach  and the effrontery of their inquisitiveness which they are in  great haste to assert as if they panted to revenge themselves upon  the decent old restraints of home they surpass any native  specimens that came within my range of observation  and i often  grew so patriotic when i saw and heard them that i would  cheerfully have submitted to a reasonable fine if i could have  given any other country in the whole world the honour of claiming  them for its children  as washington may be called the headquarters of tobaccotinctured  saliva the time is come when i must confess without any disguise  that the prevalence of those two odious practices of chewing and  expectorating began about this time to be anything but agreeable  and soon became most offensive and sickening  in all the public  places of america this filthy custom is recognised  in the courts  of law the judge has his spittoon the crier his the witness his  and the prisoner his while the jurymen and spectators are provided  for as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit  incessantly  in the hospitals the students of medicine are  requested by notices upon the wall to eject their tobacco juice  into the boxes provided for that purpose and not to discolour the  stairs  in public buildings visitors are implored through the  same agency to squirt the essence of their quids or plugs as i  have heard them called by gentlemen learned in this kind of  sweetmeat into the national spittoons and not about the bases of  the marble columns  but in some parts this custom is inseparably  mixed up with every meal and morning call and with all the  transactions of social life  the stranger who follows in the  track i took myself will find it in its full bloom and glory  luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness at washington  and let  him not persuade himself as i once did to my shame that previous  tourists have exaggerated its extent  the thing itself is an  exaggeration of nastiness which cannot be outdone  on board this steamboat there were two young gentlemen with  shirtcollars reversed as usual and armed with very big walking sticks who planted two seats in the middle of the deck at a  distance of some four paces apart took out their tobaccoboxes  and sat down opposite each other to chew  in less than a quarter  of an hours time these hopeful youths had shed about them on the  clean boards a copious shower of yellow rain clearing by that  means a kind of magic circle within whose limits no intruders  dared to come and which they never failed to refresh and re refresh before a spot was dry  this being before breakfast rather  disposed me i confess to nausea but looking attentively at one  of the expectorators i plainly saw that he was young in chewing  and felt inwardly uneasy himself  a glow of delight came over me  at this discovery and as i marked his face turn paler and paler  and saw the ball of tobacco in his left cheek quiver with his  suppressed agony while yet he spat and chewed and spat again in  emulation of his older friend i could have fallen on his neck and  implored him to go on for hours  we all sat down to a comfortable breakfast in the cabin below  where there was no more hurry or confusion than at such a meal in  england and where there was certainly greater politeness exhibited  than at most of our stagecoach banquets  at about nine oclock we  arrived at the railroad station and went on by the cars  at noon  we turned out again to cross a wide river in another steamboat  landed at a continuation of the railroad on the opposite shore and  went on by other cars in which in the course of the next hour or  so we crossed by wooden bridges each a mile in length two  creeks called respectively great and little gunpowder  the water  in both was blackened with flights of canvasbacked ducks which  are most delicious eating and abound hereabouts at that season of  the year  these bridges are of wood have no parapet and are only just wide  enough for the passage of the trains which in the event of the  smallest accident wound inevitably be plunged into the river   they are startling contrivances and are most agreeable when  passed  we stopped to dine at baltimore and being now in maryland were  waited on for the first time by slaves  the sensation of  exacting any service from human creatures who are bought and sold  and being for the time a party as it were to their condition is  not an enviable one  the institution exists perhaps in its least  repulsive and most mitigated form in such a town as this but it is  slavery and though i was with respect to it an innocent man its  presence filled me with a sense of shame and selfreproach  after dinner we went down to the railroad again and took our  seats in the cars for washington  being rather early those men  and boys who happened to have nothing particular to do and were  curious in foreigners came according to custom round the  carriage in which i sat let down all the windows thrust in their  heads and shoulders hooked themselves on conveniently by their  elbows and fell to comparing notes on the subject of my personal  appearance with as much indifference as if i were a stuffed  figure  i never gained so much uncompromising information with  reference to my own nose and eyes and various impressions wrought  by my mouth and chin on different minds and how my head looks when  it is viewed from behind as on these occasions  some gentlemen  were only satisfied by exercising their sense of touch and the  boys who are surprisingly precocious in america were seldom  satisfied even by that but would return to the charge over and  over again  many a budding president has walked into my room with  his cap on his head and his hands in his pockets and stared at me  for two whole hours  occasionally refreshing himself with a tweak  of his nose or a draught from the waterjug or by walking to the  windows and inviting other boys in the street below to come up and  do likewise  crying here he is  come on  bring all your  brothers with other hospitable entreaties of that nature  we reached washington at about halfpast six that evening and had  upon the way a beautiful view of the capitol which is a fine  building of the corinthian order placed upon a noble and  commanding eminence  arrived at the hotel i saw no more of the  place that night being very tired and glad to get to bed  breakfast over next morning i walk about the streets for an hour  or two and coming home throw up the window in the front and  back and look out  here is washington fresh in my mind and under  my eye  take the worst parts of the city road and pentonville or the  straggling outskirts of paris where the houses are smallest  preserving all their oddities but especially the small shops and  dwellings occupied in pentonville but not in washington by  furniturebrokers keepers of poor eatinghouses and fanciers of  birds  burn the whole down build it up again in wood and plaster  widen it a little throw in part of st johns wood put green  blinds outside all the private houses with a red curtain and a  white one in every window plough up all the roads plant a great  deal of coarse turf in every place where it ought not to be erect  three handsome buildings in stone and marble anywhere but the  more entirely out of everybodys way the better call one the post  office one the patent office and one the treasury make it  scorching hot in the morning and freezing cold in the afternoon  with an occasional tornado of wind and dust leave a brickfield  without the bricks in all central places where a street may  naturally be expected  and thats washington  the hotel in which we live is a long row of small houses fronting  on the street and opening at the back upon a common yard in which  hangs a great triangle  whenever a servant is wanted somebody  beats on this triangle from one stroke up to seven according to  the number of the house in which his presence is required and as  all the servants are always being wanted and none of them ever  come this enlivening engine is in full performance the whole day  through  clothes are drying in the same yard female slaves with  cotton handkerchiefs twisted round their heads are running to and  fro on the hotel business black waiters cross and recross with  dishes in their hands two great dogs are playing upon a mound of  loose bricks in the centre of the little square a pig is turning  up his stomach to the sun and grunting thats comfortable and  neither the men nor the women nor the dogs nor the pig nor any  created creature takes the smallest notice of the triangle which  is tingling madly all the time  i walk to the front window and look across the road upon a long  straggling row of houses one story high terminating nearly  opposite but a little to the left in a melancholy piece of waste  ground with frowzy grass which looks like a small piece of country  that has taken to drinking and has quite lost itself  standing  anyhow and all wrong upon this open space like something meteoric  that has fallen down from the moon is an odd lopsided oneeyed  kind of wooden building that looks like a church with a flag staff as long as itself sticking out of a steeple something larger  than a teachest  under the window is a small stand of coaches  whose slavedrivers are sunning themselves on the steps of our  door and talking idly together  the three most obtrusive houses  near at hand are the three meanest  on one  a shop which never  has anything in the window and never has the door open  is  painted in large characters the city lunch  at another which  looks like a backway to somewhere else but is an independent  building in itself oysters are procurable in every style  at the  third which is a very very little tailors shop pants are fixed  to order or in other words pantaloons are made to measure  and  that is our street in washington  it is sometimes called the city of magnificent distances but it  might with greater propriety be termed the city of magnificent  intentions for it is only on taking a birdseye view of it from  the top of the capitol that one can at all comprehend the vast  designs of its projector an aspiring frenchman  spacious avenues  that begin in nothing and lead nowhere streets milelong that  only want houses roads and inhabitants public buildings that need  but a public to be complete and ornaments of great thoroughfares  which only lack great thoroughfares to ornament  are its leading  features  one might fancy the season over and most of the houses  gone out of town for ever with their masters  to the admirers of  cities it is a barmecide feast  a pleasant field for the  imagination to rove in a monument raised to a deceased project  with not even a legible inscription to record its departed  greatness  such as it is it is likely to remain  it was originally chosen  for the seat of government as a means of averting the conflicting  jealousies and interests of the different states and very  probably too as being remote from mobs  a consideration not to  be slighted even in america  it has no trade or commerce of its  own  having little or no population beyond the president and his  establishment the members of the legislature who reside there  during the session the government clerks and officers employed in  the various departments the keepers of the hotels and boarding houses and the tradesmen who supply their tables  it is very  unhealthy  few people would live in washington i take it who  were not obliged to reside there and the tides of emigration and  speculation those rapid and regardless currents are little likely  to flow at any time towards such dull and sluggish water  the principal features of the capitol are of course the two  houses of assembly  but there is besides in the centre of the  building a fine rotunda ninetysix feet in diameter and ninety six high whose circular wall is divided into compartments  ornamented by historical pictures  four of these have for their  subjects prominent events in the revolutionary struggle  they were  painted by colonel trumbull himself a member of washingtons staff  at the time of their occurrence from which circumstance they  derive a peculiar interest of their own  in this same hall mr  greenoughs large statue of washington has been lately placed  it  has great merits of course but it struck me as being rather  strained and violent for its subject  i could wish however to  have seen it in a better light than it can ever be viewed in where  it stands  there is a very pleasant and commodious library in the capitol and  from a balcony in front the birdseye view of which i have just  spoken may be had together with a beautiful prospect of the  adjacent country  in one of the ornamented portions of the  building there is a figure of justice whereunto the guide book  says the artist at first contemplated giving more of nudity but  he was warned that the public sentiment in this country would not  admit of it and in his caution he has gone perhaps into the  opposite extreme  poor justice she has been made to wear much  stranger garments in america than those she pines in in the  capitol  let us hope that she has changed her dressmaker since  they were fashioned and that the public sentiment of the country  did not cut out the clothes she hides her lovely figure in just  now  the house of representatives is a beautiful and spacious hall of  semicircular shape supported by handsome pillars  one part of the  gallery is appropriated to the ladies and there they sit in front  rows and come in and go out as at a play or concert  the chair  is canopied and raised considerably above the floor of the house  and every member has an easy chair and a writing desk to himself   which is denounced by some people out of doors as a most  unfortunate and injudicious arrangement tending to long sittings  and prosaic speeches  it is an elegant chamber to look at but a  singularly bad one for all purposes of hearing  the senate which  is smaller is free from this objection and is exceedingly well  adapted to the uses for which it is designed  the sittings i need  hardly add take place in the day and the parliamentary forms are  modelled on those of the old country  i was sometimes asked in my progress through other places whether  i had not been very much impressed by the heads of the lawmakers at  washington meaning not their chiefs and leaders but literally  their individual and personal heads whereon their hair grew and  whereby the phrenological character of each legislator was  expressed  and i almost as often struck my questioner dumb with  indignant consternation by answering no that i didnt remember  being at all overcome  as i must at whatever hazard repeat the  avowal here i will follow it up by relating my impressions on this  subject in as few words as possible  in the first place  it may be from some imperfect development of  my organ of veneration  i do not remember having ever fainted  away or having even been moved to tears of joyful pride at sight  of any legislative body  i have borne the house of commons like a  man and have yielded to no weakness but slumber in the house of  lords  i have seen elections for borough and county and have  never been impelled no matter which party won to damage my hat by  throwing it up into the air in triumph or to crack my voice by  shouting forth any reference to our glorious constitution to the  noble purity of our independent voters or the unimpeachable  integrity of our independent members  having withstood such strong  attacks upon my fortitude it is possible that i may be of a cold  and insensible temperament amounting to iciness in such matters  and therefore my impressions of the live pillars of the capitol at  washington must be received with such grains of allowance as this  free confession may seem to demand  did i see in this public body an assemblage of men bound together  in the sacred names of liberty and freedom and so asserting the  chaste dignity of those twin goddesses in all their discussions  as to exalt at once the eternal principles to which their names are  given and their own character and the character of their  countrymen in the admiring eyes of the whole world  it was but a week since an aged greyhaired man a lasting honour  to the land that gave him birth who has done good service to his  country as his forefathers did and who will be remembered scores  upon scores of years after the worms bred in its corruption are  but so many grains of dust  it was but a week since this old man  had stood for days upon his trial before this very body charged  with having dared to assert the infamy of that traffic which has  for its accursed merchandise men and women and their unborn  children  yes  and publicly exhibited in the same city all the  while gilded framed and glazed hung up for general admiration  shown to strangers not with shame but pride its face not turned  towards the wall itself not taken down and burned is the  unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america  which solemnly declares that all men are created equal and are  endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  it was not a month since this same body had sat calmly by and  heard a man one of themselves with oaths which beggars in their  drink reject threaten to cut anothers throat from ear to ear   there he sat among them not crushed by the general feeling of the  assembly but as good a man as any  there was but a week to come and another of that body for doing  his duty to those who sent him there for claiming in a republic  the liberty and freedom of expressing their sentiments and making  known their prayer would be tried found guilty and have strong  censure passed upon him by the rest  his was a grave offence  indeed for years before he had risen up and said a gang of male  and female slaves for sale warranted to breed like cattle linked  to each other by iron fetters are passing now along the open  street beneath the windows of your temple of equality  look  but  there are many kinds of hunters engaged in the pursuit of  happiness and they go variously armed  it is the inalienable  right of some among them to take the field after their happiness  equipped with cat and cartwhip stocks and iron collar and to  shout their view halloa always in praise of liberty to the music  of clanking chains and bloody stripes  where sat the many legislators of coarse threats of words and  blows such as coalheavers deal upon each other when they forget  their breeding  on every side  every session had its anecdotes of  that kind and the actors were all there  did i recognise in this assembly a body of men who applying  themselves in a new world to correct some of the falsehoods and  vices of the old purified the avenues to public life paved the  dirty ways to place and power debated and made laws for the common  good and had no party but their country  i saw in them the wheels that move the meanest perversion of  virtuous political machinery that the worst tools ever wrought   despicable trickery at elections underhanded tamperings with  public officers cowardly attacks upon opponents with scurrilous  newspapers for shields and hired pens for daggers shameful  trucklings to mercenary knaves whose claim to be considered is  that every day and week they sow new crops of ruin with their venal  types which are the dragons teeth of yore in everything but  sharpness aidings and abettings of every bad inclination in the  popular mind and artful suppressions of all its good influences   such things as these and in a word dishonest faction in its most  depraved and most unblushing form stared out from every corner of  the crowded hall  did i see among them the intelligence and refinement  the true  honest patriotic heart of america  here and there were drops of  its blood and life but they scarcely coloured the stream of  desperate adventurers which sets that way for profit and for pay   it is the game of these men and of their profligate organs to  make the strife of politics so fierce and brutal and so  destructive of all selfrespect in worthy men that sensitive and  delicateminded persons shall be kept aloof and they and such as  they be left to battle out their selfish views unchecked  and  thus this lowest of all scrambling fights goes on and they who in  other countries would from their intelligence and station most  aspire to make the laws do here recoil the farthest from that  degradation  that there are among the representatives of the people in both  houses and among all parties some men of high character and great  abilities i need not say  the foremost among those politicians  who are known in europe have been already described and i see no  reason to depart from the rule i have laid down for my guidance of  abstaining from all mention of individuals  it will be sufficient  to add that to the most favourable accounts that have been written  of them i more than fully and most heartily subscribe and that  personal intercourse and free communication have bred within me  not the result predicted in the very doubtful proverb but  increased admiration and respect  they are striking men to look  at hard to deceive prompt to act lions in energy crichtons in  varied accomplishments indians in fire of eye and gesture  americans in strong and generous impulse and they as well  represent the honour and wisdom of their country at home as the  distinguished gentleman who is now its minister at the british  court sustains its highest character abroad  i visited both houses nearly every day during my stay in  washington  on my initiatory visit to the house of  representatives they divided against a decision of the chair but  the chair won  the second time i went the member who was  speaking being interrupted by a laugh mimicked it as one child  would in quarrelling with another and added that he would make  honourable gentlemen opposite sing out a little more on the other  side of their mouths presently  but interruptions are rare the  speaker being usually heard in silence  there are more quarrels  than with us and more threatenings than gentlemen are accustomed  to exchange in any civilised society of which we have record  but  farmyard imitations have not as yet been imported from the  parliament of the united kingdom  the feature in oratory which  appears to be the most practised and most relished is the  constant repetition of the same idea or shadow of an idea in fresh  words and the inquiry out of doors is not what did he say but  how long did he speak  these however are but enlargements of a  principle which prevails elsewhere  the senate is a dignified and decorous body and its proceedings  are conducted with much gravity and order  both houses are  handsomely carpeted but the state to which these carpets are  reduced by the universal disregard of the spittoon with which every  honourable member is accommodated and the extraordinary  improvements on the pattern which are squirted and dabbled upon it  in every direction do not admit of being described  i will merely  observe that i strongly recommend all strangers not to look at the  floor and if they happen to drop anything though it be their  purse not to pick it up with an ungloved hand on any account  it is somewhat remarkable too at first to say the least to see  so many honourable members with swelled faces and it is scarcely  less remarkable to discover that this appearance is caused by the  quantity of tobacco they contrive to stow within the hollow of the  cheek  it is strange enough too to see an honourable gentleman  leaning back in his tilted chair with his legs on the desk before  him shaping a convenient plug with his penknife and when it is  quite ready for use shooting the old one from his mouth as from a  popgun and clapping the new one in its place  i was surprised to observe that even steady old chewers of great  experience are not always good marksmen which has rather inclined  me to doubt that general proficiency with the rifle of which we  have heard so much in england  several gentlemen called upon me  who in the course of conversation frequently missed the spittoon  at five paces and one but he was certainly shortsighted mistook  the closed sash for the open window at three  on another  occasion when i dined out and was sitting with two ladies and  some gentlemen round a fire before dinner one of the company fell  short of the fireplace six distinct times  i am disposed to  think however that this was occasioned by his not aiming at that  object as there was a white marble hearth before the fender which  was more convenient and may have suited his purpose better  the patent office at washington furnishes an extraordinary example  of american enterprise and ingenuity for the immense number of  models it contains are the accumulated inventions of only five  years the whole of the previous collection having been destroyed  by fire  the elegant structure in which they are arranged is one  of design rather than execution for there is but one side erected  out of four though the works are stopped  the post office is a  very compact and very beautiful building  in one of the  departments among a collection of rare and curious articles are  deposited the presents which have been made from time to time to  the american ambassadors at foreign courts by the various  potentates to whom they were the accredited agents of the republic  gifts which by the law they are not permitted to retain  i confess  that i looked upon this as a very painful exhibition and one by no  means flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour   that can scarcely be a high state of moral feeling which imagines a  gentleman of repute and station likely to be corrupted in the  discharge of his duty by the present of a snuffbox or a richly mounted sword or an eastern shawl and surely the nation who  reposes confidence in her appointed servants is likely to be  better served than she who makes them the subject of such very  mean and paltry suspicions  at george town in the suburbs there is a jesuit college  delightfully situated and so far as i had an opportunity of  seeing well managed  many persons who are not members of the  romish church avail themselves i believe of these institutions  and of the advantageous opportunities they afford for the education  of their children  the heights of this neighbourhood above the  potomac river are very picturesque  and are free i should  conceive from some of the insalubrities of washington  the air  at that elevation was quite cool and refreshing when in the city  it was burning hot  the presidents mansion is more like an english clubhouse both  within and without than any other kind of establishment with which  i can compare it  the ornamental ground about it has been laid out  in garden walks they are pretty and agreeable to the eye though  they have that uncomfortable air of having been made yesterday  which is far from favourable to the display of such beauties  my first visit to this house was on the morning after my arrival  when i was carried thither by an official gentleman who was so  kind as to charge himself with my presentation to the president  we entered a large hall and having twice or thrice rung a bell  which nobody answered walked without further ceremony through the  rooms on the ground floor as divers other gentlemen mostly with  their hats on and their hands in their pockets were doing very  leisurely  some of these had ladies with them to whom they were  showing the premises others were lounging on the chairs and sofas  others in a perfect state of exhaustion from listlessness were  yawning drearily  the greater portion of this assemblage were  rather asserting their supremacy than doing anything else as they  had no particular business there that anybody knew of  a few were  closely eyeing the movables as if to make quite sure that the  president who was far from popular had not made away with any of  the furniture or sold the fixtures for his private benefit  after glancing at these loungers who were scattered over a pretty  drawingroom opening upon a terrace which commanded a beautiful  prospect of the river and the adjacent country and who were  sauntering too about a larger stateroom called the eastern  drawingroom we went upstairs into another chamber where were  certain visitors waiting for audiences  at sight of my conductor  a black in plain clothes and yellow slippers who was gliding  noiselessly about and whispering messages in the ears of the more  impatient made a sign of recognition and glided off to announce  him  we had previously looked into another chamber fitted all round with  a great bare wooden desk or counter whereon lay files of  newspapers to which sundry gentlemen were referring  but there  were no such means of beguiling the time in this apartment which  was as unpromising and tiresome as any waitingroom in one of our  public establishments or any physicians diningroom during his  hours of consultation at home  there were some fifteen or twenty persons in the room  one a  tall wiry muscular old man from the west sunburnt and swarthy  with a brown white hat on his knees and a giant umbrella resting  between his legs who sat bolt upright in his chair frowning  steadily at the carpet and twitching the hard lines about his  mouth as if he had made up his mind to fix the president on what  he had to say and wouldnt bate him a grain  another a kentucky  farmer sixfeetsix in height with his hat on and his hands  under his coattails who leaned against the wall and kicked the  floor with his heel as though he had times head under his shoe  and were literally killing him  a third an ovalfaced bilious looking man with sleek black hair cropped close and whiskers and  beard shaved down to blue dots who sucked the head of a thick  stick and from time to time took it out of his mouth to see how  it was getting on  a fourth did nothing but whistle  a fifth did  nothing but spit  and indeed all these gentlemen were so very  persevering and energetic in this latter particular and bestowed  their favours so abundantly upon the carpet that i take it for  granted the presidential housemaids have high wages or to speak  more genteelly an ample amount of compensation which is the  american word for salary in the case of all public servants  we had not waited in this room many minutes before the black  messenger returned and conducted us into another of smaller  dimensions where at a businesslike table covered with papers  sat the president himself  he looked somewhat worn and anxious  and well he might being at war with everybody  but the expression  of his face was mild and pleasant and his manner was remarkably  unaffected gentlemanly and agreeable  i thought that in his  whole carriage and demeanour he became his station singularly  well  being advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court  admitted of a traveller like myself declining without any  impropriety an invitation to dinner which did not reach me until  i had concluded my arrangements for leaving washington some days  before that to which it referred i only returned to this house  once  it was on the occasion of one of those general assemblies  which are held on certain nights between the hours of nine and  twelve oclock and are called rather oddly levees  i went with my wife at about ten  there was a pretty dense crowd  of carriages and people in the courtyard and so far as i could  make out there were no very clear regulations for the taking up or  setting down of company  there were certainly no policemen to  soothe startled horses either by sawing at their bridles or  flourishing truncheons in their eyes and i am ready to make oath  that no inoffensive persons were knocked violently on the head or  poked acutely in their backs or stomachs or brought to a  standstill by any such gentle means and then taken into custody  for not moving on  but there was no confusion or disorder  our  carriage reached the porch in its turn without any blustering  swearing shouting backing or other disturbance  and we  dismounted with as much ease and comfort as though we had been  escorted by the whole metropolitan force from a to z inclusive  the suite of rooms on the groundfloor were lighted up and a  military band was playing in the hall  in the smaller drawing room the centre of a circle of company were the president and his  daughterinlaw who acted as the lady of the mansion and a very  interesting graceful and accomplished lady too  one gentleman  who stood among this group appeared to take upon himself the  functions of a master of the ceremonies  i saw no other officers  or attendants and none were needed  the great drawingroom which i have already mentioned and the  other chambers on the groundfloor were crowded to excess  the  company was not in our sense of the term select for it  comprehended persons of very many grades and classes nor was there  any great display of costly attire  indeed some of the costumes  may have been for aught i know grotesque enough  but the decorum  and propriety of behaviour which prevailed were unbroken by any  rude or disagreeable incident and every man even among the  miscellaneous crowd in the hall who were admitted without any  orders or tickets to look on appeared to feel that he was a part  of the institution and was responsible for its preserving a  becoming character and appearing to the best advantage  that these visitors too whatever their station were not without  some refinement of taste and appreciation of intellectual gifts  and gratitude to those men who by the peaceful exercise of great  abilities shed new charms and associations upon the homes of their  countrymen and elevate their character in other lands was most  earnestly testified by their reception of washington irving my  dear friend who had recently been appointed minister at the court  of spain and who was among them that night in his new character  for the first and last time before going abroad  i sincerely  believe that in all the madness of american politics few public  men would have been so earnestly devotedly and affectionately  caressed as this most charming writer  and i have seldom  respected a public assembly more than i did this eager throng  when i saw them turning with one mind from noisy orators and  officers of state and flocking with a generous and honest impulse  round the man of quiet pursuits  proud in his promotion as  reflecting back upon their country  and grateful to him with their  whole hearts for the store of graceful fancies he had poured out  among them  long may he dispense such treasures with unsparing  hand and long may they remember him as worthily         the term we had assigned for the duration of our stay in washington  was now at an end and we were to begin to travel for the railroad  distances we had traversed yet in journeying among these older  towns are on that great continent looked upon as nothing  i had at first intended going south  to charleston  but when i  came to consider the length of time which this journey would  occupy and the premature heat of the season which even at  washington had been often very trying and weighed moreover in my  own mind the pain of living in the constant contemplation of  slavery against the more than doubtful chances of my ever seeing  it in the time i had to spare stripped of the disguises in which  it would certainly be dressed and so adding any item to the host  of facts already heaped together on the subject i began to listen  to old whisperings which had often been present to me at home in  england when i little thought of ever being here and to dream  again of cities growing up like palaces in fairy tales among the  wilds and forests of the west  the advice i received in most quarters when i began to yield to my  desire of travelling towards that point of the compass was  according to custom sufficiently cheerless  my companion being  threatened with more perils dangers and discomforts than i can  remember or would catalogue if i could but of which it will be  sufficient to remark that blowingsup in steamboats and breakings down in coaches were among the least  but having a western route  sketched out for me by the best and kindest authority to which i  could have resorted and putting no great faith in these  discouragements i soon determined on my plan of action  this was to travel south only to richmond in virginia and then to  turn and shape our course for the far west whither i beseech the  readers company in a new chapter    chapter ix  a night steamer on the potomac river  virginia road  and a black driver  richmond  baltimore  the harrisburg mail  and a glimpse of the city  a canal boat    we were to proceed in the first instance by steamboat and as it is  usual to sleep on board in consequence of the startinghour being  four oclock in the morning we went down to where she lay at that  very uncomfortable time for such expeditions when slippers are most  valuable and a familiar bed in the perspective of an hour or two  looks uncommonly pleasant  it is ten oclock at night  say halfpast ten  moonlight warm  and dull enough  the steamer not unlike a childs noahs ark in  form with the machinery on the top of the roof is riding lazily  up and down and bumping clumsily against the wooden pier as the  ripple of the river trifles with its unwieldy carcase  the wharf  is some distance from the city  there is nobody down here and one  or two dull lamps upon the steamers decks are the only signs of  life remaining when our coach has driven away  as soon as our  footsteps are heard upon the planks a fat negress particularly  favoured by nature in respect of bustle emerges from some dark  stairs and marshals my wife towards the ladies cabin to which  retreat she goes followed by a mighty bale of cloaks and great coats  i valiantly resolve not to go to bed at all but to walk up  and down the pier till morning  i begin my promenade  thinking of all kinds of distant things and  persons and of nothing near  and pace up and down for halfan hour  then i go on board again and getting into the light of one  of the lamps look at my watch and think it must have stopped and  wonder what has become of the faithful secretary whom i brought  along with me from boston  he is supping with our late landlord a  field marshal at least no doubt in honour of our departure and  may be two hours longer  i walk again but it gets duller and  duller  the moon goes down  next june seems farther off in the  dark and the echoes of my footsteps make me nervous  it has  turned cold too and walking up and down without my companion in  such lonely circumstances is but poor amusement  so i break my  staunch resolution and think it may be perhaps as well to go to  bed  i go on board again open the door of the gentlemens cabin and  walk in  somehow or other  from its being so quiet i suppose  i  have taken it into my head that there is nobody there  to my  horror and amazement it is full of sleepers in every stage shape  attitude and variety of slumber  in the berths on the chairs on  the floors on the tables and particularly round the stove my  detested enemy  i take another step forward and slip on the  shining face of a black steward who lies rolled in a blanket on  the floor  he jumps up grins half in pain and half in  hospitality whispers my own name in my ear and groping among the  sleepers leads me to my berth  standing beside it i count these  slumbering passengers and get past forty  there is no use in  going further so i begin to undress  as the chairs are all  occupied and there is nothing else to put my clothes on i deposit  them upon the ground  not without soiling my hands for it is in  the same condition as the carpets in the capitol and from the same  cause  having but partially undressed i clamber on my shelf and  hold the curtain open for a few minutes while i look round on all  my fellowtravellers again  that done i let it fall on them and  on the world  turn round  and go to sleep  i wake of course when we get under weigh for there is a good  deal of noise  the day is then just breaking  everybody wakes at  the same time  some are selfpossessed directly and some are much  perplexed to make out where they are until they have rubbed their  eyes and leaning on one elbow looked about them  some yawn some  groan nearly all spit and a few get up  i am among the risers   for it is easy to feel without going into the fresh air that the  atmosphere of the cabin is vile in the last degree  i huddle on my  clothes go down into the forecabin get shaved by the barber and  wash myself  the washing and dressing apparatus for the passengers  generally consists of two jacktowels three small wooden basins  a keg of water and a ladle to serve it out with six square inches  of lookingglass two ditto ditto of yellow soap a comb and brush  for the head and nothing for the teeth  everybody uses the comb  and brush except myself  everybody stares to see me using my own  and two or three gentlemen are strongly disposed to banter me on my  prejudices but dont  when i have made my toilet i go upon the  hurricanedeck and set in for two hours of hard walking up and  down  the sun is rising brilliantly we are passing mount vernon  where washington lies buried the river is wide and rapid and its  banks are beautiful  all the glory and splendour of the day are  coming on and growing brighter every minute  at eight oclock we breakfast in the cabin where i passed the  night but the windows and doors are all thrown open and now it is  fresh enough  there is no hurry or greediness apparent in the  despatch of the meal  it is longer than a travelling breakfast  with us more orderly and more polite  soon after nine oclock we come to potomac creek where we are to  land and then comes the oddest part of the journey  seven stage coaches are preparing to carry us on  some of them are ready some  of them are not ready  some of the drivers are blacks some  whites  there are four horses to each coach and all the horses  harnessed or unharnessed are there  the passengers are getting  out of the steamboat and into the coaches the luggage is being  transferred in noisy wheelbarrows the horses are frightened and  impatient to start the black drivers are chattering to them like  so many monkeys and the white ones whooping like so many drovers   for the main thing to be done in all kinds of hostlering here is  to make as much noise as possible  the coaches are something like  the french coaches but not nearly so good  in lieu of springs  they are hung on bands of the strongest leather  there is very  little choice or difference between them and they may be likened  to the car portion of the swings at an english fair roofed put  upon axletrees and wheels and curtained with painted canvas   they are covered with mud from the roof to the wheeltire and have  never been cleaned since they were first built  the tickets we have received on board the steamboat are marked no  1 so we belong to coach no 1  i throw my coat on the box and  hoist my wife and her maid into the inside  it has only one step  and that being about a yard from the ground is usually approached  by a chair  when there is no chair ladies trust in providence   the coach holds nine inside having a seat across from door to  door where we in england put our legs  so that there is only one  feat more difficult in the performance than getting in and that  is getting out again  there is only one outside passenger and he  sits upon the box  as i am that one i climb up and while they  are strapping the luggage on the roof and heaping it into a kind  of tray behind have a good opportunity of looking at the driver  he is a negro  very black indeed  he is dressed in a coarse  pepperandsalt suit excessively patched and darned particularly  at the knees grey stockings enormous unblacked highlow shoes  and very short trousers  he has two odd gloves  one of parti coloured worsted and one of leather  he has a very short whip  broken in the middle and bandaged up with string  and yet he wears  a lowcrowned broadbrimmed black hat  faintly shadowing forth a  kind of insane imitation of an english coachman  but somebody in  authority cries go ahead as i am making these observations  the  mail takes the lead in a fourhorse waggon and all the coaches  follow in procession  headed by no 1  by the way whenever an englishman would cry all right an  american cries go ahead which is somewhat expressive of the  national character of the two countries  the first halfmile of the road is over bridges made of loose  planks laid across two parallel poles which tilt up as the wheels  roll over them and in the river  the river has a clayey bottom  and is full of holes so that half a horse is constantly  disappearing unexpectedly and cant be found again for some time  but we get past even this and come to the road itself which is a  series of alternate swamps and gravelpits  a tremendous place is  close before us the black driver rolls his eyes screws his mouth  up very round and looks straight between the two leaders as if he  were saying to himself we have done this often before but now i  think we shall have a crash  he takes a rein in each hand jerks  and pulls at both and dances on the splashboard with both feet  keeping his seat of course like the late lamented ducrow on two  of his fiery coursers  we come to the spot sink down in the mire  nearly to the coach windows tilt on one side at an angle of forty five degrees and stick there  the insides scream dismally the  coach stops the horses flounder all the other six coaches stop  and their fourandtwenty horses flounder likewise  but merely for  company and in sympathy with ours  then the following  circumstances occur  black driver to the horses  hi  nothing happens  insides scream again  black driver to the horses  ho  horses plunge and splash the black driver  gentleman inside looking out  why what on airth   gentleman receives a variety of splashes and draws his head in  again without finishing his question or waiting for an answer  black driver still to the horses  jiddy  jiddy  horses pull violently drag the coach out of the hole and draw it  up a bank so steep that the black drivers legs fly up into the  air and he goes back among the luggage on the roof  but he  immediately recovers himself and cries still to the horses  pill  no effect  on the contrary the coach begins to roll back upon no  2 which rolls back upon no 3 which rolls back upon no 4 and so  on until no 7 is heard to curse and swear nearly a quarter of a  mile behind  black driver louder than before  pill  horses make another struggle to get up the bank and again the  coach rolls backward  black driver louder than before  peeeill  horses make a desperate struggle  black driver recovering spirits  hi jiddy jiddy pill  horses make another effort  black driver with great vigour  ally loo  hi  jiddy jiddy   pill  ally loo  horses almost do it  black driver with his eyes starting out of his head  lee den   lee dere  hi  jiddy jiddy  pill  ally loo  leeeeee  they run up the bank and go down again on the other side at a  fearful pace  it is impossible to stop them and at the bottom  there is a deep hollow full of water  the coach rolls  frightfully  the insides scream  the mud and water fly about us   the black driver dances like a madman  suddenly we are all right  by some extraordinary means and stop to breathe  a black friend of the black driver is sitting on a fence  the  black driver recognises him by twirling his head round and round  like a harlequin rolling his eyes shrugging his shoulders and  grinning from ear to ear  he stops short turns to me and says  we shall get you through sa like a fiddle and hope a please you  when we get you through sa  old ooman at home sa chuckling very  much  outside gentleman sa he often remember old ooman at home  sa grinning again  ay ay well take care of the old woman  dont be afraid  the black driver grins again but there is another hole and beyond  that another bank close before us  so he stops short  cries to  the horses again easy  easy den  ease  steady  hi  jiddy   pill  ally  loo but never lee until we are reduced to the  very last extremity and are in the midst of difficulties  extrication from which appears to be all but impossible  and so we do the ten miles or thereabouts in two hours and a half  breaking no bones though bruising a great many and in short  getting through the distance like a fiddle  this singular kind of coaching terminates at fredericksburgh  whence there is a railway to richmond  the tract of country  through which it takes its course was once productive but the soil  has been exhausted by the system of employing a great amount of  slave labour in forcing crops without strengthening the land  and  it is now little better than a sandy desert overgrown with trees   dreary and uninteresting as its aspect is i was glad to the heart  to find anything on which one of the curses of this horrible  institution has fallen and had greater pleasure in contemplating  the withered ground than the richest and most thriving cultivation  in the same place could possibly have afforded me  in this district as in all others where slavery sits brooding i  have frequently heard this admitted even by those who are its  warmest advocates there is an air of ruin and decay abroad which  is inseparable from the system  the barns and outhouses are  mouldering away the sheds are patched and half roofless the log  cabins built in virginia with external chimneys made of clay or  wood are squalid in the last degree  there is no look of decent  comfort anywhere  the miserable stations by the railway side the  great wild woodyards whence the engine is supplied with fuel the  negro children rolling on the ground before the cabin doors with  dogs and pigs the biped beasts of burden slinking past  gloom and  dejection are upon them all  in the negro car belonging to the train in which we made this  journey were a mother and her children who had just been  purchased the husband and father being left behind with their old  owner  the children cried the whole way and the mother was  miserys picture  the champion of life liberty and the pursuit  of happiness who had bought them rode in the same train and  every time we stopped got down to see that they were safe  the  black in sinbads travels with one eye in the middle of his  forehead which shone like a burning coal was natures aristocrat  compared with this white gentleman  it was between six and seven oclock in the evening when we drove  to the hotel  in front of which and on the top of the broad  flight of steps leading to the door two or three citizens were  balancing themselves on rockingchairs and smoking cigars  we  found it a very large and elegant establishment and were as well  entertained as travellers need desire to be  the climate being a  thirsty one there was never at any hour of the day a scarcity of  loungers in the spacious bar or a cessation of the mixing of cool  liquors  but they were a merrier people here and had musical  instruments playing to them o nights which it was a treat to hear  again  the next day and the next we rode and walked about the town  which is delightfully situated on eight hills overhanging james  river a sparkling stream studded here and there with bright  islands or brawling over broken rocks  although it was yet but  the middle of march the weather in this southern temperature was  extremely warm the peechtrees and magnolias were in full bloom  and the trees were green  in a low ground among the hills is a  valley known as bloody run from a terrible conflict with the  indians which once occurred there  it is a good place for such a  struggle and like every other spot i saw associated with any  legend of that wild people now so rapidly fading from the earth  interested me very much  the city is the seat of the local parliament of virginia and in  its shady legislative halls some orators were drowsily holding  forth to the hot noon day  by dint of constant repetition  however these constitutional sights had very little more interest  for me than so many parochial vestries and i was glad to exchange  this one for a lounge in a wellarranged public library of some ten  thousand volumes and a visit to a tobacco manufactory where the  workmen are all slaves  i saw in this place the whole process of picking rolling  pressing drying packing in casks and branding  all the tobacco  thus dealt with was in course of manufacture for chewing and one  would have supposed there was enough in that one storehouse to have  filled even the comprehensive jaws of america  in this form the  weed looks like the oilcake on which we fatten cattle and even  without reference to its consequences is sufficiently uninviting  many of the workmen appeared to be strong men and it is hardly  necessary to add that they were all labouring quietly then  after  two oclock in the day they are allowed to sing a certain number  at a time  the hour striking while i was there some twenty sang a  hymn in parts and sang it by no means ill pursuing their work  meanwhile  a bell rang as i was about to leave and they all  poured forth into a building on the opposite side of the street to  dinner  i said several times that i should like to see them at  their meal but as the gentleman to whom i mentioned this desire  appeared to be suddenly taken rather deaf i did not pursue the  request  of their appearance i shall have something to say  presently  on the following day i visited a plantation or farm of about  twelve hundred acres on the opposite bank of the river  here  again although i went down with the owner of the estate to the  quarter as that part of it in which the slaves live is called i  was not invited to enter into any of their huts  all i saw of  them was that they were very crazy wretched cabins near to  which groups of halfnaked children basked in the sun or wallowed  on the dusty ground  but i believe that this gentleman is a  considerate and excellent master who inherited his fifty slaves  and is neither a buyer nor a seller of human stock and i am sure  from my own observation and conviction that he is a kindhearted  worthy man  the planters house was an airy rustic dwelling that brought  defoes description of such places strongly to my recollection   the day was very warm but the blinds being all closed and the  windows and doors set wide open a shady coolness rustled through  the rooms which was exquisitely refreshing after the glare and  heat without  before the windows was an open piazza where in  what they call the hot weather  whatever that may be  they sling  hammocks and drink and doze luxuriously  i do not know how their  cool rejections may taste within the hammocks but having  experience i can report that out of them the mounds of ices and  the bowls of mintjulep and sherrycobbler they make in these  latitudes are refreshments never to be thought of afterwards in  summer by those who would preserve contented minds  there are two bridges across the river  one belongs to the  railroad and the other which is a very crazy affair is the  private property of some old lady in the neighbourhood who levies  tolls upon the townspeople  crossing this bridge on my way back  i saw a notice painted on the gate cautioning all persons to drive  slowly  under a penalty if the offender were a white man of five  dollars if a negro fifteen stripes  the same decay and gloom that overhang the way by which it is  approached hover above the town of richmond  there are pretty  villas and cheerful houses in its streets and nature smiles upon  the country round but jostling its handsome residences like  slavery itself going hand in hand with many lofty virtues are  deplorable tenements fences unrepaired walls crumbling into  ruinous heaps  hinting gloomily at things below the surface  these and many other tokens of the same description force  themselves upon the notice and are remembered with depressing  influence when livelier features are forgotten  to those who are happily unaccustomed to them the countenances in  the streets and labouringplaces too are shocking  all men who  know that there are laws against instructing slaves of which the  pains and penalties greatly exceed in their amount the fines  imposed on those who maim and torture them must be prepared to  find their faces very low in the scale of intellectual expression   but the darkness  not of skin but mind  which meets the  strangers eye at every turn the brutalizing and blotting out of  all fairer characters traced by natures hand immeasurably outdo  his worst belief  that travelled creation of the great satirists  brain who fresh from living among horses peered from a high  casement down upon his own kind with trembling horror was scarcely  more repelled and daunted by the sight than those who look upon  some of these faces for the first time must surely be  i left the last of them behind me in the person of a wretched  drudge who after running to and fro all day till midnight and  moping in his stealthy winks of sleep upon the stairs  betweenwhiles was washing the dark passages at four oclock in the  morning and went upon my way with a grateful heart that i was not  doomed to live where slavery was and had never had my senses  blunted to its wrongs and horrors in a slaverocked cradle  it had been my intention to proceed by james river and chesapeake  bay to baltimore but one of the steamboats being absent from her  station through some accident and the means of conveyance being  consequently rendered uncertain we returned to washington by the  way we had come there were two constables on board the steamboat  in pursuit of runaway slaves and halting there again for one  night went on to baltimore next afternoon  the most comfortable of all the hotels of which i had any  experience in the united states and they were not a few is  barnums in that city  where the english traveller will find  curtains to his bed for the first and probably the last time in  america this is a disinterested remark for i never use them and  where he will be likely to have enough water for washing himself  which is not at all a common case  this capital of the state of maryland is a bustling busy town  with a great deal of traffic of various kinds and in particular of  water commerce  that portion of the town which it most favours is  none of the cleanest it is true but the upper part is of a very  different character and has many agreeable streets and public  buildings  the washington monument which is a handsome pillar  with a statue on its summit the medical college and the battle  monument in memory of an engagement with the british at north  point are the most conspicuous among them  there is a very good prison in this city and the state  penitentiary is also among its institutions  in this latter  establishment there were two curious cases  one was that of a young man who had been tried for the murder of  his father  the evidence was entirely circumstantial and was very  conflicting and doubtful nor was it possible to assign any motive  which could have tempted him to the commission of so tremendous a  crime  he had been tried twice and on the second occasion the  jury felt so much hesitation in convicting him that they found a  verdict of manslaughter or murder in the second degree which it  could not possibly be as there had beyond all doubt been no  quarrel or provocation and if he were guilty at all he was  unquestionably guilty of murder in its broadest and worst  signification  the remarkable feature in the case was that if the unfortunate  deceased were not really murdered by this own son of his he must  have been murdered by his own brother  the evidence lay in a most  remarkable manner between those two  on all the suspicious  points the dead mans brother was the witness  all the  explanations for the prisoner some of them extremely plausible  went by construction and inference to inculcate him as plotting  to fix the guilt upon his nephew  it must have been one of them   and the jury had to decide between two sets of suspicions almost  equally unnatural unaccountable and strange  the other case was that of a man who once went to a certain  distillers and stole a copper measure containing a quantity of  liquor  he was pursued and taken with the property in his  possession and was sentenced to two years imprisonment  on  coming out of the jail at the expiration of that term he went  back to the same distillers and stole the same copper measure  containing the same quantity of liquor  there was not the  slightest reason to suppose that the man wished to return to  prison  indeed everything but the commission of the offence made  directly against that assumption  there are only two ways of  accounting for this extraordinary proceeding  one is that after  undergoing so much for this copper measure he conceived he had  established a sort of claim and right to it  the other that by  dint of long thinking about it had become a monomania with him  and had acquired a fascination which he found it impossible to  resist swelling from an earthly copper gallon into an ethereal  golden vat  after remaining here a couple of days i bound myself to a rigid  adherence to the plan i had laid down so recently and resolved to  set forward on our western journey without any more delay   accordingly having reduced the luggage within the smallest  possible compass by sending back to new york to be afterwards  forwarded to us in canada so much of it as was not absolutely  wanted and having procured the necessary credentials to banking houses on the way and having moreover looked for two evenings at  the setting sun with as welldefined an idea of the country before  us as if we had been going to travel into the very centre of that  planet we left baltimore by another railway at halfpast eight in  the morning and reached the town of york some sixty miles off by  the early dinnertime of the hotel which was the startingplace of  the fourhorse coach wherein we were to proceed to harrisburg  this conveyance the box of which i was fortunate enough to secure  had come down to meet us at the railroad station and was as muddy  and cumbersome as usual  as more passengers were waiting for us at  the inndoor the coachman observed under his breath in the usual  selfcommunicative voice looking the while at his mouldy harness  as if it were to that he was addressing himself  i expect we shall want the big coach  i could not help wondering within myself what the size of this big  coach might be and how many persons it might be designed to hold  for the vehicle which was too small for our purpose was something  larger than two english heavy night coaches and might have been  the twinbrother of a french diligence  my speculations were  speedily set at rest however for as soon as we had dined there  came rumbling up the street shaking its sides like a corpulent  giant a kind of barge on wheels  after much blundering and  backing it stopped at the door  rolling heavily from side to side  when its other motion had ceased as if it had taken cold in its  damp stable and between that and the having been required in its  dropsical old age to move at any faster pace than a walk were  distressed by shortness of wind  if here aint the harrisburg mail at last and dreadful bright and  smart to look at too cried an elderly gentleman in some  excitement darn my mother  i dont know what the sensation of being darned may be or whether  a mans mother has a keener relish or disrelish of the process than  anybody else but if the endurance of this mysterious ceremony by  the old lady in question had depended on the accuracy of her sons  vision in respect to the abstract brightness and smartness of the  harrisburg mail she would certainly have undergone its infliction   however they booked twelve people inside and the luggage  including such trifles as a large rockingchair and a goodsized  diningtable being at length made fast upon the roof we started  off in great state  at the door of another hotel there was another passenger to be  taken up  any room sir cries the new passenger to the coachman  well theres room enough replies the coachman without getting  down or even looking at him  there ant no room at all sir bawls a gentleman inside  which  another gentleman also inside confirms by predicting that the  attempt to introduce any more passengers wont fit nohow  the new passenger without any expression of anxiety looks into  the coach and then looks up at the coachman  now how do you  mean to fix it says he after a pause  for i must go  the coachman employs himself in twisting the lash of his whip into  a knot and takes no more notice of the question  clearly  signifying that it is anybodys business but his and that the  passengers would do well to fix it among themselves  in this  state of things matters seem to be approximating to a fix of  another kind when another inside passenger in a corner who is  nearly suffocated cries faintly ill get out  this is no matter of relief or selfcongratulation to the driver  for his immovable philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by anything  that happens in the coach  of all things in the world the coach  would seem to be the very last upon his mind  the exchange is  made however and then the passenger who has given up his seat  makes a third upon the box seating himself in what he calls the  middle that is with half his person on my legs and the other  half on the drivers  go ahead capen cries the colonel who directs  golang cries the capen to his company the horses and away we  go  we took up at a rural barroom after we had gone a few miles an  intoxicated gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage  and subsequently slipping off without hurting himself was seen in  the distant perspective reeling back to the grogshop where we had  found him  we also parted with more of our freight at different  times so that when we came to change horses i was again alone  outside  the coachmen always change with the horses and are usually as  dirty as the coach  the first was dressed like a very shabby  english baker the second like a russian peasant  for he wore a  loose purple camlet robe with a fur collar tied round his waist  with a particoloured worsted sash grey trousers light blue  gloves  and a cap of bearskin  it had by this time come on to  rain very heavily and there was a cold damp mist besides which  penetrated to the skin  i was glad to take advantage of a stoppage  and get down to stretch my legs shake the water off my greatcoat  and swallow the usual antitemperance recipe for keeping out the  cold  when i mounted to my seat again i observed a new parcel lying on  the coach roof which i took to be a rather large fiddle in a brown  bag  in the course of a few miles however i discovered that it  had a glazed cap at one end and a pair of muddy shoes at the other  and further observation demonstrated it to be a small boy in a  snuffcoloured coat with his arms quite pinioned to his sides by  deep forcing into his pockets  he was i presume a relative or  friend of the coachmans as he lay atop of the luggage with his  face towards the rain and except when a change of position brought  his shoes in contact with my hat he appeared to be asleep  at  last on some occasion of our stopping this thing slowly upreared  itself to the height of three feet six and fixing its eyes on me  observed in piping accents with a complaisant yawn half quenched  in an obliging air of friendly patronage well now stranger i  guess you find this amost like an english arternoon hey  the scenery which had been tame enough at first was for the last  ten or twelve miles beautiful  our road wound through the  pleasant valley of the susquehanna the river dotted with  innumerable green islands lay upon our right and on the left a  steep ascent craggy with broken rock and dark with pine trees   the mist wreathing itself into a hundred fantastic shapes moved  solemnly upon the water and the gloom of evening gave to all an  air of mystery and silence which greatly enhanced its natural  interest  we crossed this river by a wooden bridge roofed and covered in on  all sides and nearly a mile in length  it was profoundly dark  perplexed with great beams crossing and recrossing it at every  possible angle and through the broad chinks and crevices in the  floor the rapid river gleamed far down below like a legion of  eyes  we had no lamps and as the horses stumbled and floundered  through this place towards the distant speck of dying light it  seemed interminable  i really could not at first persuade myself  as we rumbled heavily on filling the bridge with hollow noises  and i held down my head to save it from the rafters above but that  i was in a painful dream for i have often dreamed of toiling  through such places and as often argued even at the time this  cannot be reality  at length however we emerged upon the streets of harrisburg  whose feeble lights reflected dismally from the wet ground did  not shine out upon a very cheerful city  we were soon established  in a snug hotel which though smaller and far less splendid than  many we put up at it raised above them all in my remembrance by  having for its landlord the most obliging considerate and  gentlemanly person i ever had to deal with  as we were not to proceed upon our journey until the afternoon i  walked out after breakfast the next morning to look about me and  was duly shown a model prison on the solitary system just erected  and as yet without an inmate the trunk of an old tree to which  harris the first settler here afterwards buried under it was  tied by hostile indians with his funeral pile about him when he  was saved by the timely appearance of a friendly party on the  opposite shore of the river the local legislature for there was  another of those bodies here again in full debate and the other  curiosities of the town  i was very much interested in looking over a number of treaties  made from time to time with the poor indians signed by the  different chiefs at the period of their ratification and preserved  in the office of the secretary to the commonwealth  these  signatures traced of course by their own hands are rough drawings  of the creatures or weapons they were called after  thus the  great turtle makes a crooked penandink outline of a great turtle  the buffalo sketches a buffalo the war hatchet sets a rough image  of that weapon for his mark  so with the arrow the fish the  scalp the big canoe and all of them  i could not but think  as i looked at these feeble and tremulous  productions of hands which could draw the longest arrow to the head  in a stout elkhorn bow or split a bead or feather with a rifle ball  of crabbes musings over the parish register and the  irregular scratches made with a pen by men who would plough a  lengthy furrow straight from end to end  nor could i help  bestowing many sorrowful thoughts upon the simple warriors whose  hands and hearts were set there in all truth and honesty and who  only learned in course of time from white men how to break their  faith and quibble out of forms and bonds  i wonder too how many  times the credulous big turtle or trusting little hatchet had put  his mark to treaties which were falsely read to him and had signed  away he knew not what until it went and cast him loose upon the  new possessors of the land a savage indeed  our host announced before our early dinner that some members of  the legislative body proposed to do us the honour of calling  he  had kindly yielded up to us his wifes own little parlour and when  i begged that he would show them in i saw him look with painful  apprehension at its pretty carpet though being otherwise occupied  at the time the cause of his uneasiness did not occur to me  it certainly would have been more pleasant to all parties  concerned and would not i think have compromised their  independence in any material degree if some of these gentlemen had  not only yielded to the prejudice in favour of spittoons but had  abandoned themselves for the moment even to the conventional  absurdity of pockethandkerchiefs  it still continued to rain heavily and when we went down to the  canal boat for that was the mode of conveyance by which we were to  proceed after dinner the weather was as unpromising and  obstinately wet as one would desire to see  nor was the sight of  this canal boat in which we were to spend three or four days by  any means a cheerful one as it involved some uneasy speculations  concerning the disposal of the passengers at night and opened a  wide field of inquiry touching the other domestic arrangements of  the establishment which was sufficiently disconcerting  however there it was  a barge with a little house in it viewed  from the outside and a caravan at a fair viewed from within  the  gentlemen being accommodated as the spectators usually are in one  of those locomotive museums of penny wonders and the ladies being  partitioned off by a red curtain after the manner of the dwarfs  and giants in the same establishments whose private lives are  passed in rather close exclusiveness  we sat here looking silently at the row of little tables which  extended down both sides of the cabin and listening to the rain as  it dripped and pattered on the boat and plashed with a dismal  merriment in the water until the arrival of the railway train for  whose final contribution to our stock of passengers our departure  was alone deferred  it brought a great many boxes which were  bumped and tossed upon the roof almost as painfully as if they had  been deposited on ones own head without the intervention of a  porters knot and several damp gentlemen whose clothes on their  drawing round the stove began to steam again  no doubt it would  have been a thought more comfortable if the driving rain which now  poured down more soakingly than ever had admitted of a window  being opened or if our number had been something less than thirty  but there was scarcely time to think as much when a train of three  horses was attached to the towrope the boy upon the leader  smacked his whip the rudder creaked and groaned complainingly and  we had begun our journey    chapter x  some further account of the canal boat its domestic  economy and its passengers  journey to pittsburg across the  alleghany mountains  pittsburg    as it continued to rain most perseveringly we all remained below   the damp gentlemen round the stove gradually becoming mildewed by  the action of the fire and the dry gentlemen lying at full length  upon the seats or slumbering uneasily with their faces on the  tables or walking up and down the cabin which it was barely  possible for a man of the middle height to do without making bald  places on his head by scraping it against the roof  at about six  oclock all the small tables were put together to form one long  table and everybody sat down to tea coffee bread butter  salmon shad liver steaks potatoes pickles ham chops black puddings and sausages  will you try said my opposite neighbour handing me a dish of  potatoes broken up in milk and butter will you try some of these  fixings  there are few words which perform such various duties as this word  fix  it is the caleb quotem of the american vocabulary  you  call upon a gentleman in a country town and his help informs you  that he is fixing himself just now but will be down directly   by which you are to understand that he is dressing  you inquire  on board a steamboat of a fellowpassenger whether breakfast will  be ready soon and he tells you he should think so for when he was  last below they were fixing the tables in other words laying  the cloth  you beg a porter to collect your luggage and he  entreats you not to be uneasy for hell fix it presently and if  you complain of indisposition you are advised to have recourse to  doctor soandso who will fix you in no time  one night i ordered a bottle of mulled wine at an hotel where i  was staying and waited a long time for it at length it was put  upon the table with an apology from the landlord that he feared it  wasnt fixed properly and i recollect once at a stagecoach  dinner overhearing a very stern gentleman demand of a waiter who  presented him with a plate of underdone roastbeef whether he  called that fixing god amightys vittles  there is no doubt that the meal at which the invitation was  tendered to me which has occasioned this digression was disposed  of somewhat ravenously and that the gentlemen thrust the broad bladed knives and the twopronged forks further down their throats  than i ever saw the same weapons go before except in the hands of  a skilful juggler  but no man sat down until the ladies were  seated or omitted any little act of politeness which could  contribute to their comfort  nor did i ever once on any occasion  anywhere during my rambles in america see a woman exposed to the  slightest act of rudeness incivility or even inattention  by the time the meal was over the rain which seemed to have worn  itself out by coming down so fast was nearly over too and it  became feasible to go on deck  which was a great relief  notwithstanding its being a very small deck and being rendered  still smaller by the luggage which was heaped together in the  middle under a tarpaulin covering leaving on either side a path  so narrow that it became a science to walk to and fro without  tumbling overboard into the canal  it was somewhat embarrassing at  first too to have to duck nimbly every five minutes whenever the  man at the helm cried bridge and sometimes when the cry was  low bridge to lie down nearly flat  but custom familiarises one  to anything and there were so many bridges that it took a very  short time to get used to this  as night came on and we drew in sight of the first range of hills  which are the outposts of the alleghany mountains the scenery  which had been uninteresting hitherto became more bold and  striking  the wet ground reeked and smoked after the heavy fall  of rain and the croaking of the frogs whose noise in these parts  is almost incredible sounded as though a million of fairy teams  with bells were travelling through the air and keeping pace with  us  the night was cloudy yet but moonlight too  and when we  crossed the susquehanna river  over which there is an  extraordinary wooden bridge with two galleries one above the  other so that even there two boat teams meeting may pass without  confusion  it was wild and grand  i have mentioned my having been in some uncertainty and doubt at  first relative to the sleeping arrangements on board this boat  i  remained in the same vague state of mind until ten oclock or  thereabouts when going below i found suspended on either side of  the cabin three long tiers of hanging bookshelves designed  apparently for volumes of the small octavo size  looking with  greater attention at these contrivances wondering to find such  literary preparations in such a place i descried on each shelf a  sort of microscopic sheet and blanket then i began dimly to  comprehend that the passengers were the library and that they were  to be arranged edgewise on these shelves till morning  i was assisted to this conclusion by seeing some of them gathered  round the master of the boat at one of the tables drawing lots  with all the anxieties and passions of gamesters depicted in their  countenances while others with small pieces of cardboard in their  hands were groping among the shelves in search of numbers  corresponding with those they had drawn  as soon as any gentleman  found his number he took possession of it by immediately  undressing himself and crawling into bed  the rapidity with which  an agitated gambler subsided into a snoring slumberer was one of  the most singular effects i have ever witnessed  as to the ladies  they were already abed behind the red curtain which was carefully  drawn and pinned up the centre though as every cough or sneeze  or whisper behind this curtain was perfectly audible before it  we had still a lively consciousness of their society  the politeness of the person in authority had secured to me a shelf  in a nook near this red curtain in some degree removed from the  great body of sleepers  to which place i retired with many  acknowledgments to him for his attention  i found it on after measurement just the width of an ordinary sheet of bath post  letterpaper and i was at first in some uncertainty as to the best  means of getting into it  but the shelf being a bottom one i  finally determined on lying upon the floor rolling gently in  stopping immediately i touched the mattress and remaining for the  night with that side uppermost whatever it might be  luckily i  came upon my back at exactly the right moment  i was much alarmed  on looking upward to see by the shape of his halfyard of sacking  which his weight had bent into an exceedingly tight bag that  there was a very heavy gentleman above me whom the slender cords  seemed quite incapable of holding and i could not help reflecting  upon the grief of my wife and family in the event of his coming  down in the night  but as i could not have got up again without a  severe bodily struggle which might have alarmed the ladies and as  i had nowhere to go to even if i had i shut my eyes upon the  danger and remained there  one of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact with  reference to that class of society who travel in these boats   either they carry their restlessness to such a pitch that they  never sleep at all or they expectorate in dreams which would be a  remarkable mingling of the real and ideal  all night long and  every night on this canal there was a perfect storm and tempest  of spitting and once my coat being in the very centre of the  hurricane sustained by five gentlemen which moved vertically  strictly carrying out reids theory of the law of storms i was  fain the next morning to lay it on the deck and rub it down with  fair water before it was in a condition to be worn again  between five and six oclock in the morning we got up and some of  us went on deck to give them an opportunity of taking the shelves  down while others the morning being very cold crowded round the  rusty stove cherishing the newly kindled fire and filling the  grate with those voluntary contributions of which they had been so  liberal all night  the washing accommodations were primitive   there was a tin ladle chained to the deck with which every  gentleman who thought it necessary to cleanse himself many were  superior to this weakness fished the dirty water out of the  canal and poured it into a tin basin secured in like manner   there was also a jacktowel  and hanging up before a little  lookingglass in the bar in the immediate vicinity of the bread  and cheese and biscuits were a public comb and hairbrush  at eight oclock the shelves being taken down and put away and the  tables joined together everybody sat down to the tea coffee  bread butter salmon shad liver steak potatoes pickles ham  chops blackpuddings and sausages all over again  some were  fond of compounding this variety and having it all on their plates  at once  as each gentleman got through his own personal amount of  tea coffee bread butter salmon shad liver steak potatoes  pickles ham chops blackpuddings and sausages he rose up and  walked off  when everybody had done with everything the fragments  were cleared away  and one of the waiters appearing anew in the  character of a barber shaved such of the company as desired to be  shaved while the remainder looked on or yawned over their  newspapers  dinner was breakfast again without the tea and  coffee and supper and breakfast were identical  there was a man on board this boat with a light freshcoloured  face and a pepperandsalt suit of clothes who was the most  inquisitive fellow that can possibly be imagined  he never spoke  otherwise than interrogatively  he was an embodied inquiry   sitting down or standing up still or moving walking the deck or  taking his meals there he was with a great note of interrogation  in each eye two in his cocked ears two more in his turnedup nose  and chin at least half a dozen more about the corners of his  mouth and the largest one of all in his hair which was brushed  pertly off his forehead in a flaxen clump  every button in his  clothes said eh  whats that  did you speak  say that again  will you  he was always wide awake like the enchanted bride who  drove her husband frantic always restless always thirsting for  answers perpetually seeking and never finding  there never was  such a curious man  i wore a fur greatcoat at that time and before we were well clear  of the wharf he questioned me concerning it and its price and  where i bought it and when and what fur it was and what it  weighed and what it cost  then he took notice of my watch and  asked me what that cost and whether it was a french watch and  where i got it and how i got it and whether i bought it or had it  given me and how it went and where the keyhole was and when i  wound it every night or every morning and whether i ever forgot  to wind it at all and if i did what then  where had i been to  last and where was i going next and where was i going after that  and had i seen the president and what did he say and what did i  say and what did he say when i had said that  eh  lor now do  tell  finding that nothing would satisfy him i evaded his questions  after the first score or two and in particular pleaded ignorance  respecting the name of the fur whereof the coat was made  i am  unable to say whether this was the reason but that coat fascinated  him afterwards he usually kept close behind me as i walked and  moved as i moved that he might look at it the better and he  frequently dived into narrow places after me at the risk of his  life that he might have the satisfaction of passing his hand up  the back and rubbing it the wrong way  we had another odd specimen on board of a different kind  this  was a thinfaced sparefigured man of middle age and stature  dressed in a dusty drabbishcoloured suit such as i never saw  before  he was perfectly quiet during the first part of the  journey  indeed i dont remember having so much as seen him until  he was brought out by circumstances as great men often are  the  conjunction of events which made him famous happened briefly  thus  the canal extends to the foot of the mountain and there of  course it stops the passengers being conveyed across it by land  carriage and taken on afterwards by another canal boat the  counterpart of the first which awaits them on the other side   there are two canal lines of passageboats one is called the  express and one a cheaper one the pioneer  the pioneer gets  first to the mountain and waits for the express people to come up  both sets of passengers being conveyed across it at the same time   we were the express company but when we had crossed the mountain  and had come to the second boat the proprietors took it into their  beads to draft all the pioneers into it likewise so that we were  fiveandforty at least and the accession of passengers was not at  all of that kind which improved the prospect of sleeping at night   our people grumbled at this as people do in such cases but  suffered the boat to be towed off with the whole freight aboard  nevertheless and away we went down the canal  at home i should  have protested lustily but being a foreigner here i held my  peace  not so this passenger  he cleft a path among the people on  deck we were nearly all on deck and without addressing anybody  whomsoever soliloquised as follows  this may suit you this may but it dont suit me  this may be  all very well with down easters and men of boston raising but it  wont suit my figure nohow and no two ways about that and so i  tell you  now  im from the brown forests of mississippi i am  and when the sun shines on me it does shine  a little  it dont  glimmer where i live the sun dont  no  im a brown forester i  am  i ant a johnny cake  there are no smooth skins where i live   were rough men there  rather  if down easters and men of boston  raising like this im glad of it but im none of that raising nor  of that breed  no  this company wants a little fixing it does   im the wrong sort of man for em i am  they wont like me they  wont  this is piling of it up a little too mountainous this  is  at the end of every one of these short sentences he turned  upon his heel and walked the other way checking himself abruptly  when he had finished another short sentence and turning back  again  it is impossible for me to say what terrific meaning was hidden in  the words of this brown forester but i know that the other  passengers looked on in a sort of admiring horror and that  presently the boat was put back to the wharf and as many of the  pioneers as could be coaxed or bullied into going away were got  rid of  when we started again some of the boldest spirits on board made  bold to say to the obvious occasion of this improvement in our  prospects much obliged to you sir whereunto the brown forester  waving his hand and still walking up and down as before  replied no you ant  youre none o my raising  you may act for  yourselves you may  i have pinted out the way  down easters and  johnny cakes can follow if they please  i ant a johnny cake i  ant  i am from the brown forests of the mississippi i am  and  so on as before  he was unanimously voted one of the tables for  his bed at night  there is a great contest for the tables  in  consideration for his public services  and he had the warmest  corner by the stove throughout the rest of the journey  but i  never could find out that he did anything except sit there nor did  i hear him speak again until in the midst of the bustle and  turmoil of getting the luggage ashore in the dark at pittsburg i  stumbled over him as he sat smoking a cigar on the cabin steps and  heard him muttering to himself with a short laugh of defiance i  ant a johnny cake  i ant  im from the brown forests of the  mississippi i am damme  i am inclined to argue from this that  he had never left off saying so but i could not make an affidavit  of that part of the story if required to do so by my queen and  country  as we have not reached pittsburg yet however in the order of our  narrative i may go on to remark that breakfast was perhaps the  least desirable meal of the day as in addition to the many savoury  odours arising from the eatables already mentioned there were  whiffs of gin whiskey brandy and rum from the little bar hard  by and a decided seasoning of stale tobacco  many of the  gentlemen passengers were far from particular in respect of their  linen which was in some cases as yellow as the little rivulets  that had trickled from the corners of their mouths in chewing and  dried there  nor was the atmosphere quite free from zephyr  whisperings of the thirty beds which had just been cleared away  and of which we were further and more pressingly reminded by the  occasional appearance on the tablecloth of a kind of game not  mentioned in the bill of fare  and yet despite these oddities  and even they had for me at  least a humour of their own  there was much in this mode of  travelling which i heartily enjoyed at the time and look back upon  with great pleasure  even the running up barenecked at five  oclock in the morning from the tainted cabin to the dirty deck  scooping up the icy water plunging ones head into it and drawing  it out all fresh and glowing with the cold was a good thing  the  fast brisk walk upon the towingpath between that time and  breakfast when every vein and artery seemed to tingle with health  the exquisite beauty of the opening day when light came gleaming  off from everything the lazy motion of the boat when one lay idly  on the deck looking through rather than at the deep blue sky  the gliding on at night so noiselessly past frowning hills  sullen with dark trees and sometimes angry in one red burning  spot high up where unseen men lay crouching round a fire the  shining out of the bright stars undisturbed by noise of wheels or  steam or any other sound than the limpid rippling of the water as  the boat went on  all these were pure delights  then there were new settlements and detached logcabins and frame houses full of interest for strangers from an old country  cabins  with simple ovens outside made of clay and lodgings for the pigs  nearly as good as many of the human quarters broken windows  patched with wornout hats old clothes old boards fragments of  blankets and paper and homemade dressers standing in the open air  without the door whereon was ranged the household store not hard  to count of earthen jars and pots  the eye was pained to see the  stumps of great trees thickly strewn in every field of wheat and  seldom to lose the eternal swamp and dull morass with hundreds of  rotten trunks and twisted branches steeped in its unwholesome  water  it was quite sad and oppressive to come upon great tracts  where settlers had been burning down the trees and where their  wounded bodies lay about like those of murdered creatures while  here and there some charred and blackened giant reared aloft two  withered arms and seemed to call down curses on his foes   sometimes at night the way wound through some lonely gorge like  a mountain pass in scotland shining and coldly glittering in the  light of the moon and so closed in by high steep hills all round  that there seemed to be no egress save through the narrower path by  which we had come until one rugged hillside seemed to open and  shutting out the moonlight as we passed into its gloomy throat  wrapped our new course in shade and darkness  we had left harrisburg on friday  on sunday morning we arrived at  the foot of the mountain which is crossed by railroad  there are  ten inclined planes five ascending and five descending the  carriages are dragged up the former and let slowly down the  latter by means of stationary engines the comparatively level  spaces between being traversed sometimes by horse and sometimes  by engine power as the case demands  occasionally the rails are  laid upon the extreme verge of a giddy precipice and looking from  the carriage window the traveller gazes sheer down without a  stone or scrap of fence between into the mountain depths below   the journey is very carefully made however only two carriages  travelling together and while proper precautions are taken is not  to be dreaded for its dangers  it was very pretty travelling thus at a rapid pace along the  heights of the mountain in a keen wind to look down into a valley  full of light and softness catching glimpses through the tree tops of scattered cabins children running to the doors dogs  bursting out to bark whom we could see without hearing  terrified  pigs scampering homewards families sitting out in their rude  gardens cows gazing upward with a stupid indifference men in  their shirtsleeves looking on at their unfinished houses planning  out tomorrows work and we riding onward high above them like a  whirlwind  it was amusing too when we had dined and rattled  down a steep pass having no other moving power than the weight of  the carriages themselves to see the engine released long after  us come buzzing down alone like a great insect its back of green  and gold so shining in the sun that if it had spread a pair of  wings and soared away no one would have had occasion as i  fancied for the least surprise  but it stopped short of us in a  very businesslike manner when we reached the canal  and before  we left the wharf went panting up this hill again with the  passengers who had waited our arrival for the means of traversing  the road by which we had come  on the monday evening furnace fires and clanking hammers on the  banks of the canal warned us that we approached the termination of  this part of our journey  after going through another dreamy place   a long aqueduct across the alleghany river which was stranger  than the bridge at harrisburg being a vast low wooden chamber  full of water  we emerged upon that ugly confusion of backs of  buildings and crazy galleries and stairs which always abuts on  water whether it be river sea canal or ditch  and were at  pittsburg  pittsburg is like birmingham in england at least its townspeople  say so  setting aside the streets the shops the houses waggons  factories public buildings and population perhaps it may be  it  certainly has a great quantity of smoke hanging about it and is  famous for its ironworks  besides the prison to which i have  already referred this town contains a pretty arsenal and other  institutions  it is very beautifully situated on the alleghany  river over which there are two bridges and the villas of the  wealthier citizens sprinkled about the high grounds in the  neighbourhood are pretty enough  we lodged at a most excellent  hotel and were admirably served  as usual it was full of  boarders was very large and had a broad colonnade to every story  of the house  we tarried here three days  our next point was cincinnati  and as  this was a steamboat journey and western steamboats usually blow  up one or two a week in the season it was advisable to collect  opinions in reference to the comparative safety of the vessels  bound that way then lying in the river  one called the messenger  was the best recommended  she had been advertised to start  positively every day for a fortnight or so and had not gone yet  nor did her captain seem to have any very fixed intention on the  subject  but this is the custom  for if the law were to bind down  a free and independent citizen to keep his word with the public  what would become of the liberty of the subject  besides it is in  the way of trade  and if passengers be decoyed in the way of  trade and people be inconvenienced in the way of trade what man  who is a sharp tradesman himself shall say we must put a stop to  this  impressed by the deep solemnity of the public announcement i  being then ignorant of these usages was for hurrying on board in  a breathless state immediately but receiving private and  confidential information that the boat would certainly not start  until friday april the first we made ourselves very comfortable  in the mean while and went on board at noon that day    chapter xi  from pittsburg to cincinnati in a western steamboat   cincinnati    the messenger was one among a crowd of highpressure steamboats  clustered together by a wharfside which looked down upon from  the rising ground that forms the landingplace and backed by the  lofty bank on the opposite side of the river appeared no larger  than so many floating models  she had some forty passengers on  board exclusive of the poorer persons on the lower deck and in  half an hour or less proceeded on her way  we had for ourselves a tiny stateroom with two berths in it  opening out of the ladies cabin  there was undoubtedly  something satisfactory in this location inasmuch as it was in  the stern and we had been a great many times very gravely  recommended to keep as far aft as possible because the steamboats  generally blew up forward  nor was this an unnecessary caution  as the occurrence and circumstances of more than one such fatality  during our stay sufficiently testified  apart from this source of  selfcongratulation it was an unspeakable relief to have any  place no matter how confined where one could be alone  and as  the row of little chambers of which this was one had each a second  glassdoor besides that in the ladies cabin which opened on a  narrow gallery outside the vessel where the other passengers  seldom came and where one could sit in peace and gaze upon the  shifting prospect we took possession of our new quarters with much  pleasure  if the native packets i have already described be unlike anything  we are in the habit of seeing on water these western vessels are  still more foreign to all the ideas we are accustomed to entertain  of boats  i hardly know what to liken them to or how to describe  them  in the first place they have no mast cordage tackle rigging or  other such boatlike gear nor have they anything in their shape at  all calculated to remind one of a boats head stem sides or  keel  except that they are in the water and display a couple of  paddleboxes they might be intended for anything that appears to  the contrary to perform some unknown service high and dry upon a  mountain top  there is no visible deck even  nothing but a long  black ugly roof covered with burntout feathery sparks above  which tower two iron chimneys and a hoarse escape valve and a  glass steeragehouse  then in order as the eye descends towards  the water are the sides and doors and windows of the state rooms jumbled as oddly together as though they formed a small  street built by the varying tastes of a dozen men  the whole is  supported on beams and pillars resting on a dirty barge but a few  inches above the waters edge  and in the narrow space between  this upper structure and this barges deck are the furnace fires  and machinery open at the sides to every wind that blows and  every storm of rain it drives along its path  passing one of these boats at night and seeing the great body of  fire exposed as i have just described that rages and roars  beneath the frail pile of painted wood  the machinery not warded  off or guarded in any way but doing its work in the midst of the  crowd of idlers and emigrants and children who throng the lower  deck  under the management too of reckless men whose  acquaintance with its mysteries may have been of six months  standing  one feels directly that the wonder is not that there  should be so many fatal accidents but that any journey should be  safely made  within there is one long narrow cabin the whole length of the  boat from which the staterooms open on both sides  a small  portion of it at the stern is partitioned off for the ladies and  the bar is at the opposite extreme  there is a long table down the  centre and at either end a stove  the washing apparatus is  forward on the deck  it is a little better than on board the  canal boat but not much  in all modes of travelling the american  customs with reference to the means of personal cleanliness and  wholesome ablution are extremely negligent and filthy and i  strongly incline to the belief that a considerable amount of  illness is referable to this cause  we are to be on board the messenger three days  arriving at  cincinnati barring accidents on monday morning  there are three  meals a day  breakfast at seven dinner at halfpast twelve  supper about six  at each there are a great many small dishes and  plates upon the table with very little in them so that although  there is every appearance of a mighty spread there is seldom  really more than a joint  except for those who fancy slices of  beetroot shreds of dried beef complicated entanglements of  yellow pickle maize indian corn applesauce and pumpkin  some people fancy all these little dainties together and sweet  preserves beside by way of relish to their roast pig  they are  generally those dyspeptic ladies and gentlemen who eat unheardof  quantities of hot corn bread almost as good for the digestion as a  kneaded pincushion for breakfast and for supper  those who do  not observe this custom and who help themselves several times  instead usually suck their knives and forks meditatively until  they have decided what to take next  then pull them out of their  mouths  put them in the dish help themselves and fall to work  again  at dinner there is nothing to drink upon the table but  great jugs full of cold water  nobody says anything at any meal  to anybody  all the passengers are very dismal and seem to have  tremendous secrets weighing on their minds  there is no  conversation no laughter no cheerfulness no sociality except in  spitting and that is done in silent fellowship round the stove  when the meal is over  every man sits down dull and languid  swallows his fare as if breakfasts dinners and suppers were  necessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation or  enjoyment and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence bolts  himself in the same state  but for these animal observances you  might suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the  melancholy ghosts of departed bookkeepers who had fallen dead at  the desk  such is their weary air of business and calculation   undertakers on duty would be sprightly beside them and a collation  of funeralbaked meats in comparison with these meals would be a  sparkling festivity  the people are all alike too  there is no diversity of character   they travel about on the same errands say and do the same things  in exactly the same manner and follow in the same dull cheerless  round  all down the long table there is scarcely a man who is in  anything different from his neighbour  it is quite a relief to  have sitting opposite that little girl of fifteen with the  loquacious chin  who to do her justice acts up to it and fully  identifies natures handwriting for of all the small chatterboxes  that ever invaded the repose of drowsy ladies cabin she is the  first and foremost  the beautiful girl who sits a little beyond  her  farther down the table there  married the young man with the  dark whiskers who sits beyond her only last month  they are  going to settle in the very far west where he has lived four  years but where she has never been  they were both overturned in  a stagecoach the other day a bad omen anywhere else where  overturns are not so common and his head which bears the marks  of a recent wound is bound up still  she was hurt too at the  same time and lay insensible for some days bright as her eyes  are now  further down still sits a man who is going some miles beyond their  place of destination to improve a newlydiscovered copper mine   he carries the village  that is to be  with him  a few frame  cottages and an apparatus for smelting the copper  he carries its  people too  they are partly american and partly irish and herd  together on the lower deck where they amused themselves last  evening till the night was pretty far advanced by alternately  firing off pistols and singing hymns  they and the very few who have been left at table twenty minutes  rise and go away  we do so too and passing through our little  stateroom resume our seats in the quiet gallery without  a fine broad river always but in some parts much wider than in  others  and then there is usually a green island covered with  trees dividing it into two streams  occasionally we stop for a  few minutes maybe to take in wood maybe for passengers at some  small town or village i ought to say city every place is a city  here but the banks are for the most part deep solitudes  overgrown with trees which hereabouts are already in leaf and  very green  for miles and miles and miles these solitudes are  unbroken by any sign of human life or trace of human footstep nor  is anything seen to move about them but the blue jay whose colour  is so bright and yet so delicate that it looks like a flying  flower  at lengthened intervals a log cabin with its little space  of cleared land about it nestles under a rising ground and sends  its thread of blue smoke curling up into the sky  it stands in the  corner of the poor field of wheat which is full of great unsightly  stumps like earthy butchersblocks  sometimes the ground is only  just now cleared  the felled trees lying yet upon the soil  and  the loghouse only this morning begun  as we pass this clearing  the settler leans upon his axe or hammer and looks wistfully at  the people from the world  the children creep out of the temporary  hut which is like a gipsy tent upon the ground and clap their  hands and shout  the dog only glances round at us and then looks  up into his masters face again as if he were rendered uneasy by  any suspension of the common business and had nothing more to do  with pleasurers  and still there is the same eternal foreground   the river has washed away its banks and stately trees have fallen  down into the stream  some have been there so long that they are  mere dry grizzly skeletons  some have just toppled over and  having earth yet about their roots are bathing their green heads  in the river and putting forth new shoots and branches  some are  almost sliding down as you look at them  and some were drowned so  long ago that their bleached arms start out from the middle of the  current and seem to try to grasp the boat and drag it under  water  through such a scene as this the unwieldy machine takes its  hoarse sullen way  venting at every revolution of the paddles a  loud highpressure blast enough one would think to waken up the  host of indians who lie buried in a great mound yonder  so old  that mighty oaks and other forest trees have struck their roots  into its earth and so high that it is a hill even among the  hills that nature planted round it  the very river as though it  shared ones feelings of compassion for the extinct tribes who  lived so pleasantly here in their blessed ignorance of white  existence hundreds of years ago steals out of its way to ripple  near this mound  and there are few places where the ohio sparkles  more brightly than in the big grave creek  all this i see as i sit in the little sterngallery mentioned just  now  evening slowly steals upon the landscape and changes it  before me when we stop to set some emigrants ashore  five men as many women and a little girl  all their worldly  goods are a bag a large chest and an old chair  one old high backed rushbottomed chair  a solitary settler in itself  they  are rowed ashore in the boat while the vessel stands a little off  awaiting its return the water being shallow  they are landed at  the foot of a high bank on the summit of which are a few log  cabins attainable only by a long winding path  it is growing  dusk but the sun is very red and shines in the water and on some  of the treetops like fire  the men get out of the boat first help out the women take out the  bag the chest the chair bid the rowers goodbye and shove the  boat off for them  at the first plash of the oars in the water  the oldest woman of the party sits down in the old chair close to  the waters edge without speaking a word  none of the others sit  down though the chest is large enough for many seats  they all  stand where they landed as if stricken into stone and look after  the boat  so they remain quite still and silent  the old woman  and her old chair in the centre the bag and chest upon the shore  without anybody heeding them all eyes fixed upon the boat  it  comes alongside is made fast the men jump on board the engine is  put in motion and we go hoarsely on again  there they stand yet  without the motion of a hand  i can see them through my glass  when in the distance and increasing darkness they are mere specks  to the eye  lingering there still  the old woman in the old  chair and all the rest about her  not stirring in the least  degree  and thus i slowly lose them  the night is dark and we proceed within the shadow of the wooded  bank which makes it darker  after gliding past the sombre maze of  boughs for a long time we come upon an open space where the tall  trees are burning  the shape of every branch and twig is expressed  in a deep red glow and as the light wind stirs and ruffles it  they seem to vegetate in fire  it is such a sight as we read of in  legends of enchanted forests  saving that it is sad to see these  noble works wasting away so awfully alone and to think how many  years must come and go before the magic that created them will rear  their like upon this ground again  but the time will come and  when in their changed ashes the growth of centuries unborn has  struck its roots the restless men of distant ages will repair to  these again unpeopled solitudes and their fellows in cities far  away that slumber now perhaps beneath the rolling sea will read  in language strange to any ears in being now but very old to them  of primeval forests where the axe was never heard and where the  jungled ground was never trodden by a human foot  midnight and sleep blot out these scenes and thoughts  and when  the morning shines again it gilds the housetops of a lively city  before whose broad paved wharf the boat is moored with other  boats and flags and moving wheels and hum of men around it as  though there were not a solitary or silent rood of ground within  the compass of a thousand miles  cincinnati is a beautiful city cheerful thriving and animated   i have not often seen a place that commends itself so favourably  and pleasantly to a stranger at the first glance as this does   with its clean houses of red and white its wellpaved roads and  footways of bright tile  nor does it become less prepossessing on  a closer acquaintance  the streets are broad and airy the shops  extremely good the private residences remarkable for their  elegance and neatness  there is something of invention and fancy  in the varying styles of these latter erections which after the  dull company of the steamboat is perfectly delightful as  conveying an assurance that there are such qualities still in  existence  the disposition to ornament these pretty villas and  render them attractive leads to the culture of trees and flowers  and the laying out of wellkept gardens the sight of which to  those who walk along the streets is inexpressibly refreshing and  agreeable  i was quite charmed with the appearance of the town  and its adjoining suburb of mount auburn  from which the city  lying in an amphitheatre of hills forms a picture of remarkable  beauty and is seen to great advantage  there happened to be a great temperance convention held here on the  day after our arrival and as the order of march brought the  procession under the windows of the hotel in which we lodged when  they started in the morning i had a good opportunity of seeing it   it comprised several thousand men the members of various  washington auxiliary temperance societies and was marshalled by  officers on horseback who cantered briskly up and down the line  with scarves and ribbons of bright colours fluttering out behind  them gaily  there were bands of music too and banners out of  number  and it was a fresh holidaylooking concourse altogether  i was particularly pleased to see the irishmen who formed a  distinct society among themselves and mustered very strong with  their green scarves carrying their national harp and their  portrait of father mathew high above the peoples heads  they  looked as jolly and goodhumoured as ever and working here the  hardest for their living and doing any kind of sturdy labour that  came in their way were the most independent fellows there i  thought  the banners were very well painted and flaunted down the street  famously  there was the smiting of the rock and the gushing forth  of the waters and there was a temperate man with considerable of  a hatchet as the standardbearer would probably have said  aiming a deadly blow at a serpent which was apparently about to  spring upon him from the top of a barrel of spirits  but the chief  feature of this part of the show was a huge allegorical device  borne among the shipcarpenters on one side whereof the steamboat  alcohol was represented bursting her boiler and exploding with a  great crash while upon the other the good ship temperance sailed  away with a fair wind to the hearts content of the captain crew  and passengers  after going round the town the procession repaired to a certain  appointed place where as the printed programme set forth it  would be received by the children of the different free schools  singing temperance songs  i was prevented from getting there in  time to hear these little warblers or to report upon this novel  kind of vocal entertainment  novel at least to me  but i found  in a large open space each society gathered round its own banners  and listening in silent attention to its own orator  the speeches  judging from the little i could hear of them were certainly  adapted to the occasion as having that degree of relationship to  cold water which wet blankets may claim  but the main thing was  the conduct and appearance of the audience throughout the day and  that was admirable and full of promise  cincinnati is honourably famous for its free schools of which it  has so many that no persons child among its population can by  possibility want the means of education which are extended upon  an average to four thousand pupils annually  i was only present  in one of these establishments during the hours of instruction  in  the boys department which was full of little urchins varying in  their ages i should say from six years old to ten or twelve the  master offered to institute an extemporary examination of the  pupils in algebra a proposal which as i was by no means  confident of my ability to detect mistakes in that science i  declined with some alarm  in the girls school reading was  proposed and as i felt tolerably equal to that art i expressed my  willingness to hear a class  books were distributed accordingly  and some halfdozen girls relieved each other in reading paragraphs  from english history  but it seemed to be a dry compilation  infinitely above their powers and when they had blundered through  three or four dreary passages concerning the treaty of amiens and  other thrilling topics of the same nature obviously without  comprehending ten words i expressed myself quite satisfied  it  is very possible that they only mounted to this exalted stave in  the ladder of learning for the astonishment of a visitor and that  at other times they keep upon its lower rounds but i should have  been much better pleased and satisfied if i had heard them  exercised in simpler lessons which they understood  as in every other place i visited the judges here were gentlemen  of high character and attainments  i was in one of the courts for  a few minutes and found it like those to which i have already  referred  a nuisance cause was trying there were not many  spectators and the witnesses counsel and jury formed a sort of  family circle sufficiently jocose and snug  the society with which i mingled was intelligent courteous and  agreeable  the inhabitants of cincinnati are proud of their city  as one of the most interesting in america  and with good reason   for beautiful and thriving as it is now and containing as it  does a population of fifty thousand souls but twoandfifty years  have passed away since the ground on which it stands bought at  that time for a few dollars was a wild wood and its citizens were  but a handful of dwellers in scattered log huts upon the rivers  shore    chapter xii  from cincinnati to louisville in another western  steamboat and from louisville to st louis in another  st louis    leaving cincinnati at eleven oclock in the forenoon we embarked  for louisville in the pike steamboat which carrying the mails  was a packet of a much better class than that in which we had come  from pittsburg  as this passage does not occupy more than twelve  or thirteen hours we arranged to go ashore that night  not  coveting the distinction of sleeping in a stateroom when it was  possible to sleep anywhere else  there chanced to be on board this boat in addition to the usual  dreary crowd of passengers one pitchlynn a chief of the choctaw  tribe of indians who sent in his card to me and with whom i had  the pleasure of a long conversation  he spoke english perfectly well though he had not begun to learn  the language he told me until he was a young man grown  he had  read many books and scotts poetry appeared to have left a strong  impression on his mind  especially the opening of the lady of the  lake and the great battle scene in marmion in which no doubt  from the congeniality of the subjects to his own pursuits and  tastes he had great interest and delight  he appeared to  understand correctly all he had read and whatever fiction had  enlisted his sympathy in its belief had done so keenly and  earnestly  i might almost say fiercely  he was dressed in our  ordinary everyday costume which hung about his fine figure  loosely and with indifferent grace  on my telling him that i  regretted not to see him in his own attire he threw up his right  arm for a moment as though he were brandishing some heavy weapon  and answered as he let it fall again that his race were losing  many things besides their dress and would soon be seen upon the  earth no more  but he wore it at home he added proudly  he told me that he had been away from his home west of the  mississippi seventeen months  and was now returning  he had been  chiefly at washington on some negotiations pending between his  tribe and the government  which were not settled yet he said in a  melancholy way and he feared never would be  for what could a  few poor indians do against such wellskilled men of business as  the whites  he had no love for washington tired of towns and  cities very soon and longed for the forest and the prairie  i asked him what he thought of congress  he answered with a  smile that it wanted dignity in an indians eyes  he would very much like he said to see england before he died  and spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen  there  when i told him of that chamber in the british museum  wherein are preserved household memorials of a race that ceased to  be thousands of years ago he was very attentive and it was not  hard to see that he had a reference in his mind to the gradual  fading away of his own people  this led us to speak of mr catlins gallery which he praised  highly  observing that his own portrait was among the collection  and that all the likenesses were elegant  mr cooper he said  had painted the red man well and so would i he knew if i would  go home with him and hunt buffaloes which he was quite anxious i  should do  when i told him that supposing i went i should not be  very likely to damage the buffaloes much he took it as a great  joke and laughed heartily  he was a remarkably handsome man some years past forty i should  judge with long black hair an aquiline nose broad cheekbones a  sunburnt complexion and a very bright keen dark and piercing  eye  there were but twenty thousand of the choctaws left he said  and their number was decreasing every day  a few of his brother  chiefs had been obliged to become civilised and to make themselves  acquainted with what the whites knew for it was their only chance  of existence  but they were not many and the rest were as they  always had been  he dwelt on this  and said several times that  unless they tried to assimilate themselves to their conquerors  they must be swept away before the strides of civilised society  when we shook hands at parting i told him he must come to england  as he longed to see the land so much  that i should hope to see  him there one day  and that i could promise him he would be well  received and kindly treated  he was evidently pleased by this  assurance though he rejoined with a goodhumoured smile and an  arch shake of his head that the english used to be very fond of  the red men when they wanted their help but had not cared much for  them since  he took his leave as stately and complete a gentleman of natures  making as ever i beheld and moved among the people in the boat  another kind of being  he sent me a lithographed portrait of  himself soon afterwards very like though scarcely handsome  enough which i have carefully preserved in memory of our brief  acquaintance  there was nothing very interesting in the scenery of this days  journey which brought us at midnight to louisville  we slept at  the galt house a splendid hotel and were as handsomely lodged as  though we had been in paris rather than hundreds of miles beyond  the alleghanies  the city presenting no objects of sufficient interest to detain us  on our way we resolved to proceed next day by another steamboat  the fulton and to join it about noon at a suburb called  portland where it would be delayed some time in passing through a  canal  the interval after breakfast we devoted to riding through the  town which is regular and cheerful  the streets being laid out at  right angles and planted with young trees  the buildings are  smoky and blackened from the use of bituminous coal but an  englishman is well used to that appearance and indisposed to  quarrel with it  there did not appear to be much business  stirring and some unfinished buildings and improvements seemed to  intimate that the city had been overbuilt in the ardour of going ahead and was suffering under the reaction consequent upon such  feverish forcing of its powers  on our way to portland we passed a magistrates office which  amused me as looking far more like a dame school than any police  establishment  for this awful institution was nothing but a little  lazy goodfornothing front parlour open to the street wherein  two or three figures i presume the magistrate and his myrmidons  were basking in the sunshine the very effigies of languor and  repose  it was a perfect picture of justice retired from business  for want of customers her sword and scales sold off napping  comfortably with her legs upon the table  here as elsewhere in these parts the road was perfectly alive  with pigs of all ages lying about in every direction fast  asleep or grunting along in quest of hidden dainties  i had  always a sneaking kindness for these odd animals and found a  constant source of amusement when all others failed in watching  their proceedings  as we were riding along this morning i  observed a little incident between two youthful pigs which was so  very human as to be inexpressibly comical and grotesque at the  time though i dare say in telling it is tame enough  one young gentleman a very delicate porker with several straws  sticking about his nose betokening recent investigations in a  dunghill was walking deliberately on profoundly thinking when  suddenly his brother who was lying in a miry hole unseen by him  rose up immediately before his startled eyes ghostly with damp  mud  never was pigs whole mass of blood so turned  he started  back at least three feet gazed for a moment and then shot off as  hard as he could go  his excessively little tail vibrating with  speed and terror like a distracted pendulum  but before he had  gone very far he began to reason with himself as to the nature of  this frightful appearance and as he reasoned he relaxed his speed  by gradual degrees until at last he stopped and faced about   there was his brother with the mud upon him glazing in the sun  yet staring out of the very same hole perfectly amazed at his  proceedings  he was no sooner assured of this and he assured  himself so carefully that one may almost say he shaded his eyes  with his hand to see the better than he came back at a round trot  pounced upon him and summarily took off a piece of his tail as a  caution to him to be careful what he was about for the future and  never to play tricks with his family any more  we found the steamboat in the canal waiting for the slow process  of getting through the lock and went on board where we shortly  afterwards had a new kind of visitor in the person of a certain  kentucky giant whose name is porter and who is of the moderate  height of seven feet eight inches in his stockings  there never was a race of people who so completely gave the lie to  history as these giants or whom all the chroniclers have so  cruelly libelled  instead of roaring and ravaging about the world  constantly catering for their cannibal larders and perpetually  going to market in an unlawful manner they are the meekest people  in any mans acquaintance  rather inclining to milk and vegetable  diet and bearing anything for a quiet life  so decidedly are  amiability and mildness their characteristics that i confess i  look upon that youth who distinguished himself by the slaughter of  these inoffensive persons as a falsehearted brigand who  pretending to philanthropic motives was secretly influenced only  by the wealth stored up within their castles and the hope of  plunder  and i lean the more to this opinion from finding that  even the historian of those exploits with all his partiality for  his hero is fain to admit that the slaughtered monsters in  question were of a very innocent and simple turn extremely  guileless and ready of belief lending a credulous ear to the most  improbable tales suffering themselves to be easily entrapped into  pits and even as in the case of the welsh giant with an excess  of the hospitable politeness of a landlord ripping themselves  open rather than hint at the possibility of their guests being  versed in the vagabond arts of sleightofhand and hocuspocus  the kentucky giant was but another illustration of the truth of  this position  he had a weakness in the region of the knees and a  trustfulness in his long face which appealed even to fivefeet  nine for encouragement and support  he was only twentyfive years  old he said and had grown recently for it had been found  necessary to make an addition to the legs of his inexpressibles   at fifteen he was a short boy and in those days his english father  and his irish mother had rather snubbed him as being too small of  stature to sustain the credit of the family  he added that his  health had not been good though it was better now but short  people are not wanting who whisper that he drinks too hard  i understand he drives a hackneycoach though how he does it  unless he stands on the footboard behind and lies along the roof  upon his chest with his chin in the box it would be difficult to  comprehend  he brought his gun with him as a curiosity  christened the little rifle and displayed outside a shopwindow  it would make the fortune of any retail business in holborn  when  he had shown himself and talked a little while he withdrew with  his pocketinstrument and went bobbing down the cabin among men  of six feet high and upwards like a lighthouse walking among  lampposts  within a few minutes afterwards we were out of the canal and in  the ohio river again  the arrangements of the boat were like those of the messenger and  the passengers were of the same order of people  we fed at the  same times on the same kind of viands in the same dull manner  and with the same observances  the company appeared to be  oppressed by the same tremendous concealments and had as little  capacity of enjoyment or lightheartedness  i never in my life did  see such listless heavy dulness as brooded over these meals  the  very recollection of it weighs me down and makes me for the  moment wretched  reading and writing on my knee in our little  cabin i really dreaded the coming of the hour that summoned us to  table and was as glad to escape from it again as if it had been a  penance or a punishment  healthy cheerfulness and good spirits  forming a part of the banquet i could soak my crusts in the  fountain with le sages strolling player and revel in their glad  enjoyment  but sitting down with so many fellowanimals to ward  off thirst and hunger as a business to empty each creature his  yahoos trough as quickly as he can and then slink sullenly away  to have these social sacraments stripped of everything but the mere  greedy satisfaction of the natural cravings goes so against the  grain with me that i seriously believe the recollection of these  funeral feasts will be a waking nightmare to me all my life  there was some relief in this boat too which there had not been  in the other for the captain a blunt goodnatured fellow had  his handsome wife with him who was disposed to be lively and  agreeable as were a few other ladypassengers who had their seats  about us at the same end of the table  but nothing could have made  head against the depressing influence of the general body  there  was a magnetism of dulness in them which would have beaten down the  most facetious companion that the earth ever knew  a jest would  have been a crime and a smile would have faded into a grinning  horror  such deadly leaden people such systematic plodding  weary insupportable heaviness such a mass of animated indigestion  in respect of all that was genial jovial frank social or  hearty never sure was brought together elsewhere since the world  began  nor was the scenery as we approached the junction of the ohio and  mississippi rivers at all inspiriting in its influence  the trees  were stunted in their growth the banks were low and flat the  settlements and log cabins fewer in number  their inhabitants more  wan and wretched than any we had encountered yet  no songs of  birds were in the air no pleasant scents no moving lights and  shadows from swift passing clouds  hour after hour the changeless  glare of the hot unwinking sky shone upon the same monotonous  objects  hour after hour the river rolled along as wearily and  slowly as the time itself  at length upon the morning of the third day we arrived at a spot  so much more desolate than any we had yet beheld that the  forlornest places we had passed were in comparison with it full  of interest  at the junction of the two rivers on ground so flat  and low and marshy that at certain seasons of the year it is  inundated to the housetops lies a breedingplace of fever ague  and death vaunted in england as a mine of golden hope and  speculated in on the faith of monstrous representations to many  peoples ruin  a dismal swamp on which the halfbuilt houses rot  away  cleared here and there for the space of a few yards and  teeming then with rank unwholesome vegetation in whose baleful  shade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither droop and  die and lay their bones the hateful mississippi circling and  eddying before it and turning off upon its southern course a slimy  monster hideous to behold a hotbed of disease an ugly sepulchre  a grave uncheered by any gleam of promise  a place without one  single quality in earth or air or water to commend it  such is  this dismal cairo  but what words shall describe the mississippi great father of  rivers who praise be to heaven has no young children like him   an enormous ditch sometimes two or three miles wide running  liquid mud six miles an hour  its strong and frothy current  choked and obstructed everywhere by huge logs and whole forest  trees  now twining themselves together in great rafts from the  interstices of which a sedgy lazy foam works up to float upon the  waters top now rolling past like monstrous bodies their tangled  roots showing like matted hair now glancing singly by like giant  leeches and now writhing round and round in the vortex of some  small whirlpool like wounded snakes  the banks low the trees  dwarfish the marshes swarming with frogs the wretched cabins few  and far apart their inmates hollowcheeked and pale the weather  very hot mosquitoes penetrating into every crack and crevice of  the boat mud and slime on everything  nothing pleasant in its  aspect but the harmless lightning which flickers every night upon  the dark horizon  for two days we toiled up this foul stream striking constantly  against the floating timber or stopping to avoid those more  dangerous obstacles the snags or sawyers which are the hidden  trunks of trees that have their roots below the tide  when the  nights are very dark the lookout stationed in the head of the  boat knows by the ripple of the water if any great impediment be  near at hand and rings a bell beside him which is the signal for  the engine to be stopped  but always in the night this bell has  work to do and after every ring there comes a blow which renders  it no easy matter to remain in bed  the decline of day here was very gorgeous tingeing the firmament  deeply with red and gold up to the very keystone of the arch above  us  as the sun went down behind the bank the slightest blades of  grass upon it seemed to become as distinctly visible as the  arteries in the skeleton of a leaf and when as it slowly sank  the red and golden bars upon the water grew dimmer and dimmer yet  as if they were sinking too and all the glowing colours of  departing day paled inch by inch before the sombre night the  scene became a thousand times more lonesome and more dreary than  before and all its influences darkened with the sky  we drank the muddy water of this river while we were upon it  it  is considered wholesome by the natives and is something more  opaque than gruel  i have seen water like it at the filtershops  but nowhere else  on the fourth night after leaving louisville we reached st louis  and here i witnessed the conclusion of an incident trifling enough  in itself but very pleasant to see which had interested me during  the whole journey  there was a little woman on board with a little baby and both  little woman and little child were cheerful goodlooking bright eyed and fair to see  the little woman had been passing a long  time with her sick mother in new york and had left her home in st  louis in that condition in which ladies who truly love their lords  desire to be  the baby was born in her mothers house and she had  not seen her husband to whom she was now returning for twelve  months  having left him a month or two after their marriage  well to be sure there never was a little woman so full of hope  and tenderness and love and anxiety as this little woman was   and all day long she wondered whether he would be at the wharf  and whether he had got her letter and whether if she sent the  baby ashore by somebody else he would know it meeting it in the  street  which seeing that he had never set eyes upon it in his  life was not very likely in the abstract but was probable enough  to the young mother  she was such an artless little creature and  was in such a sunny beaming hopeful state and let out all this  matter clinging close about her heart so freely that all the  other lady passengers entered into the spirit of it as much as she  and the captain who heard all about it from his wife was wondrous  sly i promise you  inquiring every time we met at table as in  forgetfulness whether she expected anybody to meet her at st  louis and whether she would want to go ashore the night we reached  it but he supposed she wouldnt and cutting many other dry jokes  of that nature  there was one little weazen driedapplefaced old  woman who took occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands in such  circumstances of bereavement and there was another lady with a  lapdog old enough to moralize on the lightness of human  affections and yet not so old that she could help nursing the  baby now and then or laughing with the rest when the little  woman called it by its fathers name and asked it all manner of  fantastic questions concerning him in the joy of her heart  it was something of a blow to the little woman that when we were  within twenty miles of our destination it became clearly necessary  to put this baby to bed  but she got over it with the same good  humour tied a handkerchief round her head and came out into the  little gallery with the rest  then such an oracle as she became  in reference to the localities and such facetiousness as was  displayed by the married ladies and such sympathy as was shown by  the single ones and such peals of laughter as the little woman  herself who would just as soon have cried greeted every jest  with  at last there were the lights of st louis and here was the  wharf and those were the steps  and the little woman covering her  face with her hands and laughing or seeming to laugh more than  ever ran into her own cabin and shut herself up  i have no doubt  that in the charming inconsistency of such excitement she stopped  her ears lest she should hear him asking for her  but i did not  see her do it  then a great crowd of people rushed on board though the boat was  not yet made fast but was wandering about among the other boats  to find a landingplace  and everybody looked for the husband   and nobody saw him  when in the midst of us all  heaven knows  how she ever got there  there was the little woman clinging with  both arms tight round the neck of a fine goodlooking sturdy  young fellow and in a moment afterwards there she was again  actually clapping her little hands for joy as she dragged him  through the small door of her small cabin to look at the baby as  he lay asleep  we went to a large hotel called the planters house  built like  an english hospital with long passages and bare walls and sky lights above the roomdoors for the free circulation of air  there  were a great many boarders in it and as many lights sparkled and  glistened from the windows down into the street below when we  drove up as if it had been illuminated on some occasion of  rejoicing  it is an excellent house and the proprietors have most  bountiful notions of providing the creature comforts  dining alone  with my wife in our own room one day i counted fourteen dishes on  the table at once  in the old french portion of the town the thoroughfares are narrow  and crooked and some of the houses are very quaint and  picturesque  being built of wood with tumbledown galleries  before the windows approachable by stairs or rather ladders from  the street  there are queer little barbers shops and drinking houses too in this quarter and abundance of crazy old tenements  with blinking casements such as may be seen in flanders  some of  these ancient habitations with high garret gablewindows perking  into the roofs have a kind of french shrug about them and being  lopsided with age appear to hold their heads askew besides as  if they were grimacing in astonishment at the american  improvements  it is hardly necessary to say that these consist of wharfs and  warehouses and new buildings in all directions and of a great  many vast plans which are still progressing  already however  some very good houses broad streets and marblefronted shops  have gone so far ahead as to be in a state of completion and the  town bids fair in a few years to improve considerably  though it  is not likely ever to vie in point of elegance or beauty with  cincinnati  the roman catholic religion introduced here by the early french  settlers prevails extensively  among the public institutions are  a jesuit college a convent for the ladies of the sacred heart  and a large chapel attached to the college which was in course of  erection at the time of my visit and was intended to be  consecrated on the second of december in the next year  the  architect of this building is one of the reverend fathers of the  school and the works proceed under his sole direction  the organ  will be sent from belgium  in addition to these establishments there is a roman catholic  cathedral dedicated to saint francis xavier and a hospital  founded by the munificence of a deceased resident who was a member  of that church  it also sends missionaries from hence among the  indian tribes  the unitarian church is represented in this remote place as in  most other parts of america by a gentleman of great worth and  excellence  the poor have good reason to remember and bless it  for it befriends them and aids the cause of rational education  without any sectarian or selfish views  it is liberal in all its  actions of kind construction and of wide benevolence  there are three freeschools already erected and in full operation  in this city  a fourth is building and will soon be opened  no man ever admits the unhealthiness of the place he dwells in  unless he is going away from it and i shall therefore i have no  doubt be at issue with the inhabitants of st louis in  questioning the perfect salubrity of its climate and in hinting  that i think it must rather dispose to fever in the summer and  autumnal seasons  just adding that it is very hot lies among  great rivers and has vast tracts of undrained swampy land around  it i leave the reader to form his own opinion  as i had a great desire to see a prairie before turning back from  the furthest point of my wanderings and as some gentlemen of the  town had in their hospitable consideration an equal desire to  gratify me a day was fixed before my departure for an expedition  to the lookingglass prairie which is within thirty miles of the  town  deeming it possible that my readers may not object to know  what kind of thing such a gipsy party may be at that distance from  home and among what sort of objects it moves i will describe the  jaunt in another chapter    chapter xiii  a jaunt to the lookingglass prairie and back    i may premise that the word prairie is variously pronounced  paraaer parearer paroarer  the latter mode of pronunciation is  perhaps the most in favour  we were fourteen in all and all young men  indeed it is a  singular though very natural feature in the society of these  distant settlements that it is mainly composed of adventurous  persons in the prime of life and has very few grey heads among it   there were no ladies  the trip being a fatiguing one  and we were  to start at five oclock in the morning punctually  i was called at four that i might be certain of keeping nobody  waiting and having got some bread and milk for breakfast threw up  the window and looked down into the street expecting to see the  whole party busily astir and great preparations going on below   but as everything was very quiet and the street presented that  hopeless aspect with which five oclock in the morning is familiar  elsewhere i deemed it as well to go to bed again and went  accordingly  i woke again at seven oclock and by that time the party had  assembled and were gathered round one light carriage with a very  stout axletree one something on wheels like an amateur carriers  cart one double phaeton of great antiquity and unearthly  construction one gig with a great hole in its back and a broken  head and one rider on horseback who was to go on before  i got  into the first coach with three companions the rest bestowed  themselves in the other vehicles two large baskets were made fast  to the lightest two large stone jars in wicker cases technically  known as demijohns were consigned to the least rowdy of the  party for safekeeping and the procession moved off to the  ferryboat in which it was to cross the river bodily men horses  carriages and all as the manner in these parts is  we got over the river in due course and mustered again before a  little wooden box on wheels hove down all aslant in a morass with  merchant tailor painted in very large letters over the door   having settled the order of proceeding and the road to be taken  we started off once more and began to make our way through an ill favoured black hollow called less expressively the american  bottom  the previous day had been  not to say hot for the term is weak  and lukewarm in its power of conveying an idea of the temperature   the town had been on fire in a blaze  but at night it had come on  to rain in torrents and all night long it had rained without  cessation  we had a pair of very strong horses but travelled at  the rate of little more than a couple of miles an hour through one  unbroken slough of black mud and water  it had no variety but in  depth  now it was only half over the wheels now it hid the  axletree and now the coach sank down in it almost to the windows   the air resounded in all directions with the loud chirping of the  frogs who with the pigs a coarse ugly breed as unwholesome looking as though they were the spontaneous growth of the country  had the whole scene to themselves  here and there we passed a log  hut  but the wretched cabins were wide apart and thinly scattered  for though the soil is very rich in this place few people can  exist in such a deadly atmosphere  on either side of the track if  it deserve the name was the thick bush and everywhere was  stagnant slimy rotten filthy water  as it is the custom in these parts to give a horse a gallon or so  of cold water whenever he is in a foam with heat we halted for  that purpose at a log inn in the wood far removed from any other  residence  it consisted of one room bareroofed and barewalled  of course with a loft above  the ministering priest was a swarthy  young savage in a shirt of cotton print like bedfurniture and a  pair of ragged trousers  there were a couple of young boys too  nearly naked lying idle by the well and they and he and the  traveller at the inn turned out to look at us  the traveller was an old man with a grey gristly beard two inches  long a shaggy moustache of the same hue and enormous eyebrows  which almost obscured his lazy semidrunken glance as he stood  regarding us with folded arms  poising himself alternately upon  his toes and heels  on being addressed by one of the party he  drew nearer and said rubbing his chin which scraped under his  horny hand like fresh gravel beneath a nailed shoe that he was  from delaware and had lately bought a farm down there pointing  into one of the marshes where the stunted trees were thickest  he  was going he added to st louis to fetch his family whom he  had left behind but he seemed in no great hurry to bring on these  incumbrances for when we moved away he loitered back into the  cabin and was plainly bent on stopping there so long as his money  lasted  he was a great politician of course and explained his  opinions at some length to one of our company but i only remember  that he concluded with two sentiments one of which was somebody  for ever and the other blast everybody else which is by no means  a bad abstract of the general creed in these matters  when the horses were swollen out to about twice their natural  dimensions there seems to be an idea here that this kind of  inflation improves their going we went forward again through mud  and mire and damp and festering heat and brake and bush  attended always by the music of the frogs and pigs until nearly  noon when we halted at a place called belleville  belleville was a small collection of wooden houses huddled  together in the very heart of the bush and swamp  many of them had  singularly bright doors of red and yellow for the place had been  lately visited by a travelling painter who got along as i was  told by eating his way  the criminal court was sitting and was  at that moment trying some criminals for horsestealing  with whom  it would most likely go hard  for live stock of all kinds being  necessarily very much exposed in the woods is held by the  community in rather higher value than human life and for this  reason juries generally make a point of finding all men indicted  for cattlestealing guilty whether or no  the horses belonging to the bar the judge and witnesses were  tied to temporary racks set up roughly in the road by which is to  be understood a forest path nearly kneedeep in mud and slime  there was an hotel in this place which like all hotels in  america had its large diningroom for the public table  it was an  odd shambling lowroofed outhouse halfcowshed and half kitchen with a coarse brown canvas tablecloth and tin sconces  stuck against the walls to hold candles at suppertime  the  horseman had gone forward to have coffee and some eatables  prepared and they were by this time nearly ready  he had ordered  wheatbread and chicken fixings in preference to cornbread and  common doings  the latter kind of rejection includes only pork  and bacon  the former comprehends broiled ham sausages veal  cutlets steaks and such other viands of that nature as may be  supposed by a tolerably wide poetical construction to fix a  chicken comfortably in the digestive organs of any lady or  gentleman  on one of the doorposts at this inn was a tin plate whereon was  inscribed in characters of gold doctor crocus and on a sheet of  paper pasted up by the side of this plate was a written  announcement that dr crocus would that evening deliver a lecture  on phrenology for the benefit of the belleville public at a  charge for admission of so much a head  straying upstairs during the preparation of the chicken fixings  i happened to pass the doctors chamber and as the door stood wide  open and the room was empty i made bold to peep in  it was a bare unfurnished comfortless room with an unframed  portrait hanging up at the head of the bed a likeness i take it  of the doctor for the forehead was fully displayed and great  stress was laid by the artist upon its phrenological developments   the bed itself was covered with an old patchwork counterpane  the  room was destitute of carpet or of curtain  there was a damp  fireplace without any stove full of wood ashes a chair and a  very small table and on the lastnamed piece of furniture was  displayed in grand array the doctors library consisting of some  halfdozen greasy old books  now it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole  earth out of which any man would be likely to get anything to do  him good  but the door as i have said stood coaxingly open and  plainly said in conjunction with the chair the portrait the  table and the books walk in gentlemen walk in  dont be ill  gentlemen when you may be well in no time  doctor crocus is here  gentlemen the celebrated dr crocus  dr crocus has come all this  way to cure you gentlemen  if you havent heard of dr crocus  its your fault gentlemen who live a little way out of the world  here  not dr crocuss  walk in gentlemen walk in  in the passage below when i went downstairs again was dr crocus  himself  a crowd had flocked in from the court house and a voice  from among them called out to the landlord colonel introduce  doctor crocus  mr dickens says the colonel doctor crocus  upon which doctor crocus who is a tall finelooking scotchman  but rather fierce and warlike in appearance for a professor of the  peaceful art of healing bursts out of the concourse with his right  arm extended and his chest thrown out as far as it will possibly  come and says  your countryman sir  whereupon doctor crocus and i shake hands and doctor crocus looks  as if i didnt by any means realise his expectations which in a  linen blouse and a great straw hat with a green ribbon and no  gloves and my face and nose profusely ornamented with the stings  of mosquitoes and the bites of bugs it is very likely i did not  long in these parts sir says i  three or four months sir says the doctor  do you think of soon returning to the old country says i  doctor crocus makes no verbal answer but gives me an imploring  look which says so plainly will you ask me that again a little  louder if you please that i repeat the question  think of soon returning to the old country sir repeats the  doctor  to the old country sir i rejoin  doctor crocus looks round upon the crowd to observe the effect he  produces rubs his hands and says in a very loud voice  not yet awhile sir not yet  you wont catch me at that just  yet sir  i am a little too fond of freedom for that sir  ha  ha  its not so easy for a man to tear himself from a free country  such as this is sir  ha ha  no no  ha ha  none of that till  ones obliged to do it sir  no no  as doctor crocus says these latter words he shakes his head  knowingly and laughs again  many of the bystanders shake their  heads in concert with the doctor and laugh too and look at each  other as much as to say a pretty bright and firstrate sort of  chap is crocus and unless i am very much mistaken a good many  people went to the lecture that night who never thought about  phrenology or about doctor crocus either in all their lives  before  from belleville we went on through the same desolate kind of  waste and constantly attended without the interval of a moment  by the same music until at three oclock in the afternoon we  halted once more at a village called lebanon to inflate the horses  again and give them some corn besides  of which they stood much  in need  pending this ceremony i walked into the village where i  met a fullsized dwellinghouse coming downhill at a round trot  drawn by a score or more of oxen  the publichouse was so very clean and good a one that the  managers of the jaunt resolved to return to it and put up there for  the night if possible  this course decided on and the horses  being well refreshed we again pushed forward and came upon the  prairie at sunset  it would be difficult to say why or how  though it was possibly  from having heard and read so much about it  but the effect on me  was disappointment  looking towards the setting sun there lay  stretched out before my view a vast expanse of level ground  unbroken save by one thin line of trees which scarcely amounted  to a scratch upon the great blank until it met the glowing sky  wherein it seemed to dip  mingling with its rich colours and  mellowing in its distant blue  there it lay a tranquil sea or  lake without water if such a simile be admissible with the day  going down upon it  a few birds wheeling here and there  and  solitude and silence reigning paramount around  but the grass was  not yet high there were bare black patches on the ground and the  few wild flowers that the eye could see were poor and scanty   great as the picture was its very flatness and extent which left  nothing to the imagination tamed it down and cramped its interest   i felt little of that sense of freedom and exhilaration which a  scottish heath inspires or even our english downs awaken  it was  lonely and wild but oppressive in its barren monotony  i felt  that in traversing the prairies i could never abandon myself to  the scene forgetful of all else as i should do instinctively  were the heather underneath my feet or an ironbound coast beyond  but should often glance towards the distant and frequentlyreceding  line of the horizon and wish it gained and passed  it is not a  scene to be forgotten but it is scarcely one i think at all  events as i saw it to remember with much pleasure or to covet  the lookingon again in afterlife  we encamped near a solitary loghouse for the sake of its water  and dined upon the plain  the baskets contained roast fowls  buffalos tongue an exquisite dainty by the way ham bread  cheese and butter biscuits champagne sherry lemons and sugar  for punch and abundance of rough ice  the meal was delicious and  the entertainers were the soul of kindness and good humour  i have  often recalled that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection  since and shall not easily forget in junketings nearer home with  friends of older date my boon companions on the prairie  returning to lebanon that night we lay at the little inn at which  we had halted in the afternoon  in point of cleanliness and  comfort it would have suffered by no comparison with any english  alehouse of a homely kind in england  rising at five oclock next morning i took a walk about the  village  none of the houses were strolling about today but it  was early for them yet perhaps  and then amused myself by  lounging in a kind of farmyard behind the tavern of which the  leading features were a strange jumble of rough sheds for stables  a rude colonnade built as a cool place of summer resort a deep  well a great earthen mound for keeping vegetables in in winter  time and a pigeonhouse whose little apertures looked as they do  in all pigeonhouses very much too small for the admission of the  plump and swellingbreasted birds who were strutting about it  though they tried to get in never so hard  that interest  exhausted i took a survey of the inns two parlours which were  decorated with coloured prints of washington and president  madison and of a whitefaced young lady much speckled by the  flies who held up her gold neckchain for the admiration of the  spectator and informed all admiring comers that she was just  seventeen although i should have thought her older  in the best  room were two oil portraits of the kitcat size representing the  landlord and his infant son both looking as bold as lions and  staring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been  cheap at any price  they were painted i think by the artist who  had touched up the belleville doors with red and gold for i seemed  to recognise his style immediately  after breakfast we started to return by a different way from that  which we had taken yesterday and coming up at ten oclock with an  encampment of german emigrants carrying their goods in carts who  had made a rousing fire which they were just quitting stopped  there to refresh  and very pleasant the fire was for hot though  it had been yesterday it was quite cold today and the wind blew  keenly  looming in the distance as we rode along was another of  the ancient indian burialplaces called the monks mound in  memory of a body of fanatics of the order of la trappe who founded  a desolate convent there many years ago when there were no  settlers within a thousand miles and were all swept off by the  pernicious climate  in which lamentable fatality few rational  people will suppose perhaps that society experienced any very  severe deprivation  the track of today had the same features as the track of  yesterday  there was the swamp the bush and the perpetual chorus  of frogs the rank unseemly growth the unwholesome steaming earth   here and there and frequently too we encountered a solitary  brokendown waggon full of some new settlers goods  it was a  pitiful sight to see one of these vehicles deep in the mire the  axletree broken the wheel lying idly by its side the man gone  miles away to look for assistance the woman seated among their  wandering household gods with a baby at her breast a picture of  forlorn dejected patience the team of oxen crouching down  mournfully in the mud and breathing forth such clouds of vapour  from their mouths and nostrils that all the damp mist and fog  around seemed to have come direct from them  in due time we mustered once again before the merchant tailors  and having done so crossed over to the city in the ferryboat   passing on the way a spot called bloody island the duelling ground of st louis and so designated in honour of the last fatal  combat fought there which was with pistols breast to breast   both combatants fell dead upon the ground and possibly some  rational people may think of them as of the gloomy madmen on the  monks mound that they were no great loss to the community    chapter xiv  return to cincinnati  a stagecoach ride from that  city to columbus and thence to sandusky  so by lake erie to the  falls of niagara    as i had a desire to travel through the interior of the state of  ohio and to strike the lakes as the phrase is at a small town  called sandusky to which that route would conduct us on our way to  niagara we had to return from st louis by the way we had come  and to retrace our former track as far as cincinnati  the day on which we were to take leave of st louis being very  fine and the steamboat which was to have started i dont know how  early in the morning postponing for the third or fourth time her  departure until the afternoon we rode forward to an old french  village on the river called properly carondelet and nicknamed  vide poche and arranged that the packet should call for us there  the place consisted of a few poor cottages and two or three  publichouses the state of whose larders certainly seemed to  justify the second designation of the village for there was  nothing to eat in any of them  at length however by going back  some half a mile or so we found a solitary house where ham and  coffee were procurable and there we tarried to wait the advent of  the boat which would come in sight from the green before the door  a long way off  it was a neat unpretending village tavern and we took our repast  in a quaint little room with a bed in it decorated with some old  oil paintings which in their time had probably done duty in a  catholic chapel or monastery  the fare was very good and served  with great cleanliness  the house was kept by a characteristic old  couple with whom we had a long talk and who were perhaps a very  good sample of that kind of people in the west  the landlord was a dry tough hardfaced old fellow not so very  old either for he was but just turned sixty i should think who  had been out with the militia in the last war with england and had  seen all kinds of service  except a battle and he had been very  near seeing that he added  very near  he had all his life been  restless and locomotive with an irresistible desire for change  and was still the son of his old self  for if he had nothing to  keep him at home he said slightly jerking his hat and his thumb  towards the window of the room in which the old lady sat as we  stood talking in front of the house he would clean up his musket  and be off to texas tomorrow morning  he was one of the very many  descendants of cain proper to this continent who seem destined  from their birth to serve as pioneers in the great human army  who  gladly go on from year to year extending its outposts and leaving  home after home behind them and die at last utterly regardless of  their graves being left thousands of miles behind by the wandering  generation who succeed  his wife was a domesticated kindhearted old soul who had come  with him from the queen city of the world which it seemed was  philadelphia but had no love for this western country and indeed  had little reason to bear it any having seen her children one by  one die here of fever in the full prime and beauty of their  youth  her heart was sore she said to think of them and to talk  on this theme even to strangers in that blighted place so far  from her old home eased it somewhat and became a melancholy  pleasure  the boat appearing towards evening we bade adieu to the poor old  lady and her vagrant spouse and making for the nearest landing place were soon on board the messenger again in our old cabin  and steaming down the mississippi  if the coming up this river slowly making head against the stream  be an irksome journey the shooting down it with the turbid current  is almost worse for then the boat proceeding at the rate of  twelve or fifteen miles an hour has to force its passage through a  labyrinth of floating logs which in the dark it is often  impossible to see beforehand or avoid  all that night the bell  was never silent for five minutes at a time and after every ring  the vessel reeled again sometimes beneath a single blow sometimes  beneath a dozen dealt in quick succession the lightest of which  seemed more than enough to beat in her frail keel as though it had  been piecrust  looking down upon the filthy river after dark it  seemed to be alive with monsters as these black masses rolled upon  the surface or came starting up again head first when the boat  in ploughing her way among a shoal of such obstructions drove a  few among them for the moment under water  sometimes the engine  stopped during a long interval and then before her and behind and  gathering close about her on all sides were so many of these ill favoured obstacles that she was fairly hemmed in the centre of a  floating island and was constrained to pause until they parted  somewhere as dark clouds will do before the wind and opened by  degrees a channel out  in good time next morning however we came again in sight of the  detestable morass called cairo and stopping there to take in wood  lay alongside a barge whose starting timbers scarcely held  together  it was moored to the bank and on its side was painted  coffee house that being i suppose the floating paradise to  which the people fly for shelter when they lose their houses for a  month or two beneath the hideous waters of the mississippi  but  looking southward from this point we had the satisfaction of  seeing that intolerable river dragging its slimy length and ugly  freight abruptly off towards new orleans and passing a yellow line  which stretched across the current were again upon the clear ohio  never i trust to see the mississippi more saving in troubled  dreams and nightmares  leaving it for the company of its sparkling  neighbour was like the transition from pain to ease or the  awakening from a horrible vision to cheerful realities  we arrived at louisville on the fourth night and gladly availed  ourselves of its excellent hotel  next day we went on in the ben  franklin a beautiful mail steamboat and reached cincinnati  shortly after midnight  being by this time nearly tired of  sleeping upon shelves we had remained awake to go ashore  straightway and groping a passage across the dark decks of other  boats and among labyrinths of enginemachinery and leaking casks  of molasses we reached the streets knocked up the porter at the  hotel where we had stayed before and were to our great joy  safely housed soon afterwards  we rested but one day at cincinnati and then resumed our journey  to sandusky  as it comprised two varieties of stagecoach  travelling which with those i have already glanced at comprehend  the main characteristics of this mode of transit in america i will  take the reader as our fellowpassenger and pledge myself to  perform the distance with all possible despatch  our place of destination in the first instance is columbus  it is  distant about a hundred and twenty miles from cincinnati but there  is a macadamised road rare blessing the whole way and the rate  of travelling upon it is six miles an hour  we start at eight oclock in the morning in a great mailcoach  whose huge cheeks are so very ruddy and plethoric that it appears  to be troubled with a tendency of blood to the head  dropsical it  certainly is for it will hold a dozen passengers inside  but  wonderful to add it is very clean and bright being nearly new  and rattles through the streets of cincinnati gaily  our way lies through a beautiful country richly cultivated and  luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest  sometimes we pass  a field where the strong bristling stalks of indian corn look like  a crop of walkingsticks and sometimes an enclosure where the  green wheat is springing up among a labyrinth of stumps the  primitive wormfence is universal and an ugly thing it is but the  farms are neatly kept and save for these differences one might  be travelling just now in kent  we often stop to water at a roadside inn which is always dull and  silent  the coachman dismounts and fills his bucket and holds it  to the horses heads  there is scarcely ever any one to help him  there are seldom any loungers standing round and never any stable company with jokes to crack  sometimes when we have changed our  team there is a difficulty in starting again arising out of the  prevalent mode of breaking a young horse  which is to catch him  harness him against his will and put him in a stagecoach without  further notice  but we get on somehow or other after a great many  kicks and a violent struggle and jog on as before again  occasionally when we stop to change some two or three half drunken loafers will come loitering out with their hands in their  pockets or will be seen kicking their heels in rockingchairs or  lounging on the windowsill or sitting on a rail within the  colonnade  they have not often anything to say though either to  us or to each other but sit there idly staring at the coach and  horses  the landlord of the inn is usually among them and seems  of all the party to be the least connected with the business of  the house  indeed he is with reference to the tavern what the  driver is in relation to the coach and passengers  whatever  happens in his sphere of action he is quite indifferent and  perfectly easy in his mind  the frequent change of coachmen works no change or variety in the  coachmans character  he is always dirty sullen and taciturn   if he be capable of smartness of any kind moral or physical he  has a faculty of concealing it which is truly marvellous  he never  speaks to you as you sit beside him on the box and if you speak to  him he answers if at all in monosyllables  he points out  nothing on the road and seldom looks at anything  being to all  appearance thoroughly weary of it and of existence generally  as  to doing the honours of his coach his business as i have said is  with the horses  the coach follows because it is attached to them  and goes on wheels  not because you are in it  sometimes towards  the end of a long stage he suddenly breaks out into a discordant  fragment of an election song but his face never sings along with  him  it is only his voice and not often that  he always chews and always spits and never encumbers himself with  a pockethandkerchief  the consequences to the box passenger  especially when the wind blows towards him are not agreeable  whenever the coach stops and you can hear the voices of the inside  passengers or whenever any bystander addresses them or any one  among them or they address each other you will hear one phrase  repeated over and over and over again to the most extraordinary  extent  it is an ordinary and unpromising phrase enough being  neither more nor less than yes sir but it is adapted to every  variety of circumstance and fills up every pause in the  conversation  thus  the time is one oclock at noon  the scene a place where we are  to stay and dine on this journey  the coach drives up to the door  of an inn  the day is warm and there are several idlers lingering  about the tavern and waiting for the public dinner  among them  is a stout gentleman in a brown hat swinging himself to and fro in  a rockingchair on the pavement  as the coach stops a gentleman in a straw hat looks out of the  window  straw hat  to the stout gentleman in the rockingchair  i  reckon thats judge jefferson ant it  brown hat  still swinging speaking very slowly and without any  emotion whatever  yes sir  straw hat  warm weather judge  brown hat  yes sir  straw hat  there was a snap of cold last week  brown hat  yes sir  straw hat  yes sir  a pause  they look at each other very seriously  straw hat  i calculate youll have got through that case of the  corporation judge by this time now  brown hat  yes sir  straw hat  how did the verdict go sir  brown hat  for the defendant sir  straw hat  interrogatively  yes sir  brown hat affirmatively  yes sir  both  musingly as each gazes down the street  yes sir  another pause  they look at each other again still more seriously  than before  brown hat  this coach is rather behind its time today i guess  straw hat  doubtingly  yes sir  brown hat  looking at his watch  yes sir nigh upon two hours  straw hat  raising his eyebrows in very great surprise  yes  sir  brown hat  decisively as he puts up his watch  yes sir  all the other inside passengers  among themselves  yes sir  coachman  in a very surly tone  no it ant  straw hat  to the coachman  well i dont know sir  we were a  pretty tall time coming that last fifteen mile  thats a fact  the coachman making no reply and plainly declining to enter into  any controversy on a subject so far removed from his sympathies and  feelings another passenger says yes sir and the gentleman in  the straw hat in acknowledgment of his courtesy says yes sir  to him in return  the straw hat then inquires of the brown hat  whether that coach in which he the straw hat then sits is not a  new one  to which the brown hat again makes answer yes sir  straw hat  i thought so  pretty loud smell of varnish sir  brown hat  yes sir  all the other inside passengers  yes sir  brown hat  to the company in general  yes sir  the conversational powers of the company having been by this time  pretty heavily taxed the straw hat opens the door and gets out  and all the rest alight also  we dine soon afterwards with the  boarders in the house and have nothing to drink but tea and  coffee  as they are both very bad and the water is worse i ask  for brandy but it is a temperance hotel and spirits are not to be  had for love or money  this preposterous forcing of unpleasant  drinks down the reluctant throats of travellers is not at all  uncommon in america but i never discovered that the scruples of  such wincing landlords induced them to preserve any unusually nice  balance between the quality of their fare and their scale of  charges  on the contrary i rather suspected them of diminishing  the one and exalting the other by way of recompense for the loss  of their profit on the sale of spirituous liquors  after all  perhaps the plainest course for persons of such tender  consciences would be a total abstinence from tavernkeeping  dinner over we get into another vehicle which is ready at the door  for the coach has been changed in the interval and resume our  journey which continues through the same kind of country until  evening when we come to the town where we are to stop for tea and  supper and having delivered the mail bags at the postoffice ride  through the usual wide street lined with the usual stores and  houses the drapers always having hung up at their door by way of  sign a piece of bright red cloth to the hotel where this meal is  prepared  there being many boarders here we sit down a large  party and a very melancholy one as usual  but there is a buxom  hostess at the head of the table and opposite a simple welsh  schoolmaster with his wife and child who came here on a  speculation of greater promise than performance to teach the  classics  and they are sufficient subjects of interest until the  meal is over and another coach is ready  in it we go on once  more lighted by a bright moon until midnight when we stop to  change the coach again and remain for half an hour or so in a  miserable room with a blurred lithograph of washington over the  smoky fireplace and a mighty jug of cold water on the table  to  which refreshment the moody passengers do so apply themselves that  they would seem to be one and all keen patients of dr sangrado   among them is a very little boy who chews tobacco like a very big  one and a droning gentleman who talks arithmetically and  statistically on all subjects from poetry downwards and who  always speaks in the same key with exactly the same emphasis and  with very grave deliberation  he came outside just now and told  me how that the uncle of a certain young lady who had been spirited  away and married by a certain captain lived in these parts and  how this uncle was so valiant and ferocious that he shouldnt  wonder if he were to follow the said captain to england and shoot  him down in the street wherever he found him in the feasibility  of which strong measure i being for the moment rather prone to  contradiction from feeling half asleep and very tired declined to  acquiesce  assuring him that if the uncle did resort to it or  gratified any other little whim of the like nature he would find  himself one morning prematurely throttled at the old bailey  and  that he would do well to make his will before he went as he would  certainly want it before he had been in britain very long  on we go all night and byandby the day begins to break and  presently the first cheerful rays of the warm sun come slanting on  us brightly  it sheds its light upon a miserable waste of sodden  grass and dull trees and squalid huts whose aspect is forlorn  and grievous in the last degree  a very desert in the wood whose  growth of green is dank and noxious like that upon the top of  standing water  where poisonous fungus grows in the rare footprint  on the oozy ground and sprouts like witches coral from the  crevices in the cabin wall and floor it is a hideous thing to lie  upon the very threshold of a city  but it was purchased years ago  and as the owner cannot be discovered the state has been unable to  reclaim it  so there it remains in the midst of cultivation and  improvement like ground accursed and made obscene and rank by  some great crime  we reached columbus shortly before seven oclock and stayed there  to refresh that day and night  having excellent apartments in a  very large unfinished hotel called the neill house which were  richly fitted with the polished wood of the black walnut and  opened on a handsome portico and stone verandah like rooms in some  italian mansion  the town is clean and pretty and of course is  going to be much larger  it is the seat of the state legislature  of ohio and lays claim in consequence to some consideration and  importance  there being no stagecoach next day upon the road we wished to  take i hired an extra at a reasonable charge to carry us to  tiffin a small town from whence there is a railroad to sandusky   this extra was an ordinary fourhorse stagecoach such as i have  described changing horses and drivers as the stagecoach would  but was exclusively our own for the journey  to ensure our having  horses at the proper stations and being incommoded by no  strangers the proprietors sent an agent on the box who was to  accompany us the whole way through and thus attended and bearing  with us besides a hamper full of savoury cold meats and fruit  and wine we started off again in high spirits at halfpast six  oclock next morning very much delighted to be by ourselves and  disposed to enjoy even the roughest journey  it was well for us that we were in this humour for the road we  went over that day was certainly enough to have shaken tempers  that were not resolutely at set fair down to some inches below  stormy  at one time we were all flung together in a heap at the  bottom of the coach and at another we were crushing our heads  against the roof  now one side was down deep in the mire and we  were holding on to the other  now the coach was lying on the  tails of the two wheelers and now it was rearing up in the air in  a frantic state with all four horses standing on the top of an  insurmountable eminence looking coolly back at it as though they  would say unharness us  it cant be done  the drivers on these  roads who certainly get over the ground in a manner which is quite  miraculous so twist and turn the team about in forcing a passage  corkscrew fashion through the bogs and swamps that it was quite a  common circumstance on looking out of the window to see the  coachman with the ends of a pair of reins in his hands apparently  driving nothing or playing at horses and the leaders staring at  one unexpectedly from the back of the coach as if they had some  idea of getting up behind  a great portion of the way was over  what is called a corduroy road which is made by throwing trunks of  trees into a marsh and leaving them to settle there  the very  slightest of the jolts with which the ponderous carriage fell from  log to log was enough it seemed to have dislocated all the bones  in the human body  it would be impossible to experience a similar  set of sensations in any other circumstances unless perhaps in  attempting to go up to the top of st pauls in an omnibus  never  never once that day was the coach in any position attitude or  kind of motion to which we are accustomed in coaches  never did it  make the smallest approach to ones experience of the proceedings  of any sort of vehicle that goes on wheels  still it was a fine day and the temperature was delicious and  though we had left summer behind us in the west and were fast  leaving spring we were moving towards niagara and home  we  alighted in a pleasant wood towards the middle of the day dined on  a fallen tree and leaving our best fragments with a cottager and  our worst with the pigs who swarm in this part of the country like  grains of sand on the seashore to the great comfort of our  commissariat in canada we went forward again gaily  as night came on the track grew narrower and narrower until at  last it so lost itself among the trees that the driver seemed to  find his way by instinct  we had the comfort of knowing at least  that there was no danger of his falling asleep for every now and  then a wheel would strike against an unseen stump with such a jerk  that he was fain to hold on pretty tight and pretty quick to keep  himself upon the box  nor was there any reason to dread the least  danger from furious driving inasmuch as over that broken ground  the horses had enough to do to walk as to shying there was no  room for that and a herd of wild elephants could not have run away  in such a wood with such a coach at their heels  so we stumbled  along quite satisfied  these stumps of trees are a curious feature in american travelling   the varying illusions they present to the unaccustomed eye as it  grows dark are quite astonishing in their number and reality   now there is a grecian urn erected in the centre of a lonely  field now there is a woman weeping at a tomb now a very  commonplace old gentleman in a white waistcoat with a thumb thrust  into each armhole of his coat now a student poring on a book now  a crouching negro now a horse a dog a cannon an armed man a  hunchback throwing off his cloak and stepping forth into the  light  they were often as entertaining to me as so many glasses in  a magic lantern and never took their shapes at my bidding but  seemed to force themselves upon me whether i would or no and  strange to say i sometimes recognised in them counterparts of  figures once familiar to me in pictures attached to childish books  forgotten long ago  it soon became too dark however even for this amusement and the  trees were so close together that their dry branches rattled  against the coach on either side and obliged us all to keep our  heads within  it lightened too for three whole hours each flash  being very bright and blue and long and as the vivid streaks  came darting in among the crowded branches and the thunder rolled  gloomily above the tree tops one could scarcely help thinking that  there were better neighbourhoods at such a time than thick woods  afforded  at length between ten and eleven oclock at night a few feeble  lights appeared in the distance and upper sandusky an indian  village where we were to stay till morning lay before us  they were gone to bed at the log inn which was the only house of  entertainment in the place but soon answered to our knocking and  got some tea for us in a sort of kitchen or common room tapestried  with old newspapers pasted against the wall  the bedchamber to  which my wife and i were shown was a large low ghostly room  with a quantity of withered branches on the hearth and two doors  without any fastening opposite to each other both opening on the  black night and wild country and so contrived that one of them  always blew the other open  a novelty in domestic architecture  which i do not remember to have seen before and which i was  somewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention after getting  into bed as i had a considerable sum in gold for our travelling  expenses in my dressingcase  some of the luggage however piled  against the panels soon settled this difficulty and my sleep  would not have been very much affected that night i believe  though it had failed to do so  my boston friend climbed up to bed somewhere in the roof where  another guest was already snoring hugely  but being bitten beyond  his power of endurance he turned out again and fled for shelter  to the coach which was airing itself in front of the house  this  was not a very politic step as it turned out for the pigs  scenting him and looking upon the coach as a kind of pie with some  manner of meat inside grunted round it so hideously that he was  afraid to come out again and lay there shivering till morning   nor was it possible to warm him when he did come out by means of  a glass of brandy  for in indian villages the legislature with a  very good and wise intention forbids the sale of spirits by tavern  keepers  the precaution however is quite inefficacious for the  indians never fail to procure liquor of a worse kind at a dearer  price from travelling pedlars  it is a settlement of the wyandot indians who inhabit this place   among the company at breakfast was a mild old gentleman who had  been for many years employed by the united states government in  conducting negotiations with the indians and who had just  concluded a treaty with these people by which they bound  themselves in consideration of a certain annual sum to remove  next year to some land provided for them west of the mississippi  and a little way beyond st louis  he gave me a moving account of  their strong attachment to the familiar scenes of their infancy  and in particular to the burialplaces of their kindred and of  their great reluctance to leave them  he had witnessed many such  removals and always with pain though he knew that they departed  for their own good  the question whether this tribe should go or  stay had been discussed among them a day or two before in a hut  erected for the purpose the logs of which still lay upon the  ground before the inn  when the speaking was done the ayes and  noes were ranged on opposite sides and every male adult voted in  his turn  the moment the result was known the minority a large  one cheerfully yielded to the rest and withdrew all kind of  opposition  we met some of these poor indians afterwards riding on shaggy  ponies  they were so like the meaner sort of gipsies that if i  could have seen any of them in england i should have concluded as  a matter of course that they belonged to that wandering and  restless people  leaving this town directly after breakfast we pushed forward  again over a rather worse road than yesterday if possible and  arrived about noon at tiffin where we parted with the extra  at  two oclock we took the railroad the travelling on which was very  slow its construction being indifferent and the ground wet and  marshy and arrived at sandusky in time to dine that evening  we  put up at a comfortable little hotel on the brink of lake erie lay  there that night and had no choice but to wait there next day  until a steamboat bound for buffalo appeared  the town which was  sluggish and uninteresting enough was something like the back of  an english wateringplace out of the season  our host who was very attentive and anxious to make us  comfortable was a handsome middleaged man who had come to this  town from new england in which part of the country he was  raised  when i say that he constantly walked in and out of the  room with his hat on and stopped to converse in the same freeand easy state and lay down on our sofa and pulled his newspaper out  of his pocket and read it at his ease i merely mention these  traits as characteristic of the country  not at all as being  matter of complaint or as having been disagreeable to me  i  should undoubtedly be offended by such proceedings at home because  there they are not the custom and where they are not they would  be impertinencies but in america the only desire of a good natured fellow of this kind is to treat his guests hospitably and  well and i had no more right and i can truly say no more  disposition to measure his conduct by our english rule and  standard than i had to quarrel with him for not being of the exact  stature which would qualify him for admission into the queens  grenadier guards  as little inclination had i to find fault with a  funny old lady who was an upper domestic in this establishment and  who when she came to wait upon us at any meal sat herself down  comfortably in the most convenient chair and producing a large pin  to pick her teeth with remained performing that ceremony and  steadfastly regarding us meanwhile with much gravity and composure  now and then pressing us to eat a little more until it was time  to clear away  it was enough for us that whatever we wished done  was done with great civility and readiness and a desire to oblige  not only here but everywhere else and that all our wants were in  general zealously anticipated  we were taking an early dinner at this house on the day after our  arrival which was sunday when a steamboat came in sight and  presently touched at the wharf  as she proved to be on her way to  buffalo we hurried on board with all speed and soon left sandusky  far behind us  she was a large vessel of five hundred tons and handsomely fitted  up though with highpressure engines which always conveyed that  kind of feeling to me which i should be likely to experience i  think if i had lodgings on the firstfloor of a powdermill  she  was laden with flour some casks of which commodity were stored  upon the deck  the captain coming up to have a little  conversation and to introduce a friend seated himself astride of  one of these barrels like a bacchus of private life and pulling a  great claspknife out of his pocket began to whittle it as he  talked by paring thin slices off the edges  and he whittled with  such industry and hearty good will that but for his being called  away very soon it must have disappeared bodily and left nothing  in its place but grist and shavings  after calling at one or two flat places with low dams stretching  out into the lake whereon were stumpy lighthouses like windmills  without sails the whole looking like a dutch vignette we came at  midnight to cleveland where we lay all night and until nine  oclock next morning  i entertained quite a curiosity in reference to this place from  having seen at sandusky a specimen of its literature in the shape  of a newspaper which was very strong indeed upon the subject of  lord ashburtons recent arrival at washington to adjust the points  in dispute between the united states government and great britain   informing its readers that as america had whipped england in her  infancy and whipped her again in her youth so it was clearly  necessary that she must whip her once again in her maturity and  pledging its credit to all true americans that if mr webster did  his duty in the approaching negotiations and sent the english lord  home again in double quick time they should within two years  sing yankee doodle in hyde park and hail columbia in the scarlet  courts of westminster  i found it a pretty town and had the  satisfaction of beholding the outside of the office of the journal  from which i have just quoted  i did not enjoy the delight of  seeing the wit who indited the paragraph in question but i have no  doubt he is a prodigious man in his way and held in high repute by  a select circle  there was a gentleman on board to whom as i unintentionally  learned through the thin partition which divided our stateroom  from the cabin in which he and his wife conversed together i was  unwittingly the occasion of very great uneasiness  i dont know  why or wherefore but i appeared to run in his mind perpetually  and to dissatisfy him very much  first of all i heard him say   and the most ludicrous part of the business was that he said it in  my very ear and could not have communicated more directly with me  if he had leaned upon my shoulder and whispered me  boz is on  board still my dear  after a considerable pause he added  complainingly boz keeps himself very close which was true  enough for i was not very well and was lying down with a book   i thought he had done with me after this but i was deceived for a  long interval having elapsed during which i imagine him to have  been turning restlessly from side to side and trying to go to  sleep he broke out again with i suppose that boz will be writing  a book byandby and putting all our names in it at which  imaginary consequence of being on board a boat with boz he  groaned and became silent  we called at the town of erie at eight oclock that night and lay  there an hour  between five and six next morning we arrived at  buffalo where we breakfasted and being too near the great falls  to wait patiently anywhere else we set off by the train the same  morning at nine oclock to niagara  it was a miserable day chilly and raw a damp mist falling and  the trees in that northern region quite bare and wintry  whenever  the train halted i listened for the roar and was constantly  straining my eyes in the direction where i knew the falls must be  from seeing the river rolling on towards them every moment  expecting to behold the spray  within a few minutes of our  stopping not before i saw two great white clouds rising up slowly  and majestically from the depths of the earth  that was all  at  length we alighted  and then for the first time i heard the  mighty rush of water and felt the ground tremble underneath my  feet  the bank is very steep and was slippery with rain and halfmelted  ice  i hardly know how i got down but i was soon at the bottom  and climbing with two english officers who were crossing and had  joined me over some broken rocks deafened by the noise half blinded by the spray and wet to the skin  we were at the foot of  the american fall  i could see an immense torrent of water tearing  headlong down from some great height but had no idea of shape or  situation or anything but vague immensity  when we were seated in the little ferryboat and were crossing the  swollen river immediately before both cataracts i began to feel  what it was  but i was in a manner stunned and unable to  comprehend the vastness of the scene  it was not until i came on  table rock and looked  great heaven on what a fall of bright green water  that it came upon me in its full might and majesty  then when i felt how near to my creator i was standing the first  effect and the enduring one  instant and lasting  of the  tremendous spectacle was peace  peace of mind tranquillity calm  recollections of the dead great thoughts of eternal rest and  happiness  nothing of gloom or terror  niagara was at once  stamped upon my heart an image of beauty to remain there  changeless and indelible until its pulses cease to beat for ever  oh how the strife and trouble of daily life receded from my view  and lessened in the distance during the ten memorable days we  passed on that enchanted ground  what voices spoke from out the  thundering water what faces faded from the earth looked out upon  me from its gleaming depths what heavenly promise glistened in  those angels tears the drops of many hues that showered around  and twined themselves about the gorgeous arches which the changing  rainbows made  i never stirred in all that time from the canadian side whither i  had gone at first  i never crossed the river again for i knew  there were people on the other shore and in such a place it is  natural to shun strange company  to wander to and fro all day and  see the cataracts from all points of view to stand upon the edge  of the great horseshoe fall marking the hurried water gathering  strength as it approached the verge yet seeming too to pause  before it shot into the gulf below to gaze from the rivers level  up at the torrent as it came streaming down to climb the  neighbouring heights and watch it through the trees and see the  wreathing water in the rapids hurrying on to take its fearful  plunge to linger in the shadow of the solemn rocks three miles  below watching the river as stirred by no visible cause it  heaved and eddied and awoke the echoes being troubled yet far  down beneath the surface by its giant leap to have niagara before  me lighted by the sun and by the moon red in the days decline  and grey as evening slowly fell upon it to look upon it every day  and wake up in the night and hear its ceaseless voice  this was  enough  i think in every quiet season now still do those waters roll and  leap and roar and tumble all day long still are the rainbows  spanning them a hundred feet below  still when the sun is on  them do they shine and glow like molten gold  still when the day  is gloomy do they fall like snow or seem to crumble away like the  front of a great chalk cliff or roll down the rock like dense  white smoke  but always does the mighty stream appear to die as it  comes down and always from its unfathomable grave arises that  tremendous ghost of spray and mist which is never laid  which has  haunted this place with the same dread solemnity since darkness  brooded on the deep and that first flood before the deluge  light   came rushing on creation at the word of god    chapter xv  in canada toronto kingston montreal quebec st  johns  in the united states again lebanon the shaker village  west point    i wish to abstain from instituting any comparison or drawing any  parallel whatever between the social features of the united states  and those of the british possessions in canada  for this reason i  shall confine myself to a very brief account of our journeyings in  the latter territory  but before i leave niagara i must advert to one disgusting  circumstance which can hardly have escaped the observation of any  decent traveller who has visited the falls  on table rock there is a cottage belonging to a guide where  little relics of the place are sold and where visitors register  their names in a book kept for the purpose  on the wall of the  room in which a great many of these volumes are preserved the  following request is posted  visitors will please not copy nor  extract the remarks and poetical effusions from the registers and  albums kept here  but for this intimation i should have let them lie upon the tables  on which they were strewn with careful negligence like books in a  drawingroom  being quite satisfied with the stupendous silliness  of certain stanzas with an anticlimax at the end of each which  were framed and hung up on the wall  curious however after  reading this announcement to see what kind of morsels were so  carefully preserved i turned a few leaves and found them scrawled  all over with the vilest and the filthiest ribaldry that ever human  hogs delighted in  it is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so  obscene and worthless that they can delight in laying their  miserable profanations upon the very steps of natures greatest  altar  but that these should be hoarded up for the delight of  their fellowswine and kept in a public place where any eyes may  see them is a disgrace to the english language in which they are  written though i hope few of these entries have been made by  englishmen and a reproach to the english side on which they are  preserved  the quarters of our soldiers at niagara are finely and airily  situated  some of them are large detached houses on the plain  above the falls which were originally designed for hotels and in  the evening time when the women and children were leaning over the  balconies watching the men as they played at ball and other games  upon the grass before the door they often presented a little  picture of cheerfulness and animation which made it quite a  pleasure to pass that way  at any garrisoned point where the line of demarcation between one  country and another is so very narrow as at niagara desertion from  the ranks can scarcely fail to be of frequent occurrence  and it  may be reasonably supposed that when the soldiers entertain the  wildest and maddest hopes of the fortune and independence that  await them on the other side the impulse to play traitor which  such a place suggests to dishonest minds is not weakened  but it  very rarely happens that the men who do desert are happy or  contented afterwards and many instances have been known in which  they have confessed their grievous disappointment and their  earnest desire to return to their old service if they could but be  assured of pardon or lenient treatment  many of their comrades  notwithstanding do the like from time to time and instances of  loss of life in the effort to cross the river with this object are  far from being uncommon  several men were drowned in the attempt  to swim across not long ago and one who had the madness to trust  himself upon a table as a raft was swept down to the whirlpool  where his mangled body eddied round and round some days  i am inclined to think that the noise of the falls is very much  exaggerated and this will appear the more probable when the depth  of the great basin in which the water is received is taken into  account  at no time during our stay there was the wind at all  high or boisterous but we never heard them three miles off even  at the very quiet time of sunset though we often tried  queenston at which place the steamboats start for toronto or i  should rather say at which place they call for their wharf is at  lewiston on the opposite shore is situated in a delicious  valley through which the niagara river in colour a very deep  green pursues its course  it is approached by a road that takes  its winding way among the heights by which the town is sheltered  and seen from this point is extremely beautiful and picturesque   on the most conspicuous of these heights stood a monument erected  by the provincial legislature in memory of general brock who was  slain in a battle with the american forces after having won the  victory  some vagabond supposed to be a fellow of the name of  lett who is now or who lately was in prison as a felon blew up  this monument two years ago and it is now a melancholy ruin with  a long fragment of iron railing hanging dejectedly from its top  and waving to and fro like a wild ivy branch or broken vine stem   it is of much higher importance than it may seem that this statue  should be repaired at the public cost as it ought to have been  long ago  firstly because it is beneath the dignity of england to  allow a memorial raised in honour of one of her defenders to  remain in this condition on the very spot where he died   secondly because the sight of it in its present state and the  recollection of the unpunished outrage which brought it to this  pass is not very likely to soothe down border feelings among  english subjects here or compose their border quarrels and  dislikes  i was standing on the wharf at this place watching the passengers  embarking in a steamboat which preceded that whose coming we  awaited and participating in the anxiety with which a sergeants  wife was collecting her few goods together  keeping one distracted  eye hard upon the porters who were hurrying them on board and the  other on a hoopless washingtub for which as being the most  utterly worthless of all her movables she seemed to entertain  particular affection  when three or four soldiers with a recruit  came up and went on board  the recruit was a likely young fellow enough strongly built and  well made but by no means sober  indeed he had all the air of a  man who had been more or less drunk for some days  he carried a  small bundle over his shoulder slung at the end of a walking stick and had a short pipe in his mouth  he was as dusty and  dirty as recruits usually are and his shoes betokened that he had  travelled on foot some distance but he was in a very jocose state  and shook hands with this soldier and clapped that one on the  back and talked and laughed continually like a roaring idle dog  as he was  the soldiers rather laughed at this blade than with him  seeming  to say as they stood straightening their canes in their hands and  looking coolly at him over their glazed stocks go on my boy  while you may youll know better byandby when suddenly the  novice who had been backing towards the gangway in his noisy  merriment fell overboard before their eyes and splashed heavily  down into the river between the vessel and the dock  i never saw such a good thing as the change that came over these  soldiers in an instant  almost before the man was down their  professional manner their stiffness and constraint were gone and  they were filled with the most violent energy  in less time than  is required to tell it they had him out again feet first with  the tails of his coat flapping over his eyes everything about him  hanging the wrong way and the water streaming off at every thread  in his threadbare dress  but the moment they set him upright and  found that he was none the worse they were soldiers again looking  over their glazed stocks more composedly than ever  the halfsobered recruit glanced round for a moment as if his  first impulse were to express some gratitude for his preservation  but seeing them with this air of total unconcern and having his  wet pipe presented to him with an oath by the soldier who had been  by far the most anxious of the party he stuck it in his mouth  thrust his hands into his moist pockets and without even shaking  the water off his clothes walked on board whistling not to say as  if nothing had happened but as if he had meant to do it and it  had been a perfect success  our steamboat came up directly this had left the wharf and soon  bore us to the mouth of the niagara where the stars and stripes of  america flutter on one side and the union jack of england on the  other  and so narrow is the space between them that the sentinels  in either fort can often hear the watchword of the other country  given  thence we emerged on lake ontario an inland sea and by  halfpast six oclock were at toronto  the country round this town being very flat is bare of scenic  interest but the town itself is full of life and motion bustle  business and improvement  the streets are well paved and lighted  with gas the houses are large and good the shops excellent  many  of them have a display of goods in their windows such as may be  seen in thriving county towns in england and there are some which  would do no discredit to the metropolis itself  there is a good  stone prison here and there are besides a handsome church a  courthouse public offices many commodious private residences  and a government observatory for noting and recording the magnetic  variations  in the college of upper canada which is one of the  public establishments of the city a sound education in every  department of polite learning can be had at a very moderate  expense  the annual charge for the instruction of each pupil not  exceeding nine pounds sterling  it has pretty good endowments in  the way of land and is a valuable and useful institution  the first stone of a new college had been laid but a few days  before by the governor general  it will be a handsome spacious  edifice approached by a long avenue which is already planted and  made available as a public walk  the town is well adapted for  wholesome exercise at all seasons for the footways in the  thoroughfares which lie beyond the principal street are planked  like floors and kept in very good and clean repair  it is a matter of deep regret that political differences should  have run high in this place and led to most discreditable and  disgraceful results  it is not long since guns were discharged  from a window in this town at the successful candidates in an  election and the coachman of one of them was actually shot in the  body though not dangerously wounded  but one man was killed on  the same occasion and from the very window whence he received his  death the very flag which shielded his murderer not only in the  commission of his crime but from its consequences was displayed  again on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the  governor general to which i have just adverted  of all the  colours in the rainbow there is but one which could be so  employed  i need not say that flag was orange  the time of leaving toronto for kingston is noon  by eight oclock  next morning the traveller is at the end of his journey which is  performed by steamboat upon lake ontario calling at port hope and  coburg the latter a cheerful thriving little town  vast  quantities of flour form the chief item in the freight of these  vessels  we had no fewer than one thousand and eighty barrels on  board between coburg and kingston  the latter place which is now the seat of government in canada is  a very poor town rendered still poorer in the appearance of its  marketplace by the ravages of a recent fire  indeed it may be  said of kingston that one half of it appears to be burnt down and  the other half not to be built up  the government house is neither  elegant nor commodious yet it is almost the only house of any  importance in the neighbourhood  there is an admirable jail here well and wisely governed and  excellently regulated in every respect  the men were employed as  shoemakers ropemakers blacksmiths tailors carpenters and  stonecutters and in building a new prison which was pretty far  advanced towards completion  the female prisoners were occupied in  needlework  among them was a beautiful girl of twenty who had  been there nearly three years  she acted as bearer of secret  despatches for the selfstyled patriots on navy island during the  canadian insurrection  sometimes dressing as a girl and carrying  them in her stays sometimes attiring herself as a boy and  secreting them in the lining of her hat  in the latter character  she always rode as a boy would which was nothing to her for she  could govern any horse that any man could ride and could drive  fourinhand with the best whip in those parts  setting forth on  one of her patriotic missions she appropriated to herself the  first horse she could lay her hands on and this offence had  brought her where i saw her  she had quite a lovely face though  as the reader may suppose from this sketch of her history there  was a lurking devil in her bright eye which looked out pretty  sharply from between her prison bars  there is a bombproof fort here of great strength which occupies a  bold position and is capable doubtless of doing good service  though the town is much too close upon the frontier to be long  held i should imagine for its present purpose in troubled times   there is also a small navyyard where a couple of government  steamboats were building and getting on vigorously  we left kingston for montreal on the tenth of may at halfpast  nine in the morning and proceeded in a steamboat down the st  lawrence river  the beauty of this noble stream at almost any  point but especially in the commencement of this journey when it  winds its way among the thousand islands can hardly be imagined   the number and constant successions of these islands all green and  richly wooded their fluctuating sizes some so large that for half  an hour together one among them will appear as the opposite bank of  the river and some so small that they are mere dimples on its  broad bosom their infinite variety of shapes and the numberless  combinations of beautiful forms which the trees growing on them  present  all form a picture fraught with uncommon interest and  pleasure  in the afternoon we shot down some rapids where the river boiled  and bubbled strangely and where the force and headlong violence of  the current were tremendous  at seven oclock we reached  dickensons landing whence travellers proceed for two or three  hours by stagecoach  the navigation of the river being rendered  so dangerous and difficult in the interval by rapids that  steamboats do not make the passage  the number and length of those  portages over which the roads are bad and the travelling slow  render the way between the towns of montreal and kingston somewhat  tedious  our course lay over a wide uninclosed tract of country at a little  distance from the riverside whence the bright warning lights on  the dangerous parts of the st lawrence shone vividly  the night  was dark and raw and the way dreary enough  it was nearly ten  oclock when we reached the wharf where the next steamboat lay and  went on board and to bed  she lay there all night and started as soon as it was day  the  morning was ushered in by a violent thunderstorm and was very wet  but gradually improved and brightened up  going on deck after  breakfast i was amazed to see floating down with the stream a  most gigantic raft with some thirty or forty wooden houses upon  it and at least as many flagmasts so that it looked like a  nautical street  i saw many of these rafts afterwards but never  one so large  all the timber or lumber as it is called in  america which is brought down the st lawrence is floated down in  this manner  when the raft reaches its place of destination it is  broken up the materials are sold and the boatmen return for more  at eight we landed again and travelled by a stagecoach for four  hours through a pleasant and wellcultivated country perfectly  french in every respect  in the appearance of the cottages the  air language and dress of the peasantry the signboards on the  shops and taverns  and the virgins shrines and crosses by the  wayside  nearly every common labourer and boy though he had no  shoes to his feet wore round his waist a sash of some bright  colour  generally red  and the women who were working in the  fields and gardens and doing all kinds of husbandry wore one and  all great flat straw hats with most capacious brims  there were  catholic priests and sisters of charity in the village streets and  images of the saviour at the corners of crossroads and in other  public places  at noon we went on board another steamboat and reached the village  of lachine nine miles from montreal by three oclock  there we  left the river and went on by land  montreal is pleasantly situated on the margin of the st lawrence  and is backed by some bold heights about which there are charming  rides and drives  the streets are generally narrow and irregular  as in most french towns of any age but in the more modern parts of  the city they are wide and airy  they display a great variety of  very good shops and both in the town and suburbs there are many  excellent private dwellings  the granite quays are remarkable for  their beauty solidity and extent  there is a very large catholic cathedral here recently erected  with two tall spires of which one is yet unfinished  in the open  space in front of this edifice stands a solitary grimlooking  square brick tower which has a quaint and remarkable appearance  and which the wiseacres of the place have consequently determined  to pull down immediately  the government house is very superior to  that at kingston and the town is full of life and bustle  in one  of the suburbs is a plank road  not footpath  five or six miles  long and a famous road it is too  all the rides in the vicinity  were made doubly interesting by the bursting out of spring which  is here so rapid that it is but a days leap from barren winter  to the blooming youth of summer  the steamboats to quebec perform the journey in the night that is  to say they leave montreal at six in the evening and arrive at  quebec at six next morning  we made this excursion during our stay  in montreal which exceeded a fortnight and were charmed by its  interest and beauty  the impression made upon the visitor by this gibraltar of america   its giddy heights its citadel suspended as it were in the air  its picturesque steep streets and frowning gateways and the  splendid views which burst upon the eye at every turn  is at once  unique and lasting  it is a place not to be forgotten or mixed up in the mind with  other places or altered for a moment in the crowd of scenes a  traveller can recall  apart from the realities of this most  picturesque city there are associations clustering about it which  would make a desert rich in interest  the dangerous precipice  along whose rocky front wolfe and his brave companions climbed to  glory the plains of abraham where he received his mortal wound  the fortress so chivalrously defended by montcalm and his  soldiers grave dug for him while yet alive by the bursting of a  shell are not the least among them or among the gallant incidents  of history  that is a noble monument too and worthy of two great  nations which perpetuates the memory of both brave generals and  on which their names are jointly written  the city is rich in public institutions and in catholic churches  and charities but it is mainly in the prospect from the site of  the old government house and from the citadel that its surpassing  beauty lies  the exquisite expanse of country rich in field and  forest mountainheight and water which lies stretched out before  the view with miles of canadian villages glancing in long white  streaks like veins along the landscape the motley crowd of  gables roofs and chimney tops in the old hilly town immediately  at hand the beautiful st lawrence sparkling and flashing in the  sunlight and the tiny ships below the rock from which you gaze  whose distant rigging looks like spiders webs against the light  while casks and barrels on their decks dwindle into toys and busy  mariners become so many puppets all this framed by a sunken  window in the fortress and looked at from the shadowed room within  forms one of the brightest and most enchanting pictures that the  eye can rest upon  in the spring of the year vast numbers of emigrants who have newly  arrived from england or from ireland pass between quebec and  montreal on their way to the backwoods and new settlements of  canada  if it be an entertaining lounge as i very often found it  to take a morning stroll upon the quay at montreal and see them  grouped in hundreds on the public wharfs about their chests and  boxes it is matter of deep interest to be their fellowpassenger  on one of these steamboats and mingling with the concourse see  and hear them unobserved  the vessel in which we returned from quebec to montreal was crowded  with them and at night they spread their beds between decks those  who had beds at least and slept so close and thick about our  cabin door that the passage to and fro was quite blocked up  they  were nearly all english from gloucestershire the greater part and  had had a long winterpassage out but it was wonderful to see how  clean the children had been kept and how untiring in their love  and selfdenial all the poor parents were  cant as we may and as we shall to the end of all things it is  very much harder for the poor to be virtuous than it is for the  rich and the good that is in them shines the brighter for it  in  many a noble mansion lives a man the best of husbands and of  fathers whose private worth in both capacities is justly lauded to  the skies  but bring him here upon this crowded deck  strip from  his fair young wife her silken dress and jewels unbind her braided  hair stamp early wrinkles on her brow pinch her pale cheek with  care and much privation array her faded form in coarsely patched  attire let there be nothing but his love to set her forth or deck  her out and you shall put it to the proof indeed  so change his  station in the world that he shall see in those young things who  climb about his knee  not records of his wealth and name  but  little wrestlers with him for his daily bread so many poachers on  his scanty meal so many units to divide his every sum of comfort  and farther to reduce its small amount  in lieu of the endearments  of childhood in its sweetest aspect heap upon him all its pains  and wants its sicknesses and ills its fretfulness caprice and  querulous endurance  let its prattle be not of engaging infant  fancies but of cold and thirst and hunger  and if his fatherly  affection outlive all this and he be patient watchful tender  careful of his childrens lives and mindful always of their joys  and sorrows then send him back to parliament and pulpit and to  quarter sessions and when he hears fine talk of the depravity of  those who live from hand to mouth and labour hard to do it let  him speak up as one who knows and tell those holders forth that  they by parallel with such a class should be high angels in their  daily lives and lay but humble siege to heaven at last  which of us shall say what he would be if such realities with  small relief or change all through his days were his  looking  round upon these people  far from home houseless indigent  wandering weary with travel and hard living  and seeing how  patiently they nursed and tended their young children  how they  consulted ever their wants first then half supplied their own  what gentle ministers of hope and faith the women were how the men  profited by their example and how very very seldom even a  moments petulance or harsh complaint broke out among them  i felt  a stronger love and honour of my kind come glowing on my heart and  wished to god there had been many atheists in the better part of  human nature there to read this simple lesson in the book of life         we left montreal for new york again on the thirtieth of may  crossing to la prairie on the opposite shore of the st lawrence  in a steamboat we then took the railroad to st johns which is  on the brink of lake champlain  our last greeting in canada was  from the english officers in the pleasant barracks at that place a  class of gentlemen who had made every hour of our visit memorable  by their hospitality and friendship and with rule britannia  sounding in our ears soon left it far behind  but canada has held and always will retain a foremost place in my  remembrance  few englishmen are prepared to find it what it is   advancing quietly old differences settling down and being fast  forgotten public feeling and private enterprise alike in a sound  and wholesome state nothing of flush or fever in its system but  health and vigour throbbing in its steady pulse  it is full of  hope and promise  to me  who had been accustomed to think of it  as something left behind in the strides of advancing society as  something neglected and forgotten slumbering and wasting in its  sleep  the demand for labour and the rates of wages the busy  quays of montreal the vessels taking in their cargoes and  discharging them the amount of shipping in the different ports  the commerce roads and public works all made to last the  respectability and character of the public journals and the amount  of rational comfort and happiness which honest industry may earn   were very great surprises  the steamboats on the lakes in their  conveniences cleanliness and safety in the gentlemanly character  and bearing of their captains and in the politeness and perfect  comfort of their social regulations are unsurpassed even by the  famous scotch vessels deservedly so much esteemed at home  the  inns are usually bad because the custom of boarding at hotels is  not so general here as in the states and the british officers who  form a large portion of the society of every town live chiefly at  the regimental messes  but in every other respect the traveller  in canada will find as good provision for his comfort as in any  place i know  there is one american boat  the vessel which carried us on lake  champlain from st johns to whitehall  which i praise very  highly but no more than it deserves when i say that it is  superior even to that in which we went from queenston to toronto  or to that in which we travelled from the latter place to kingston  or i have no doubt i may add to any other in the world  this  steamboat which is called the burlington is a perfectly exquisite  achievement of neatness elegance and order  the decks are  drawingrooms the cabins are boudoirs choicely furnished and  adorned with prints pictures and musical instruments every nook  and corner in the vessel is a perfect curiosity of graceful comfort  and beautiful contrivance  captain sherman her commander to  whose ingenuity and excellent taste these results are solely  attributable has bravely and worthily distinguished himself on  more than one trying occasion  not least among them in having the  moral courage to carry british troops at a time during the  canadian rebellion when no other conveyance was open to them  he  and his vessel are held in universal respect both by his own  countrymen and ours and no man ever enjoyed the popular esteem  who in his sphere of action won and wore it better than this  gentleman  by means of this floating palace we were soon in the united states  again and called that evening at burlington a pretty town where  we lay an hour or so  we reached whitehall where we were to  disembark at six next morning and might have done so earlier but  that these steamboats lie by for some hours in the night in  consequence of the lake becoming very narrow at that part of the  journey and difficult of navigation in the dark  its width is so  contracted at one point indeed that they are obliged to warp  round by means of a rope  after breakfasting at whitehall we took the stagecoach for  albany  a large and busy town where we arrived between five and  six oclock that afternoon after a very hot days journey for we  were now in the height of summer again  at seven we started for  new york on board a great north river steamboat which was so  crowded with passengers that the upper deck was like the box lobby  of a theatre between the pieces and the lower one like tottenham  court road on a saturday night  but we slept soundly  notwithstanding and soon after five oclock next morning reached  new york  tarrying here only that day and night to recruit after our late  fatigues we started off once more upon our last journey in  america  we had yet five days to spare before embarking for  england and i had a great desire to see the shaker village  which is peopled by a religious sect from whom it takes its name  to this end we went up the north river again as far as the town  of hudson and there hired an extra to carry us to lebanon thirty  miles distant  and of course another and a different lebanon from  that village where i slept on the night of the prairie trip  the country through which the road meandered was rich and  beautiful the weather very fine and for many miles the kaatskill  mountains where rip van winkle and the ghostly dutchmen played at  ninepins one memorable gusty afternoon towered in the blue  distance like stately clouds  at one point as we ascended a  steep hill athwart whose base a railroad yet constructing took  its course we came upon an irish colony  with means at hand of  building decent cabins it was wonderful to see how clumsy rough  and wretched its hovels were  the best were poor protection from  the weather the worst let in the wind and rain through wide  breaches in the roofs of sodden grass and in the walls of mud  some had neither door nor window some had nearly fallen down and  were imperfectly propped up by stakes and poles all were ruinous  and filthy  hideously ugly old women and very buxom young ones  pigs dogs men children babies pots kettles dunghills vile  refuse rank straw and standing water all wallowing together in  an inseparable heap composed the furniture of every dark and dirty  hut  between nine and ten oclock at night we arrived at lebanon which  is renowned for its warm baths and for a great hotel well  adapted i have no doubt to the gregarious taste of those seekers  after health or pleasure who repair here but inexpressibly  comfortless to me  we were shown into an immense apartment  lighted by two dim candles called the drawingroom  from which  there was a descent by a flight of steps to another vast desert  called the diningroom  our bedchambers were among certain long  rows of little whitewashed cells which opened from either side of  a dreary passage and were so like rooms in a prison that i half  expected to be locked up when i went to bed and listened  involuntarily for the turning of the key on the outside  there  need be baths somewhere in the neighbourhood for the other washing  arrangements were on as limited a scale as i ever saw even in  america  indeed these bedrooms were so very bare of even such  common luxuries as chairs that i should say they were not provided  with enough of anything but that i bethink myself of our having  been most bountifully bitten all night  the house is very pleasantly situated however and we had a good  breakfast  that done we went to visit our place of destination  which was some two miles off and the way to which was soon  indicated by a fingerpost whereon was painted to the shaker  village  as we rode along we passed a party of shakers who were at work  upon the road who wore the broadest of all broadbrimmed hats and  were in all visible respects such very wooden men that i felt  about as much sympathy for them and as much interest in them as  if they had been so many figureheads of ships  presently we came  to the beginning of the village and alighting at the door of a  house where the shaker manufactures are sold and which is the  headquarters of the elders requested permission to see the shaker  worship  pending the conveyance of this request to some person in authority  we walked into a grim room where several grim hats were hanging on  grim pegs and the time was grimly told by a grim clock which  uttered every tick with a kind of struggle as if it broke the grim  silence reluctantly and under protest  ranged against the wall  were six or eight stiff highbacked chairs and they partook so  strongly of the general grimness that one would much rather have  sat on the floor than incurred the smallest obligation to any of  them  presently there stalked into this apartment a grim old shaker  with eyes as hard and dull and cold as the great round metal  buttons on his coat and waistcoat a sort of calm goblin  being  informed of our desire he produced a newspaper wherein the body of  elders whereof he was a member had advertised but a few days  before that in consequence of certain unseemly interruptions which  their worship had received from strangers their chapel was closed  to the public for the space of one year  as nothing was to be urged in opposition to this reasonable  arrangement we requested leave to make some trifling purchases of  shaker goods which was grimly conceded  we accordingly repaired  to a store in the same house and on the opposite side of the  passage where the stock was presided over by something alive in a  russet case which the elder said was a woman and which i suppose  was a woman though i should not have suspected it  on the opposite side of the road was their place of worship  a  cool clean edifice of wood with large windows and green blinds   like a spacious summerhouse  as there was no getting into this  place and nothing was to be done but walk up and down and look at  it and the other buildings in the village which were chiefly of  wood painted a dark red like english barns and composed of many  stories like english factories i have nothing to communicate to  the reader beyond the scanty results i gleaned the while our  purchases were making  these people are called shakers from their peculiar form of  adoration which consists of a dance performed by the men and  women of all ages who arrange themselves for that purpose in  opposite parties  the men first divesting themselves of their hats  and coats which they gravely hang against the wall before they  begin and tying a ribbon round their shirtsleeves as though they  were going to be bled  they accompany themselves with a droning  humming noise and dance until they are quite exhausted  alternately advancing and retiring in a preposterous sort of trot   the effect is said to be unspeakably absurd  and if i may judge  from a print of this ceremony which i have in my possession and  which i am informed by those who have visited the chapel is  perfectly accurate it must be infinitely grotesque  they are governed by a woman and her rule is understood to be  absolute though she has the assistance of a council of elders   she lives it is said in strict seclusion in certain rooms above  the chapel and is never shown to profane eyes  if she at all  resemble the lady who presided over the store it is a great  charity to keep her as close as possible and i cannot too strongly  express my perfect concurrence in this benevolent proceeding  all the possessions and revenues of the settlement are thrown into  a common stock which is managed by the elders  as they have made  converts among people who were well to do in the world and are  frugal and thrifty it is understood that this fund prospers  the  more especially as they have made large purchases of land  nor is  this at lebanon the only shaker settlement  there are i think at  least three others  they are good farmers and all their produce is eagerly purchased  and highly esteemed  shaker seeds shaker herbs and shaker  distilled waters are commonly announced for sale in the shops of  towns and cities  they are good breeders of cattle and are kind  and merciful to the brute creation  consequently shaker beasts  seldom fail to find a ready market  they eat and drink together after the spartan model at a great  public table  there is no union of the sexes and every shaker  male and female is devoted to a life of celibacy  rumour has been  busy upon this theme but here again i must refer to the lady of  the store and say that if many of the sister shakers resemble  her i treat all such slander as bearing on its face the strongest  marks of wild improbability  but that they take as proselytes  persons so young that they cannot know their own minds and cannot  possess much strength of resolution in this or any other respect i  can assert from my own observation of the extreme juvenility of  certain youthful shakers whom i saw at work among the party on the  road  they are said to be good drivers of bargains but to be honest and  just in their transactions and even in horsedealing to resist  those thievish tendencies which would seem for some undiscovered  reason to be almost inseparable from that branch of traffic  in  all matters they hold their own course quietly live in their  gloomy silent commonwealth and show little desire to interfere  with other people  this is well enough but nevertheless i cannot i confess incline  towards the shakers view them with much favour or extend towards  them any very lenient construction  i so abhor and from my soul  detest that bad spirit no matter by what class or sect it may be  entertained which would strip life of its healthful graces rob  youth of its innocent pleasures pluck from maturity and age their  pleasant ornaments and make existence but a narrow path towards  the grave  that odious spirit which if it could have had full  scope and sway upon the earth must have blasted and made barren  the imaginations of the greatest men and left them in their power  of raising up enduring images before their fellowcreatures yet  unborn no better than the beasts  that in these very broad brimmed hats and very sombre coats  in stiffnecked solemn visaged piety in short no matter what its garb whether it have  cropped hair as in a shaker village or long nails as in a hindoo  temple  i recognise the worst among the enemies of heaven and  earth who turn the water at the marriage feasts of this poor  world not into wine but gall  and if there must be people vowed  to crush the harmless fancies and the love of innocent delights and  gaieties which are a part of human nature  as much a part of it  as any other love or hope that is our common portion  let them  for me stand openly revealed among the ribald and licentious the  very idiots know that they are not on the immortal road and will  despise them and avoid them readily  leaving the shaker village with a hearty dislike of the old  shakers and a hearty pity for the young ones  tempered by the  strong probability of their running away as they grow older and  wiser which they not uncommonly do  we returned to lebanon and  so to hudson by the way we had come upon the previous day  there  we took the steamboat down the north river towards new york but  stopped some four hours journey short of it at west point where  we remained that night and all next day and next night too  in this beautiful place  the fairest among the fair and lovely  highlands of the north river  shut in by deep green heights and  ruined forts and looking down upon the distant town of newburgh  along a glittering path of sunlit water with here and there a  skiff whose white sail often bends on some new tack as sudden  flaws of wind come down upon her from the gullies in the hills   hemmed in besides all round with memories of washington and  events of the revolutionary war  is the military school of  america  it could not stand on more appropriate ground and any ground more  beautiful can hardly be  the course of education is severe but  well devised and manly  through june july and august the young  men encamp upon the spacious plain whereon the college stands and  all the year their military exercises are performed there daily   the term of study at this institution which the state requires  from all cadets is four years but whether it be from the rigid  nature of the discipline or the national impatience of restraint  or both causes combined not more than half the number who begin  their studies here ever remain to finish them  the number of cadets being about equal to that of the members of  congress one is sent here from every congressional district  its  member influencing the selection  commissions in the service are  distributed on the same principle  the dwellings of the various  professors are beautifully situated and there is a most excellent  hotel for strangers though it has the two drawbacks of being a  total abstinence house wines and spirits being forbidden to the  students and of serving the public meals at rather uncomfortable  hours  to wit breakfast at seven dinner at one and supper at  sunset  the beauty and freshness of this calm retreat in the very dawn and  greenness of summer  it was then the beginning of june  were  exquisite indeed  leaving it upon the sixth and returning to new  york to embark for england on the succeeding day i was glad to  think that among the last memorable beauties which had glided past  us and softened in the bright perspective were those whose  pictures traced by no common hand are fresh in most mens minds  not easily to grow old or fade beneath the dust of time  the  kaatskill mountains sleepy hollow and the tappaan zee    chapter xvi  the passage home    i never had so much interest before and very likely i shall never  have so much interest again in the state of the wind as on the  longlookedfor morning of tuesday the seventh of june  some  nautical authority had told me a day or two previous anything  with west in it will do so when i darted out of bed at daylight  and throwing up the window was saluted by a lively breeze from the  northwest which had sprung up in the night it came upon me so  freshly rustling with so many happy associations that i conceived  upon the spot a special regard for all airs blowing from that  quarter of the compass which i shall cherish i dare say until my  own wind has breathed its last frail puff and withdrawn itself for  ever from the mortal calendar  the pilot had not been slow to take advantage of this favourable  weather and the ship which yesterday had been in such a crowded  dock that she might have retired from trade for good and all for  any chance she seemed to have of going to sea was now full sixteen  miles away  a gallant sight she was when we fast gaining on her  in a steamboat saw her in the distance riding at anchor  her tall  masts pointing up in graceful lines against the sky and every rope  and spar expressed in delicate and threadlike outline  gallant  too when we being all aboard the anchor came up to the sturdy  chorus cheerily men oh cheerily and she followed proudly in the  towing steamboats wake  but bravest and most gallant of all when  the towrope being cast adrift the canvas fluttered from her  masts and spreading her white wings she soared away upon her free  and solitary course  in the after cabin we were only fifteen passengers in all and the  greater part were from canada where some of us had known each  other  the night was rough and squally so were the next two days  but they flew by quickly and we were soon as cheerful and snug a  party with an honest manlyhearted captain at our head as ever  came to the resolution of being mutually agreeable on land or  water  we breakfasted at eight lunched at twelve dined at three and  took our tea at halfpast seven  we had abundance of amusements  and dinner was not the least among them  firstly for its own  sake secondly because of its extraordinary length  its duration  inclusive of all the long pauses between the courses being seldom  less than two hours and a half which was a subject of never failing entertainment  by way of beguiling the tediousness of  these banquets a select association was formed at the lower end of  the table below the mast to whose distinguished president modesty  forbids me to make any further allusion which being a very  hilarious and jovial institution was prejudice apart in high  favour with the rest of the community and particularly with a  black steward who lived for three weeks in a broad grin at the  marvellous humour of these incorporated worthies  then we had chess for those who played it whist cribbage books  backgammon and shovelboard  in all weathers fair or foul calm  or windy we were every one on deck walking up and down in pairs  lying in the boats leaning over the side or chatting in a lazy  group together  we had no lack of music for one played the  accordion another the violin and another who usually began at  six oclock am the keybugle  the combined effect of which  instruments when they all played different tunes in different  parts of the ship at the same time and within hearing of each  other as they sometimes did everybody being intensely satisfied  with his own performance was sublimely hideous  when all these means of entertainment failed a sail would heave in  sight  looming perhaps the very spirit of a ship in the misty  distance or passing us so close that through our glasses we could  see the people on her decks and easily make out her name and  whither she was bound  for hours together we could watch the  dolphins and porpoises as they rolled and leaped and dived around  the vessel or those small creatures ever on the wing the mother  careys chickens which had borne us company from new york bay and  for a whole fortnight fluttered about the vessels stern  for some  days we had a dead calm or very light winds during which the crew  amused themselves with fishing and hooked an unlucky dolphin who  expired in all his rainbow colours on the deck  an event of such  importance in our barren calendar that afterwards we dated from  the dolphin and made the day on which he died an era  besides all this when we were five or six days out there began to  be much talk of icebergs of which wandering islands an unusual  number had been seen by the vessels that had come into new york a  day or two before we left that port and of whose dangerous  neighbourhood we were warned by the sudden coldness of the weather  and the sinking of the mercury in the barometer  while these  tokens lasted a double lookout was kept and many dismal tales  were whispered after dark of ships that had struck upon the ice  and gone down in the night but the wind obliging us to hold a  southward course we saw none of them and the weather soon grew  bright and warm again  the observation every day at noon and the subsequent working of  the vessels course was as may be supposed a feature in our  lives of paramount importance nor were there wanting as there  never are sagacious doubters of the captains calculations who  so soon as his back was turned would in the absence of compasses  measure the chart with bits of string and ends of pocket handkerchiefs and points of snuffers and clearly prove him to be  wrong by an odd thousand miles or so  it was very edifying to see  these unbelievers shake their heads and frown and hear them hold  forth strongly upon navigation  not that they knew anything about  it but that they always mistrusted the captain in calm weather or  when the wind was adverse  indeed the mercury itself is not so  variable as this class of passengers whom you will see when the  ship is going nobly through the water quite pale with admiration  swearing that the captain beats all captains ever known and even  hinting at subscriptions for a piece of plate and who next  morning when the breeze has lulled and all the sails hang useless  in the idle air shake their despondent heads again and say with  screwedup lips they hope that captain is a sailor  but they  shrewdly doubt him  it even became an occupation in the calm to wonder when the wind  would spring up in the favourable quarter where it was clearly  shown by all the rules and precedents it ought to have sprung up  long ago  the first mate who whistled for it zealously was much  respected for his perseverance and was regarded even by the  unbelievers as a firstrate sailor  many gloomy looks would be  cast upward through the cabin skylights at the flapping sails while  dinner was in progress and some growing bold in ruefulness  predicted that we should land about the middle of july  there are  always on board ship a sanguine one and a despondent one  the  latter character carried it hollow at this period of the voyage  and triumphed over the sanguine one at every meal by inquiring  where he supposed the great western which left new york a week  after us was now  and where he supposed the cunard steampacket  was now  and what he thought of sailing vessels as compared with  steamships now  and so beset his life with pestilent attacks of  that kind that he too was obliged to affect despondency for very  peace and quietude  these were additions to the list of entertaining incidents but  there was still another source of interest  we carried in the  steerage nearly a hundred passengers  a little world of poverty   and as we came to know individuals among them by sight from  looking down upon the deck where they took the air in the daytime  and cooked their food and very often ate it too we became curious  to know their histories and with what expectations they had gone  out to america and on what errands they were going home and what  their circumstances were  the information we got on these heads  from the carpenter who had charge of these people was often of  the strangest kind  some of them had been in america but three  days some but three months and some had gone out in the last  voyage of that very ship in which they were now returning home   others had sold their clothes to raise the passagemoney and had  hardly rags to cover them others had no food and lived upon the  charity of the rest  and one man it was discovered nearly at the  end of the voyage not before  for he kept his secret close and  did not court compassion  had had no sustenance whatever but the  bones and scraps of fat he took from the plates used in the after cabin dinner when they were put out to be washed  the whole system of shipping and conveying these unfortunate  persons is one that stands in need of thorough revision  if any  class deserve to be protected and assisted by the government it is  that class who are banished from their native land in search of the  bare means of subsistence  all that could be done for these poor  people by the great compassion and humanity of the captain and  officers was done but they require much more  the law is bound  at least upon the english side to see that too many of them are  not put on board one ship  and that their accommodations are  decent  not demoralising and profligate  it is bound too in  common humanity to declare that no man shall be taken on board  without his stock of provisions being previously inspected by some  proper officer and pronounced moderately sufficient for his  support upon the voyage  it is bound to provide or to require  that there be provided a medical attendant whereas in these ships  there are none though sickness of adults and deaths of children  on the passage are matters of the very commonest occurrence   above all it is the duty of any government be it monarchy or  republic to interpose and put an end to that system by which a  firm of traders in emigrants purchase of the owners the whole  tweendecks of a ship and send on board as many wretched people  as they can lay hold of on any terms they can get without the  smallest reference to the conveniences of the steerage the number  of berths the slightest separation of the sexes or anything but  their own immediate profit  nor is even this the worst of the  vicious system  for certain crimping agents of these houses who  have a percentage on all the passengers they inveigle are  constantly travelling about those districts where poverty and  discontent are rife and tempting the credulous into more misery  by holding out monstrous inducements to emigration which can never  be realised  the history of every family we had on board was pretty much the  same  after hoarding up and borrowing and begging and selling  everything to pay the passage they had gone out to new york  expecting to find its streets paved with gold and had found them  paved with very hard and very real stones  enterprise was dull  labourers were not wanted jobs of work were to be got but the  payment was not  they were coming back even poorer than they  went  one of them was carrying an open letter from a young english  artisan who had been in new york a fortnight to a friend near  manchester whom he strongly urged to follow him  one of the  officers brought it to me as a curiosity  this is the country  jem said the writer  i like america  there is no despotism  here thats the great thing  employment of all sorts is going a begging and wages are capital  you have only to choose a trade  jem and be it  i havent made choice of one yet but i shall  soon  at present i havent quite made up my mind whether to be a  carpenter  or a tailor  there was yet another kind of passenger and but one more who in  the calm and the light winds was a constant theme of conversation  and observation among us  this was an english sailor a smart  thoroughbuilt english manofwarsman from his hat to his shoes  who was serving in the american navy and having got leave of  absence was on his way home to see his friends  when he presented  himself to take and pay for his passage it had been suggested to  him that being an able seaman he might as well work it and save the  money but this piece of advice he very indignantly rejected   saying hed be damned but for once hed go aboard ship as a  gentleman  accordingly they took his money but he no sooner  came aboard than he stowed his kit in the forecastle arranged to  mess with the crew and the very first time the hands were turned  up went aloft like a cat before anybody  and all through the  passage there he was first at the braces outermost on the yards  perpetually lending a hand everywhere but always with a sober  dignity in his manner and a sober grin on his face which plainly  said i do it as a gentleman  for my own pleasure mind you  at length and at last the promised wind came up in right good  earnest and away we went before it with every stitch of canvas  set slashing through the water nobly  there was a grandeur in the  motion of the splendid ship as overshadowed by her mass of sails  she rode at a furious pace upon the waves which filled one with an  indescribable sense of pride and exultation  as she plunged into a  foaming valley how i loved to see the green waves bordered deep  with white come rushing on astern to buoy her upward at their  pleasure and curl about her as she stooped again but always own  her for their haughty mistress still  on on we flew with  changing lights upon the water being now in the blessed region of  fleecy skies a bright sun lighting us by day and a bright moon by  night the vane pointing directly homeward alike the truthful  index to the favouring wind and to our cheerful hearts until at  sunrise one fair monday morning  the twentyseventh of june i  shall not easily forget the day  there lay before us old cape  clear god bless it showing in the mist of early morning like a  cloud  the brightest and most welcome cloud to us that ever hid  the face of heavens fallen sister  home  dim speck as it was in the wide prospect it made the sunrise a  more cheerful sight and gave to it that sort of human interest  which it seems to want at sea  there as elsewhere the return of  day is inseparable from some sense of renewed hope and gladness  but the light shining on the dreary waste of water and showing it  in all its vast extent of loneliness presents a solemn spectacle  which even night veiling it in darkness and uncertainty does not  surpass  the rising of the moon is more in keeping with the  solitary ocean and has an air of melancholy grandeur which in its  soft and gentle influence seems to comfort while it saddens  i  recollect when i was a very young child having a fancy that the  reflection of the moon in water was a path to heaven trodden by  the spirits of good people on their way to god and this old  feeling often came over me again when i watched it on a tranquil  night at sea  the wind was very light on this same monday morning but it was  still in the right quarter and so by slow degrees we left cape  clear behind and sailed along within sight of the coast of  ireland  and how merry we all were and how loyal to the george  washington and how full of mutual congratulations and how  venturesome in predicting the exact hour at which we should arrive  at liverpool may be easily imagined and readily understood  also  how heartily we drank the captains health that day at dinner and  how restless we became about packing up  and how two or three of  the most sanguine spirits rejected the idea of going to bed at all  that night as something it was not worth while to do so near the  shore but went nevertheless and slept soundly and how to be so  near our journeys end was like a pleasant dream from which one  feared to wake  the friendly breeze freshened again next day and on we went once  more before it gallantly  descrying now and then an english ship  going homeward under shortened sail while we with every inch of  canvas crowded on dashed gaily past and left her far behind   towards evening the weather turned hazy with a drizzling rain  and soon became so thick that we sailed as it were in a cloud   still we swept onward like a phantom ship and many an eager eye  glanced up to where the lookout on the mast kept watch for  holyhead  at length his longexpected cry was heard and at the same moment  there shone out from the haze and mist ahead a gleaming light  which presently was gone and soon returned and soon was gone  again  whenever it came back the eyes of all on board brightened  and sparkled like itself  and there we all stood watching this  revolving light upon the rock at holyhead and praising it for its  brightness and its friendly warning and lauding it in short  above all other signal lights that ever were displayed until it  once more glimmered faintly in the distance far behind us  then it was time to fire a gun for a pilot and almost before its  smoke had cleared away a little boat with a light at her masthead  came bearing down upon us through the darkness swiftly  and  presently our sails being backed she ran alongside and the  hoarse pilot wrapped and muffled in peacoats and shawls to the  very bridge of his weatherploughedup nose stood bodily among us  on the deck  and i think if that pilot had wanted to borrow fifty  pounds for an indefinite period on no security we should have  engaged to lend it to him among us before his boat had dropped  astern or which is the same thing before every scrap of news in  the paper he brought with him had become the common property of all  on board  we turned in pretty late that night and turned out pretty early  next morning  by six oclock we clustered on the deck prepared to  go ashore and looked upon the spires and roofs and smoke of  liverpool  by eight we all sat down in one of its hotels to eat  and drink together for the last time  and by nine we had shaken  hands all round and broken up our social company for ever  the country by the railroad seemed as we rattled through it  like a luxuriant garden  the beauty of the fields so small they  looked the hedgerows and the trees the pretty cottages the  beds of flowers the old churchyards the antique houses and every  wellknown object the exquisite delights of that one journey  crowding in the short compass of a summers day the joy of many  years with the winding up with home and all that makes it dear no  tongue can tell or pen of mine describe    chapter xvii  slavery    the upholders of slavery in america  of the atrocities of which  system i shall not write one word for which i have not had ample  proof and warrant  may be divided into three great classes  the first are those more moderate and rational owners of human  cattle who have come into the possession of them as so many coins  in their trading capital but who admit the frightful nature of the  institution in the abstract and perceive the dangers to society  with which it is fraught  dangers which however distant they may  be or howsoever tardy in their coming on are as certain to fall  upon its guilty head as is the day of judgment  the second consists of all those owners breeders users buyers  and sellers of slaves who will until the bloody chapter has a  bloody end own breed use buy and sell them at all hazards   who doggedly deny the horrors of the system in the teeth of such a  mass of evidence as never was brought to bear on any other subject  and to which the experience of every day contributes its immense  amount who would at this or any other moment gladly involve  america in a war civil or foreign provided that it had for its  sole end and object the assertion of their right to perpetuate  slavery and to whip and work and torture slaves unquestioned by  any human authority and unassailed by any human power who when  they speak of freedom mean the freedom to oppress their kind and  to be savage merciless and cruel and of whom every man on his  own ground in republican america is a more exacting and a  sterner and a less responsible despot than the caliph haroun  alraschid in his angry robe of scarlet  the third and not the least numerous or influential is composed  of all that delicate gentility which cannot bear a superior and  cannot brook an equal of that class whose republicanism means i  will not tolerate a man above me  and of those below none must  approach too near whose pride in a land where voluntary  servitude is shunned as a disgrace must be ministered to by  slaves and whose inalienable rights can only have their growth in  negro wrongs  it has been sometimes urged that in the unavailing efforts which  have been made to advance the cause of human freedom in the  republic of america strange cause for history to treat of  sufficient regard has not been had to the existence of the first  class of persons and it has been contended that they are hardly  used in being confounded with the second  this is no doubt the  case noble instances of pecuniary and personal sacrifice have  already had their growth among them and it is much to be regretted  that the gulf between them and the advocates of emancipation should  have been widened and deepened by any means  the rather as there  are beyond dispute among these slaveowners many kind masters  who are tender in the exercise of their unnatural power  still it  is to be feared that this injustice is inseparable from the state  of things with which humanity and truth are called upon to deal   slavery is not a whit the more endurable because some hearts are to  be found which can partially resist its hardening influences nor  can the indignant tide of honest wrath stand still because in its  onward course it overwhelms a few who are comparatively innocent  among a host of guilty  the ground most commonly taken by these better men among the  advocates of slavery is this  it is a bad system and for myself  i would willingly get rid of it if i could most willingly  but  it is not so bad as you in england take it to be  you are  deceived by the representations of the emancipationists  the  greater part of my slaves are much attached to me  you will say  that i do not allow them to be severely treated but i will put it  to you whether you believe that it can be a general practice to  treat them inhumanly when it would impair their value and would  be obviously against the interests of their masters  is it the interest of any man to steal to game to waste his  health and mental faculties by drunkenness to lie forswear  himself indulge hatred seek desperate revenge or do murder  no   all these are roads to ruin  and why then do men tread them   because such inclinations are among the vicious qualities of  mankind  blot out ye friends of slavery from the catalogue of  human passions brutal lust cruelty and the abuse of  irresponsible power of all earthly temptations the most difficult  to be resisted and when ye have done so and not before we will  inquire whether it be the interest of a master to lash and maim the  slaves over whose lives and limbs he has an absolute control  but again  this class together with that last one i have named  the miserable aristocracy spawned of a false republic lift up  their voices and exclaim public opinion is allsufficient to  prevent such cruelty as you denounce  public opinion  why  public opinion in the slave states is slavery is it not  public  opinion in the slave states has delivered the slaves over to the  gentle mercies of their masters  public opinion has made the laws  and denied the slaves legislative protection  public opinion has  knotted the lash heated the brandingiron loaded the rifle and  shielded the murderer  public opinion threatens the abolitionist  with death if he venture to the south and drags him with a rope  about his middle in broad unblushing noon through the first city  in the east  public opinion has within a few years burned a  slave alive at a slow fire in the city of st louis and public  opinion has to this day maintained upon the bench that estimable  judge who charged the jury impanelled there to try his murderers  that their most horrid deed was an act of public opinion and being  so must not be punished by the laws the public sentiment had made   public opinion hailed this doctrine with a howl of wild applause  and set the prisoners free to walk the city men of mark and  influence and station as they had been before  public opinion what class of men have an immense preponderance  over the rest of the community in their power of representing  public opinion in the legislature the slaveowners  they send  from their twelve states one hundred members while the fourteen  free states with a free population nearly double return but a  hundred and fortytwo  before whom do the presidential candidates  bow down the most humbly on whom do they fawn the most fondly and  for whose tastes do they cater the most assiduously in their  servile protestations  the slaveowners always  public opinion hear the public opinion of the free south as  expressed by its own members in the house of representatives at  washington  i have a great respect for the chair quoth north  carolina i have a great respect for the chair as an officer of  the house and a great respect for him personally nothing but that  respect prevents me from rushing to the table and tearing that  petition which has just been presented for the abolition of slavery  in the district of columbia to pieces  i warn the  abolitionists says south carolina ignorant infuriated  barbarians as they are that if chance shall throw any of them into  our hands he may expect a felons death  let an abolitionist  come within the borders of south carolina cries a third mild  carolinas colleague and if we can catch him we will try him  and notwithstanding the interference of all the governments on  earth including the federal government we will hang him  public opinion has made this law  it has declared that in  washington in that city which takes its name from the father of  american liberty any justice of the peace may bind with fetters  any negro passing down the street and thrust him into jail  no  offence on the black mans part is necessary  the justice says i  choose to think this man a runaway and locks him up  public  opinion impowers the man of law when this is done to advertise the  negro in the newspapers warning his owner to come and claim him  or he will be sold to pay the jail fees  but supposing he is a  free black and has no owner it may naturally be presumed that he  is set at liberty  no  he is sold to recompense his jailer  this  has been done again and again and again  he has no means of  proving his freedom has no adviser messenger or assistance of  any sort or kind no investigation into his case is made or  inquiry instituted  he a free man who may have served for years  and bought his liberty is thrown into jail on no process for no  crime and on no pretence of crime  and is sold to pay the jail  fees  this seems incredible even of america but it is the law  public opinion is deferred to in such cases as the following   which is headed in the newspapers   interesting lawcase  an interesting case is now on trial in the supreme court arising  out of the following facts  a gentleman residing in maryland had  allowed an aged pair of his slaves substantial though not legal  freedom for several years  while thus living a daughter was born  to them who grew up in the same liberty until she married a free  negro and went with him to reside in pennsylvania  they had  several children and lived unmolested until the original owner  died when his heir attempted to regain them but the magistrate  before whom they were brought decided that he had no jurisdiction  in the case  the owner seized the woman and her children in the  night and carried them to maryland   cash for negroes cash for negroes cash for negroes is the  heading of advertisements in great capitals down the long columns  of the crowded journals  woodcuts of a runaway negro with manacled  hands crouching beneath a bluff pursuer in top boots who having  caught him grasps him by the throat agreeably diversify the  pleasant text  the leading article protests against that  abominable and hellish doctrine of abolition which is repugnant  alike to every law of god and nature  the delicate mamma who  smiles her acquiescence in this sprightly writing as she reads the  paper in her cool piazza quiets her youngest child who clings  about her skirts by promising the boy a whip to beat the little  niggers with  but the negroes little and big are protected by  public opinion  let us try this public opinion by another test which is important  in three points of view  first as showing how desperately timid  of the public opinion slaveowners are in their delicate  descriptions of fugitive slaves in widely circulated newspapers  secondly as showing how perfectly contented the slaves are and  how very seldom they run away thirdly as exhibiting their entire  freedom from scar or blemish or any mark of cruel infliction as  their pictures are drawn not by lying abolitionists but by their  own truthful masters  the following are a few specimens of the advertisements in the  public papers  it is only four years since the oldest among them  appeared and others of the same nature continue to be published  every day in shoals  ran away negress caroline  had on a collar with one prong turned  down  ran away a black woman betsy  had an iron bar on her right

latter piece of  description that among the other blessings which public opinion  secures to the negroes is the common practice of violently  punching out their teeth  to make them wear iron collars by day  and night and to worry them with dogs are practices almost too  ordinary to deserve mention  ran away my man fountain  has holes in his ears a scar on the  right side of his forehead has been

his ears  ran away negro boy jack  has a small crop out of his left ear  ran away a negro man named ivory  has a small piece cut out of  the top of each ear  while upon the subject of ears i may observe that a distinguished  abolitionist in new york once received a negros ear which had  been cut off close to the head in a general post letter  it was  forwarded by the free and independent gentleman who had caused it  to be amputated with a polite request that he would place the  specimen in his collection  i could enlarge this catalogue with broken arms and broken legs  and gashed flesh and missing teeth and lacerated backs and bites  of dogs and brands of redhot irons innumerable  but as my  readers will be sufficiently sickened and repelled already i will  turn to another branch of the subject  these advertisements of which a similar collection might be made  for every year and month and week and day and which are coolly  read in families as things of course and as a part of the current  news and smalltalk will serve to show how very much the slaves  profit by public opinion and how tender it is in their behalf   but it may be worth while to inquire how the slaveowners and the  class of society to which great numbers of them belong defer to  public opinion in their conduct not to their slaves but to each  other how they are accustomed to restrain their passions what  their bearing is among themselves whether they are fierce or  gentle whether their social customs be brutal sanguinary and  violent or bear the impress of civilisation and refinement  that we may have no partial evidence from abolitionists in this  inquiry either i will once more turn to their own newspapers and  i will confine myself this time to a selection from paragraphs  which appeared from day to day during my visit to america and  which refer to occurrences happening while i was there  the  italics in these extracts as in the foregoing are my own  these cases did not all occur it will be seen in territory  actually belonging to legalised slave states though most and  those the very worst among them did as their counterparts  constantly do but the position of the scenes of action in  reference to places immediately at hand where slavery is the law  and the strong resemblance between that class of outrages and the  rest lead to the just presumption that the character of the  parties concerned was formed in slave districts and brutalised by  slave customs   horrible tragedy   by a slip from the southport telegraph wisconsin we learn that  the hon charles c p arndt member of the council for brown  county was shot dead on the floor of the council chamber by james  r vinyard member from grant county  the affair grew out of a  nomination for sheriff of grant county  mr e s baker was  nominated and supported by mr arndt  this nomination was opposed  by vinyard who wanted the appointment to vest in his own brother   in the course of debate the deceased made some statements which  vinyard pronounced false and made use of violent and insulting  language dealing largely in personalities to which mr a made no  reply  after the adjournment mr a stepped up to vinyard and  requested him to retract which he refused to do repeating the  offensive words  mr arndt then made a blow at vinyard who  stepped back a pace drew a pistol and shot him dead  the issue appears to have been provoked on the part of vinyard  who was determined at all hazards to defeat the appointment of  baker and who himself defeated turned his ire and revenge upon  the unfortunate arndt   the wisconsin tragedy   public indignation runs high in the territory of wisconsin in  relation to the murder of c c p arndt in the legislative hall  of the territory  meetings have been held in different counties of  wisconsin denouncing the practice of secretly bearing arms in the  legislative chambers of the country  we have seen the account of  the expulsion of james r vinyard the perpetrator of the bloody  deed and are amazed to hear that after this expulsion by those  who saw vinyard kill mr arndt in the presence of his aged father  who was on a visit to see his son little dreaming that he was to  witness his murder judge dunn has discharged vinyard on bail  the  miners free press speaks in terms of merited rebuke at the outrage  upon the feelings of the people of wisconsin  vinyard was within  arms length of mr arndt when he took such deadly aim at him  that he never spoke  vinyard might at pleasure being so near  have only wounded him but he chose to kill him   murder   by a letter in a st louis paper of the 4th we notice a terrible  outrage at burlington iowa  a mr bridgman having had a  difficulty with a citizen of the place mr ross a brotherinlaw  of the latter provided himself with one of colts revolving  pistols met mr b in the street and discharged the contents of  five of the barrels at him  each shot taking effect  mr b  though horribly wounded and dying returned the fire and killed  ross on the spot   terrible death of robert potter   from the caddo gazette of the 12th inst we learn the  frightful death of colonel robert potter    he was beset in his  house by an enemy named rose  he sprang from his couch seized  his gun and in his nightclothes rushed from the house  for  about two hundred yards his speed seemed to defy his pursuers but  getting entangled in a thicket he was captured  rose told him  that he intended to act a generous part and give him a chance for  his life  he then told potter he might run and he should not be  interrupted till he reached a certain distance  potter started at  the word of command and before a gun was fired he had reached the  lake  his first impulse was to jump in the water and dive for it  which he did  rose was close behind him and formed his men on the  bank ready to shoot him as he rose  in a few seconds he came up to  breathe and scarce had his head reached the surface of the water  when it was completely riddled with the shot of their guns and he  sunk to rise no more   murder in arkansas   we understand that a severe rencontre came off a few days since in  the seneca nation between mr loose the subagent of the mixed  band of the senecas quapaw and shawnees and mr james gillespie  of the mercantile firm of thomas g allison and co of maysville  benton county ark in which the latter was slain with a bowie knife  some difficulty had for some time existed between the  parties  it is said that major gillespie brought on the attack  with a cane  a severe conflict ensued during which two pistols  were fired by gillespie and one by loose  loose then stabbed  gillespie with one of those neverfailing weapons a bowieknife   the death of major g is much regretted as he was a liberalminded  and energetic man  since the above was in type we have learned  that major allison has stated to some of our citizens in town that  mr loose gave the first blow  we forbear to give any particulars  as the matter will be the subject of judicial investigation   foul deed   the steamer thames just from missouri river brought us a  handbill offering a reward of 500 dollars for the person who  assassinated lilburn w baggs late governor of this state at  independence on the night of the 6th inst  governor baggs it is  stated in a written memorandum was not dead but mortally wounded  since the above was written we received a note from the clerk of  the thames giving the following particulars  gov baggs was shot  by some villain on friday 6th inst in the evening while sitting  in a room in his own house in independence  his son a boy  hearing a report ran into the room and found the governor sitting  in his chair with his jaw fallen down and his head leaning back  on discovering the injury done to his father he gave the alarm   foot tracks were found in the garden below the window and a pistol  picked up supposed to have been overloaded and thrown from the  hand of the scoundrel who fired it  three buck shots of a heavy  load took effect one going through his mouth one into the brain  and another probably in or near the brain all going into the back  part of the neck and head  the governor was still alive on the  morning of the 7th but no hopes for his recovery by his friends  and but slight hopes from his physicians  a man was suspected and the sheriff most probably has possession  of him by this time  the pistol was one of a pair stolen some days previous from a  baker in independence and the legal authorities have the  description of the other   rencontre   an unfortunate affair took place on friday evening in chatres  street in which one of our most respectable citizens received a  dangerous wound from a poignard in the abdomen  from the bee  new orleans of yesterday we learn the following particulars  it  appears that an article was published in the french side of the  paper on monday last containing some strictures on the artillery  battalion for firing their guns on sunday morning in answer to  those from the ontario and woodbury and thereby much alarm was  caused to the families of those persons who were out all night  preserving the peace of the city  major c gally commander of the  battalion resenting this called at the office and demanded the  authors name that of mr p arpin was given to him who was  absent at the time  some angry words then passed with one of the  proprietors and a challenge followed the friends of both parties  tried to arrange the affair but failed to do so  on friday  evening about seven oclock major gally met mr p arpin in  chatres street and accosted him  are you mr arpin  yes sir  then i have to tell you that you are a   applying an  appropriate epithet  i shall remind you of your words sir  but i have said i would break my cane on your shoulders  i know it but i have not yet received the blow  at these words major gally having a cane in his hands struck  mr arpin across the face and the latter drew a poignard from his  pocket and stabbed major gally in the abdomen  fears are entertained that the wound will be mortal  we  understand that mr arpin has given security for his appearance at  the criminal court to answer the charge   affray in mississippi   on the 27th ult in an affray near carthage leake county  mississippi between james cottingham and john wilburn the latter  was shot by the former and so horribly wounded that there was no  hope of his recovery  on the 2nd instant there was an affray at  carthage between a c sharkey and george goff in which the latter  was shot and thought mortally wounded  sharkey delivered himself  up to the authorities but changed his mind and escaped   personal encounter   an encounter took place in sparta a few days since between the  barkeeper of an hotel and a man named bury  it appears that bury  had become somewhat noisy and that the barkeeper determined to  preserve order had threatened to shoot bury whereupon bury drew a  pistol and shot the barkeeper down  he was not dead at the last  accounts but slight hopes were entertained of his recovery   duel   the clerk of the steamboat tribune informs us that another duel  was fought on tuesday last by mr robbins a bank officer in  vicksburg and mr fall the editor of the vicksburg sentinel   according to the arrangement the parties had six pistols each  which after the word fire they were to discharge as fast as  they pleased  fall fired two pistols without effect  mr robbins  first shot took effect in falls thigh who fell and was unable to  continue the combat   affray in clarke county   an unfortunate affray occurred in clarke county mo near  waterloo on tuesday the 19th ult which originated in settling  the partnership concerns of messrs mkane and mallister who had  been engaged in the business of distilling and resulted in the  death of the latter who was shot down by mr mkane because of  his attempting to take possession of seven barrels of whiskey the  property of mkane which had been knocked off to mallister at a  sheriffs sale at one dollar per barrel  mkane immediately fled  and at the latest dates had not been taken  this unfortunate affray caused considerable excitement in the  neighbourhood as both the parties were men with large families  depending upon them and stood well in the community   i will quote but one more paragraph which by reason of its  monstrous absurdity may be a relief to these atrocious deeds   affair of honour   we have just heard the particulars of a meeting which took place  on six mile island on tuesday between two young bloods of our  city  samuel thurston aged fifteen and william hine aged  thirteen years  they were attended by young gentlemen of the same  age  the weapons used on the occasion were a couple of dicksons  best rifles the distance thirty yards  they took one fire  without any damage being sustained by either party except the ball  of thurstons gun passing through the crown of hines hat  through  the intercession of the board of honour the challenge was  withdrawn and the difference amicably adjusted  if the reader will picture to himself the kind of board of honour  which amicably adjusted the difference between these two little  boys who in any other part of the world would have been amicably  adjusted on two porters backs and soundly flogged with birchen  rods he will be possessed no doubt with as strong a sense of its  ludicrous character as that which sets me laughing whenever its  image rises up before me  now i appeal to every human mind imbued with the commonest of  common sense and the commonest of common humanity to all  dispassionate reasoning creatures of any shade of opinion and  ask with these revolting evidences of the state of society which  exists in and about the slave districts of america before them can  they have a doubt of the real condition of the slave or can they  for a moment make a compromise between the institution or any of  its flagrant fearful features and their own just consciences   will they say of any tale of cruelty and horror however aggravated  in degree that it is improbable when they can turn to the public  prints and running read such signs as these laid before them by  the men who rule the slaves  in their own acts and under their own  hands  do we not know that the worst deformity and ugliness of slavery are  at once the cause and the effect of the reckless license taken by  these freeborn outlaws  do we not know that the man who has been  born and bred among its wrongs who has seen in his childhood  husbands obliged at the word of command to flog their wives women  indecently compelled to hold up their own garments that men might  lay the heavier stripes upon their legs driven and harried by  brutal overseers in their time of travail and becoming mothers on  the field of toil under the very lash itself who has read in  youth and seen his virgin sisters read descriptions of runaway  men and women and their disfigured persons which could not be  published elsewhere of so much stock upon a farm or at a show of  beasts do we not know that that man whenever his wrath is  kindled up will be a brutal savage  do we not know that as he is  a coward in his domestic life stalking among his shrinking men and  women slaves armed with his heavy whip so he will be a coward out  of doors and carrying cowards weapons hidden in his breast will  shoot men down and stab them when he quarrels  and if our reason  did not teach us this and much beyond if we were such idiots as to  close our eyes to that fine mode of training which rears up such  men should we not know that they who among their equals stab and  pistol in the legislative halls and in the countinghouse and on  the marketplace and in all the elsewhere peaceful pursuits of  life must be to their dependants even though they were free  servants so many merciless and unrelenting tyrants  what shall we declaim against the ignorant peasantry of ireland  and mince the matter when these american taskmasters are in  question  shall we cry shame on the brutality of those who  hamstring cattle  and spare the lights of freedom upon earth who  notch the ears of men and women cut pleasant posies in the  shrinking flesh learn to write with pens of redhot iron on the  human face rack their poetic fancies for liveries of mutilation  which their slaves shall wear for life and carry to the grave  breaking living limbs as did the soldiery who mocked and slew the  saviour of the world and set defenceless creatures up for targets   shall we whimper over legends of the tortures practised on each  other by the pagan indians and smile upon the cruelties of  christian men  shall we so long as these things last exult above  the scattered remnants of that race and triumph in the white  enjoyment of their possessions  rather for me restore the forest  and the indian village in lieu of stars and stripes let some poor  feather flutter in the breeze replace the streets and squares by  wigwams and though the deathsong of a hundred haughty warriors  fill the air it will be music to the shriek of one unhappy slave  on one theme which is commonly before our eyes and in respect of  which our national character is changing fast let the plain truth  be spoken and let us not like dastards beat about the bush by  hinting at the spaniard and the fierce italian  when knives are  drawn by englishmen in conflict let it be said and known  we owe  this change to republican slavery  these are the weapons of  freedom  with sharp points and edges such as these liberty in  america hews and hacks her slaves or failing that pursuit her  sons devote them to a better use and turn them on each other    chapter xviii  concluding remarks    there are many passages in this book where i have been at some  pains to resist the temptation of troubling my readers with my own  deductions and conclusions  preferring that they should judge for  themselves from such premises as i have laid before them  my only  object in the outset was to carry them with me faithfully  wheresoever i went  and that task i have discharged  but i may be pardoned if on such a theme as the general character  of the american people and the general character of their social  system as presented to a strangers eyes i desire to express my  own opinions in a few words before i bring these volumes to a  close  they are by nature frank brave cordial hospitable and  affectionate  cultivation and refinement seem but to enhance their  warmth of heart and ardent enthusiasm and it is the possession of  these latter qualities in a most remarkable degree which renders  an educated american one of the most endearing and most generous of  friends  i never was so won upon as by this class never yielded  up my full confidence and esteem so readily and pleasurably as to  them never can make again in half a year so many friends for  whom i seem to entertain the regard of half a life  these qualities are natural i implicitly believe to the whole  people  that they are however sadly sapped and blighted in their  growth among the mass and that there are influences at work which  endanger them still more and give but little present promise of  their healthy restoration is a truth that ought to be told  it is an essential part of every national character to pique itself  mightily upon its faults and to deduce tokens of its virtue or its  wisdom from their very exaggeration  one great blemish in the  popular mind of america and the prolific parent of an innumerable  brood of evils is universal distrust  yet the american citizen  plumes himself upon this spirit even when he is sufficiently  dispassionate to perceive the ruin it works and will often adduce  it in spite of his own reason as an instance of the great  sagacity and acuteness of the people and their superior shrewdness  and independence  you carry says the stranger this jealousy and distrust into  every transaction of public life  by repelling worthy men from  your legislative assemblies it has bred up a class of candidates  for the suffrage who in their very act disgrace your  institutions and your peoples choice  it has rendered you so  fickle and so given to change that your inconstancy has passed  into a proverb for you no sooner set up an idol firmly than you  are sure to pull it down and dash it into fragments  and this  because directly you reward a benefactor or a public servant you  distrust him merely because he is rewarded and immediately apply  yourselves to find out either that you have been too bountiful in  your acknowledgments or he remiss in his deserts  any man who  attains a high place among you from the president downwards may  date his downfall from that moment for any printed lie that any  notorious villain pens although it militate directly against the  character and conduct of a life appeals at once to your distrust  and is believed  you will strain at a gnat in the way of  trustfulness and confidence however fairly won and well deserved  but you will swallow a whole caravan of camels if they be laden  with unworthy doubts and mean suspicions  is this well think you  or likely to elevate the character of the governors or the  governed among you  the answer is invariably the same  theres freedom of opinion  here you know  every man thinks for himself and we are not to be  easily overreached  thats how our people come to be suspicious  another prominent feature is the love of smart dealing  which  gilds over many a swindle and gross breach of trust many a  defalcation public and private and enables many a knave to hold  his head up with the best who well deserves a halter though it  has not been without its retributive operation for this smartness  has done more in a few years to impair the public credit and to  cripple the public resources than dull honesty however rash  could have effected in a century  the merits of a broken  speculation or a bankruptcy or of a successful scoundrel are not  gauged by its or his observance of the golden rule do as you  would be done by but are considered with reference to their  smartness  i recollect on both occasions of our passing that ill fated cairo on the mississippi remarking on the bad effects such  gross deceits must have when they exploded in generating a want of  confidence abroad and discouraging foreign investment  but i was  given to understand that this was a very smart scheme by which a  deal of money had been made  and that its smartest feature was  that they forgot these things abroad in a very short time and  speculated again as freely as ever  the following dialogue i have  held a hundred times  is it not a very disgraceful circumstance  that such a man as soandso should be acquiring a large property  by the most infamous and odious means and notwithstanding all the  crimes of which he has been guilty should be tolerated and abetted  by your citizens  he is a public nuisance is he not  yes  sir  a convicted liar  yes sir  he has been kicked and  cuffed and caned  yes sir  and he is utterly dishonourable  debased and profligate  yes sir  in the name of wonder  then what is his merit  well sir he is a smart man  in like manner all kinds of deficient and impolitic usages are  referred to the national love of trade though oddly enough it  would be a weighty charge against a foreigner that he regarded the  americans as a trading people  the love of trade is assigned as a  reason for that comfortless custom so very prevalent in country  towns of married persons living in hotels having no fireside of  their own and seldom meeting from early morning until late at  night but at the hasty public meals  the love of trade is a  reason why the literature of america is to remain for ever  unprotected for we are a trading people and dont care for  poetry though we do by the way profess to be very proud of our  poets  while healthful amusements cheerful means of recreation  and wholesome fancies must fade before the stern utilitarian joys  of trade  these three characteristics are strongly presented at every turn  full in the strangers view  but the foul growth of america has a  more tangled root than this and it strikes its fibres deep in its  licentious press  schools may be erected east west north and south pupils be  taught and masters reared by scores upon scores of thousands  colleges may thrive churches may be crammed temperance may be  diffused and advancing knowledge in all other forms walk through  the land with giant strides  but while the newspaper press of  america is in or near its present abject state high moral  improvement in that country is hopeless  year by year it must and  will go back year by year the tone of public feeling must sink  lower down year by year the congress and the senate must become  of less account before all decent men and year by year the memory  of the great fathers of the revolution must be outraged more and  more in the bad life of their degenerate child  among the herd of journals which are published in the states there  are some the reader scarcely need be told of character and  credit  from personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen  connected with publications of this class i have derived both  pleasure and profit  but the name of these is few and of the  others legion and the influence of the good is powerless to  counteract the moral poison of the bad  among the gentry of america among the wellinformed and moderate   in the learned professions at the bar and on the bench  there is  as there can be but one opinion in reference to the vicious  character of these infamous journals  it is sometimes contended   i will not say strangely for it is natural to seek excuses for  such a disgrace  that their influence is not so great as a visitor  would suppose  i must be pardoned for saying that there is no  warrant for this plea and that every fact and circumstance tends  directly to the opposite conclusion  when any man of any grade of desert in intellect or character can  climb to any public distinction no matter what in america  without first grovelling down upon the earth and bending the knee  before this monster of depravity when any private excellence is  safe from its attacks when any social confidence is left unbroken  by it or any tie of social decency and honour is held in the least  regard when any man in that free country has freedom of opinion  and presumes to think for himself and speak for himself without  humble reference to a censorship which for its rampant ignorance  and base dishonesty he utterly loathes and despises in his heart  when those who most acutely feel its infamy and the reproach it  casts upon the nation and who most denounce it to each other dare  to set their heels upon and crush it openly in the sight of all  men  then i will believe that its influence is lessening and men  are returning to their manly senses  but while that press has its  evil eye in every house and its black hand in every appointment in  the state from a president to a postman while with ribald  slander for its only stock in trade it is the standard literature  of an enormous class who must find their reading in a newspaper  or they will not read at all so long must its odium be upon the  countrys head and so long must the evil it works be plainly  visible in the republic  to those who are accustomed to the leading english journals or to  the respectable journals of the continent of europe to those who  are accustomed to anything else in print and paper it would be  impossible without an amount of extract for which i have neither  space nor inclination to convey an adequate idea of this frightful  engine in america  but if any man desire confirmation of my  statement on this head let him repair to any place in this city of  london where scattered numbers of these publications are to be  found and there let him form his own opinion 1  it would be well there can be no doubt for the american people as  a whole if they loved the real less and the ideal somewhat more   it would be well if there were greater encouragement to lightness  of heart and gaiety and a wider cultivation of what is beautiful  without being eminently and directly useful  but here i think the  general remonstrance we are a new country which is so often  advanced as an excuse for defects which are quite unjustifiable as  being of right only the slow growth of an old one may be very  reasonably urged  and i yet hope to hear of there being some other  national amusement in the united states besides newspaper  politics  they certainly are not a humorous people and their temperament  always impressed me is being of a dull and gloomy character  in  shrewdness of remark and a certain castiron quaintness the  yankees or people of new england unquestionably take the lead as  they do in most other evidences of intelligence  but in travelling  about out of the large cities  as i have remarked in former parts  of these volumes  i was quite oppressed by the prevailing  seriousness and melancholy air of business  which was so general  and unvarying that at every new town i came to i seemed to meet  the very same people whom i had left behind me at the last  such  defects as are perceptible in the national manners seem to me to  be referable in a great degree to this cause  which has  generated a dull sullen persistence in coarse usages and rejected  the graces of life as undeserving of attention  there is no doubt  that washington who was always most scrupulous and exact on points  of ceremony perceived the tendency towards this mistake even in  his time and did his utmost to correct it  i cannot hold with other writers on these subjects that the  prevalence of various forms of dissent in america is in any way  attributable to the nonexistence there of an established church   indeed i think the temper of the people if it admitted of such an  institution being founded amongst them would lead them to desert  it as a matter of course merely because it was established  but  supposing it to exist i doubt its probable efficacy in summoning  the wandering sheep to one great fold simply because of the  immense amount of dissent which prevails at home and because i do  not find in america any one form of religion with which we in  europe or even in england are unacquainted  dissenters resort  thither in great numbers as other people do simply because it is  a land of resort and great settlements of them are founded  because ground can be purchased and towns and villages reared  where there were none of the human creation before  but even the  shakers emigrated from england our country is not unknown to mr  joseph smith the apostle of mormonism or to his benighted  disciples i have beheld religious scenes myself in some of our  populous towns which can hardly be surpassed by an american camp meeting and i am not aware that any instance of superstitious  imposture on the one hand and superstitious credulity on the  other has had its origin in the united states which we cannot  more than parallel by the precedents of mrs southcote mary tofts  the rabbitbreeder or even mr thorn of canterbury  which latter  case arose some time after the dark ages had passed away  the republican institutions of america undoubtedly lead the people  to assert their selfrespect and their equality but a traveller is  bound to bear those institutions in his mind and not hastily to  resent the near approach of a class of strangers who at home  would keep aloof  this characteristic when it was tinctured with  no foolish pride and stopped short of no honest service never  offended me and i very seldom if ever experienced its rude or  unbecoming display  once or twice it was comically developed as  in the following case but this was an amusing incident and not  the rule or near it  i wanted a pair of boots at a certain town for i had none to  travel in but those with the memorable cork soles which were much  too hot for the fiery decks of a steamboat  i therefore sent a  message to an artist in boots importing with my compliments that  i should be happy to see him if he would do me the polite favour  to call  he very kindly returned for answer that he would look  round at six oclock that evening  i was lying on the sofa with a book and a wineglass at about  that time when the door opened and a gentleman in a stiff cravat  within a year or two on either side of thirty entered in his hat  and gloves walked up to the lookingglass arranged his hair took  off his gloves slowly produced a measure from the uttermost depths  of his coatpocket and requested me in a languid tone to unfix  my straps  i complied but looked with some curiosity at his hat  which was still upon his head  it might have been that or it  might have been the heat  but he took it off  then he sat  himself down on a chair opposite to me rested an arm on each knee  and leaning forward very much took from the ground by a great  effort the specimen of metropolitan workmanship which i had just  pulled off  whistling pleasantly as he did so  he turned it  over and over surveyed it with a contempt no language can express  and inquired if i wished him to fix me a boot like that  i  courteously replied that provided the boots were large enough i  would leave the rest to him that if convenient and practicable i  should not object to their bearing some resemblance to the model  then before him but that i would be entirely guided by and would  beg to leave the whole subject to his judgment and discretion   you ant partickler about this scoop in the heel i suppose  then says he  we dont foller that here  i repeated my last  observation  he looked at himself in the glass again went closer  to it to dash a grain or two of dust out of the corner of his eye  and settled his cravat  all this time my leg and foot were in the  air  nearly ready sir i inquired  well pretty nigh he  said keep steady  i kept as steady as i could both in foot and  face and having by this time got the dust out and found his  pencilcase he measured me and made the necessary notes  when he  had finished he fell into his old attitude and taking up the boot  again mused for some time  and this he said at last is an  english boot is it  this is a london boot eh  that sir i  replied is a london boot  he mused over it again after the  manner of hamlet with yoricks skull nodded his head as who  should say i pity the institutions that led to the production of  this boot rose put up his pencil notes and paper  glancing  at himself in the glass all the time  put on his hat  drew on  his gloves very slowly and finally walked out  when he had been  gone about a minute the door reopened and his hat and his head  reappeared  he looked round the room and at the boot again which  was still lying on the floor appeared thoughtful for a minute and  then said well good arternoon  good afternoon sir said i   and that was the end of the interview  there is but one other head on which i wish to offer a remark and  that has reference to the public health  in so vast a country  where there are thousands of millions of acres of land yet  unsettled and uncleared and on every rood of which vegetable  decomposition is annually taking place where there are so many  great rivers and such opposite varieties of climate there cannot  fail to be a great amount of sickness at certain seasons  but i  may venture to say after conversing with many members of the  medical profession in america that i am not singular in the  opinion that much of the disease which does prevail might be  avoided if a few common precautions were observed  greater means  of personal cleanliness are indispensable to this end the custom  of hastily swallowing large quantities of animal food three times  aday and rushing back to sedentary pursuits after each meal must  be changed the gentler sex must go more wisely clad and take more  healthful exercise and in the latter clause the males must be  included also  above all in public institutions and throughout  the whole of every town and city the system of ventilation and  drainage and removal of impurities requires to be thoroughly  revised  there is no local legislature in america which may not  study mr chadwicks excellent report upon the sanitary condition  of our labouring classes with immense advantage         i have now arrived at the close of this book  i have little reason  to believe from certain warnings i have had since i returned to  england that it will be tenderly or favourably received by the  american people and as i have written the truth in relation to the  mass of those who form their judgments and express their opinions  it will be seen that i have no desire to court by any adventitious  means the popular applause  it is enough for me to know that what i have set down in these  pages cannot cost me a single friend on the other side of the  atlantic who is in anything deserving of the name  for the  rest i put my trust implicitly in the spirit in which they have  been conceived and penned and i can bide my time  i have made no reference to my reception nor have i suffered it to  influence me in what i have written for in either case i should  have offered but a sorry acknowledgment compared with that i bear  within my breast towards those partial readers of my former books  across the water who met me with an open hand and not with one  that closed upon an iron muzzle   the end    postscript    at a public dinner given to me on saturday the 18th of april 1868  in the city of new york by two hundred representatives of the  press of the united states of america i made the following  observations among others  so much of my voice has lately been heard in the land that i  might have been contented with troubling you no further from my  present standingpoint were it not a duty with which i henceforth  charge myself not only here but on every suitable occasion  whatsoever and wheresoever to express my high and grateful sense  of my second reception in america and to bear my honest testimony  to the national generosity and magnanimity  also to declare how  astounded i have been by the amazing changes i have seen around me  on every side  changes moral changes physical changes in the  amount of land subdued and peopled changes in the rise of vast new  cities changes in the growth of older cities almost out of  recognition changes in the graces and amenities of life changes  in the press without whose advancement no advancement can take  place anywhere  nor am i believe me so arrogant as to suppose  that in five and twenty years there have been no changes in me and  that i had nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to correct  when i was here first  and this brings me to a point on which i  have ever since i landed in the united states last november  observed a strict silence though sometimes tempted to break it  but in reference to which i will with your good leave take you  into my confidence now  even the press being human may be  sometimes mistaken or misinformed and i rather think that i have  in one or two rare instances observed its information to be not  strictly accurate with reference to myself  indeed i have now  and again been more surprised by printed news that i have read of  myself than by any printed news that i have ever read in my  present state of existence  thus the vigour and perseverance with  which i have for some months past been collecting materials for  and hammering away at a new book on america has much astonished  me seeing that all that time my declaration has been perfectly  well known to my publishers on both sides of the atlantic that no  consideration on earth would induce me to write one  but what i  have intended what i have resolved upon and this is the  confidence i seek to place in you is on my return to england in  my own person in my own journal to bear for the behoof of my  countrymen such testimony to the gigantic changes in this country  as i have hinted at tonight  also to record that wherever i have  been in the smallest places equally with the largest i have been  received with unsurpassable politeness delicacy sweet temper  hospitality consideration and with unsurpassable respect for the  privacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation here  and the state of my health  this testimony so long as i live and  so long as my descendants have any legal right in my books i shall  cause to be republished as an appendix to every copy of those two  books of mine in which i have referred to america  and this i will  do and cause to be done not in mere love and thankfulness but  because i regard it as an act of plain justice and honour  i said these words with the greatest earnestness that i could lay  upon them and i repeat them in print here with equal earnestness   so long as this book shall last i hope that they will form a part  of it and will be fairly read as inseparable from my experiences  and impressions of america  charles dickens  may 1868    footnotes  1 note to the original edition  or let him refer to an able  and perfectly truthful article in the foreign quarterly review  published in the present month of october to which my attention  has been attracted since these sheets have been passing through  the press  he will find some specimens there by no means  remarkable to any man who has been in america but sufficiently  striking to one who has not
