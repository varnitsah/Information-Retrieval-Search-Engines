48891444	the young stepmother  or  a chronicle of mistakes  by charlotte m yonge      failyet rejoice because no less the failure that makes thy distress may teach another full success  nor with thy share of work be vexed though incomplete and even perplexed it fits exactly to the next                        adelaide a proctor      chapter i    have you talked it over with her said mr ferrars as his little slender wife met him under the beeches that made an avenue of the lane leading to fairmead vicarage  yes was the answer which the vicar was not slow to understand  i cannot say i expected much from your conversation and perhaps we ought not to wish it  we are likely to see with selfish eyes for what shall we do without her  dear albinia  you always taunted me with having married your sister as much as yourself  so i shall again if you cannot give her up with a good grace  if i could have had my own way in disposing of her  perhaps the hero of your own composition might be less satisfactory to her than is kendal  at least he should be minus the children  i fancy the children are one great attraction  do you know how many there are  three but if albinia knows their ages she involves them in a discreet haze  i imagine some are in their teens  impossible winifred he is hardly fiveandthirty  thirtyeight he said yesterday and he married very early  i asked albinia if her son would be in tailcoats but she thought i was laughing at her and would not say  she is quite eager at the notion of being governess to the girls  she has wanted scope for her energies said mr ferrars  even spoiling her nephew and being my curate have not afforded field enough for her spirit of usefulness  that is what i am afraid of  of what winifred  that it is my fault  before our marriage you and she were the whole world to each other but since i came i have seen as you say that the craving for work was strong and i fear it actuates her more than she knows  no such thing  it is a case of good hearty love  what are you afraid of that too  yes i am  i grudge her giving her fresh whole young heart away to a man who has no return to make  his heart is in his first wifes grave  yes you may smile maurice as if i were talking romance but only look at him poor man  did you ever see any one so utterly broken down  she can hardly beguile a smile from him  his melancholy is one of his charms in her eyes  so it may be as a sort of interesting romance  i am sure i pity the poor man heartily but to see her at threeandtwenty with her sweet face and high spirits give herself away to a man who looks but half alive and cannot if he would return that full first lovehave the charge of a tribe of children be spied and commented on by the first wifes relationsmaurice i cannot bear it  it is not what we should have chosen said her husband but it has a bright side  kendal is a most rightminded superior man and she appreciates him thoroughly  she has great energy and cheerfulness and if she can comfort him and rouse him into activity and be the kind mother she will be to his poor children i do not think we ought to grudge her from our own home  you and she have so strong a feeling for motherless children  thinking of kendal as i do i have but one fear for her  i have manythe chief being the grandmother  mine will make you angry but it is my only one  you who have only known her since she has subdued it have probably never guessed that she has that sort of quick sensitive temper  maurice maurice as if i had not been a most provoking presuming sisterinlaw  as if i had not acted so that if albinia ever had a temper she must have shown it  i knew you would not believe me and i really am not afraid of her doing any harm by it if that is what you suspect me of  no indeed but i fear it may make her feel any trials of her position more acutely than a placid person would  oho so you own there will be trials  my dear winifred as if i had not sat up till twelve last night laying them before albinia  how sick the poor child must be of our arguments when there is no real objection and she is so much attached  have you heard anything about these connexions of his did you not write to mrs nugent  i wish she were at home  i had her answer by this afternoons post but there is nothing to tell  mr kendal has only been settled at bayford bridge a few years and she never visited any one there though mr nugent had met mr kendal several times before his wifes death and liked him emily is charmed to have albinia for a neighbour  does she know nothing of the meadows family  nothing but that old mrs meadows lives in the town with one unmarried daughter  she speaks highly of the clergyman  john dusautoy  ay he is admirablenot that i have done more than see him at visitations when he was curate at lauriston  is he married  i fancy he is but i am not sure  there is one good friend for albinia any way  and now for your investigations  did you see colonel bury  i did but he could say little more than we knew  he says nothing could be more exemplary than kendals whole conduct in india he only regretted that he kept so much aloof from others that his principle and gentlemanly feeling did not tell as much as could have been wished  he has always been wrapped up in his own pursuitsa perfect dictionary of information  we had found out that though he is so silent  i should think him a most elegant scholar  and a deep one  he has studied and polished his acquirements to the utmost  i assure you winifred i mean to be proud of my brotherinlaw  what did you hear of the first wife  it was an early marriage  he went home as soon as he had sufficient salary married her and brought her out  she was a brilliant dark beauty who became quickly a motherly housewifely commonplace personi should think there had been a poets love never awakened from  the very thing that has always struck me when poor man he has tried to be civil to me  here is a man sensible himself but who has never had the hap to live with sensible women  when their children grew too old for india she came into some little property at bayford bridge which enabled him to retire colonel bury came home in the same ship and saw much of them liked him better and better and seems to have been rather wearied by her a very good woman he says and kendal most fondly attached but as to comparing her with miss ferrars he could not think of it for a moment  so they settled at bayford and there about two years ago came this terrible visitation of typhus fever  i remember how colonel bury used to come and sigh over his friends illness and trouble  he could not help going over it again  the children all fell ill togetherthe two eldest were twin boys one puny the other a very fine fellow and his fathers especial pride and delight  as so often happens the sickly one was spared the healthy one was taken  then albinia will have an invalid on her hands  the colonel says this edmund was a particularly promising boy and poor kendal felt the loss dreadfully  he sickened after that and his wife was worn out with nursing and grief and sank under the fever at once  poor kendal has never held up his head since he had a terrible relapse  and said winifred he no sooner recovers than he goes and marries our albinia  two years my dear  pray explain to me maurice why when people become widowed in any unusually lamentable way they always are the first to marry again  incorrigible  i meant to make you pity him  i did till i found i had wasted my pity  why could not these meadowses look after his children  why must the colonel bring him here  i believe it was with malice prepense  the colonel went to see after him and found him so drooping and wretched that he insisted on bringing him home with him and old mrs meadows and her daughter almost forced him to accept the invitation  they little guessed what the colonel would be at  you will be better now you have the colonel to abuse said her husband  and pray what do you mean to say to the general  exactly what i think  and to the aunts slyly asked the wife  i think i shall leave you all that correspondence  it will be too edifying to see you making common cause with the aunts  that comes of trying to threaten ones husband and here they come said winifred  well maurice what cant be cured must be endured albiniaa heart is gone he is a very good man and spite of india first wife and melancholy he does not look amiss  mr ferrars smiled at the chary grudging commendation of the tall handsome man who advanced through the beechwood but it was too true that his clear olive complexion had not the line of health that there was a world of oppression on his broad brow and deep hazel eyes and that it was a dim dreamy reluctant smile that was awakened by the voice of the lady who walked by his side as if reverencing his grave mood  she was rather tall very graceful and well made but her features were less handsome than sweet bright and sensible  her hair was nutbrown in long curled waves her eyes deep soft grey and though downcast under the new sympathies new feelings and responsibilities that crowded on her the smile and sparkle that lighted them as she blushed and nodded to her brother and sister showed that liveliness was the natural expression of that engaging face  say what they would it was evident that albinia ferrars had cast in her lot with edmund kendal and that her energetic spirit and love of children animated her to embrace joyfully the cares which such a choice must impose on her  as might have been perceived by one glance at the figure step and bearing of mr ferrars perfectly clerical though they were he belonged to a military family  his father had been a distinguished peninsular officer and his brother older by many years held a command in canada  maurice and albinia early left orphans had with a young cousin been chiefly under the charge of their aunts mrs annesley and miss ferrars and had found a kind home in their house in mayfair until maurice had been ordained to the family living of fairmead and his sister had gone to live with him there extorting the consent of her elder brother to her spending a more real and active life than her aunts round of society could offer her  the aunts lamented but they could seldom win their darling to them for more than a few weeks at a time even after their nephew maurice hadas they consideredthrown himself away on a little lively lady of irish parentage no equal in birth or fortune in their opinion for the grandson of lord belraven  they had been very friendly to the young wife but their hopes had all the more been fixed on albinia and even winifred could afford them some generous pity in the engagement of their favourite niece to a retired east india companys servanta widower with three children     chapter ii    the equinoctial sun had long set and the blue haze of march east wind had deepened into twilight and darkness when albinia kendal found herself driving down the steep hilly street of bayford  the town was not large nor modern enough for gas and the dark street was only lighted here and there by a shop of more pretension the plateglass of the enterprising draper with the light veiled by shawls and ribbons the purple jars green ruby and crimson of the chemist and the modest ray of the grocer revealing busy heads driving saturdaynight bargains  how well i soon shall know them all said albinia looking at her husband though she knew she could not see his face as he leant back silently in his corner and she tried to say no more  she was sure that coming home was painful to him he had been so willing to put it off and to prolong those pleasant seaside days when there had been such pleasant reading walking musing and a great deal of happy silence  down the hill and a little way on level groundhouses on one side something like hedge or shrubbery on the othera stopa gate openeda hollow sound beneath the carriage as though crossing a wooden bridgetreesbright windowsan open doorand light streaming from it  here is your home albinia said that deep musical voice that she loved the better for the subdued melancholy of the tones and the suppressed sigh that could not be hidden  and my children she eagerly said as he handed her out and springing to the ground she hurried to the open door opposite where in the lamplight she saw moving about in shy curiosity and embarrassment two girls in white frocks and broad scarlet sashes and a boy who as she advanced retreated with his younger sister to the fireplace while the elder one a pretty and rather formal looking girl of twelve stood forward  albinia held out her arms saying you are lucy i am sure and eagerly kissed the girls smiling bright face  yes i am lucy was the wellpleased answer i am glad you are come  i hope we shall be very good friends said albinia with the sweet smile that few young or old could resist  and this is gilbert as she kissed the blushing cheek of a thin boy of thirteenand sophia  sophia who was eleven had not stirred to meet her  she alone inherited her fathers fine straight profile and large black eyes but she had the heaviness of feature that sometimes goes with very dark complexions  the white frock did not become her brown neck and arms her thick black hair was arranged in too womanly a manner and her head and face looked too large moreover there was no lightingup to answer the greeting and albinia was disappointed  poor child she thought she is feeling deeply that i am an interloper it will be different now her father is coming  mr kendal was crossing the hall and as he entered he took the hand and kissed the forehead of each of the three but sophia stood with the same half sullen indifferenceit might be shyness or sensibility  how much you are grown he said looking at the children with some surprise  in fact though albinia knew their ages they were all on a larger scale than she had expected and looked too old for the children of a man of his youthful appearance  gilbert had the slight look of rapid growth lucy though not so tall and with a small clear bright face had the air of a little woman and sophias face might have befitted any age  yes papa said lucy gilbert has grown an inchandahalf since october for we measured him  have you been well gilbert continued mr kendal anxiously  i have the toothache said gilbert piteously  happily nothing more serious thrust in lucy mr bowles told aunt maria that he considers gilberts health much improved  albinia asked some kind questions about the delinquent tooth but the answers were short and to put an end to the general constraint she asked lucy to show her to her room  it was a pretty baywindowed room and looked cheerful in the firelight  lucys tongue was at once unloosed telling that gilberts tutor mr salsted had insisted on his having his tooth extracted and that he had refused saying it was quite well but lucy gave it as her opinion that he much preferred the toothache to his lessons  where does mr salsted live  at tremblam about two miles off gilbert rides the pony over there every day except when he has the toothache and then he stays at home  and what do you do  we went to miss belmarche till the end of our quarter and since that we have been at home or with grandmamma  do you really mean that we are to study with you  i should like it my dear  i have been looking forward very much to teaching you and sophia  thank you mamma  the word was said with an effort as if it came strangely but it thrilled albinias heart and she kissed lucy who clung to her and returned the caress  i shall tell gilbert and sophy what a dear mamma you are she said do you know sophy says she shall never call you anything but mrs kendal and i know gilbert means the same  let them call me whatever suits them best said albinia i had rather they waited till they feel that they like to call me as you have donethank you for it dear lucy  you must not fancy i shall be at all hurt at your thinking of times past  i shall want you to tell me of them and of your own dear mother and what will suit papa best  lucy looked highly gratified and eagerly said i am sure i shall love you just like my own mamma  no said albinia kindly i do not expect that my dear  i dont ask for any more than you can freely give dear child  you must bear with having me in that place and we will try and help each other to make your papa comfortable and lucy you will forgive me if i am impetuous and make mistakes  lucys little clear black eyes looked as if nothing like this had ever come within her range of observation and albinia could sympathize with her difficulty of reply  mr kendal was not in the drawingroom when they reentered there was only gilbert nursing his toothache by the fire and sophy sitting in the middle of the rug holding up a screen  she said something goodnatured to each but neither responded graciously and lucy went on talking showing off the room the chiffonieres the ornaments and some pretty indian ivory carvings  there was a great ottoman of aunt marias work and a huge cushion with an arab horseman that lucy would uncover whispering poor mamma worked it while sophy visibly winced and albinia hurried it into the chintz cover again lest mr kendal should come  but lucy had full time to be communicative about the household with such a satisfied capable manner that albinia asked if she had been keeping house all this time  no old nurse kept the keys and managed till now but she went this morning  sophys mouth twitched  she was so very fond continued lucy  dont burst out sophy almost the first word albinia had heard from her but no more passed for mr kendal came in and lucys conversation instantly was at an end  before him she was almost as silent as the others and he seldom addressed himself to her only inquiring once after her grandmammas health and once calling sophy out of the way when she was standing between the fire andhe finished with the gesture of command whether he said your mamma none could tell  it was late and the meal was not over before bedtime when albinia lingered to find remedies for gilberts toothache pleased to feel herself making a commencement of motherly care and to meet an affectionate glance of thanks from mr kendals eye  gilbert too thanked her with less shyness than before and was hopeful about the remedy and with the feeling of having made a beginning she ran down to tell mr kendal that she thought he had hardly done justice to the childrenthey were fine creaturessomething so sweet and winning about lucyshe liked gilberts countenancesophy must have something deep and noble in her  he lifted his head to look at her bright face and said they are very much obliged to you  you must not say that they are my own  i will not say it again but as i look at you and the home to which i have brought you i feel that i have acted selfishly  albinia timidly pressed his hand work was always what i wished she said if only i could do anything to lighten your grief and care  he gave a deep heavy sigh  albinia felt that if he had hoped to have lessened the sadness he had surely found it again at his own door  he roused himself however to say this is using you ill albinia no one is more sensible of it than i am  i never sought more than you can give she murmured i only wish to do what i can for you and you will not let me disturb you  i am very grateful to you was his answer a sad welcome for a bride  and these poor children will owe everything to you  i wish i may do right by them said albinia fervently  the flower of the flockbegan mr kendal but he broke off at once  albinia had told winifred that she could bear to have his wifes memory first with him and that she knew that she could not compensate to him for his loss but the actual sight of his dejection came on her with a chill and she had to call up all her energies and hopes and still better the thought of strength not her own to enable her to look cheerfully on the prospect  sleep revived her elastic spirits and with eager curiosity she drew up her blind in the morning for the first view of her new home  but there was a veilmoisture made the panes resemble ground glass and when she had rubbed that away and secured a clear corner her range of vision was not much more extensive  she could only see the grey outline of trees and shrubs obscured by the heavy mist and on the lawn below a thick cloud that seemed to hang over a dark space which she suspected to be a large pond  there is very little to be gained by looking out here albinia soliloquized  it is not doing the place justice to study it on a misty moisty morning  it looks now as if that fever might have come bodily out of the pond  ill have no more to say to it till the sun has licked up the fog and made it bright  sunday morningmy last sunday without schoolteaching i hope  i famish to begin againand i will make time for that and the girls too  i am glad he consents to my doing whatever i please in that way  i hope mr dusautoy will i wish edmund knew him betterbut oh what a shy man it is  with a light step she went downstairs and found mr kendal waiting for her in the diningroom his face brightening as she entered  i am sorry bayford should wear this heavy cloud to receive you he said  it will soon clear she answered cheerfully  have you heard of poor gilbert this morning  not yet  then after a pause i have generally gone to mrs meadows after the morning service he said speaking with constraint  you will take me said albinia  i wish it i assure you  it was evidently what he wished her to propose and he added she must never feel herself neglected and it will be better at once  so much more cordial said albinia  pray let us go  they were interrupted by the voices of the girlsnot unpleasing voices but loud and unsubdued and with a slight tone of provincialism which seemed to hurt mr kendals ears for he said i hope you will tune those voices to something less unlike your own  as he spoke the sisters appeared in the full and conscious rustling of new lilac silk dresses which seemed to have happily carried off all sophys sullenness for she made much more brisk and civil answers and ran across the room in a boisterous manner when her father sent her to see whether gilbert were up  there was a great clatter and gilbert chased her in breathless and scolding but the tongues were hushed before papa and no more was heard than that the tooth was better and had not kept him awake lucy seemed disposed to make conversation overwhelming albinia with needless repetitions of mamma dear and plunging into what mrs bowles and miss goldsmith had said of mr dusautoy and how he kept so few servants and the butcher had no orders last time he called aunt maria thought he starved and tyrannized over that poor little sickly mrs dusautoy  mr kendal said not one word and seemed not to hear  albinia felt as if she had fallen into a whirlpool of gossip she looked towards him and hoped to let the conversation drop but sophy answered her sister and at last when it came to something about what jane heard from mrs osborns susan albinia gently whispered i do not think this entertains your papa my dear and silence sank upon them all  albinias next venture was to ask about that which had been her sunday pleasure from childhood and she turned to sophy and said i suppose you have not begun to teach at the school yet  sophys great eyes expanded and lucy said oh dear mamma nobody does that but genevieve durant and the monitors  miss wolte did till mr dusautoy came but she does not approve of him  lucy you do not know what you are saying said mr kendal and again there was an annihilating silence which albinia did not attempt to disturb  at church time she met the young ladies in the hall in pink bonnets and seagreen mantillas over the lilac silks all evidently put on for the first time in her honour an honour of which she felt herself the less deserving as sensible that this was no case for bridal display she wore a quiet dark silk a cashmere shawl and plain straw bonnet trimmed with white  with manifest wish for reciprocity lucy fell into transports over the shawl but gaining nothing by this sophy asked if she did not like the mantillas  albinia could only make civility compatible with truth by saying that the colour was pretty but where was gilbert he was on a stool before the diningroom fire looking piteous and pronouncing his tooth far too bad for going to church and she had just time for a fresh administration of camphor before mr kendal came forth from his study and gave her his arm  the front door opened on a narrow sweep the river cutting it off from the road and crossed by two wooden bridges beside each of which stood a weepingwillow budding with fresh spring foliage opposite were houses of various pretentious and sheer behind them rose the steep hill with the church nearly at the summit the noble spire tapering high above and the bells ringing out a cheerful chime  the mist had drawn up and all was fresh and clear  there go lizzie and loo cried lucy and the admiral and mrs osborn  ill run and tell them papa is come home  sophy was setting off also but mr kendal stopped them and lingered a moment or two making an excuse of looking for a needless umbrella but in fact to avoid the general gaze  as if making a desperate plunge however and looking up and down the broad street so as to be secure that no acquaintance was near he emerged with albinia from the gate and crossed the road as the chime of the bells changed  we are late he said  you will prefer the speediest way though it is somewhat steep  the most private way albinia understood and could also perceive that the girls would have liked the street which sloped up the hill and thought the lilac and green insulted by being conducted up the steep irregular and not very clean byelane that led directly up the ascent between houses some meanly modern some picturesquely ancient with stone steps outside to the upper story but all with far too much of pigstye about them for beauty or fragrance  lucy held up her skirts and daintily picked her way and albinia looked with kindly eyes at the doors and windows secretly wondering what friends she should find there  the lane ended in a long flight of more than a hundred shallow steps cut out in the soft stone of the hill with landingplaces here and there whence views were seen of the rich meadowlandscape beyond with villages orchards and farms and the blue winding river baye in the midst woods rising on the opposite side under the soft haze of distance  on the other side the wall of rock was bordered by gardens with streamers of ivy or periwinkle here and there hanging down  the ascent ended in an oldfashioned stone stile and here sophy standing on the step proclaimed with unnecessary loudness that mr dusautoy was carrying mrs dusautoy across the churchyard  this had the effect of making a pause but albinia saw the rector a tall powerful man rather supporting than actually carrying a little fragile form to the lowbrowed door leading into the chancel on the north side  the church was handsome though in the late style and a good deal misused by eighteenthcentury taste and albinia was full of admiration as mr kendal conducted her along the flagged path  she was rather dismayed to find herself mounting the gallery stairs and to emerge into a wellcushioned abode with the shieldbearing angel of the corbel of an arch all to herself and a very good view of the cobwebs over mr dusautoys soundingboard  it seemed to suit all parties however for lucy and sophia took possession of the forefront and their father had the inmost corner where certainly nobody could see him  just opposite to albinia was a mural tablet on which she read what revealed to her more of the sorrows of her household than she had guessed before        to the memory of lucy the beloved wife of edmund kendal            died february 18th 1845 aged 35 years        edmund meadows kendal born january 20th 1834            died february 10th 1845        maria kendal born september 5th 1840            died september 14th 1840        sarah anne kendal born october 3rd 1841            died november 20th 1843        john augustus kendal born january 4th 1842            died july 6th 1842        anne maria kendal born june 12th 1844            died june 19th 1844   then followed in the original greek the words because i live ye shall live also  four infants how many hopes laid here  all the englishborn children of the family had died in their cradles and not only did compassion for the past affect albinia as she thought of her husbands world of hidden grief but a shudder for the future came over her as she remembered having read that such mortality is a test of the healthiness of a locality  what could she think of willow lawn  it was with a strong effort that she brought her attention back to him who controlleth the sickness that destroyeth at noonday  but mr dusautoys deep powerful intonations roused her wandering thoughts and she was calmed and reassured by the holy feast in which she joined with her husband  mr kendals fine face was calm and placid as best she loved to look upon it when they came out of church and she was too happy to disturb the quiet by one word  lively and animated as she was there was a sort of repose and enjoyment in the species of respect exacted by his grave silent demeanour  if this could only have lasted longer but he was taking her along an irregular street and too soon she saw a slight colour flit across his cheek and his eyebrows contract as he unlatched a green door in a high wall and entered a little flagged court decorated by a stand destined for flowers  albinia caught the blush and felt more bashful than she had believed was in her nature but she had a warmhearted determination that she would work down prejudices and like and be liked by all that concerned him and his children  so she smiled at him and went bravely on into the matted hall and up the narrow stairs and made a laughing sign when he looked back at her ere he tapped at the sittingroom door  it was opened from within before he could turn the handle and a shrill voice exaggerating those of the girls showered welcomes with such rapidity that albinia was seated at the table and had been helped to cold chicken before she could look round or make much answer to reiterations of so very kind  it was a small room loaded with knicknacks and cushions like a repository of every species of female ornamental handiwork in vogue for the last half century and the luncheontray in the middle of all ready for six people for the two girls were there and though mr kendal stood up by the fire and would not eat he and his black image reflected backwards and forwards in the lookingglass and in the little round mirror seemed to take up more room than if he had been seated  mrs meadows was slight shrunken and gentlelooking with a sweet tone in her voice great softness of manner and pretty blue eyes albinia only wished that she had worn mourning it would have been so much more becoming than bright colours but that was soon overlooked in gratitude for her affectionate reception and in the warmth of feeling excited by her evident fondness and solicitude for mr kendal  miss meadows was gaily dressed in youthful fashion such as evidently had set her off to advantage when she had been a bright dark handsome girl but her hair was thin her cheeks haggard the colour hardened and her forty years apparent above all in an uncomfortable furrow on the brow and round the mouth her voice had a sharp distressed tone that grated even in her lowest key and though she did not stammer she could never finish a sentence but made halfadozen disjointed commencements whenever she spoke  albinia pitied her and thought her nervous for she was painfully assiduous in waiting on every one scarcely sitting down for a minute before she was sure that pepper or pickle or new bread or stale bread or something was wanted and squeezing round the table to help some one or to ring the bell every third minute and all in a dress that had a teasing stiff silken rustle  she offered mr kendal everything in the shape of food till he purchased peace by submitting to take a hard biscuit while albinia was not allowed her glass of water till all manner of wines foreign and domestic had been tried upon her in vain  conversation was not easy  gilbert was inquired after and his aunt spoke in her shrill injured note as she declared that she had done her utmost to persuade him to have the tooth extracted and began a history of what the dentist ought to have done five years ago  his grandmother softly pitied him saying poor little gibbie was such a delicate boy and required such careful treatment and when albinia hoped that he was outgrowing his illhealth she was amused to find that desponding compassion would have been more pleasing  there had been a transaction about a servant in her behalf and miss meadows insisted on hunting up a note searching all about the room and making her mother and sophy move from the front of two tabledrawers a disturbance which sophy did not take with such placid looks as did her grandmother  the name of the maid was eweretta dobson at which there was a general exclamation  i wonder what is the history of the name said albinia it sounds like nothing but the diminutive of ewer  i hope she will not be the little pitcher with long ears  mr kendal looked as much amused as he ever did but no one else gave the least token of so much as knowing what she meant and she felt as if she had been making a foolish attempt at wit  you need not call her so was all that mrs meadows said  i do not like calling servants by anything but their true names answered albinia it does not seem to me treating them with proper respect to change their names as if we thought them too good for them  it is using them like slaves  lucy exclaimed why grandmammas betty is really named philadelphia  albinia laughed but was disconcerted by finding that she had really given annoyance  i beg your pardon she said  it is only a fancy of my own  i am afraid that i have many fancies for my friends to bear with  you see i have so fine a name of my own that i have a fellowfeeling for those under the same affliction and i believe some servants like an alias rather than be teased for their finery so i shall give miss eweretta her choice between that and her surname  the old lady looked goodnatured and that matter blew over but miss meadows fell into another complication of pros and cons about writing for the womans character looking miserably harassed whether she should write or mrs kendal before she had been called upon  albinia supposed that mrs wolfe might call in the course of the week but this miss meadows did not know and she embarked in so many half speeches and looked so mysterious and significant at her mother that albinia began to suspect that some dreadful truth was behind  perhaps said the old lady perhaps mrs kendal might make it understood through you my dear maria that she is ready to receive visits  i suppose they must be said albinia  you see my dear people would be most happy but they do not know whether you have arrived  you have not appeared at church as i may say  indeed said albinia much diverted by her new discoveries in the realms of etiquette i was rather in a cupboard i must allow ought we to have sailed up the aisle in state in the grandison pattern  are you ready and she glanced up at her husband but he only half heard  no said miss meadows fretfully but you have not appeared as a bride  the straw bonnetyou see people cannot tell whether you are not incog as yet  to refrain from laughing was impossible  my tarn cap she exclaimed i am invisible in it  what shall i do  i fear i shall never be producible for indeed it is my very best my veritable weddingbonnet  lucy looked as if she thought it not worth while to be married for no better a bonnet than that  absurdity said mr kendal  if he would but have given a good hearty laugh thought albinia what a consolation it would be but she considered herself to have had a lesson against laughing in that house and was very glad when he proposed going home  he took a kind affectionate leave of the old lady who again looked fondly in big face and rejoiced in his having recovered his looks  as they arrived at home lucy announced that she was just going to speak to lizzie osborn and sophy ran after her to a house of about the same degree as their own but dignified as mount lodge because it stood on the hill side of the street while mr kendals house was for more gentility called willow lawn  gilbert was not to be found but at four oclock the whole party met at dinner before the evening service  gilbert could eat little and on going back to the fire to roast his cheek instead of going to church was told by his father i cannot have this going on  you must go to mr bowles directly after breakfast tomorrow have the tooth drawn and then go on to mr salsteds  the tone was one that admitted of no rebellion  if mr kendal interfered little his authority was absolute where he did interfere and albinia could only speak a few kind words of encouragement but the boy was vexed and moody seemed half asleep when they came home and went to bed as soon as tea was over  sophy went to bed too mr kendal went to his study and albinia after this day of novelty and excitement drew her chair to the fire and as lucy was hanging wearily about called her to her side and made her talk believing that there was more use in studying the girls character than even in suggesting some occupation though that was apparently the great want of the whole family on sunday  lucys first confidence was that gilbert had not been out alone but with that archibald tritton  mr tritton had a great farm and was a sort of gentleman and gilbert was always after that archy  she thought it very undesirable and aunt maria had talked to him about it but he never listened to aunt maria  albinia privately thought that it must be a severe penance to listen to aunt maria and took gilberts part  she supposed that he must be very solitary it must be a melancholy thing to be a twin left alone  and edmund dear edmund was always so kind and so fond of gilbert said lucy  you would not have thought they were twins edmund was so much the tallest and strongest  it seemed so odd that gilbert should have got over it when he did not  should you like to hear all about it mamma  it was albinias great wish to lift that dark veil and lucy began with as much seriousness and sadness as could coexist with the satisfaction and importance of having to give such a narration and exciting emotion and pity  it was remarkable how she managed to make herself the heroine of the story though she had been sent out of the house and had escaped the infection  she spoke in phrases that showed that she had so often told the story as to have a set form caught from her elders but still it had a deep and intrinsic interest for the bride that made her sit gazing into the fire pressing lucys hand and now and then sighing and shuddering slightly as she heard how there had been a bad fever prevailing in that lower part of the town and how the two boys were both unwell one damp hot autumn morning and lucy dwelt on the escape it had been that she had not kissed them before going to school  sophy had sickened the same day and after the tedious three weeks when father and mother were spent with attendance on the three edmund after long delirium had suddenly sunk just as they had hopes of him and the same message that told lucy of her brothers death told her of the severe illness of both parents  the disease had done the work rapidly on the mothers exhausted frame and she was buried a week after her boy  lucy had seen the procession from the window and thought it necessary to tell how she had cried  mr kendals had been a long illness the first knowledge of his loss had caused a relapse and his recovery had long been doubtful  as soon as the children were able to move they were sent with miss meadows to ramsgate and lucy had joined them there  the day before i went i saw papa she said  i had gone home for some things that i was to take and his room door was open so he saw me on the stairs and called me for there was no fear of infection then  oh he was so changed his hair all cut off and his cheeks hollow and he was quite trembling as he lay back on pillows in the great armchair  you cant think what a shock it was to me to see him in such a state  he held out his arms and i flung mine round his neck and sobbed and cried  and he just said so faintly take her away maria i cannot bear it  i assure you i was quite hysterical  you must have wished for more selfcommand said albinia disturbed by lucys evident pleasure in having made a scene  oh but it was such a shock and such a thing to see the house all empty and forlorn with the windows open and everything so still miss belmarche cried too and said she did not wonder my feelings overcame me and she did not see papa  ah lucy said albinia fervently how we must try to make him happy after all that he has gone through  that is what grandmamma said when she got his letter  i would be glad of anything she said that would bring back a smile to him and aunt maria said she had done her best for him but he must consult his own happiness and so i say  when people talk to me i say that papa is quite at liberty to consult his own happiness  thank you  lucy did not understand the tone and went on patronizing  and if they say you look younger than they expected i dont object to that at all  i had rather you were not as old as aunt maria or miss belmarche  who thinks me so young  oh  aunt maria and grandmamma and mrs osborn and all but i dont mind that it is only sophy who says you look like a girl aunt maria says sophy has an unmanageable temper  dont you think you can let me find that out for myself  i thought you wanted me to tell you about everybody  ah but tell me of the good in your brother and sister  i dont know how said lucy  gilbert is so tiresome and so is sophy  i heard mary telling jane im sure the new missus will have a heavy handful of those two  and what of yourself said albinia  oh i dont know said lucy modestly  mr kendal came in and as albinia looked at his pensive brow she was oppressed by the thought of his sufferings in that dreary convalescence  at night when she looked from her window the fog hung white like mildew over the pond and she could not reason herself out of a spectral haunting fancy that sickness lurked in the heavy misty atmosphere  she dreamt of it and the four babies started awoke and had to recall all her higher trust to enable her vigour to chase off the oppressive imagination     chapter iii    fog greeted mrs kendals eyes as she rose and she resolved to make an attack on the pond without loss of time  but mr kendal was absorbed nearly all breakfasttime in a letter from india containing a scrap in some uncouth character  as he finished his last cup of tea he looked up and said a letter from my old friend penrose of bombayan inscription in the salsette caves  have you seen the salsette caves  yes  she was longing to hear about them but his horse was announced  you said you would be engaged in the morning while i ride out albinia he said i shall return before luncheon  gilbert you had better go at once to mr bowles  i shall order your pony to be ready when you come back  there was not a word of remonstrance though the boy looked very disconsolate and began to murmur the moment his father had gone albinia who had regarded protection at a dentists one of the offices of the head of a family though dismayed at the task told gilbert that she would come with him in a moment  the girls exclaimed that no one thought of going with him and fearing she had put an affront on his manliness she asked what he would like but could get no answer only when lucy scolded him for lingering he said i thought she was going with me  amiable thought albinia as she ran up to put on her bonnet but i suppose toothache puts people out of the pale of civilization  and if he is thankless is not that treating me more like a mother  perhaps he had accepted her escort in hopes of deferring the evil hour for he seemed discomfited to see her so quickly ready and not grateful to his sisters who hurried them by saying that mr bowles would be gone out upon his rounds  mr bowles was amazed at the sight of mrs kendal and so elaborate in compliments and assurances that mrs bowles would do herself the honour of calling that albinia pitying gilbert called his attention back  with him the apothecary was peremptory and facetious  he had expected that he should soon see him after his papas return  and with a soon be over he set him down and albinia bravely stood a desperate wringing of her hand at the tug of war  she was glad she had come for the boy suffered a good deal and was faint and mr bowles pronounced his mouth in no state for a ride to tremblam  i must go said gilbert as they walked home i wish papa would listen to anything  he would not wish you to hurt yourself  when papa says a thing began gilbert  well gilbert you are quite right and i hope you dont think i mean to teach you disobedience  but i do desire you on my own responsibility not to go and catch an inflammation in your jaw ill undertake papa  gilbert at once became quite another creature  he discoursed so much that she had to make him restore the handkerchief to his mouth he held open the gate showed her a shoal of minnows and tried to persuade her to come round the garden before going in but she clapped her hands at him and hunted him back into the warm room much impressed and delighted by his implicit obedience to his father with lucy and sophy his remaining seemed likewise to make a great sensation they looked at mrs kendal and whispered and were evidently curious as to the result of her audacity  albinia who had grown up with her brother maurice and cousin frederick was more used to boys than to girls and was already more at ease with her son than her daughters  gilbert lent a ready hand with hammer and chisel and boxes were opened to the great delight and admiration of the girls  they were all very happy and busy setting things to rights but albinia was in difficulty how to bestow her books  there was an unaccountable scarcity both of books and bookcases none were to be seen except that in a chiffoniere in the drawingroom there was a row in gilded bindings chiefly pope gray and the like and one which albinia took out had pages which stuck together a little pale blue string faded at the end and in the garlanded flyleaf the inscription to miss lucy meadows the reward of good conduct december 20th 1822 the book seemed rather surprised at being opened and albinia let it close itself as lucy said those are poor mammas books all the others are in the study  come in and ill show you  she threw open the door and albinia entered  the study was shaded with a mass of laurels that kept out the sun and made it look chill and sad and the air in it was close  the round librarytable was loaded with desks pocketbooks and papers the mantelpiece was covered with letters and bookshelves mounted to the ceiling filled with the learned and the poetical of new and old times  over the fireplace hung what it needed not lucys whisper to point out as poor mammas picture  it represented a very pretty girl with dark eyes brilliant colour and small cherry mouth painted in the exaggerated style usually called ridiculously like  albinias first feeling was that there was nothing in herself that could atone for the loss of so fair a creature and the thought became more oppressive as she looked at a niche in the wall holding a carved sandalwood workbox with a silver watch lying on it  poor edmunds watch said lucy  it was given to him for a reward just before he was ill  albinia tried to recover composure by reading the titles of the books  suddenly lucy started and exclaimed come away  there he is  why come away said albinia  i would not have him find me there for all the world  in all her vexation and dismay albinia could not help thinking of bluebeards closet  her inclination was to stay where she was and take her chance of losing her head yet she felt as if she could not bear to be found invading a sanctuary of past recollections and was relieved to find that it was a false alarm though not relieved by the announcement that admiral and mrs osborn and the miss osborns were in the drawingroom  before luncheontoo bad she exclaimed as she hurried upstairs to wash off the dust of unpacking  ere she could hurry down there was another inundation streaming across the hall mrs drury and three miss drurys who as she remembered when they began to kiss her were some kind of cousins  there was talk but albinia could not give entire attention she was watching for mr kendals return that she might guard gilbert from his displeasure and the instant she heard him she sprang up and flew into the hall  he could not help brightening at the eager welcome but when she told him of mr bowles opinion he looked graver and said i fear you must not always attach credit to all gilberts reports  mr bowles told me himself that he must run no risk of inflammation  you saw mr bowles  i went with gilbert  you  i never thought of your imposing so unpleasant a task on yourself  i fear the boy has been trespassing on your kindness  no indeed he never asked me but with a sort of laugh to hide the warmth excited by his pleased grateful look i thought it all in the days work only natural  she would have given anything to have had time to enjoy his epanchement de coeur at those words bit she was obliged to add alas theres all the world in the drawingroom  who  osborns and drurys  do you want me  i ran away on the plea of calling you  ill never do so again was her inward addition as his countenance settled into the accustomed fixed look of abstraction and as an unwilling victim he entered the room with her and the visitors were dreadful enough to congratulate him  albinia knew that it must be so unpleasant to him that she blushed up to the roots of her hair and could not look at anybody  when she recovered the first comers were taking leave but the second set stayed on and on till past luncheontime and far past her patience before the room was at last cleared  gilbert hurried in and was received by his father with you are very much obliged to her  indeed i am said gilbert in a winning pleasant manner  i dont want you to be said albinia affectionately laying her arm on his shoulder  and now for luncheoni pitied you poor fellow i thought you must have been famished  anything not to have all the drurys at luncheon said gilbert confidentially i had begun to wish myself at tremblam  by the bye said mr kendal waking as he sat down at the bottom of the table how was it that the drurys did not stay to luncheon  was that what they were waiting for exclaimed albinia  poor people i had no notion of that  they do have luncheon here in general said mr kendal as if not knowing exactly how it came to pass  o yes said lucy sarah anne asked me whether we ate weddingcake every day  poor miss sarah anne said albinia laughing  but one cannot help feeling inhospitable when people come so unconscionably early and cut up all ones morning  the door was again besieged by visitors just as they were all going out to make the round of the garden and it was not till halfpast four that the succession ceased and albinia was left to breathe freely and remember how often maurice had called her to order for intolerance of morning calls  and not the only people i cared to see she said the dusautoys and nugents  but they have too much mercy to call the first day  mr kendal looked as if his instinct were drawing him studywards but albinia hung on his arm and made him come into the garden though devoid of winifreds gardening tastes she was dismayed at the untended look of the flowerbeds  the laurels were too high and seemed to choke the narrow space and the turf owed its verdant appearance to damp moss  she had made but few steps before the water squished under her feet and impelled her to exclaim what a pity this pond should not be filled up  filled up  yes it would be so much less damp  one might drain it off into the river and then we should get rid of the fog  and she began actively to demonstrate the convenient slope and the beautiful flowerbed that might be made in its place  mr kendal answered with a few assenting sounds and complacent looks and albinia accustomed to a brother with whom to assent was to act believed the matter was in train and that pond and fever would be annihilated  the garden opened into a meadow with a causeway leading to a canal bank where there was a promising country walk but the cruel visitors had left no time for exploring and albinia had to return home and hurry up her arrangements before there was space to turn round in her roomeven then it was not what winifred could have seen without making a face  mr kendal had read aloud to his wife in the evening during the stay at the seaside and she was anxious not to let the habit drop  he liked it and read beautifully and she thought it good for the children  she therefore begged him to read catching him on the way to his study and coaxing him to stay no longer than to find a book he brought schlegels philosophy of history  she feared that it was above the young ones but it was delightful to herself and the custom had better be established before it was perilled by attempts to adapt it to the children  lucy and sophy seemed astonished and displeased and their whispers had to be silenced gilbert learnt his lessons apart  albinia rallied her spirits and insisted to herself that she did not feel discouraged  monday had gone or rather albinia had been robbed of it by visitorsnow for a vigorous tuesday  her unpacking and her setting to rights were not half over but as the surface was habitable she resolved to finish at her leisure and sacrifice no more mornings of study  so after she had lingered at the door to delight gilbert by admiring his pony she returned to the diningroom where the girls were loading a small table in the window with piles of books and exercises and lucy was standing looking all eagerness to show off her drawings  yes my dear but first we had better read  i have been talking to your papa and we have settled that on wednesdays and fridays we will go to church but on these days we will begin by reading the psalms and lessons  oh said lucy we never do that except when we are at grandmammas  pray are you too old or too young for it said albinia  we did it to please grandmamma said sophy  now you will do it to please me said albinia if for no better reason  fetch your bibles and prayerbooks  we shall never have time for our studies i assure you mamma objected lucy  that is not your concern said albinia her spirit rising at the girls opposition  i wish for obedience  lucy went sophy leant against the table like a post  albinia regretted that the first shot should have been fired for such a cause and sat perplexing herself whether it were worse to give way or to force the girls to read holy scripture in such a mood  lucy came flying down with the four books in her hands and began officiously opening them before her sister and exhorting her not to give way to sullennessshe ought to like to read the biblewhich of course made sophy look crosser  the desire to establish her authority conquered the scruple about reverence  albinia set them to read and suffered for it  lucy road flippantly sophy in the hoarse dull dogged voice of a naughty boy  she did not dare to expostulate lest she should exasperate the tempers that she had roused  never mind she thought when the institution is fixed they will be more amenable  she tried a little examination afterwards but not one answer was to be extracted from sophy and lucy knew far less than the first class at fairmead and made her replies wide of the mark with an air of satisfaction that nearly overthrew the young stepmothers patience  when albinia took her bible upstairs she gave sophy time to say what lucy reported instantly on her entrance  dear me mamma here is sophy declaring that you ought to be a charityschoolmistress  you wont be angry with her but it is so funny  if you were at my charity school lucy said albinia the first lesson i should give you would be against telling tales  lucy subsided  albinia turned to sophy  my dear she said perhaps i pressed this on when you were not prepared for it but i have always been used to think of it as a duty  sophy made no answer but her moody attitude relaxed and albinia took comfort in the hope that she might have been gracious if she had known how to set about it  i suppose miss belmarche is a roman catholic she said wishing to account for this wonderful ignorance and addressing herself to sophy but lucy whom she thought she had effectually put down was up again in a moment like a jackinabox  o yes but not genevieve  her papa made it his desire that she should be brought up a protestant  wasnt it funny  you know genevieve is madame belmarches granddaughter and mr durant was a dancingmaster  madame belmarches father and brother were guillotined continued sophy  ah then she is an emigrant  yes  miss belmarche has always kept school here  our own mamma and aunt maria went to school to her and miss celeste belmarche married mr durant a dancingmastershe was french teacher in a school in london where he taught and madame belmarche did not approve for she and her husband were something very grand in france so they waited and waited ever so long and when at last they did marry they were quite old and she died very soon and they say he never was happy again and pined away till he really did die of grief and so genevieve came to her grandmamma to be brought up  poor child  how old is she  fifteen said lucy  she teaches in the school  she is not at all pretty and such a queer little thing  was her father french  no said sophy  yes said lucy  you know nothing about it sophy  he was french but of the protestant french sort that came to england a great many years ago when they ran away from the sicilian vespers or the edict of nantes i dont remember which only the spitalfields weavers have something to do with it  however at any rate genevieve has got something in a drawer up in her own room that she is very secret about and wont show to anybody  i think it is something that somebody was killed with said sophy in a low voice  dear me if it is i am sure it is quite wicked to keep it  i shall be quite afraid to go into her room and you know i slept there all the time of the fever  it did not hurt you said sophy  albinia had been strongly interested by the touching facts so untouchingly narrated and by the characteristic account of the huguenot emigration but it suddenly occurred to her that she was promoting gossip and she returned to business  lucy showed off her attainments with her usual selfsatisfaction  they were what might be expected from a secondrate oldfashioned young ladies school where nothing was good but the french pronunciation  she was evidently considered a great proficient and her glib mediocrity was even more disheartening than the ungracious carelessness or dulness there was no knowing whichthat made her sister figure wretchedly in the examination  however there was little timethe doorbell rang at a quarter to twelve and mrs wolfe was in the drawingroom  i told you so whispered lucy exultingly  this is unbearable cried albinia  i shall give notice that i am always engaged in the morning  she desired each young lady to work a sum in her absence and left them to murmur if they were so disposed  perhaps it was lucys speech that made her inflict the employment at any rate her spirit was not as serene as she could have desired  mr kendal was quite willing that she should henceforth shut her door against company in the morning that is to say he bowed his head assentingly  she was begging him to take a walk with her when at another sound of the bell he made a precipitate retreat into his study  the visitors were the belmarche family  the old lady was dark and withered small yet in look and air with a certain nobility and grandeur that carried albinia back in a moment to the days of hoops and trains of powder and highheeled shoes and made her feel that the sweeping courtesy had come straight from the days of marie antoinette and that it was an honour and distinction conferred by a superiorsuperior indeed in all the dignity of age suffering and constancy  albinia blushed and took her hand with respect very unlike the patronizing airs of bayford bridge towards poor old madame belmarche and with downcast eyes and pretty embarrassment heard the stately compliments of the ancien regime  miss belmarche was not such a fine specimen of sevres porcelain as her mother  she was a brown dried small woman having lost or never possessed her countrys taste in dress and with a rusty bonnet over the tight frizzly curls of her front too thin and too scantily robed to have any waist and speaking english too well for the piquant grace of her mothers speech  poor lady born an exile she had toiled and struggled for a whole lifetime to support her mother but though care had worn her down there was still vivacity in her quick little black eyes and though her teeth were of a dreadful colour her laugh was so full of life and sweetness that albinia felt drawn towards her in a moment  silent and demure plainly dressed in an old dark merino and a whiteribboned faded bonnet sat a little figure almost behind her grandmother  her face had the french want of complexion but the eyes were of the deepest most lustrous hue of grey almost as dark as the pupils and with the softness of long dark eyelashesbeautiful eyes full of light and expressionand as she moved towards the table there was a finish and delicacy about the whole form and movements that made her a most pleasing object  but albinia could not improve her acquaintance for in flowed another party of visitors and madame curtsied herself out again albinia volunteering that she would soon come to see her and being answered you will do me too much honour  another afternoon devoured by visitors  every one seemed to have come except the persons who would have been most welcome mr dusautoy and winifreds friends the nugents  when at four oclock she had shaken hands with the last guest she gave a hearty yawn jumped up and shook herself as she exclaimed there  there that is done  i wonder whether your papa would come out now  he is in his study said the girls  albinia thought of knocking and calling at the door but somehow it seemed impossible and she decided on promenading past his window to show that she was ready for him  but alas those evergreens  she could not see in and probably he could not see out  ha cried lucy as they pursued their walk into the kitchen garden here are some asparagus coming up  grandmamma always has our first asparagus  albinia was delighted to find such an opening  out came her knife they would cut the heads and take them up at once but when the tempting whitestalked pinktipped bundle had been made up and put into a basket a difficulty arose  ill call the boy to take it said lucy  what when we are going ourselves said albinia  oh but we cant  why  do you think we shall break down under the weight  o no but people will stare  whywhat should they stare at  it looks so to carry a basket  albinia burst into one of her merriest peals of laughing  not carry a basket  my dear i have looked so all the days of my life  bayford must endure the spectacle so it may as well begin at once  but dear mamma  im not asking you to carry it  o no i only hope you dont think it too ungenteel to walk with me  but the notion of calling a boy away from his work to carry a couple of dozen asparagus when an ablebodied woman is going that way herself  albinia was so tickled that she could hardly check herself even when she saw lucy looking distressed and hurt and little laughs would break out every moment as she beheld the young lady keeping aloof as if ashamed of her company turning towards the steep church steps willing at least to hide the dreadful sight from the high street  just as they had entered the narrow alley they heard a hasty tread and almost running over them with his long strides came mr dusautoy  he brought himself up short just in time and exclaimed i beg your pardonmrs kendal i believe  could you be kind enough to give me a glass of brandy  albinia gave a great start as well she might  i was going to fetch one quickly proceeded mr dusautoy but your house is nearer  a poor mantherejust come homebeen on the tramp for workquite exhausted and he pointed to one of the cottages  ill fetch it at once cried albinia  thank you he said as they crossed the street  this poor fellow has had nothing all day has walked from hadminsterjust got home sank down quite worn out and there is nothing in the house but dry bread  his wife wants something nearly as much as he does  in the excitement albinia utterly forgot all scruples about bluebeards closet  she hurried into the house and made but one dash standing before her astonished husbands dreamy eyes exclaiming pray give me the key of the cellaret theres a poor man just come home fainting with exhaustion mr dusautoy wants some brandy for him  like a man but half awake obeying an apparition mr kendal put his hand into his pocket and gave her the key  she was instantly opening the cellaret seeking among the bottles and asking questions all the time  she proposed taking a jug of the kitchentea then in operation and mr dusautoy caught at the idea so that poor lucy beheld the dreadful spectacle of the vicar bearing a can full of steaming tea and mrs kendal a small cup with the spirituous liquor  what was the asparagus to this  albinia told her to go on to mrs meadows and that she should soon follow  she intended to have gone the moment that she had carried in the cup leaving mr dusautoy in the cottage but the poor trembling frightened wife needed womans sympathy and soothing and she waited to comfort her and to see the pair more able to enjoy the meeting in their tidy but bare and damplooking cottage  she promised broth for the morrow and took her leave the vicar coming away at the same time  thank you he said warmly as they came out and turned to mount the hill together  may i go and call on them again  it will be very kind in you  poor simkins is a steady good sort of fellow but a clumsy workman downhearted and with poor health and things have been untoward with him  people who do not prosper in the world are not always the worst said albinia  no indeed and these are grateful warmhearted people that you will like if you can get over the poor womans lackadaisical manner but you are used to all that he added smiling i see you know what poor folk are made of  i have been living among them nearly all my days said albinia  i hope you will give me something to do i should be quite forlorn without it and she looked up to his kind open face as much at home with him as if she had known him for years  fannymy wifeshall find work for you he said  you must excuse her calling on you she is never off the sofa but and what a bright look he gave as much as to say that his wife on the sofa was better than any one else off  i was hoping to call some of these afternoons he continued but i have had little time and fanny thought your door was besieged enough already  thank you said albinia i own i thought it was your kindness in leaving me a little breathing time  and would mrs dusautoy be able to see me if i were to call  she would be delighted  suppose you were to come in at once  i wish i could but i must go on to mrs meadows  if i were to come tomorrow  any timeany time he said  she is always at home and she has been much better since we came here  we were too much in the town at lauriston  mr dusautoy having a year ago come out of the diocese where had been albinias home they had many common friends and plunged into ecclesiastical intelligence with a mutual understanding of the topics most often under discussion that made albinia quite in her element  a great newfoundland dog of a man in size and countenance and kindness thought she  if his wife be worthy of him i shall reck little of all the rest  her tread the gayer for this resumption of old habits she proceeded to mrs meadows where the sensation created by her poor little basket justified lucys remonstrance  there were regrets and assurances that the girl could have come in a moment and that she need not have troubled herself and her laughing declarations that it was no trouble were disregarded except that the old lady said in gentle excuse to her daughter that mrs kendal had always lived in the country where people could do as they pleased  i mean to do as i please here said albinia laughing but the speech was received with silent discomfiture that made her heartily regret it  she disdained to explain it away she was beginning to hold mrs and miss meadows too cheap to think it worth while  well said mrs meadows as if yielding up the subject things may be different from what they were in my time  oh mammamrs kendali am sure albinia let maria flounder but she only found her way out of the speech with well and is not it the most extraordinarymr dusautoyso rude  i should not wonder if you found me almost as extraordinary as mr dusautoy said albinia  why would miss meadows always nettle her into saying exactly the wrong thing so as to alarm and distress the old lady  that want of comprehension of playfulness was a strangely hard trial  she turned to mrs meadows and tried to reassure her by saying you know i have been always in the clerical line myself so i naturally take the part of the parson  yes my dear said mrs meadows  i dare say mr dusautoy is a very good man but i wish he would allow his poor delicate wife more butchers meat and i dont think it looks well to see the vicarage without a manservant  albinia finally made her escape and while wondering whether she should ever visit that house without tingling with irritation with herself and with the inmates lucy exclaimed there you see i was right  grandmamma and aunt maria were surprised when i told them that you said you were an ablebodied woman  what would not albinia have given for winifred to laugh with her what to do now she did not know so she thought it best not to hear and to ask the way to a carpenters shop to order some bookshelves  she was more uncomfortable after she came home for by the sounds when mr kendal next emerged from his study she found that he had locked himself in to guard against further intrusion  and when she offered to return to him the key of the cellaret he quietly replied that he should prefer her retaining itnot a formidable answer in itself but one which coupled with the locking of the door proved to her that she might do anything rather than invade his privacy  now maurices study was the thoroughfare of the household the place for all parish preparations unpresentable in the drawingroom and albinia was taken by surprise  she grew hot and cold  had she done anything wrong  could he care for her if he could lock her out  i will not be morbid i will not be absurd said she to herself though the tears stood in her eyes  some men do not like to be rushed in upon  it may be only habit  it may have been needful here  it is base to take petty offences and set up doubts  and mr kendals tender manner when they were again together his gentle way of addressing her and a sort of shy caress proved that he was far from all thought of displeasure nay he might be repenting of his momentary annoyance though he said nothing  albinia went to inquire after the sick man at her first leisure moment and while talking kindly to the wife and hearing her troubles was surprised at the forlorn rickety state of the building the broken pavement damp walls and door that would not shut because the frame had sunk out of the perpendicular  cant you ask your landlord to do something to the house  it is of no use maam mr pettilove never will do nothing perhaps if you would be kind enough to say a word to him maam  mr pettilove the lawyer  ill try if mr kendal can say anything to him  it really is a shame to leave a house in this condition  thanks were so profuse that she feared that she was supposed to possess some power of amelioration  the poor woman even insisted on conducting her up a breakneck staircase to see the broken ceiling whence water often streamed in plentifully from the roof  her mind full of designs against the cruel landlord she speeded up the hill exhilarated by each step she took into the fresh air to the gardengate which she was just unhasping when the hearty voice of the vicar was heard behind her  mrs kendal  i told fanny you would come  instead of taking her to the front door he conducted her across a sloping lawn towards a french window open to the bright afternoon sunshine  here she is here is mrs kendal he said sending his voice before him as they came in sight of the pretty little drawingroom where through the gay chintz curtains she saw the clear fire shining upon halfadozen school girls ranged opposite to a couch  ah as he perceived them shall i take her for a turn in the garden while you finish your lesson  one moment if you please  i did not know it was so late and a face as bright as all the rest was turned towards the window  ah give her her scholars and she never knows how time passes said mr dusautoy  but step this way and ill show you the best view in bayford  he took her up a step or two to a little turfed mound where there was a rustic seat commanding the whole exquisite view of river vale and woodland with the church tower rising in the foreground  the wind blew pleasantly chasing the shadows of the clouds across the open space  albinia was delighted to feel it fan her brow and her eager exclamations contented mr dusautoy  yes he said it was all fannys notion  she planned it all last summer when i took her round the garden  it is wonderful what an eye she has  i only hope when the dry weather comes that i shall be able to get her up there to enjoy it  on coming down they found that mrs dusautoy had dismissed her class and come out to a low longbacked sloping gardenseat at the window she was very little and slight a mere doll in proportion to her great husband who could lift her as easily and tenderly as a baby paying her a sort of reverential deference and fond admiration that rendered them a beautiful sight in such full redoubled measure was his fondness repaid by the little clever fairylooking woman with her playful manner high spirits keen wit and the active habits that even confirmed invalidism could not destroy  she had small deadly white hands a fair complexion that varied more than was good for her pretty though rather sharp and irregular features and hazel eyes dancing with merriment and face and figure at some years above thirty would have suited a girl of twenty  to see mr dusautoy bringing her footstools shawls and cushions and to remember the accusation of starvation was almost irresistibly ludicrous  now john you had better have been giving mrs kendal a chair all this time  mrs kendal will excuse said mr dusautoy as he brought her a seat  mrs kendal has excused said mrs dusautoy bursting into a merry fit of laughter  oh i never heard anything more charming than your introduction  i beg your pardon but i laughed last evening till i was worn out and waked in the night laughing again  it was exhilarating to find that any one laughed at bayford and albinia partook of the mirth with all her heart  never was an address more gratifying to me she said  it was like him so unlike bayford  so bold a venture continued mrs dusautoy amid peals of laughter  what is there to laugh at said mr dusautoy putting on a look between merriment and simplicity  what else could i have done  i should have done the same whoever i had met  ah now he is afraid of your taking it as too great a compliment to do him justice i believe he would but the question is what answer he would have had  nobody could have refused began albinia  oh cried mrs dusautoy  little you know bayford  fanny  fanny this is too bad  madame belmarche  would have had nothing but eau sucre  no john decidedly you and simkins fell upon your legs and you bad better take credit for your admirable sagacity  i like the people said albinia but they never can be well while they live in such a shocking place  it is quite a disgrace to bayford  it is in a sad state said mr dusautoy  i know i should like to set my brother upon that mr pettilove who they say will do nothing exclaimed albinia  the vicar was going to have said something but a look from his wife checked him  albinia was sorry for it as she detected a look of suppressed amusement on mrs dusautoys face  i mean to ask mr kendal what can be done she said and in the meantime to descend from what we cant do to what we can  mr dusautoy told me to come to you for orders  and i told mr dusautoy that i should give you none  oh that is hard  if you could have heard him  he thought he had got a working lady at last and he would have had no mercy upon you  one would have imagined that mr kendal had brought you here for his sole behoof  then i shall look to you mr dusautoy  no i believe she is quite right he said  she says you ought to undertake nothing till yon have had time to see what leisure you have to give us  nay i have been used to think the parish my business home my leisure  yes said mrs dusautoy but then you were the womankind of the clergy now you are a laywoman  i think you have work at home said the vicar  work but not work enough cried albinia  the girls will help me only tell me what i may do  i say what you can said mrs dusautoy  you see before you a singlehanded man  only two of the ladies here can be called coadjutors one being poor little genevieve durant the other the booksellers daughter clarissa richardson who made all the rest fly off  all the others do what good they mean to do according to their own sweet will free and independent women and we cant have any district system so i think you can only do what just comes to hand  most heartily did albinia undertake all that mrs dusautoy would let her husband assign to her  yes john is a strong temptation said the bright little invalid but you must let mrs kendal find out in a months time whether she has work enough  i could think my wise brother maurice had been cautioning you said albinia taking leave as of an old friend for indeed she felt more at home with mrs dusautoy than with any acquaintance she had made in bayford  albinia told her husband of the state of the cottages and railed at mr pettilove much to her own satisfaction  mr kendal answered he would see about it an answer of which albinia had yet to learn the import     chapter iv    there are some characters so constituted that of them the old proverb that love is blind is perfectly true they can see no imperfection in the mind or body of those dear to them  there are others in whom the strongest affections do not destroy clearness of vision who see their friends on all sides and perceive their faults and foibles without loving them the less  albinia kendal was a person of the latter description  it might almost be called her temptation that her mind beheld all that came before it in a clear and a humorous light such as only a disposition overflowing with warm affection and with the energy of kindness could have prevented from bordering upon censoriousness she had imagination but it was not such as to make an illusion of the present or to interfere with her almost satirical good sense happily religion and its earthly manifestationcharity regulated her taught her to fear to judge lest she should be judged strengthened her naturally fond affections and tempered the keenness that disappointment might soon have turned to sourness  the tongue the temper and the judgment knew their own tendencies and a guard was set over them and if the sentinel were ever torpid or deceived repentance paid the penalty  she had not long seen her husband at home before she had involuntarily completed her view of his character  nature must have designed him for a fellow of a college where apart from all cares he might have collected fragments of forgotten authors and immortalized his name by some edition of a greek lyric poet known by four poems and a half and twothirds of a line quoted somewhere else  in such a controversy lightened by perpetually polished poems by a fair amount of modern literature select college friendships and methodical habits edmund kendal would have been in his congenial element lived and died and had his portrait hung up as one of the glories of his college  but he had been carried off from school before he had done more than prove his unusual capacity  all his connexions were indian and his father who had not seen him since his earliest childhood offered him no choice but an appointment in the civil service  he had one stimulus he had seen lucy meadows in the radiant glory of girlish beauty and had fastened on her all a poets dreams deepening and becoming more fervid in the recesses of a reserved heart which did not easily admit new sensations  that stimulus carried him out cheerfully to india and quickened his abilities so that he exerted himself sufficiently to obtain a lucrative situation early in life he married and his household must have been on the german system all the learning on one side all the domestic cares on the other the understanding and refinement wanting in his wife he believed to be wanting in all women  as resident at a small remote native court in india he saw no female society such as could undeceive him and subsequently his bayford life had not raised his standard of womankind  a perfect gentleman his superiority was his own work rather than that of station or education and so he had never missed intercourse with really ladylike or cultivated female minds expected little from wife or daughters or neighbours had a few learned friends but lived within himself  he had acquired a competence too soon and had the great misfortune of property without duties to present themselves obviously  he had nothing to do but to indulge his naturally indolent scholarly tastes which directed as they had been to eastern languages had even less chance of sympathy among his neighbours than if they had been classical  always reserved and seldom or never meeting with persons who could converse with him he had lapsed into secluded habits and learnt to shut himself up in his study and exclude every one that he might have at least a refuge from the gossip and petty cares that reigned everywhere else  so seldom was anything said worth his attention that he never listened to what was passing and had learnt to say very wellill see about it without even knowing what was said to him  but though his wife had been no companion the illusion had never died away he had always loved her devotedly and her loss had shattered all his present rest and comfort as entirely as the death of his son had taken from him hope and companionship  what a home it must have been with lucy reigning over it in her pert selfsufficiency gilbert and sophy running riot and squabbling and maria meadows coming in on them with her wellmeant worries and persecutions  when taken away from the scene of his troubles his spirits revived afraid to encounter his own household alone he had thought albinia the cure for everything  but at home habit and association had proved too strong for her presencethe grief which he had tried to leave behind had waited ready to meet him on the threshold and the very sense that it was a melancholy welcome added to his depression and made him less able to exert himself  the old sorrows haunted the walls of the house and above all the study and tarried not in seizing on their unresisting victim  melancholy was in his nature his indolence gave it force and his habits were almost ineffaceable and they were habits of quiet selfishness formed by a resolute though inert will and fostered by an adoring wife  a youth spent in india had not given him ideas of responsibilities beyond his own family and his principles though sound had not expanded the views of duty with which he had started in life  it was a positive pleasure to albinia to discover that there had been an inefficient clergyman at bayford before mr dusautoy and to know that during half the time that the present vicar had held the living mr kendal had been absent so that his influence had had no time to work  she began to understand her line of action  it must be her effort in all loving patience and gentleness to raise her husbands spirits and rouse his faculties to make his powers available for the good of his fellowcreatures to make him an active and happy man and to draw him and his children together  this was truly a task to make her heart throb high with hope and energy  strong and brave was that young heart and not selfconfidentthe difficulty made her only the more hopeful because she saw it was her duty  she was secure of her influence with him  if he did exclude her from his study he left her supreme elsewhere and though she would have given the world that their sovereignty might be a joint one everywhere still she allowed much for the morbid inveterate habit of dreading disturbance  when he began by silence and not listening she could always rouse him and give him animation and he was so much surprised and pleased whenever she entered into any of his pursuits that she had full hope of drawing him out  one day when the fog instead of clearing off had turned to violent rain albinia had been out on parish work and afterwards enlivening old mrs meadows by dutifully spending an hour with her while maria was nursing a nervous headacheshe had been subject to headaches ever sincean ominous sigh supplied the rest  but all the effect of albinias bright kindness was undone when the grandmother learnt that gilbert was gone to his tutor and would have to come home in the rain and she gave such an account of his exceeding delicacy that albinia became alarmed and set off at once that she might consult his father about sending for him  her opening of the hall door was answered by mr kendal emerging from his study  he was looking restless and anxious came to meet her and uncloaked her while he affectionately scolded her for being so venturesome  she told him where she had been and he smiled saying you are a busy spirit  but you must not be too imprudent  oh nothing hurts me  it is poor gilbert that i am anxious about  so am i  gilbert has not a constitution fit for exposure  i wish he were come home  could we not send for him  suppose we sent a fly  he was consenting with a pleased smile when the door opened and there stood the dripping gilbert completely wet through pale and chilled with his hair plastered down and his coat stuck all over with the horses short hair  you must go to bed at once gilbert said his father  are you cold  very  it was such a horrid driving wind and i rode so fast said gilbert violently shivering as they helped to pull him out of his great coat he put his hand to his mouth and said that his face ached  mr kendal was very anxious and albinia hurried the boy up to bed and meantime ordered quickly a basin of the soup preparing for dinner warmed some worsted socks at the fire and ran upstairs with them  he seemed to have no substance in him he had hardly had energy to undress himself and she found him with his face hidden on the pillow shivering audibly and actually crying  she was aghast  the boys with whom she had been brought up would never have given way so entirely without resistance but between laughing cheering scolding covering him up close and rubbing his hands with her own she comforted him so that he could be grateful and cheerful when his father himself came up with the soup  albinia noticed a sort of shudder pass over mr kendal as he entered and he stood close by gilbert turning his back on everything else while he watched the boy eat the soup as if restored by every spoonful  that was a good thought was his comment to his wife and the look of gratitude brought a flush of pleasure into her cheek   of all the dinners this was the most pleasant he was more gentle and affectionate and she made him tell her about the persian poets and promise to show her some specimens of the rose garden of saadishe had never before been so near having his pursuits opened to her  what a favourite gilbert is lucy said to sophia as albinia lighted a candle and went up to his room  he makes such a fuss said sophy  what is there in being wet through to cry about  albinia heard a little shuffle as she opened the door and gilbert pushed a book under his pillow  she asked him what he had been reading  oh he said he had not been doing it long for the flickering of the candle hurt his eyes  yes you had better not said albinia moving the flaring light to a less draughty part of the dingy whitewashed attic  or shall i read to you  are you come to stay with me cried the boy raising himself up to look after her as she moved about the room and stood looking from the window over the trees at the water meadows now flooded into a lake and lighted by the beams of a young moon  i can stay till your father is ready for tea said albinia coming nearer  let me see whether your hands are hot  she found her own hand suddenly clasped and pressed to his lips and then as if ashamed he turned his face away nor would she betray her pleasure in it but merely said shall i go on with your book  no said he wearily turning his reddened cheek to the other side i only took it because it is so horrid lying here thinking  i am very sorry to hear it  do you know gibbie that it is said there is nothing more lamentable than for a man not to like to have his own thoughts for his company said she gaily  ah but said gilbert  if i lie here alone im always looking out there and he pointed to the opposite recess  she looked but saw nothing  dont you know he said  edmund she asked  he grasped her hands in both his own  aye  ned used to sleep there  i always look for him there  do you mean that you would rather have another room  i would manage it directly  o no thank you i like it for some things  take the candlelook by the shuttercut out in the wood  the boys scoring of e  g k was visible there  papa has taken all be could of edmunds said gilbert but he could not take that  no i would not have any other room if you were to give me the best in the house  i am sure not  but my dear considering what edmund was surely they should be gentle happy thoughts that the room should give you  he shuddered and presently said do you know what and paused then continued with an effort getting tight hold of her hand just before edmund diedhe lay out therei lay herehe sat up all white in bed and he called out clear and loud mamma gilberti saw himand thenhe was dead  and you know mamma did dieand im sure i shall  he had worked himself into a trembling fit hid his face and sobbed  but you have not died of the fever  yesbut i know it means that i shall die young  i am sure it does it was a call  i heard nurse say it was a call  what was to be done with such a superstition  albinia did not think it would be right to argue it away  it might be in truth a warning to him to guard his waysa voice from the twinbrother to be with him through life  she knelt down by him and kissed his forehead  dear gilbert she said we all shall die  yes but i shall die young  and if you should  those are happy who die young  how much pain your babybrother and sisters have missed  how happy edmund is now  then you really think it meant that i shall he cried tremblingly o dont  i cant die  your brother called on what he loved best said albinia  it may mean nothing  or rather it may mean that your dear twinbrother is watching for you i am sure he is to have you with him for what makes your mortal life however long seem as nothing  it was a call to you to be as pure on earth as he is in heaven o gilbert how good you should be  gilbert did not know whether it frightened him or soothed him to see his superstition treated with respectneither denied nor reasoned away  but the ghastliness was not in the mere fear that death might not be far off  the pillow had turned a little on one sidealbinia tried to smooth itthe corner of a book peeped out  it was a translation of the three musqueteers one of the worst and most fascinating of dumas romances  you wont tell papa cried gilbert raising himself in far more real and present terror than he had previously shown  how did you get it  whose is it  it is my own  i bought it at richardsons  it is very funny  but you wont tell papa  i never was told not indeed i was not  now gilbert dear will you tell me a few things  i do only wish what is good for you  why dont you wish that papa should hear of this book  gilbert writhed himself  you know he would not like it  then why did you take to reading it  oh cried the boy if you only did know how stupid and how miserable it has been  more than half myself gone and sophy always glum and lucy always plaguing and aunt maria always being a torment you would not wonder at ones doing anything to forget it  yes but why do what you knew to be wrong  nobody told me not  disobedience to the spirit then if not to the letter  it was not the way to be happier my poor boy nor nearer to your brother and mother  things didnt use to be stupid when ned was there sobbed gilbert bursting into a fresh flood of tears  ah  gilbert i grieved most of all for you when first i heard your story before i thought i should ever have anything to do with you said albinia hanging over him fondly  i always thought it must be so forlorn to be a twin left solitary  but it is sadder still than i knew if grief has made you put yourself farther from him instead of nearer  i shall be good again now that i have you said gilbert as he looked up into that sweet face  and you will begin by making a free confession to your father and giving up the book  i dont see what i have to confess  he would be so angry and he never told me not  oh i cannot tell him  she felt that this was not the right way to begin a reformation and yet she feared to press the point knowing that the one was thought severe the other timid  at least you will give up the book she said  o dear if you would let me see whether dartagnan got to england i must know that  im sure there cant be any harm in that  do you know what it is about  yes i do  my brother got it by some mistake among some french books  he read some of the droll unobjectionable parts to my sister and me but the rest was so bad that he threw it into the fire  then you think it funny  to be sure i do  do you remember the three duels all at once and the three valets oh what fun it is  but do let me see if dartagnan got the diamonds  yes he did  but will this satisfy you gilbert  you know there are some exciting pleasures that we must turn our backs on resolutely  i think this book is one of them  now you will let me take it  i will tell your father about it in private and he cannot blame you  then if he will give his consent whenever you can come home early come to my dressingroom out of your sisters way and i will read to you the innocent part so as to get the story out of your brain  very well said gilbert slowly  yes if you will not let papa be angry with me  and oh dear must you go  i think you had better dress yourself and come down to tea  there is nothing the matter with you now is there  he was delighted with the suggestion and promised to come directly and albinia carried off her prize exceedingly hopeful and puzzled and wondering whether her compromise had been a right one or a mere tampering with temptationdelighted with the confidence and affection bestowed on her so freely but awestruck by the impression which the boy had avowed and marvelling how it should be treated so as to render it a blessed and salutary restraint rather than the dim superstitious terror that it was at present  at least there was hope of influencing him his heart was affectionate his will on the side of right and in consideration of feeble health and timid character she would overlook the fact that he had not made one voluntary open confession and that the partial renunciation had been wrung from him as a choice of evils  she could only feel how much he was to be pitied and how he responded to her affection  she was crossing the hall next day when she heard a confusion of tongues through the open door of the diningroom and above all gilberts  well i say there are but two ladies in bayford  one is mrs kendal and the other is genevieve durant  a dancingmasters daughter lucys scornful tone was unmistakeable and so was the ensuing highpitched querulous voice well to be sure gilbert might be a little morea little more civil  not that ive a word to say againstagainst youryour mamma  oh noglad to seebut gilbert might be more civil  i think so indeed said albinia  good morning miss meadows  you see gilbert has come home quite alive enough for mischief  ah i thought i might be excused  mamma was so uneasythough i know you dont admit visitorsmy just coming to seeweve been always so anxious about gilbert  gibbie dear where is that flannel i gave you for your throat  she advanced to put her finger within his necktie and feel for it gilbert stuck his chin down and snapped with his teeth like a gin lucy exclaimed now gilbert i know mamma will say that is wrong  ah we are used to gilberts tricks  always bear with a boys antics said miss meadows preventing whatever she thought was coming out of mrs kendals month  albinia took the unwise step of laughing for her sympathies were decidedly with resistance both to flannels and to the insertion of that hooked finger  mr bowles has always said it was a case for great care  flannel next the skinno exposure continued miss meadows tartly  i am surei know i am the last person to wish to interferebut so delicateyoull excusebut my mother was uneasy and people who go out in all weathers  i hope mrs meadows had my note this morning  o yes  i am perfectly aware  thank you  yes i know the rule but youll excusemy mother was still anxiousi know you exclude visitors in lessontime  im going  only grandmamma would be glad not that she wishes to interferebut if gilbert had on his piece of flannel  have you gilbert said albinia becoming tormented  i have been flannel all over all my life said gilbert sulkily one bit more or less can make no odds  then you have not that piece said albinia  oh my dear  think of that  new saxony  i begged it of mr holland  a new remnantpink list and all  i said it was just what i wanted for master gilbert  mr holland is always a civil feeling man  new saxonythree shillings the yardand trimmed with blue sarsenet  where is it gilbert  in a soup dish with a crop of mustard and cress on it said gilbert with a wicked wink at albinia who was unable to resist joining in the girls shout of laughing but she became alarmed when she found that poor miss meadows was very near crying and that her incoherency became so lachrymose as to be utterly incomprehensible  lucy ashamed of her laughter solemnly declared that it was very wrong of gilbert and she hoped he would not suffer from it and albinia trying to become grave judicial and conciliatory contrived to pronounce that it was very silly to leave anything off in an east wind and hoping to put an end to the matter asked aunt maria to sit down and judge how they went on with their lessons  o no she could not interrupt  her mother would want her  she knew mrs kendal never admitted visitors  she had no doubt she was quite right  she hoped it would be understood  she would not intrude  in fact she could neither go nor stay  she would not resume her seat nor let anything go on and it was full twenty minutes before a series of little vibrating motions and fragmentary phrases had borne her out of the house  well cried gilbert i hoped aunt maria had left off coming down upon us  o mamma exclaimed lucy you never sent your love to grandmamma  depend upon it she was waiting for that said gilbert  im sure i wish i had known it said albinia not in the most judicious manner  halfpast eleven  aunt maria says she cant think how you can find time for church when you cant see visitors in the morning said lucy  and oh dear mamma grandmamma says gravy soup was enough to throw gilbert into a fever  at any rate it did not said albinia  oh and dear mamma mrs osborn is so hurt that you called on mrs dusautoy before returning her visit and aunt maria says if you dont call today you will never get over it and she says that  what business has mrs osborn to ask whom i called on exclaimed albinia impatiently  because mrs osborn is the leading lady in the town said lucy she told miss goldsmith that she had no notion of not being respected  and she cant bear the dusautoys  she left off subscribing to anything when they came and he behaved very ill to the admiral and everybody at a vestrymeeting  i shall ask your papa before i am in any hurry to call on the osborns cried albinia  i have no desire to be intimate with people who treat their clergyman in that way  but mrs osborn is quite the leader exclaimed lucy  they keep the best society here  so many families in the county come and call on them  very likely  ah mrs osborn told aunt maria that as the nugents called on you and you had such connexions she supposed you would be high  but you wont make me separate from lizzie will you  i suppose miss nugent is a fashionable young lady  miss nugent is five years old  dont let us have any more of this nonsense  but you wont part me from lizzie osborn said lucy hanging her head pathetically on one side  i shall talk to your father  he said the other day he did not wish you to be so much with her  lucy melted into tears and albinia was conscious of having been first indiscreet and then sharp hurt at the comments feeling injured by lucys evident habit of reporting whatever she said and at the failure of the attempt to please mrs meadows  she was so uneasy about the osborn question that she waylaid mr kendal on his return from riding and laid it before him  my dear albinia he said as if he would fain have avoided the appeal you must manage your own visiting affairs your own way  i do not wish to offend my neighbours nor would i desire to be very intimate with any one  i suppose you must pay them ordinary civility and you know what that amounts to  as to the leadership in society here she is a noisy woman full of pretension and thus always arrogates the distinction to herself  your claims will establish themselves  oh you dont imagine me thinking of that cried albinia laughing i meant their behaving ill to mr dusautoy  i know nothing about that  mr dusautoy once called to ask for my support for a vestry meeting but i make it a rule never to meddle with parish skirmishes  i believe there was a very unbecoming scene and that mr dusautoy was in the minority  ah edmund next time youll see if a parsons sister can sit quietly by to see the parson beaten  he smiled and moved towards his study  then i am to be civil  certainly  but is it necessary to call today  i should suppose not and there he was shut up in his den albinia went back between laughing and vexation and lucy looked up from her exercise to say does papa say you must call on the osborns  it was undignified  she bit her lip and felt her false position as with a quiver of the voice she replied we shall make nothing but mischief if we talk now  go on with your business  the sharp curious eyes did not take themselves off her face  she leant over sophy who was copying a house told her the lines were slanting took the pencil from her hand and tried to correct them but found herself making them overblack and shaky  she had not seen such a line since the days of her childhoods illtemper  she walked to the fireplace and said i am going to call on mrs osborn today  not that your father desires it but because i have been indulging in a wrong feeling  im sure you neednt cried gilbert  it is very impertinent of mrs osborn  why if he is an admiral she was the daughter of an old lieutenant of the marines and you are general sir maurice ferrars first cousin  hush hush gilbert said albinia blushing and distressed  mrs osborns standing in the place entitles her to all attention  i was thinking of nothing of the kind  it was because i gave way to a wrong feeling that i mean to go this afternoon  on the sunday when mr and mrs kendal went to pay their weekly visit to mrs meadows they found the old lady taking a turn in the garden  and as they were passing by the screen of laurels gilberts voice was heard very loud thats too bad lucy  grandmamma dont believe one word of it  gilbert youyou are im sure very rude to your sister  ill not stand to hear false stories of mrs kendal  what is all this said mr kendal suddenly appearing and discovering gilbert pirouetting with indignation before lucy  miss meadows burst out with a shower of half sentences grandmamma begged that no notice might be taken of the childrens nonsense lucy put on an air of injured innocence and gilbert was beginning to speak but his father put him aside saying tell me what has happened sophia  from you i am certain of hearing the exact truth  only growled sophy in her hoarse boys voice lucy said mamma said she would not call on mrs osborn unless you ordered her and when you did she cried and flew into a tremendous passion  sophy what a story exclaimed lucy but gilbert was ready to corroborate his younger sisters report  you know lucy too well to attach any importance to her misrepresentations said mr kendal turning to mrs meadows but i know not what amends she can make for this most unprovoked slander speak lucy have you no apology to make  for lucy in selfdefence had begun to cry and her grandmother seemed much disposed to do the same  miss meadows had tears in her eyes and incoherencies on her lips  the distress drove away all albinias inclination to laugh and clasping her two hands over her husbands arm she said dont edmund it is only a misunderstanding of what really happened  i did have a silly fit you know so it is my fault  i cannot forgive for you as you do for yourself said mr kendal with a look that was precious to her though it might have given a pang to the meadowses  i did not imagine that my daughter could be so lost to the sense of your kindness and forbearance  have you nothing to say lucy  poor child she cannot speak said her grandmother  you see she is very sorry and mrs kendal is too kind to wish to say any more about it  go home at once lucy said her father  perhaps solitude may bring you to a better state of feeling  go  direct resistance to mr kendal was never thought of and lucy turned to go  her aunt chose to accompany her and though this was a decided relief to the company she left it was not likely to be the best thing for the young lady herself  mr kendal gave his arm to mrs meadows saying gravely that lucy must not be encouraged in her habit of gossiping and inaccuracy mrs meadows quite agreed with him it was a very bad habit for a girl she was very sorry for it she wished she could have attended to the dear children better but she was sure dear mrs kendal would make them everything  desirable  she only hoped that she would remember their disadvantages have patience and not recollect this against poor lucy  the warm indignation and championship of her husband and his son were what albinia chiefly wished to recollect but it was impossible to free herself from a sense of pain and injury in the knowledge that she lived with a spy who would exaggerate and colour every careless word  mr kendal returned to the subject as they walked home  i hope you will talk seriously to lucy about her intolerable gossiping he said  there is no safety in mentioning any subject before her and maria meadows makes her worse  some stop must be put to it  i should like to wait till next time said albinia  what do you mean  because this is too personal to myself  nay your own candour is an example to which lucy can hardly be insensible  besides it is a nuisance which must be abated  albinia could not help thinking that he suffered from it as little as most people and wondering whether it were this which had taught him silence  they met miss meadows at their own gate and she told them that dear lucy was very sorry and she hoped they would take no more notice of a little nonsense that could do no one any harm she would be more on her guard next time  mr kendal made no answer  albinia ventured to ask him whether it would not be better to leave it since her aunt had talked to her  no he said maria has no influence whatever with the children she frets them by using too many words about everything  one quiet remonstrance from you would have far more effect  albinia called the culprit and tried to reason with her  lucy tried at first to battle it off by saying that she had made a mistake and aunt maria had said that she should hear no more about it  but my dear i am afraid you must hear more  it is not that i am hurt but your papa has desired me to talk to you  you would be frightened to hear what he says  lucy chose to hear and seemed somewhat struck but she was sure that she meant no harm and she had a great deal to say for herself so voluble and so inconsequent that argument was breath spent in vain and albinia was obliged to wind up as an ultimatum with warning her that till she should prove herself trustworthy nothing interesting would be talked of before her  the atmosphere of gossip certainly had done its part in cultivating mr kendals talent for silence  when albinia had him all to herself he was like another person and the long drives to return visits in the country were thoroughly enjoyable  so too were the walks home from the dinner parties in the town when the husband and wife lingered in the starlight or moonlight and felt that the weary gaiety of the constrained evening was made up for  great was the offence they gave by not taking out the carriage  it was disrespect to bayford and one of the airs of which mrs kendal was accused  as granddaughter of a baron daughter of one general officer and sister of another and presented at court the bayford ladies were prepared to consider her a fine lady and when they found her peculiarly simple were the more aggrieved as if her contempt were ironically veiled  her walks her dress her intercourse with the clergy were all airs and lucy spared her none of the remarks  albinia might say dont tell me all aunt maria says but it was impossible not to listen and whether in mirth or vexation she was sure to be harmed by what she heard  and yet except for the talebearing lucy was really giving less trouble than her sister she was quick observant and obliging and under albinias example the more salient vulgarities of speech and manner were falling off  there had seldom been any collision since it had become evident that mrs kendal could and would hold her own and that her address and air even while criticised were regarded as something superior so that it was a distinction to belong to her how many of poor albiniaa socalled airs should justly have been laid to lucys account  on the other hand sophy would attend to a word from her father where she had obstinately opposed her stepmothers wishes making her obedience marked as if for the very purpose of enforcing the contrast  it was a character that albinia could not as yet fathom in all occupations and amusements sophy followed the lead of her elder sister and in her lessons her sole object seemed to be to get things done with as little trouble as possible and especially without setting her mind to work and yet in the very effort to escape diligence or exertion she sometimes showed signs of so much ability as to excite a longing desire to know of what she would be capable when once aroused and interested but the surly ungracious temper rendered this apparently impossible and whatever albinia attempted was sure as if for the very reason that it came from her to be answered with a redoubling of the growl of that odd hoarse voice  on lucys birthday there was an afternoon party of her young friends including miss durant  albinia who among the girlhood of fairmead and its neighbourhood had been so acceptable a playmate that her marriage had caused the outcry that there would never be any fun again without miss ferrars came out on the lawn with the girls in hopes of setting them to enjoy themselves  but they looked at her almost suspiciously retained their cold stiff company manners and drew apart into giggling knots  she relieved them of her presence and sitting by the window watched genevieve walking up and down alone as if no one cared to join her  presently lucy and lizzie osborn spoke to her and she went in  albinia went to meet her in the hall she coloured and said she was only come to fetch miss osborns cloak  albinia saw her disposing it over lizzies shoulders and then running in again  this time it was for miss louisas cloak and a third time for miss drurys shawl which albinia chose to take out herself and encountering sophia said next time you had better run on errands yourself instead of sending your guests  sophy gave a black look and she retreated but presently the groups coalesced and maria drury and sophy ran out to call genevieve into the midst  albinia hoped they were going to play but soon she beheld genevieve trying to draw back but evidently imprisoned there was an echo of a laugh that she did not like the younger girls were skipping up in the victims face in a rude way she hastily turned round as in indignation one hand raised to her eyes but it was instantly snatched down by maria drury and the pitiless ring closed in  albinia sprang to her feet exclaiming aloud they are teasing her and rushed into the garden hearing on her way no we wont let you goyou shall tell usyou shall promise to show usmy papa is a magistrate you knowhell come and searchjenny you shall tell  come with me genevieve said albinia standing in the midst of the tormentors and launching a look of wrath around her as she saw tears in the young girls eyes and taking her hand found it trembling with agitation  fondling it with both her own she led genevieve away turning her back upon lucy and her we were only  the poor girl shook more and more and when they reached the shelter of the house gave way to a tightened oppressed sob and at the first kind words a shower of tears followed and she took albinias hand and clasped it to her breast in a manner embarrassing to english feelings though perfectly natural and sincere in her  ah si bonne si bonne pardonnesmoi madame she exclaimed sobbing and probably not knowing that she was speaking french but oh madame you will tell me  is it truecan he  can who  what do you mean my dear  the admiral said genevieve looking about frightened and sinking her voice to a whisper  miss louisa said so that he could send and search  search for what my dear  for my poor little secret  ah madame assuredly i may tell you it is but a french bible it belonged to my martyred ancestor francois durant who perished at the st barthelemiit is stained with his bloodit has been handed on from one to the otherit was all that jacques durant rescued when he fled from the dragonnadesit was given to me by my own dear father on his deathbed with a charge to keep it from my grandmother and not to speak of itbut to guard it as my greatest treasure  and nowoh i am not disobeying him cried genevieve with a fresh burst of tears  you can feel for me madame you can counsel me  can the magistrates come and search unless i confess to those young ladies  most decidedly not said albinia  set your mind at rest my poor child whoever threatened you played you a most base cruel trick  ah do not be angry with them madame no doubt they were in sport they could not know how precious that treasure was to me and they will say much in their gaiety of heart  i do not like such gaiety said albinia  what they wished to make you confess your secret  yes  they had learnt by some means that i keep one of my drawers locked and they had figured to themselves that in it was some relic of my huguenot ancestors  they thought it was some instrument of death and they said that unless i would tell them the whole the admiral had the right of search and oh it was foolish of me to believe them for a moment but i only thought that the fright would kill my grandmother  oh you were so good madame i shall never forget no not to the end of my life how you rescued me  we did not bring you here to be teased said albinia caressing her  i should like to ask your pardon for what they have made you undergo  ah madame said genevieve smiling it is nothing  i am well used to the like and i heed it little except when it falls on such subjects as these  she was easily drawn into telling the full history of her treasure as she had learnt from her fathers lips the huguenot shot down by the persecutors and the son who had fled into the mountains and returned to bury the corpse and take the prized bloodstained bible from the breast the escapes and dangers of the two next generations the few succeeding days of peace and finally the dragonnade when the children had been snatched from the durant family and the father and mother had been driven at length to fly in utter destitution and had made their way to england in a wretched unprovisioned open boat the child for whose sake they fled was the only one rescued from the hands of these enemies and the tradition of their sufferings had been handed on with the faithfully preserved relic down to the slender girl their sole descendant and who in early childhood had drunk in the tale from the lips of her father  the child of the persecutors and of the persecuted genevieve durant did indeed represent strangely the history of her ancestral country and as albinia said to her surely it might be hoped that the faith in which she had been bred up united what was true and sound in the religion of both reformed and romanist  the words made the brown cheek glow  ah madame did i not say i could talk with you  you who do not think me a heretic as my dear grandmothers friends do and who yet can respect my grandmothers church  assuredly little genevieve was one of the most interesting and engaging persons that albinia had ever met and she listened earnestly to her artless history and pretty enthusiasms and the story which she could not tell without tears of her fathers care when the reward of her good behaviour had been the reading one verse in the quaint black letter of the old french bible  the conversation lasted till gilbert made his appearance and albinia was glad to find that his greeting to genevieve was cordial and affectionate and free from all that was unpleasant in his sisters manner and he joined himself to their company when albinia proposed a walk along the broad causeway through the meadows  it was one of the pleasantest walks that she had taken at bayford with both her companions so bright and merry and the scene around in all the beauty of spring  gilbert with the courtesy that albinias very presence had infused into him gathered a pretty wild bouquet for each and albinia talked of cowslipballs and found that neither gilbert nor genevieve had ever seen one then she pitied them and owned that she did not know how to get through a spring without one and gilbert having of course a pocketful of string a delicious ball was constructed over which genevieve went into an inexpressible ecstasy  all the evening gilbert devoted himself to genevieve though more than one of the others tried to attract him playing off the follies of more advanced girlhood to the vexation of albinia who could not bear to see him the centre of attention to silly girls when he ought to have been finding his level among boys  gilbert makes himself so ridiculous about jenny durant said his sisters when he insisted on escorting her home and thus they brought on themselves albinias pentup indignation at their usage of their guest  lucy argued in unsatisfactory selfdefence but sophy when shown how ungenerous her conduct had been crimsoned deeply and though uttering no word of apology wore a look that gave her stepmother for the first time a hope that her sullenness might not be so much from want of compunction as from want of power to express it  oh for a consultation with her brother  but he and his wife were taking a holiday among their kindred in ireland and for once albinia could have echoed the aunts lamentation that winifred had so many relations     chapter v    albinia needed patience to keep alive hope and energy for a sore disappointment awaited her  whatever had been her annoyances with the girls she had always been on happy and comfortable terms with gilbert he had responded to her advances accommodated himself to her wishes adopted her tastes and returned her affection  she had early perceived that his father and sisters looked on him as the naughty one of the family but when she saw lucys fretting interference and sophias wrangling contempt she did not wonder that an unjust degree of blame had often fallen to his share and under her management he scarcely ever gave cause for complaint that he was evidently happier and better for her presence was compensation for many a vexation she loved him with all her heart made fun with him told legends of the freaks of her brother maurice and cousin fred and grudged no trouble for his pleasure  as long as the three musqueteers lasted he had come constantly to her dressingroom and afterwards she promised to find other pleasant reading but after such excitement it was not easy to find anything that did not appear dry  as the daughter of a peninsular man she thought nothing so charming as the subaltern and gilbert seemed to enjoy it but by the time he had heard all her oral traditions of the war by way of notes his attendance began to slacken he stayed out later and always brought excusesmr salsted had kept him he had been with a fellow or his pony had lost a shoe  albinia did not care to question the evenings were light and warm and the one thing she desired for him was manly exercise she thought it much better for him to be at play with his fellowpupils and she could not regret the gain of another hour to her hurried day  one morning however mr kendal called her and his look was so grave and perturbed that she hardly waited till the door was shut to ask in terror what could be the matter  nothing to alarm you he said  it is only that i am vexed about gilbert  i have reason to fear that he is deceiving us again and i want you to help us to recollect on which days he should have been at tremblam  my dear do not look so pale  for albinia had turned quite white at hearing that the boy on whom she had fixed her warm affection had been carrying on a course of falsehood but a moments hope restored her  i did keep him at home on tuesday she said it was so very hot and he had a headache  i thought i might  you told me not to send him on doubtful days  i hope you may be able to make out that it is right said mr kendal but i am afraid that mr salsted has too much cause of complaint  it is the old story  and so indeed it proved when albinia heard what the tutor had come to say  the boy was seldom in time often altogether missing excusing himself by saying he was kept at home by fears of the weather but mr salsted was certain that his father could not know how he disposed of his time namely in a low style of sporting with young tritton the son of a rich farmer or halfgentleman who was the pest of mr salsteds parish  illlearnt slurredover lessons with lame excuses were nothing as compared with this and the amount of petty deceit subterfuge and falsehood was frightful especially when albinia recollected the tone of thought which the boy had seemed to be catching from her   unused to duplicity except from mere ignorant unmanageable schoolchildren she was excessively shocked and felt as if he must be utterly lost to all good and had been acting a lie from first to last  after the conviction had broken on her she hardly spoke while mr kendal was promising to talk to his son threaten him with severe punishment and keep a strict account of his comings and goings to be compared weekly with mr salsteds notes of his arrival  this settled the tutor departed and no sooner was he gone than albinia hiding her face in her hands shed tears of bitter grief and disappointment  my dearest said her husband fondly you must not let my boys doings grieve you in this manner  you have been doing your utmost for him if any one could do him good it would be you  o no surely i must have made some dreadful mistake to have promoted such faults  no i have long known him not to be trustworthy  it is an evil of long standing  was it always so  i cannot tell said he sitting down beside her and shading his brow with one hand i have only been aware of it since he has been left alone  when the twins were together they were led by one soul of truth and generosity  what this poor fellow was separately no one could know while he had his brother to guide and shield him  the first time i noticed the evil was when we were recovering  gilbert and sophia were left together and in one of their quarrels injured some papers of mine  i was very weak and had little power of selfcontrol i believe i terrified him too much  there was absolute falsehood and the truth was only known by sophias coming forward and confessing the whole  it was ill managed  i was not equal to dealing with him and whether the mischief began then or earlier it has gone on ever since breaking out every now and then  i had hoped that with your carebut oh how different it would have been with his brother albinia what would i not give that you had but seen him  not a fault was there not a moments grief did he give us tillo what an overthrow of hope  and he gave way to an excess of grief that quite appalled her and made her feel herself powerless to comfort she only ventured a few words of peace and hope but the contrast between the brothers was just then keen agony and he could not help exclaiming how strange it was that edmund should be the one to be taken  nay he said was not he ripe for better things  may not poor gilbert have been spared that longer life may train him to be like his brother  he never will be like him cried mr kendal  no no  the difference is evident in the very countenance and features  was he like you  they said so but you could not gather an idea of him from me said mr kendal smiling mournfully as he met her gaze  it was the most beautiful countenance i ever saw full of life and joy and there were wonderful expressions in the eyes when he was thinking or listening  he used to read the greek testament with me every morning and his questions and remarks rise up before me again  that textyou have seen it in church  because i live ye shall live also albinia repeated  yes  a little before his illness we came to that  he rested on it as he used to do on anything that struck him and asked me whether it meant the life hereafter or the life that is hidden here  we went over it with such comments as i could find but his mind was not satisfied and it must have gone on working on it for one night when i had been thinking him delirious he called me and the light shone out of those bright dark eyes of his as he said joyfully it is both papa  it is hidden here but it will shine out there and as i did not catch his meaning he repeated the greek words  dear boy  some day we shall be glad that the full life and glory came so soon  he shook his head the parting was still too recent and it was the first time he had been able to speak of his son  it was a great satisfaction to her that the reserve had once been broken it seemed like compensation for the present trouble though that was acutely felt and not softened by the curious eyes and leading questions of the sisters when she returned to give what attention she could to their interrupted lessons  gilbert returned unsuspicious of the storm till his fathers stern gravity and her depressed preoccupied manner excited his attention and he asked her anxiously whether anything were the matter  a sad gesture replied and perhaps revealed the state of the case for he became absolutely silent  albinia left them together she watched anxiously and hurried after mr kendal into the study where his manner showed her not to be unwelcome as the sharer of his trouble  i do not know what to do he said dejectedly  i can make nothing of him  it is all prevarication and sulkiness  i do not think he felt one word that i said  people often feel more than they show  he groaned  will you go to him he presently added  perhaps i grew too angry at last and i believe he loves you  at least if he does not he must be more unfeeling than i can think him  you do not dislike it dearest  o no no  if i only knew what would be best for him  he may be more unreserved with you said mr kendal and as he was anxious for her to make the attempt she moved away though in perplexity and in the revulsion of feeling with a sort of disgust towards the boy who had deceived her so long  she found him seated on a wheelbarrow by the pond chucking pebbles into the still black water and disturbing the duckweed on the surface  his colour was gone and his face was dark and moody and strove not to relax as she said o gilbert how could you  he turned sharply away muttering she is coming to bother now  it cut her to the heart  gilbert was all she could exclaim but the tone of pain made him look at her as if in spite of himself and as he saw the tears he exclaimed in an impatient voice of rude consolation theres nothing to take so much to heart  no one thinks anything of it  what would edmund have thought said albinia but the appeal came too soon he made an angry gesture and said he was nearly three years younger than i am now  he would not have been kept in these abominable leadingstrings  she was too much shocked to find an answer and gilbert went on watched and examined wherever i gonot a minute to myselfnothing but lessons at tremblam and bother at home driven about hither and thither and not allowed a friend of my own nor to do one single thing  theres no standing it and i wont  i am very sorry said albinia struggling with choking tears  it has been my great wish to make things pleasant to you  i hope i have not teased or driven you to  nonsense exclaimed gilbert disrespectfully indeed but from the bottom of his heart and breaking at once into a flood of tears you are the only creature that has been kind to me since i lost my mother and ned and now they have been and turned you against me too and he sobbed violently  i dont know what you mean gilbert  if i stand in your mothers place i cant be turned against you any more than she could and she stroked his brow which she found so throbbing as to account for his paleness  you can grieve and hurt me but you cant prevent me from feeling for you nor for your dear fathers grief  he declared that people at home knew nothing about boys and made an uproar about nothing  do you call falsehood nothing  falsehood  a mere trifle now and then when i am driven to it by being kept so strictly  i dont know how to talk to you gilbert said albinia rising your conscience knows better than your tongue  dont go and he went off into another paroxysm of crying as he caught hold of her dress and when he spoke again his mood was changed he was very miserable nobody cared for him he did not know what to do he wanted to do right and to please her but archie tritton would not let him alone he wished he had never seen archie tritton  at last walking up and down with him she drew from him a full confidence and began to understand how when health and strength had come back to him in greater measure than he had ever before enjoyed the craving for boyish sports had awakened just after he had been deprived of his brother and was debarred from almost every wholesome manner of gratifying it  to fall in with young tritton was as great a misfortune as could well have befallen a boy with a dreary home melancholy reserved father and wearisome aunt   tritton was a youth of seventeen who had newly finished his education at an inferior commercial school and lived on his fathers farm giving himself the airs of a sporting character and fast hurrying into dissipation  he was really goodnatured and gilbert dwelt on his kindness with warmth and gratitude and on his prowess in all sporting accomplishments with a perfect effervescence of admiration  he evidently patronized gilbert partly from goodnatured pity and partly as flattered by the adherence of a boy of a grade above him and gilbert was proud of the notice of one who seemed to him a man and an adept in all athletic games  it was a dangerous intimacy and her heart sank as she found that the pleasures to which he had been introducing gilbert were not merely the free exercise the rabbitshooting and rathunting of the farm nor even the village cricketmatch all of which in other company would have had her full sympathy  but there had been such low and cruel sports that she turned her head away sickened at the notion of any one dear to her having been engaged in such amusements and when gilbert in excuse said that every one did it she answered indignantly my brothers never  it is no use talking about what swells do that hunt and shoot and go to school answered gilbert  do you wish you went to school asked albinia  i wish i was out of it all  he was in a very different frame  he owned that he knew how wrong it had been to deceive but he seemed to look upon it as a sort of fate he wished he could help it but could not he was so much afraid of his father that he did not know what he said archie tritton said no one could get on withoutthere was an utter bewilderment in his notions here and there showing a better tone but obscured by the fancies imbibed from his companion that the knowledge and practice of evil were manly  at one moment he cried bitterly and declared that he was wretched at another he defended each particular case with all his might changing and slipping away so that she did not know where to take him  however the conclusion was far more in pity than anger and after receiving many promises that if she would shield him from his father and bear with him he would abstain from all she disapproved she caressed and soothed the aching head and returned to his father hopeful and encouraged certain that the evil had been chiefly caused by weakness and neglect and believing that here was a beginning of repentance  since there was sorrow and confession there surely must be reformation  for a week gilbert went on steadily but at the end of that time his arrivals at home became irregular and one day there was another great aberration  on a doubtful day when it had been decided that he might go safely between the showers he never came to tremblam at all and mr salsted sent a note to mr kendal to let him know that his son had been at the racesvillage races managed by the sporting farmers of the neighbourhood  there was a sense of despair and again a talk bringing at once those everready tears and protestations sorrow genuine but fruitless  it was all archies fault he had overtaken him persuaded him that mr salsted would not expect him promised him that he should see the celebrated blunderbuss sam shepherds horse that won the race last year gilbert had gone because he could not help it  not help it cried albinia looking at him with her clear indignant eyes  how can you be such a poor creature gilbert  it is very hard exclaimed gilbert i must go past robbles leigh twice every day of my life and archie will come out and be at me  that is the very temptation you have to resist said albinia fight against it pray against it resolve against it ride fast and dont linger and look after him  he looked desponding and miserable  if she could only have put a spirit into him  shall i walk and meet you sometimes before you get to robbies leigh  his face cleared up but the cloud returned in a moment  what is it she asked  only tell me  you know i wish for nothing so much as to help you  he did confess that there was nothing he should like better if archie would not be all the worse another time whenever he should catch him alone  but surely gilbert he is not always lying in ambush for you like a cat for a mouse  you cant be his sole game  no but he is coming or going or out with his gun and he will often come part of the way with me and he is such a droll fellow  albinia thought that there was but one cure  to leave gilbert daily exposed to the temptation must be wrong and she laid the case before mr kendal with so much earnestness that he allowed that it would be better to send the boy from home and in the meantime albinia obtained that mr kendal should ride some way on the tremblam road with his son in the morning so as to convoy him out of reach of the tempter whilst she tried to meet him in the afternoon and managed so that he should be seldom without the hope of meeting her  albinias likings had taken a current absolutely contrary to all her preconceived notions sophia with her sullen truth was respected but it was not easy to like her even as well as lucy who though pert and empty had much goodnature and goodtemper and was not indocile while gilbert in spite of a weak shallow character habits of deception and low ungentlemanly tastes had won her affection and occupied the chief of her time and thoughts and she dreaded the moment of parting with him as removing the most available and agreeable of her young companions  that moment of parting though acknowledged to be expedient did not approach  gilbert could not be sent to a public school without risk and anxiety which his father did not like and which would have been horror to his grandmother and albinia herself did not feel certain that he was fit for it nor that it was her part to enforce it  she wrote to her brother and found that he likewise thought a tutor would be a safe alternative but then he must be a perfect man in a perfect climate and mr kendal was not the man to make researches mr dusautoy mentioned one clergyman who took pupils maurice ferrars another but there was something against each  mr kendal wrote four letters and was undecideda third was heard of but the locality was doubtful and the plan went off because mr kendal could not make up his mind to go thirty miles to see the place and talk to a stranger  albinia found that her power did not extend beyond driving him from ill see about it to yes by all means  action was a length to which he could not be brought  mr nugent was very anxious that he should qualify as a magistrate since a sensible highlyprincipled man was much wanted counterbalance admiral osborns misdirected restless activity and the lower parts of the town were in a dreadful state  mrs nugent talked to albinia and she urged it in vain  to come out of his study examine felons contend with the admiral and to meet all the world at the quarter sessions was abhorrent to him and he silenced her almost with sternness  she was really hurt and vexed and scarcely less so by a discovery that she made shortly after  the hot weather had made the houses beneath the hill more close and unwholesome than ever simkinss wife had fallen into a lingering illness and albinia visiting her constantly was painfully sensible of the dreadful atmosphere in which she lived under the roof with a window that would not open she offered to have the house improved at her own expense but was told that mr pettilove would raise the rent if anything were laid out on it  she went about talking indignantly of mr pettiloves cruelty and rapacity and when mr dusautoy hinted that pettilove was only agent she exclaimed that the owner was worse since ignorance alone could be excused  who was the wretch  some one no doubt who never came near the place and only thought of it as money  fanny said mr dusautoy i really think we ought to tell her  yes said mrs dusautoy i think it would be better  the houses belonged to old mr meadows  oh if they are mrs meadowss i dont wonder at anything  i believe they are gilbert kendals  they were very kind mr dusautoy strode out at the window and his wife would not look at albinia during the minutes struggle to regain her composure under the mortification that her husband should have let her rave so much and so long about what must be in his own power her only comfort was the hope that he had never heard what she said and she knew that he so extremely disliked a conference with pettilove that he would consent to anything rather than have a discussion  she was for the first time in her life out of spirits  gilbert was always upon her mind and the daily walk to meet him was a burthen consuming a great deal of time and becoming trying on hot summer afternoons the more so as she seldom ventured to rest after it lest dulness should drive gilbert into mischief or if nothing worse into quarrelling with sophia  if she could not send him safely out fishing she must be at hand to invent pleasures and occupations for him and the worst of it was that the girls grudged her attention to their brother and were becoming jealous  they hated the walk to robbles leigh and she knew that it was hard on them that their pleasure should be sacrificed but it was allimportant to preserve him from evil  she had wished to keep the tutornegotiations a secret but they had oozed out and she found that mrs and miss meadows had been declaring that they had known how it would be whatever people said beforehand it always came to the same thing in the end and as to its being necessary poor dear gibbie was very different before the change at home  albinia could not help shedding a few bitter tears  why was she to be always misjudged even when she meant the best  and oh how hard wellnigh impossible to forgive and candidly to believe that in the old lady at least it was partiality and not spite  in september mr and mrs ferrars returned from their journey albinia was anxious to see them for if there was a sense that she had fallen short of her confident hopes of doing prosperously there was also a great desire for their sympathy and advice  but maurice had been too long away from his parish to be able to spare another day and begged that the kendals would come to fairmead  seeing that albinias heart was set on it mr kendal allowed himself to be stirred up to appoint a time for driving her over to spend a long day at fairmead  for her own pleasure and ease of mind albinia made a point of taking gilbert and the girls were to spend the day with their grandmother  pretty old fairmead she cried as the beechtrees rose before her and she was turning round every minute to point out to gilbert some of the spots of which she had told him and nodding to the few scattered children who were not at school and who looked up with mouths from ear to ear and flushed cheeks as they curtsied to miss ferrars  the miss ferrars life seemed long ago  they came to the little green gate that led to what had been home for the happiest years of albinias life and from the ivy porch there was a rush of little willie and mary and close at hand their mamma and maurice emerging from the school  it was very joyous and natural  but there were two more figures not youthful but of decided style and air and quiet but fashionable dress and albinia had only time to say quickly to her husband my aunts before she was fondly embraced  it was not at all what she had intended  mrs annesley and miss ferrars were very kind aunts and she had much affection for them but there was an end of the hope of the unreserve and confidence that she wanted  she could get plenty of compassion and plenty of advice but her whole object would be to avoid these and besides mr kendal had not bargained for strangers  what would become of his opportunity of getting better acquainted with maurice and winifred and of all the pleasures that she had promised gilbert  at least however she was proud that her aunts should see what a finelooking man her husband was and they were evidently struck with his appearance and manner  gilbert too was in very good looks and was altogether a bright gentlemanly boy well made though with the air of growing too fast and with something of uncertainty about his expression  it was quickly explained that the aunts had only decided two days before on coming to fairmead at once some other engagement having failed them and they were delighted to find that they should meet their dear albinia and be introduced to mr kendal  setting off before the post came in albinia had missed winifreds note to tell her of their arrival  and said winifred as she took albinia upstairs if i did suspect that would be the case i wont say i regretted it  i did not wish to afford mr kendal the pleasures of anticipation  perhaps it was better said albinia smiling especially as i suppose they will stay for the next six weeks so that the days will be short before you will be free  and now let me see you my pretty one said winifred fondly  are you well are you strong  no dont wriggle your head away i shall believe nothing but what i read for myself  dont believe anything you read without the notes said albinia i have a great deal to say to you but i dont expect much opportunity thereof  certainly not for miss ferrars was knocking at the door  she had never been able to suppose that the sistersinlaw could be more to each other than she was to her own niece  so it became a regular specimen of a long day spent together by relations who intending to be very happy make themselves very weary of each other by discarding ordinary occupations and reducing themselves to needlework and small talk  albinia was bent on liveliness and excelled herself in her droll observations but to winifred who knew her so well this brilliancy did not seem like perfect ease it was more like effort than natural spirits  this was no wonder for not only had the sight of new people thrown mr kendal into a severe access of shyness and silence but he was revolving in fear and dread the expediency of asking them to willow lawn and considering whether albinia and propriety could make the effort bearable  silent he sat while the aunts talked of their wishes that one nephew would marry and that the other would not and no one presumed to address him except little mary who would keep trotting up to him to make him drink out of her dolls teacups  mr ferrars took pity on him and took him and gilbert out to call upon colonel bury but this did not lessen his wifes difficulties for there was a general expectation that she would proceed to confidences whereas she would do nothing but praise the dusautoys ask after all the parishioners of fairmead one by one and consult about french readingbooks and italian grammars  mrs annesley began a gentle warning against overtaxing her strength and miss ferrars enforced it with such vehemence that winifred who had been rather on that side began to take albinias part but perceived with some anxiety that her sisters attempts to laugh off the admonition almost amounted to an admission that she was working very hard  as to the stepdaughters no intelligence was attainable except that lucy would be pleased with a new crochet pattern and that sophy was like her father but not so handsome  the next division of time passed better  albinia walked out at the window to meet the gentlemen when they came home and materially relieved mr kendals mind by saying to him the aunts are settled in here till they go to knutsford  i hope you dont thinkthere is not the least occasion for asking them to stay with us  are you sure you do not wish it said mr kendal with great kindness but an evident weight removed  most certain she exclaimed with full sincerity i am not at all ready for them  what should i do with them to entertain  very well said mr kendal you must be the judge  if there be no necessity i shall be glad to avoid unsettling our habits and probably bayford would hardly afford much enjoyment to your aunts  albinia glanced in his face and in that of her brother with her own arch fun  it was the first time that day that maurice had seen that peculiarly merry look and he rejoiced but he was not without fear that she was fostering mr kendals retiring habits more than was good for him  but it was not only on his account that she avoided the invitation she by no means wished to show bayford to her fastidious aunts and felt as if to keep them satisfied and comfortable would be beyond her power  set free from this dread and his familiarity with his brotherinlaw renewed mr kendal came out to great advantage at the early dinner miss ferrars was well read and used to literary society and she started subjects on which he was at home and they discussed new books and criticised critics so that his deep reading showed itself and even a grave quiet tone of satire such as was seldom developed except under the most favourable circumstances  he and aunt gertrude were evidently so well pleased with each other that albinia almost thought she had been precipitate in letting him off the visit  gilbert had fortunately a turn for small children and submitted to be led about the garden by little willie and as far as moderate enjoyment went the visit was not unsuccessful but as for what albinia came for it was unattainable except for one little space alone with her brother  i meant to have asked a great deal she said sighing  if you want me i would contrive to ride over said maurice  no it is not worth that  but maurice what is to be done when one sees ones duty and yet fails for ever for want of tact and temper ah i know what you will say and i often say it to myself but whatever i propose i always do either the wrong thing or in the wrong way  you fall a hundred times a day but are raised up again said maurice  maurice tell me one thing  is it wrong to do not the best but only the best one can  it is the wrong common to us all said maurice  i used to believe in whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well  now i do everything ill rather than do nothing at all  there are only two ways of avoiding that  and they are  either doing nothing or admiring all your own doings  which do you recommend said albinia smiling but not far from tears  my dear said maurice all i can dare to recommend is patience and selfcontrol  dont fret and agitate yourself about what you cant do but do your best to do calmly what you can  it will be made up depend upon it  there was no time for more but the sound counsel the sympathy and playfulness had done albinia wonderful good and she was almost glad there had been no more privacy or her friends might have guessed that she had not quite found a counsellor at home     chapter vi    the christmas holidays did indeed put an end to the walks to meet gilbert but only so as to make albinia feel responsible for him all day long and uneasy whenever he was not accounted for  she played chess with him found books and racked her brains to seek amusements for him but knowing all the time that it was hopeless to expect a boy of fourteen to be satisfied with them  one or two boys of his age had come home for the holidays and she tried to be relieved by being told that he was going out with dick wolfe or harry osborn but it was not quite satisfactory and she began to look fagged and unwell and had lost so much of her playfulness that even mr kendal was alarmed  sophias birthday fell in the last week before christmas and it had always been the family custom to drink tea with mrs meadows albinia made the engagement with a sense of virtuous resignation though not feeling well enough for the infliction but mr kendal put a stop to all notion of her going  she expected to enjoy her quiet solitary evening but the result was beyond her hopes for as she was wishing gilbert goodbye she heard the click of the study lock and in came mr kendal  i thought you were gone she said  no  i did not like to leave you alone for a whole evening  if it were only an excuse to himself for avoiding the meadows party it was too prettily done for the notion to occur to his wife and never had she spent a happier evening  he was so unusually tender and unreserved so desirous to make her comfortable and what was far more to her growing into so much confidence that it was even better than what she used last year to picture to herself as her future life with him  it even came to what he had probably never done for any one  she spoke of a beautiful old latin hymn which she had once read with her brother and had never seen adequately translated and he fetched a manuscript book where written out with unrivalled neatness stood a translation of his own made many years ago full of scholarly polish  she ventured to ask leave to copy it i will copy it for you he said but it must be for yourself alone  she was grateful for the concession and happy in the promise  she begged to turn the page and it was granted  there were other translations chiefly from curious oriental sources and there were about twenty original poems elaborated in the same exquisite manner and with a deep melancholy strain of thought and power of beautiful description that she thought finer and more touching than almost anything she had read  and these are all locked up for ever  no one has seen them  so  when i was a young lad my poor father put some lines of mine into a newspaper  that sufficed me and he shut the clasped book as if repenting of having revealed the contents  no i was not thinking of anything you would dislike with regard to those verses  i dont like to let in the world on things precious but how could she venture so far i was thinking how many powers and talents are shut up in that study and whether they might not have been meant for more  i beg your pardon if i ought not to say so  the time is past he replied without displeasure my youth is gone and with it the enterprise and hopefulness that can press forward insensible to annoyance  you should have married a man with freshness and energy more responsive to your own  oh edmund that is a severe reproach for my impertinent speech  you must not expect too much from me he continued  i told you that i was a broken griefstricken man and you were content to be my comforter  would that i could be so exclaimed albinia but to try faithfully i must say what is on my mind  dear edmund if you would only look out of your books and see how much good you could do here in your own sphere how much the right wants strengthening how much evil cries out to be repressed how sadly your own poor sufferoh if you once began you would be so much happier  she trembled with earnestness and with fear of her own audacity but a resounding knock at the door prevented her from even discovering whether he were offended  he started away to secure his book and the two girls came in  albinia could hardly believe it late enough for their return but they accounted for having come rather earlier by saying that gilbert had been making himself so ridiculous when he had come at last that grandmamma had sent him home  at last said albinia  he set off only ten minutes after you as soon as he found that papa was not coming  all i know said lucy is that he did not come till halfpast nine and said he had come from home  and where can he be now  gone to bed growled sophy  i dont know what he has been doing said lucy who since the suspicion of favouritism had seemed to find especial pleasure in bringing forward her brothers faults but he came in laughing like a ploughboy and talking perfect nonsense  and when aunt maria spoke to him he answered quite rudely that he wasnt going to be questioned and called to order he had enough of petticoat government at home  no said sophy breaking in with ungracious reluctance as if against her will conveying some comfort to her stepmother for the sake of truth what he said was that if he bore with petticoat government at home it was because mrs kendal was pretty and kind and didnt torment him out of his life for nothing and what he stood from her he would not stand from any other woman  but sophy i am sure he did say mrs kendal knew what she was going to say and said it and it was worth hearing and he laughed in aunt marias face and told her not to make so many bites at a cherry  he must have been beside himself said albinia in a bewilderment of consternation but mr kendals return put a stop to all for the sisters never told tales before him and she would not bring the subject under his notice until she should be better informed  his suffering was too great his wrath too stern to be excited without serious cause but she spent a wakeful anxious night revolving all imaginable evils into which the boy could have fallen and perplexing herself what measures to take feeling all the more grieved and bound to him by the preference that even in this dreadful mood he had expressed for her  she fell into a restless sleep in the morning from which she wakened so late as to have no time to question gilbert before breakfast  on coming down she found that he had not made his appearance and had sent word that he had a bad headache and wanted no breakfast  his father who had made a visit of inspection said he thought it was passing off smiling as he observed upon mrs meadowss mincepie suppers and homemade wine  lucy said nothing but glanced knowingly at her sister and at albinia from neither of whom did she get any response  albinia did not dare to take any measures till mr kendal had ridden out and then she went up and knocked at gilberts door  he was better he said and was getting up he would be downstairs presently  she watched for him as he came down looking still very pale and unwell  she took him into her room made him sit by the fire and get a little life and warmth into his chilled hands before she spoke  yes gilbert i dont wonder you cannot lift up your head while so much is on your mind  gilbert started and hid his face  did you think i did not know and was not grieved  well he cried peevishly im sure i have the most illnatured pair of sisters in the world  then you meant to deceive us again gilbert  he had relapsed into the old habitas usual a burst of tears and a declaration that no one was ever so badly off and he did not know what to do  you do know perfectly well what to do gilbert  there is nothing for it but to tell me the whole meaning of this terrible affair and i will see whether i can help you  it was always the same round a few words would always bring the confession and that pitiful kind of helpless repentance which had only too often given her hope  gilbert assured her that he had fully purposed following his sisters but that on the way he had unluckily fallen in with archie tritton and a friend who had driven in to hear a man from london singing comic songs at the kings head and they had persuaded him to come in  he had been uneasy and tried to get away but the dread of being laughed at about his grandmothers tea had prevailed and he had been supping on oysters and porter and trying to believe himself a fast man till archie who had assured him that he was himself going home in no time had found it expedient to set off and it had been agreed that he should put a bold face on it and profess that he had never intended to do more than come and fetch his sisters home  that the porter had anything to do with his extraordinary manner to his grandmother and aunt was so shocking a notion and the very hint made him cry so bitterly and protest so earnestly that he had only had one pint which he did not like and only drank because he was afraid of being teased that albinia was ready to believe that he had been so elevated by excitement as to forget himself and continue the style of the company he had left  it was bad enough and she felt almost overpowered by the contemplation of the lamentable weakness of the poor boy of the consequences and of what was incumbent on her  she leant back and considered a little while then sighed heavily and said gilbert two things must be done  you must make an apology to your grandmother and aunt and you must confess the whole to your father  he gave a sort of howl as if she were misusing his confidence  it must be she said  if you are really sorry you will not shrink  i do not believe that it could fail to come to your fathers knowledge even if i did not know it was my duty to tell him and how much better to confess it yourself  for this however gilbert seemed to have no force he cried piteously bewailed himself vowed incoherently that he would never do so again and if she had not pitied him so much would have made her think him contemptible  she was inexorable as to having the whole told though dreading the confession scarcely less than he did and he finally made a virtue of necessity and promised to tell if only she would not desert him declaring with a fresh flood of tears that he should never do wrong when she was by  then came the apology  it was most necessary and he owned that it would be much better to be able to tell his father that his grandmother had forgiven him but he really had not nerve to set out alone and albinia who had begun to dread having him out of sight consented to go and protect him  he shrank behind her and she had to bear the flood of marias surprises and regrets before she could succeed in saying that he was very sorry for yesterdays improper behaviour and had come to ask pardon  grandmamma was placable gilberts white face and red eyes were pleading enough and she was distressed at mrs kendal having come out looking pale and tired  if she had been alone the only danger would have been that the offence would be lost in petting but maria had been personally wounded and the jealousy she already felt of the stepmother had been excited to the utmost by gilberts foolish words  she was excessively grieved and a great deal more angry with mrs kendal than with gilbert and the want of justification for this feeling together with her great excitement distress and embarrassment made her attempts to be dry and dignified ludicrously abortive  she really seemed to have lost the power of knowing what she said  she was glad mrs kendal could walk up this morning since she could not come at night  it was not my fault said albinia earnestly mr kendal forbade me  i am sure i wish we had come  the old lady would have said something kind about not reproaching herself but miss meadows interposed with it was very unlucky to be suremr kendal never failed them before not that she would wishbut she had always understood that to let young people run about late in the evening by themselvesnot that she meant anything but it was very unfortunateif she had only been awarebetty should have come down to walk up with them  gilbert could not forbear an ashamed smile of intense affront at this reproach to his manliness  it was exceedingly unfortunate said albinia trying to repress her vexation but gilbert must learn to have resolution to guard himself  and now that he is come to ask your forgiveness will you not grant it to him  oh yes yes certainly i forgive him from my heart  yes gilbert i do only you must mind and bewareit is a very shocking thinglow company and all thatyouve made yourself look as illand if you knew what a cake betty had madealmond and citron bothbut its for master gilbert she said and i dont grudgeand then to thinkoh dear  albinia tried to express for him some becoming sorrow at having disappointed so much kindness but she brought miss meadows down on her again  oh yesshe grudged nothingbut she never expected to meet with gratitudeshe was quite prepared and she swallowed and almost sobbed there had been changes  she was ready to make every excuse she was sure she had done her bestbut she understoodshe didnt want to be assured  it always happened soshe knew her homely ways were not what mrs kendal had been used toand she didnt wonder she only hoped the dear children and she was absolutely crying  my dear maria said her mother soothingly you have worked yourself into such a state that you dont know what you are saying you must not let mrs kendal think that we dont know that she is leading the dear children to all that is right and kind towards as  oh no i dont accuse any one  only if they like to put me down under their feet and trample on me they are welcome  thats all i have to say  albinia was too much annoyed to be amused and said as she rose to take leave i think it would be better for gilbert as well as for ourselves if we were to say no more till some more cool and reasonable moment  i am as cool as possible said miss meadows convulsively clutching her hand im not excited  dont excite yourself mrs kendalit is very bad for you  tell her not mammaoh no dont be excited i mean nothingi forgive poor dear gibbie whatever little mattersi know there was excuseboys with unsettled homesbut pray dont go and excite yourselfyou see how cool i am  and she pursued albinia to the gardengate recommending her at every step not to be excited for she was as cool as possible trembling and stammering all the time with flushed cheeks and tears in her eyes  i wonder who she thinks is excited exclaimed albinia as they finally turned their backs on her  it was hardly in human nature to help making the observation but it was not prudent  gilbert took licence to laugh and say aunt maria is beside herself  i never heard anything so absurd or unjust cried albinia too much irritated to remember anything but the sympathy of her auditor  if i am to be treated in this manner i have done striving to please them  due respect shall be shown but as to intimacy and confidence  im glad you see it so at last cried gilbert  aunt maria has been the plague of my life and im glad i told her a bit of my mind  what was albinias consternation  her moments petulance had undone her mornings work  gilbert she said we are both speaking very wrongly  i especially who ought to have helped you  spite of all succeeding humility the outburst had been fatal and argue and plead as she might she could not restore the boy to anything like the half satisfactory state of penitence in which she had led him from home  the giving way to her worse nature had awakened his and though he still allowed that she should prepare the way for his confession to his father all real sense of his outrageous conduct towards his aunt was gone  disheartened and worn out albinia did not feel equal even to going to take off her walking things but sat down in the drawingroom on the sofa and tried to silence the girls questions and chatter by desiring lucy to read aloud  byandby mr kendal was heard returning and she rose to arrest him in the hall  her looks began the story for he exclaimed my dear albinia what is the matter  oh edmund i have such things to tell you  i have been doing so wrong  she was almost sobbing and he spoke fondly  no albinia i can hardly believe that  something has vexed you and you must take time to compose yourself  he led her up to her own room tried to soothe her and would not listen to a word till she should be calm  after lying still for a little while she thought she had recovered but the very word gilbert brought such an expression of anxiety and sternness over his brow as overcame her again and she could not speak without so much emotion that he silenced her and finding that she could neither leave the subject nor mention it without violent agitation he said he would leave her for a little while and perhaps she might sleep and then be better able to speak to him  still she held him and begged that he would say nothing to gilbert till he had heard her and to pacify her he yielded passed his promise and quitted her with a kiss     chapter vii    there was a messenger at fairmead parsonage by sunrise the next morning and by twelve oclock mr and mrs ferrars were at willow lawn  mr kendals grave brow and depressed manner did not reassure winifred as he met her in the hall although his words were i hope she is doing well  he said no more for the drawingroom door was moving to and fro as if uneasy on the hinges and as he made a step towards it it disclosed a lady with black eyes and pinched features whom he presented as miss meadows  well nowi thinksince more efficientsince i leave mrs kendal to betteronly pray tell hermy love and my mothersif i could have been of any useor shall i remaincould i be of any service edmundi would not intrude whenbut in the houseif i could be of any further use  of none thank you said mr kendal unless you would be kind enough to take home the girls  oh papa cried lucy ive got the keys  you wont be able to get on at all without me  sophy may go but i could not be spared  let it be as you will said mr kendal i only desire quiet and that you should not inconvenience mrs ferrars  you will help me will you not said winifred smiling though she did not augur well from this opening scene  may i go soon to albinia  presently i hope said mr kendal with an uneasy glance towards miss meadows she has seen no one as yet and she is so determined that you cannot come till after christmas that she does not expect you  miss meadows began one of her tangled skeins of words the most tangible of which was excitement and mr kendal knowing by long experience that the only chance of a conclusion was to let her run herself down held his tongue and she finally departed  then he breathed more freely and said he would go and prepare albinia to see her sister desiring lucy to show mrs ferrars to her room and to take care not to talk upon the stairs  this lucy who was in high glory obeyed by walking upon creaking tiptoe apparently borrowed from her aunt and whispering at a wonderful rate about her eagerness to see dear dear mamma and the darling little brother  the spare room did not look expectant of guests and felt still less so  it struck winifred as very like the mouth of a well and the paper showed patches of ancient damp  one maid was hastily laying the fire the other shaking out the curtains in the endeavour to render it habitable and lucy began saying i must apologize  if papa had only given us notice that we were to have the pleasure of seeing you and then she dashed at the maid in all the pleasure of authority  eweretta go and bring up mrs ferrarss trunks directly and some water and some towels  winifred thought the greatest mercy to the hunted maid would be to withdraw as soon as she had hastily thrown off bonnet and cloak and lucy followed her into the passage repeating that papa was so absent and forgetful that it was very inconvenient in making arrangements whatever was ordinarily repressed in her was repaying itself with interest in the pleasure of acting as mistress of the house  mrs ferrars beheld gilbert sitting listlessly on the deep windowseat at the end of the passage resting his head on his hand  well exclaimed lucy if he is not there still  he has hardly stirred since breakfast  come and speak to mrs ferrars gilbert or and she simpered shall it be aunt winifred  as you please said mrs ferrars advancing towards her old acquaintance whom she would hardly have recognised so different was the pale downcast slouching figure from the bright handsome lad she remembered  how cold your hand is she exclaimed you should not sit in this cold passage  as i have been telling him all this morning said lucy  how is she whispered the boy rousing himself to look imploringly in winifreds face  your father seems satisfied about her  at that moment a door at some distance was opened and gilbert seemed to thrill all over as for the moment ere it closed a babys cry was heard  he turned his face away and rested it on the window  my brother my brother he murmured but at that moment his father turned the corner of the passage saying that albinia had heard their arrival and was very eager to see her sister  still winifred could not leave the boy without saying you can make gilbert happy about her can you not  he is waiting here watching anxiously for news of her  gilbert himself best knows whether he has a right to be made happy said mr kendal gravely  i promised to ask no questions till she is able to explain but i much fear that he has been causing her great grief and distress  he fixed his eyes on his son and winifred in the belief that she was better out of their way hurried to albinias room and was seen very little all the rest of the day  she was spared however to walk to church the next morning with her husband lucy showing them the way and being quiet and agreeable when repressed by mr ferrarss presence  after church mr dusautoy overtook them to inquire after mrs kendal and to make a kind proposal of exchanging sunday duty  he undertook to drive the ponies home on the morrow begged for credentials for the clerk and messages for willie and mary and seemed highly pleased with the prospect of the holiday as he called it only entreating that mrs ferrars would be so kind as to look in on fanny if mrs kendal could spare her  i thought said winifred to her husband that you would rather have exchanged a sunday when albinia is better able to enjoy you  that may yet be but poor kendal is so much depressed that i do not like to leave him  i have no patience with him cried winifred he does not seem to take the slightest pleasure in his baby and he will hardly let poor albinia do so either  do you know maurice it is as bad as i ever feared it would be  no dont stop me i must have it out  i always said he had no business to victimize her and i am sure of it now  i believe this gloom of his has broken down her own dear sunny spirits there she isso unlike herselfso anxious and fidgety about her babywill hardly take any ones word for his being as healthy and stout a child as i ever saw  and then every other moment she is restless about that boyalways asking where he is or what he is doing  i dont see how she is ever to get well while it goes on in this way  mr kendal told me that gilbert had been worrying and distressing her and as to those girls the eldest of them is intolerable with her airs and the youngesti asked her if she liked babies and she growled no  lucy said gilbert was waiting in the passage for news of mamma and she grunted all sham and thats the whole i have heard of her  he is bad enough in himself but with such a train  my poor albinia  if they are not the death of her it will be lucky  well done winifred  but maurice said his impetuous wife in a curiously altered tone are not you very unhappy about albinia  i shall leave you to find that out for me  then you are not  i think kendal thoroughly values and appreciates her and is very uncomfortable without her  i suppose so  people do miss a maidofallwork  i should not so much mind it if she had been only his slave but to be so to all those disagreeable children of his too  and with so little effect why cant he send them all to school  propose that to albinia  she did want the boy to go somewhere  i should not care where so it were out of her way  what creatures they must be for her to have produced no more effect on them  poor albinia  i am afraid it is a hard task but these are still early days and we see things at a disadvantage  we shall be able to judge whether there be really too great a strain on her spirits and if so i would talk to kendal  and i wonder what is to come of that  it seems to me like what john smith calls singing psalms to a dead horse  john smith  i am glad you mentioned him i shall desire dusautoy to bring him here on monday  what as poor albinia would say you cant exist a week without john smith  even so  i want him to lay out a plan for draining the garden that pond is intolerable  i suspect that all yourself included will become far more goodtempered in consequence  a capital measure but do you mean that edmund kendal is going to let you and john smith drain his pond under his very nose and never find it out  i did not imagine him quite come to that  not quite said maurice it is with his free consent and i believe he will be very glad to have it done without any trouble to himself  he said that albinia thought it damp and when i put a few sanatory facts before him thanked me heartily and seemed quite relieved  if they had only been in sanscrit they would have made the greater impression  one comfort is maurice that however provoking you are at first you generally prove yourself reasonable at last i am glad you are not mr kendal  ah it will have a fine effect on you to spend your christmasday teteatete with him  mrs ferrarss views underwent various modifications like all hasty yet candid judgments  she took mr kendal into favour when she found him placidly submitting to miss meadowss showers of words in order to prevent her gaining access to his wife  maria meadows is a very wellmeaning person he said afterwards but i know of no worse infliction in a sickroom  i wonder thought winifred whether he married to get rid of her i should have thought it justifiable had it been any one but albinia  the call on mrs dusautoy was consoling  it was delightful to find how albinia was loved and valued at the vicarage  mrs dusautoy began by sending her as a message johns first exclamation on hearing of the event  then she will never be of any more use  in fact she said it was much to him like having a curate disabled and she believed he could only be consoled by the hopes of a pattern christening and of a nursery for his schoolgirls but there winifred shook her head fairmead had a prior claim and albinia had long had her eye upon a scholar of her own  i told john that she would and he must bear it as he can laughed mrs dusautoy and she went on more seriously to say that her gratitude was beyond expression not merely for the actual help though that was much but for the sympathy the first encouragement they had met among their richer parishioners and she spoke of the refreshment of the mirthfulness and playful manner so as to convince winifred that they had neither died away nor been everywhere wasted  winifred had no amenable patient  weak and depressed as albinia was her restlessness and air of anxiety could not be appeased  there was a look of being constantly on the watch and once when her door was ajar before winifred was aware she exerted her voice to call gilbert  pushing the door just wide enough to enter and treading almost noiselessly he came forward looking from side to side as with a sense of guilt  she stretched out her hand and smiled and he obeyed the movement that asked him to bend and kiss her but still durst not speak  let me have the baby she said  mrs ferrars laid it beside her and held aloof  gilberts eyes were fixed intently on it  yes gilbert albinia said i know what you will feel for him  he cant be what you once hadbut oh gilbert you will do all that an elder brother can to make him like edmund  gilbert wrung her fingers and ventured to stoop down to kiss the little red forehead  the tears were running down his cheeks and he could not speak  if your father might only say the same of him that he never grieved him said albinia but oh gilbertexample and then pausing and gazing searchingly in his face you have not told papa  no whispered gilbert  winifred said albinia would you be so kind as to ask papa to come  winifred was forced to obey though feeling much to blame as mr kendal rose with a sigh of uneasiness  gilbert still stood with his hand clasped in albinias and she held it while her weak voice made the full confession for him and assured his father of his shame and sorrow  there needed no such assurance his whole demeanour had been sorrow all these dreary days and mr kendal could not but forgive though his eye spoke deep grief  i could not refuse pardon thus asked he said  oh gilbert that i could hope this were the beginning of a new course  albinia looked from gilbert to his little brother and back again to gilbert  it shall be she said and gilberts resolution was perhaps the more sincere that he spoke no word  poor boy said albinia half to herself and half aloud i think i feel more strong to love and to help him  that interview was a dangerous experiment and she suffered for it as her brother said instead of having too little life she had too much and could not let herself rest she had never cultivated the art of being still and when she was weak she could not be calm  still the strength of her constitution staved off the nervous fever of her spirits and though she was not at all a comfortable patient she made a certain degree of progress so that though it was not easy to call her better she was not quite so ill and grew less irrational in her solicitude and more open to other ideas  do you know winifred she said one day i have been thinking myself at fairmead till i almost believed i heard john smiths voice under the window  winifred was obliged to look out at the window to hide her smile maurice who was standing on the lawn with the very john smith beckoned to her and she went down to hear his plans  he was wanted at home the next day and asked whether she thought he had better take gilbert with him  it is the wisest thing that has been said yet exclaimed she  now i shall have a chance for albinia and accordingly mr kendal having given a gracious and grateful consent albinia was informed but winifred thought her almost perverse when a perturbed look came over her and she said it is very kind in maurice but i must speak to him  he was struck by the worn restless expression of her features so unlike the calm contented repose of a young mother and when she spoke to him her first word was of gilbert  maurice it is so kind i know you will make him happybut oh take carehe is so delicateindeed he isdont let him get wet through  maurice promised but albinia resumed with minutiae of directions ending with oh if he should get hurt or into any mischief what should we do  pray take care maurice you are not used to such delicate boys  my dear i think you may rely on me  yes but you will not be too strict with him and more was following when her brother said i promise you to make him my special charge  i like the boy very much  i think you may be reasonable and trust him with me without so much agitation  you have not let me see my own nephew yet  albinia looked with her wistful piteous face at her brother as he took in his arms her noblelooking fair infant  you are a great fellow indeed sir said his uncle  now if i were your mamma i would be proud of you rather than  i am afraid said albinia in a sudden low whisper  he looked at her anxiously  let me have him she said then as maurice bent over her and she hastily gathered the babe into her arms she whispered in quick low faint accents do you know how many children have been born in this house  mr ferrars understood her he too had seen the catalogue in the church and guessed that the phantoms of her boys dead brethren dwelt on her imagination forbidding her to rejoice in him hopefully he tried to say something encouraging of the childs appearance but she would not let him go on  i know she said he is so now but then catching her breath again and speaking very low his father does not dare look at himi see that he is sorry for me oh maurice it will come and i shall be able to do nothing  maurice felt his lip quivering as his sisters voice became chokedthe sister to whom he had once been the whole world and who still could pour out her inmost heart more freely to him than to any other  but it was a time for grave authority and though he spoke gently it was almost sternly  albinia this is not right  it is not thankful or trustful  no do not cry but listen to me  your child is as likely to do well as any child in the world but nothing is so likely to do him harm as your want of composure  i tell myself so said albinia but there is no helping it  yes there is  make it your duty to keep yourself still and not be troubled about what may or may not happen but be glad of the present pleasure  dont you think i am said albinia half smiling so glad that i grow frightened at myself and as if fain to leave the subject she added and it is what you dont understand maurice but he cant be the first to edmund as he is to meneverand when i get almost jealous for him i think of gilbert and the girlsand oh there is so much to do for themthey want a mother so muchand winifred wont let me see them or tell me about them  she had grown piteous and incoherent and a glance from winifred told him this is always the way  my dear he said you will never be fit to attend to them if you do not use this present time rightly  you may hurt your health and still more certainly you will go to work fretfully and impetuously if you have a busy life the more reason to learn to be tranquil calm is forced on you now and if you give way to useless nervous brooding over the work you are obliged to lay aside for a time you have no right to hope that you will either have judgment or temper for your tasks  but how am i to keep from thinking maurice  the weaker i am the more i think  are you dutiful as to what winifred there thinks wisest  ah albinia you want to learn as poor queen anne of austria did that docility in illness may be selfresignation into higher hands perhaps you despise it but it is no mean exercise of strength and resolution to be still  albinia looked at him as if receiving a new idea  and he added bending nearer her face and speaking lower when you pray let them be hearty faithful prayers that gods hand may be over your childyour children not halfhearted faithless ones that he may work out your will in them  oh maurice how did you know  but you are not going  i have so much to talk over with you  yes i must go and you must be still  indeed i will watch over gilbert as though he were mine  yes even more  dont speak again albinia i desire you will not  goodbye  that lecture had been the most wholesome treatment she had yet received she ceased to give way without effort to restless thoughts and cares and was much less refractory  when at last lucy and sophia were admitted winifred found perils that she had not anticipated  lucy was indeed supremely and girlishly happy but it was sophy whose eye albinia sought with anxiety and that eye was averted  her cheek was cold like that of a doll when albinia touched it eagerly with her lips and when lucy admonished her to kiss the dear little brother she fairly turned and ran out of the room  poor sophy said lucy  never mind her mamma but she is odder than ever since baby has been born  when eweretta came up and told us she hid her face and cried and when grandmamma wanted to make us promise to love him with all our hearts and not make any difference she would only say i wont  we will leave him to take care of that lucy said albinia  but though she spoke cheerfully winifred was not surprised after a little interval to hear sounds like stifled weeping  almost every home subject was so dangerous that whenever mrs ferrars wanted to make cheerful innocent conversation she began to talk of her visit to ireland and the beautiful galway coast and the omores of ballymakilty till albinia grew quite sick of the names of the whole clan of thirtysix cousins and thought with her aunts that winifred was too irish  yet at any other time the histories would have made her sometimes laugh and sometimes cry but the world was sadly out of joint with her  there was a sudden change when for the first time her eye rested on the lawn and she beheld the work of drainage  the light glanced in her eye the colour rose on her cheek and she exclaimed how kind of edmund  winifred must needs give her husband his share  ah you would never have had it done without maurice  yes said albinia edmund has been out of the way of such things but he consented you know  then as her eyes grew liquid a duck pond is a funny subject for sentiment but oh if you knew what that place has been to my imagination from the first and how the wreaths of mist have wound themselves into spectres in my dreams and stretched out white shrouds now for one now for the other and she shuddered  and you have gone through all this and never spoken  no wonder your nerves and spirits were tried  i did speak at first said albinia but i thought edmund did not hear or thought it nonsense and so did i at times  but you see he did attend he always does you see at the right time  it was only my impatience  i suspect maurice and john smith had more to do with it said winifred  well we wont quarrel about that said albinia  i only know that whoever brought it about has taken the heaviest weight off my mind that has been there yet  in truth the terror half real half imaginary had been a sorer burthen than all the positive cares for those unruly children or their silent melancholy father and the relief told in all ways above all in the peace with which she began to regard her child still she would provoke winifred by bestowing all her gratitude on mr kendal who began to be persuaded that he had made an heroic exertion  winifred had been somewhat scandalized by discovering albinias deficiencies in the furniture development  she was too active and stirring and too fond of outofdoor occupation to regard interior decoration as one of the domestic graces her nest was rather that of the ostrich than the chaffinch as winifred told her on the discovery that her morningroom had been used for no other purpose than as a deposit for all the books wedding presents lumber etc which she had never had leisure to arrange  you might be more civil answered albinia  remember that the ringdove never made half such a fuss about her nest as the magpie  well i am glad you have found some likeness in yourself to a dove rejoined winifred  mrs ferrars set vigorously to work with lucy and rendered the room so pretty and pleasant that lucy pronounced that it must be called nothing but the boudoir for it was a perfect little bijou  albinia was laid on the sofa by the sparkling fire by her side the little cot and in her hand a most happy affectionate letter from gilbert detailing the fairmead christmas festivities  she felt the invigoration of change of room admired and was grateful for winifreds work and looked so fair and bright so tranquil and so contented that her sister and husband could not help pausing to contemplate her as an absolutely new creature in a state of quiescence  it did not last long and mrs ferrars felt herself the unwilling culprit  attracted by sounds in the hall she found the two girls receiving from the hands of genevieve durant a pretty basket choicely adorned with sprays of myrtle saying mamma would be much obliged and they would take it up at once genevieve should take home her basket and down plunged their hands regardless of the garniture  genevieves disappointed look caught winifreds attention and springing forward she exclaimed you shall come to mrs kendal yourself my dear  she must see your pretty basket and yourself she could have added as she met the grateful glitter of the dark eyes  lucy remonstrated that mamma had seen no one yet not even aunt maria but mrs ferrars would not listen and treading airily yet with reverence that would have befitted a royal palace genevieve was ushered upstairs and with heartfelt sweetness and timid grace presented her etrennes  under the fragrant sprays lay a small whitepaper parcel tied with narrow blue satin bows such as no english fingers could accomplish and within was a little frockbody exquisitely embroidered with a breastplate of actual point lace in a pattern like frostwork on the windows  it was such work as madame belmarche had learnt in a convent in times of history and poor little genevieve had almost worn out her black eyes on this piece of homage to her dear mrs kendal grieving only that she had not been able to add the length of robe needed to complete her gift  albinias kiss was recompense beyond her dreams and she fairly cried for joy when she was told that she should come and help to dress the babe in it for his christening  mrs ferrars would walk out with her at once to buy a sufficiency of cambric for the mighty skirts  that visit was indeed nothing but pleasure but mrs ferrars had not calculated on contingencies and family punctilios  she forgot that it would be a mortal offence to let in any one rather than miss meadows but the rest of the family were so well aware of it that when she returned she heard a perfect sparrowsnest of voiceslucys pert and eager miss meadowss injured and shrill and albinias alas thin and loud half sarcasm half fret  there sat aunt maria fidgeting in the armchair lucy stood by the fire albinias countenance sadly different from what it had been in the morningweary impatient and excited all that it ought not to be  winifred would have cleared the room at once but this was not easy and poor albinia was so far gone as to be determined on finishing that endless thing an altercation so all three began explaining and appealing at once  it seemed that mrs osborn was requiting mrs kendals neglect in not having inquired after her when the admirals sisters husband died by the omission of inquiries at present whereat albinia laughed a feeble overdone giggle and observed that she believed mrs osborn knew all that passed in willow lawn better than the inmates and lucy deposed that sophy and loo were together every day though sophy knew mamma did not like it  miss meadows said if reparation were not made the osborns had expressed their intention of omitting lucy and sophy from their twelfthday party  to this albinia pettishly replied that the girls were to go to no christmas parties without her miss meadows had taken it very much to heart and lucy was declaiming against mamma making any condescension to mrs osborn or herself being supposed to care for the osborns parties where the boys were so rude and vulgar the girls so boisterous and the dancing a mere romp  sophy might like it but she never did  miss meadows was hurt by her nieces defection and had come to oh very well and things were altered and people used to be grateful to old friends but there were changes  and thereby lucy grew personal as to the manners of the osborns while albinia defended herself against the being grand or exclusive but it was her duty to do what she thought right for the children  yes miss meadows was quite awareonly grandmamma was so nervous about poor dear gibbie missing his christmas dinner for the first timebeing absentmrs ferrars would take great care but damp stockings and all  winifred endeavoured to stem the tide of words but in vain between the meandering incoherency of the one and the nervous rapidity of the other and they had both set off again on this fresh score when in despair she ran downstairs rapped at the study door and cried mr kendal mr kendal will you not come  i cant get miss meadows out of albinias room  forth came mr kendal walked straight upstairs and stood in full majesty on the threshold  holding out his hand to maria with grave courtesy he thanked her for coming to see his wife but at the same time handed her down saw her out safely at the hall door and lucy into the drawingroom  it was a pity that he had not returned to albinias room for she was too much excited to be composed without authority  first she scolded winifred it was the thing she most wished to avoid that he should fancy her teased by anything the meadowses could say and she laughed and protested she never was vexed such absurdity did not hurt her in the least  it has tired you though said winifred  lie quite down and sleep  of course however albinia would not believe that she was tired and began to talk of the osborns and their partyshe was annoyed at the being thought too fine  if it were not such a penance and if you would not be gone home i really would ask you to take the girls winifred  i shall not be gone home  yes you will  i am well and every one wants you  did you not hear willies complimentary message that he is never naughty now because gilbert makes him so happy  but winifred the penny club  the people must have their things  they can wait or  it is very well for us to talk of waiting cried albinia but how should we like a frosty night without cloaks or blankets or fire i did not think it of you winifred  it is the first winter i have been away from my poor old dames and i did think you would have cared for them  and thereupon her overwrought spirits gave way in a flood of tears as she angrily averted her face from her sister who could have cried too not at the injustice but with compassion and perplexity lest there should be an equally violent reaction either of remorse or of mirth  it must be confessed that albinia was very much the creature of health  never having been ill before the depression had been so new that it broke her completely down convalescence made her fractious  recovery however filled her with such an ecstasy of animal spirits that her time seemed to be entirely passed in happiness or in sleep and cares appeared to have lost all power  it was so sudden a change that winifred was startled though it was a very pleasant one and she did not reflect that this was as far from the calm selfrestrained meditative tranquillity enjoined by maurice as had been the previous restless querulous state  both were body more than mind but mrs ferrars was much more ready to be merry with albinia than to moralize about her  and it was droll that the penny club was one of the first stages in her revival  oh mamma cried lucy flying in mr dusautoy is at the door there is such a to do  all the women have been getting gin with their penny club tickets and mrs brock has been stealing the money and mr dusautoy wants to know if you paid up threeandfourpence for the hancock children  albinia instantly invited mr dusautoy to explain in person and he entered hearty and pleasant as ever but in great haste for he had left his fanny keeping the peace between five angry women while he came out to collect evidence  the bayford clothingclub payments were collected by mrs brock the sextons wife and distributed by tickets to be produced at the various shops in the town  mrs brock had detected some women exchanging their tickets for gin and the offending parties retaliated by accusing her of embezzling the subscriptions both parties launching into the usual amount of personalities and exaggerations  albinias testimony cleared mrs brock as to the threeandfourpence but she snuffed the battle from afar and rushed into a scheme of taking the clothingclub into her own hands collecting the pence having the goods from london and selling them herselfshe would propose it on the very first opportunity to the dusautoys  winifred asked if she had not a good deal on her hands already  my dear i have the work in me of a young giant  and will mr kendal like it  he would never find it out unless i told him and very possibly not then  six months hence perhaps he may tell me he is glad that lucy is inclined to useful pursuits and that is approval winifred much more than if i went and worried him about every little petty womans matter  every one to her taste thought winifred who had begun to regard mr and mrs kendal in the same relation as the king and queen at chess  the day before the christening mr ferrars brought back gilbert and his own little willie  through all the interchange of greetings gilbert would hardly let go albinias hand and the moment her attention was free he earnestly whispered may i see my brother  she took him upstairs at once  let me look a little while he said hanging over the child with a sort of hungry fondness and curiosity  my brother my brother he repeated  it has rung in my ears every morning that i can say my brother once more till i have feared it was a dream  it was the sympathy albinia cared for come back again  i hope he will be a good brother to you she said  he must be good he cant help it  he has you said gilbert see he is opening his eyesoh how blue  may i touch him  to be sure you may  he is not sugar said albinia laughing theremake an arm you may have him if you like  your left arm you awkward man  yes that is right  you will do quite as well as i who never touched a baby till willie was born  there sir how do you like your brother gilbert  gilbert held him reverently and gave him back with a sigh when he seemed to have satiated his gaze and touch and convinced himself that his new possession was substantial  i say he added wistfully did you think that name would bring illluck  she knew the name he meant and answered no but your father could not have borne it  besides gibbie we would not think him instead of edmund  no he shall learn to look up to his other brother as you do and look to meeting and knowing him some day  gilbert shivered at this and made no opposition to her carrying him downstairs to his uncle and then gilbert hurried off for the basket of snowdrops that he had gathered early from a favourite spot at fairmead  that short absence seemed to have added double force to his affection he could hardly bear to be away from her and every moment when he could gain her ear poured histories of the delights of fairmead where mr ferrars had devoted himself to his amusement and had made him happier than perhaps he had ever been in his life he had had a taste of shooting of skating of snowballinghe had been useful and important in the village feasts had dined twice at colonel burys and felt himself many degrees nearer manhood  to hear of her old haunts and friends from such enthusiastic lips delighted albinia and her felicity with her baby with mr kendal with her brother and his little son was one of the brightest things in all the worldthe fresh young loving bloom of her matronhood was even sweeter and more beautiful than her girlish days  poor little frail blighted mrs dusautoy  winifred could not help wondering if the contrast pained her when in all the glory of her motherly thankfulness albinia carried her beautiful newlychristened maurice ferrars kendal to the vicarage to show him off lying so openchested and dignified in genevieves pretty work with a sort of manly serenity already dawning on his baby brow  winifred need not have pitied the little lady  she would not have changed with mrs kendalno not for that perfect health usefulness valuenor even for such a baby as that  no indeed she lovedshe rejoiced in all her friends sweet and precious giftsbut mrs dusautoy had one gift that she prized above all  even grandmamma and aunt maria did justice to master maurices attractions at least in public though it came round that miss meadows did not admire fat children and when he had once been seen in lucys arms an alarm arose that mrs kendal would allow the girls to carry him about till his weight made them crooked but albinia was too joyous to take their displeasure to heart and it only served her for something to laugh at  they had a very happy christening party chiefly juvenile in honour of little willie and of francis and emily nugent  albinia was so radiantly lively and goodnatured and her assistants winifred maurice and mr dusautoy so kind so droll so inventive that even aunt maria forgot herself in enjoyment and novelty and was like a different person  mr kendal looked at her with a pleased sad wonder and told his wife it reminded him of what she had been when she was nearly the prettiest girl at bayford  gilbert devoted himself as usual to making genevieve feel welcome and she had likewise willie ferrars and francis nugent at her feet  neither urchin would sit two inches away from her all the evening and in all games she was obliged to obviate jealousies by being partner to both at once  where there was no one to oppress her she came out with all her natural grace and vivacity and people of a larger growth than her little admirers were charmed with her  lucy was obliging ready and useful and looked very pretty the only blot was the heavy dulness of poor sophy who seemed resolved to take pleasure in nothing  winifred varied in opinion whether her moodiness arose from illhealth or from jealousy of her little brother  this latter albinia would not believe especially as she saw that little maurices blue eyes were magnets that held the silent sophy fast but surly denials silenced her interrogations as to illness and made her content to acquiesce in lucys explanation that sophy was only cross because the osborns and drurys were not asked  albinia did her duty handsomely by the two families a day or two after for whatever reports might come round they were always ready to receive her advances and she only took notice of what she saw instead of what she heard  her brother helped mr kendal through the party and winifred made a discovery that excited her more than albinia thought warranted by any fact relating to the horde of irish cousins  only think albinia i have found out that poor ellen omore is mr goldsmiths sister  indeed  but i am afraid i dont remember which ellen omore is you know i never undertake to recollect any but your real cousins out of the thirtysix  for shame albinia i have so often told you about ellen  im sure you cant forget  her husband is my sisters brotherinlaws cousin  oh winifred winifred  but i tell you her husband is the third son of old mr omore of ballymakilty and was in the army  oh the halfpay officer with the twelve children in the cottage on the estate  there now i did think you would care when i told you of a soldier a waterloo man too and you only call him a halfpay officer  i do remember said albinia taking a little pity that you used to be sorry for his good little english wife  of course  i knew she had married him very imprudently but she has struggled gallantly with illhealth and poverty and irish recklessness  i quite venerate her and it seems these goldsmiths had so far cast her off that they had no notion of the extent of her troubles  just like them said albinia  is that the reason you wish me to make the most of the connexion  let me see my sisterinlaws sisters wifeno husbands brothers uncle eh  i dont want you to do anything said winifred a little hurt only if you had seen ellens patient face you would be interested in her  well i am interested you know i am winifred  i hope you interested our respected banker which would be more to the purpose  i think i did said winifred at least he said poor ellen once or twice  i dont want him to do anything for the captain you might give him a thousand pounds and he would never be the better for it but that fourth boy ulick is without exception the nicest fellow i ever saw in my lifeso devoted to his mother so much more considerate and selfdenying than any of the others and very clever maurice examined him and was quite astonished  we did get him sent to st columba for the present but whether they will keep him there no one can guess and it is the greatest pity he should run to waste i told mr goldsmith all this and i really think he seemed to attend  i wonder if it will work  albinia was by this time anxious that it should take effect and they agreed that an old bachelor banker and his sister both past sixty were the very people to adopt a promising nephew  what had become of the multitude of things which albinia had to discuss with her brother  the floodtide of bliss had floated her over all the stumblingblocks and shoals that the ebb had disclosed and she had absolutely forgotten all the perplexities that had seemed so trying  even when she sought a private interview to talk to him about gilbert it was in full security of hearing the praises of her darling  a nice boy a very nice boy returned maurice most amiable and intelligent and particularly engaging from his feeling being so much on the surface  nothing can be more sincere and genuine she cried as if this fell a little flat  certainly not at the time  always exclaimed albinia  you must not distrust him because he is not like you or fred and has never been hardened and taught reserve by rude boys  nothing was ever more real than his affection poor dear boy and the tears thrilled to her eyes  no and it is much to his credit  his love and gratitude to you are quite touching poor fellow but the worst of it is that i am afraid he is very timid both physically and morally  often as she had experienced this truth the soldiers daughter could not bear to avow it and she answered hastily he has never been braced or trained he was always ill till within the last few years coddling at first neglect afterwards he has it all to learn and it is too late for school  yes he is too old to be laughed at or bullied out of cowardice indeed i doubt whether there ever would have been substance enough for much wear and tear  i know you have a turn for riotous obstinate boys  you want willie to be another fred said albinia like an old hen ruffling up her feathers  you think a boy cant be good for anything unless he is a universal plague  i wonder what you will do with your own son said maurice amused since you take gilberts part so fiercely  i trust my boy will never be as much to be pitied as his brother said albinia with tenderness that accused her petulance  at least he can never be a lonely twin with that sore spot in his heart  oh maurice how can any one help dealing gently with my poor gibbie  gentle dealing is the very thing he wants said mr ferrars and i am thinking how to find it for him  how did his going to traversham fail  i dont know edmund did not like to send him without having seen traversham and i could not go  but i dont think there is any need for his going away  his father has been quite enough tormented about it and i can manage him very well now  he is always good and happy with me  i mean to try to ride with him and i have promised to teach him music and we shall garden  never fear i will employ him and keep him out of mischiefit is all pleasure to me  and pray what are your daughters and baby to do while you are galloping after gilbert  oh ill manage  we can all do things together  come maurice i wont have edmund teased and i cant bear parting with any of them or think that any strange man can treat gibbie as i should  maurice was edified by his sisters warmhearted weakness but not at all inclined to let edmund escape a teasing  mr kendals first impulse always was to find a sufficient plea for doing nothing  if gilbert was to go to india it was not worth while to give him a classical education  is he to go to india  albinia had not told me so  i thought she was aware of it but possibly i may not have mentioned it  it has been an understood thing ever since i came home  he will have a good deal of the property in this place but he had better have seen something of the world  bayford is no place for a man to settle down in too young  certainly said mr ferrars repressing a smile  then are you thinking of sending him to haileybury  he was pronounced too young besides it was explained that his destination in india was unfixed  on going home it had been a kind of promise that one of the twin brothers should have an appointment in the civil service the other should enter the bank of kendal and kendal and the survivor was unconsciously suspended between these alternatives while the doubt served as a convenient protection to his father from making up his mind to prepare him for either of these or for anything else  the prompt ferrars temper could bear it no longer and maurice spoke out  ill tell you what kendal it is time to attend to your own concerns  if you choose to let your son run to ruin because you will not exert yourself to remove him from temptation i shall not stand by to see my sister worn out with making efforts to save him she is willing and devoted she fancies she could work day and night to preserve him and she does it with all her heart but it is not womans work she cannot do it and it is not fit to leave it to her when gilbert has broken her heart as well as yours and left an evil example to his brother then you will feel what it is to have kept a lad whom you know to be well disposed but weak as water in the very midst of contamination and to have left your young inexperienced wife to struggle alone to save him  if you are unwarned by the experience of last autumn and winter i could not pity you whatever might happen  maurice who had run on the longer because mr kendal did not answer immediately was shocked at his own impetuosity but a rattling peal of thunder was not more than was requisite  i believe you are right mr kendal said  i was to blame for leaving him so entirely to albinia but she is very fond of him and is one who will never be induced to spare herself and there were considerations  however she shall be relieved at once  what do you recommend  mr ferrars actually made mr kendal promise to set out for traversham with him next morning thirty miles by the railway to inspect mr downton and his pupils  albinia had just sense enough not to object though the discovery of the indian plans was such a blow to her that she could not be consoled by all her husbands representations of the advantages gilbert would derive there and of his belief that the kendal constitution always derived strength from a hot climate and that to himself going to india seemed going home  she took refuge in the hope that between the two indian stools gilbert might fall upon one of the professions which she thought alone worthy of mans attention the clerical or the military  under maurices escort mr kendal greatly enjoyed his expedition liked traversham was satisfied with the looks of the pupils and very much pleased with the tutor whom he even begged to come to bayford for a conference with mrs kendal and this was received by her as no small kindness  she was delighted with mr downton and felt as if gilbert could be safely trusted in his charge nor was gilbert himself reluctant  he was glad to escape from his tempter and to begin a new life and though he hung about mrs kendal and implored her to write often and always tell him about his little brothernay though he cried like a child at the last yet still he was happy and satisfied to go and to break the painful fetters which had held him so long  and though albinia likewise shed some parting tears she could not but own that she was glad to have him in trustworthy hands and as to the additional time thus gained it was disposed of in a million of bright plans for every ones servicedaughters baby parish school classes clubs neighbours  it almost made winifred giddy to hear how much she had undertaken and yet with what zest she talked and acted  theres your victim winifred said maurice as they drove away and looked back at albinia scandalizing bayford by standing in the open gateway her face all smiles of cheerful parting the sun and wind making merry with her chestnut curls her baby in one arm the other held up to wave her farewell  that child will catch cold began winifred turning to sign her to go in  well she continued after all i believe some people like an idol that sits quiet to be worshipped  to be sure she must want to beat him sometimes as the africans do their gods  but on the whole her sentiment of reverence is satisfied and she likes the acting for herself and reigning absolute  yes she is quite happywhy do you look doubtful  dont you admire her  from my heart  then why do you doubt  do you expect her to do anything  a little too much of everything     chapter viii    yes  albinia was excessively happy  her naturally high spirits were enhanced by the enjoyment of recovery and reaction from her former depression  since the great stroke of the drainage every one looked better and her pride in her babe was without a drawback  he seemed to have inherited her vigour and superabundance of life and that first wondrous spring to all but babes unknown was in him unusually rapid so that he was a marvel of fair stateliness size strength and intelligence so unlike the little blighted buds which had been wont to fade at willow lawn that his father watched him with silent wondering affection and his eldest sister was unmerciful in her descriptions of his progress while even sophia had not been proof against his smiles and was proud to be allowed to carry him about and fondle him  neither was mr kendals reserve the trial that it had once been after having become habituated to it as a necessary idiosyncrasy she had become rather proud of his lofty inaccessibility  besides her brothers visit her recovery and the renewed hope and joy in this promising child had not been without effect in rousing him from his apathy  he was less inclined to shun his fellowcreatures had become friendly with the vicar and had even let albinia take him into mrs dusautoys drawingroom where he had been fairly happy having once begun taking his wife out in the carriage he found this much more agreeable than his solitary ride and was in the condition to which albinia had once imagined it possible to bring him in which gentle means and wholesome influence might lead him imperceptibly out of his morbid habits of selfabsorption  unfortunately in the flush of blitheness and whirl of activity albinia failed to perceive the relative importance of objects and he had taught her to believe herself so little necessary to him that she had not learnt to make her pursuits and occupations subservient to his convenience  as long as the drive took place regularly all was well but he caught a severe cold which lasted even to the setting in of the east winds the yearly misery of a man who hardly granted that india was overhot  though albinia had removed much listing and opened various doors and windows he made no complaints but did his best to keep the obnoxious fresh air out of his study and seldom crossed the threshold thereof but with a shiver  his favourite atmosphere was quite enough to account for a return of the old mood but albinia had no time to perceive that it might have been prevented or at least mitigated  few even of the wisest women are fit for authority and liberty so little restrained and happily it seldom falls to the lot of such as have not previously been chastened by a lifelong affliction  but mrs kendal at twentyfour with the consequence conferred by marriage and by her superiority of manners and birth was left as unchecked and almost as irresponsible as if she had been single or a widow and was solely guided by the impulses of her own character noble and highly principled but like most zealous dispositions without balance and without repose  ballast had been given at first by bashfulness disappointment and anxiety but she had been freed from her troubles with gilbert had gained confidence in herself and had taken her position at bayford she was beloved esteemed and trusted in her own set and though elsewhere she might not be liked yet she was deferred to could not easily be quarrelled with so that she met with little opposition and did not care for such as she did meet  in fact very few persons had so much of their own way as mrs kendal  she was generally in her nursery at a much earlier hour than an oldestablished nurse would have tolerated but the little susan promoted from fairmead school and nursery was trained in energetic habits  in passing the doors of the young ladies rooms albinia gave a call which she had taught them not to resist for like all strong persons she thought early to rise the only way to health wealth or wisdom  much work had been despatched before breakfast after which on two days in the week albinia and lucy went to church  sophy never volunteered to accompany them and albinia was the less inclined to press her because her attitudes and attention on sunday were far from satisfactory  on tuesday and thursday albinia had a class at school and so likewise had lucy who kept a jealous watch over every stray necklace and curl and had begun thoroughly to enjoy the importance and bustle of charity  she was a useful assistant in the penny club and lending library which occupied albinia on other mornings in the week until the hour when she came in for the girls studies  after luncheon she enjoyed the company of little maurice who indeed pervaded all her home doings and thoughts for she had a great gift of doing everything at once  a sharp constitutional walk was taken in the afternoon  she thought no one could look drooping or dejected but from the air of the valley and that no cure was equal to rushing straight up one hill and on to the next always walking rapidly with a springy buoyant step and surprised at any one who lagged behind  parochial cares visits singing classes lessons to sundayschool teachers c filled up the rest of the day  she had an endless number of excellent plans on which she always acted instantly and which kept her in a state of perpetual haste  poor mrs dusautoy had almost learnt to dread her flashing into the room full of some parish matter and flashing out again before the invalid felt as if the subject had been fairly entered on or her sitting down to impress some project with overpowering eagerness that generally carried away the vicar into grateful consent and admiring approval while his wife was feeling doubtful suspecting her hesitation of being ungracious or blaming herself for not liking the little she could do to be taken out of her hands  there was nothing more hateful to albinia than dawdling  she left the girls choice of employments but insisted on their being veritably occupied and many a time did she encounter a killing glance from sophia for attacking her listless moody position in her chair or saying in clear alert tones my dear when you read read when you work work  when you fix your eye in that way you are doing neither  lucys brisk active disposition and great goodhumour had responded to this treatment she had been obliging instead of officious repeated checks had improved her taste her love of petty bustle was directed to better objects and though nothing could make her intellectual or deep she was a really pleasant assistant and companion and no one except grandmamma who thought her perfect before could fail to perceive how much more ladylike her tones manners and appearance had become  the results with sophy had been directly the reverse  at first she had followed her sisters lead except that she was always sincere and often sulky but the more lucy had yielded to albinias moulding the more had sophy diverged from her as if out of the very spirit of contradiction  her intervals of childish nonsense had well nigh disappeared her indifference to lessons was greater than ever though she devoured every book that came in her way in a silent but absorbed manner a good deal like her father  tales and stories were not often within her reach but her appetite seemed to be universal and albinia saw her reading oldfashioned standard poetrysuch as she had never herself assailedand books of history travels or metaphysics  she wondered whether the girl derived any pleasure from them or whether they were only a shield for doing nothing but no inquiry produced an answer and if sophy remembered anything of them it was not with the memory used in lessontime  the attachment to louisa osborn was pertinacious and unaccountable in a person who could have so little in common with that young lady and there was nothing comfortable about her except her fondness for her little brother and that really seemed to be against her will  her voice was less hoarse and gruff since the pond had been no more and she had acquired an expression so suffering so concentrated so thoughtful that together with her heavy black eyebrows large face profuse black hair and unlustrous eyes it gave her almost a dwarfish air increased by her awkward deportment which concealed that she was in reality tall and on a large scale  she looked to so little advantage in bright delicate colours that albinia was often incurring her displeasure and risking that of lucy by the deep blues and sober browns which alone looked fit to be seen with those beetle brows and sallow features  her face looked many years older than that of her fair fresh rosy stepmother nay her fathers clear olive complexion and handsome countenance had hardly so aged an aspect and gilbert when he came home at midsummer declared that sophy had grown as old as grandmamma  the compliment could not be returned gilbert was much more boylike in a good sense  he had brought home an excellent character and showed it in every look and gesture  his father was pleased to have him again took the trouble to talk to him and received such sensible answers that the habit of conversing was actually established and the dinners were enlivened instead of oppressed by his presence  towards his sisters he had become courteous he was fairly amiable to aunt maria very attentive to grandmamma overflowing with affection to mrs kendal and as to little maurice he almost adored him and awakened a reciprocity which was the delight of his heart  at midsummer came the grand pennyclub distribution the triumph for which albinia had so long been preparing  one of mrs dusautoys hints as to bayford tradesmen had been overruled and goods had been ordered from a house in london after albinia and lucy had made an incredible agitation over their patterns of calico and flannel  mr kendal was just aware that there was a prodigious commotion but he knew that all ladies were subject to linendrapery epidemics and albinias took a more endurable form than a pull on his purse for the sweetest silk in the world and above all it neither came into his study nor even into his house  it was a grand spectacle when mr dusautoy looked in on mrs kendal and her staff armed with their yardwands  a pile of calico was heaped in wild masses like avalanches in one corner rapidly diminishing under the measurements of gilbert who looked as if he took thorough goodnatured delight in the frolic brown inodorous materials for petticoats blouses and trowsers were dealt out by the dextrous hands of genevieve a mountain of lilac print was folded off by clarissa richardson lucy was presiding joyously over the various blue buff brown and pink sunday frocks the schoolmistress helping with the other goods the customerssome pleased with novelty or hoping to get more for their money others suspicious of the gentry and secretly resentful for favourite dealers but except the desperate grumblers satisfied with the quality and quantity of the waresand extremely taken with the sellers especially with gilberts wit and with miss durants ready lively persuasions varied to each ones taste and extracting a smile and thank you miss from the surliest  and the presiding figure with the light on her sunny hair and goodnatured unfailing interest in her countenance was at her central table calculating giving advice considering of complaints measuring foldinghere there and everywherealways bright lively forbearing however complaining or unreasonable her clients might be  mr dusautoy went home to tell his fanny that mrs kendal was worth her weight in gold and the workers toiled till luncheon when albinia took them home for food and wine to restore them for the labours of the afternoon  what have you been about all the morning sophy  yes i see your translationvery welli wish you would come up and help this afternoon miss richardson is looking so pale and tired that i want to relieve her  i cant said sophy  i dont order you but you are losing a great deal of fun  suppose you came to look on at least  i hate poor people  i hope you will change your mind some day but yon must do something this afternoon  you had better take a walk with susan and baby i told her to go by the meadows to horton  i dont want to walk  have you anything to do instead  no i thought not and it is not at all hot to signifyit will do you much more good  yes you must go  in the course of the summer an old indian friend was staying at fairmead park and colonel bury wrote to beg for a weeks visit from the whole kendal family  even sophy vouchsafed to be pleased and lucy threw all her ardour into the completion of a blue braided cape which was to add immensely to little maurices charms she declared that she should work at it the whole of the last evening while mr and mrs kendal were at the dinner that old mr and mrs bowles annually inflicted on themselves and their neighbours a dinner which it would have been as cruel to refuse as it was irksome to accept  there was a great similarity in those bayford parties inasmuch as the same cook dressed them all and the same waiters waited at them and the same guests met each other and the principal variety on this occasion was that the osborns did not come because the admiral was in london  the ladies had left the diningroom when albinias ear caught a sound of hurried opening of doors and sound of steps and saw mrs and miss bowles look as if they heard something unexpected  she paused and forgot the end of what she was saying  the room door was pushed a little way open but then seemed to hesitate  miss bowles hastened forward and opening it admitted a voice that made albinia hurry breathlessly from the other side of the room and push so that the door yielded and she saw it had been mr dusautoy who had been holding it while there was some kind of consultation round gilbert the instant he saw her he exclaimed come to the baby sophy has fallen down with him  people pressed about her trying to speak cheeringly but she understood nothing but that her husband and mr bowles were gone on and she had a sense that there had been hardness and cruelty in hesitating to summon her  without knowing that a shawl was thrown round her or seeing mr dusautoys offered arm she clutched gilberts wrist in her hand and flew down the street  the gates and front door were open and there was a throng of people in the hall  lucy caught hold of her with a sobbing oh mamma but she only framed the words with her lipswhere  they pointed to the study  the door was shut but albinia broke from lucy and pushed through it in too much haste to dwell on the sickening doubt what it might conceal  two figures stood under the window  mr kendal who was holding the little inanimate form in his arms for the doctor to examine looking up as she entered cast on her a look of mute pleading despairing agony that was as the bitterness of death  she sprang forward herself to clasp her child and her husband yielded him in brokenhearted pity but at that moment the little limbs moved the features worked the eyes unclosed and clinging tightly to her as she strained him to her bosom the little fellow proclaimed himself alive by lusty roars more welcome than any music  partly stunned and far more terrified he had been in a sort of swoon without breath to cry till recalled to himself by feeling his mothers arms around him  every attempt of mr bowles to ascertain whether he were uninjured produced such a fresh panic and renewal of screams that she begged that he might be left to her  mr kendal took the doctor away and gradually the terror subsided though the long convulsive sobs still quivered up through the little frame and as the twilight darkened on her she had time to realize the past alarm and rejoice in trembling over the treasure still her own  the opening of the door and the gleaming of a light had nearly brought on a fresh access of crying but it was his father who entered and maurice knew the low deep sweetness of his voice and was hushed  i believe there is no harm done albinia said and the smile that she fain would have made reassuring gave way as her eyes filled with tears on feeling the trembling of the strong arm that was put round her when mr kendal bent to look into the childs eyes  i thought my blight had fallen on you was all he said  oh the thankfulness she said but she could not go on she must stifle all that swelled within her for the babe felt each throb of her beating heart and she could barely keep from bursting into tears as his father kissed him then as he marked the still sobbing breath said bowles must see him again  i dont know how to make him cry again  i suppose he must be looked at but indeed i think him safesee this little bruise on his forehead is the only mark i can find  what was it  how did it happen  sophia thought proper to take him herself from the nursery to show him to mrs osborn  in crossing the street she was frightened by a party of men coming out of a publichouse in tibbss alley and in avoiding them slipped down and struck the childs head against a gatepost  he was perfectly insensible when i took himi thought him gone  albinia you must let bowles see him again  is any one there she said  every one i think he replied looking oppressedmaria and mrs osborn and dusautoybut i will call bowles  apparently the little boy had escaped entirely unhurt but the surgeon still spoke of the morrow and he was so startled and restless that albinia feared to move and felt the dark study a refuge from the voices and sounds that she feared to encounter lest they should again occasion the dreadful screaming  oh if they would only go home she said  i will send them said mr kendal and presently she heard sounds of leavetaking and he came back as if he had been dispersing a riot announcing that the house was clear  gilbert and lucy were watching at the foot of the stairs the one pale and casting anxious imploring looks at her the other with eyes red and swollen with crying neither venturing near till she spoke to them when they advanced noiselessly to look at their little brother and it was not till they had caught his eye and made him smile that lucy bethought herself of saying she had known nothing of his adventure and albinia thus recalled to the thought of the culprit asked where sophy was  in her own room said mr kendal  i could not bear the sight of her obduracy  even her aunt was shocked at her want of feeling  low as he spoke the sternness of his voice frightened the baby and she was obliged to run away to the nursery where she listened to the contrition of the little nursemaid who had never suspected miss sophys intention of taking him out of the house  and indeed maam she said there is not one of us servants who dares cross miss sophy  it was long before albinia ventured to lay him in his cot and longer still before she could feel any security that if she ceased her low monotonous lullaby the little fellow would not wake again in terror but the thankfulness and prayer that as she grew more calm gained fuller possession of her heart made her recur the more to pity and forgiveness for the poor girl who had caused the alarm  yet there was strong indignation likewise and she could not easily resolve on meeting the hard defiance and sullen indifference which would wound her more than ever  she was much inclined to leave sophy to herself till morning but suspecting that this would be vindictive she unclasped the arm that lucy had wound round her waist whispered to her to go on singing and moved to sophys door  it was fastened but before she could call it was thrown violently back and sophy stood straight up before her striving for her usual rigidity but shaking from head to foot and though there were no signs of tears she looked with wistful terror at her stepmothers face and her lips moved as if she wished to speak  baby is gone quietly to sleep began albinia in a low voice beginning in displeasure but as she spoke the harshness of sophys face gave way she sank down on the floor and fell into the most overpowering fit of weeping that albinia had ever witnessed kneeling beside her she would have drawn the girl close to her but a sharp cry of pain startled her and she found the right arm from elbow to wrist all one purple bruise the skin grazed and the blood starting  my poor child how you have hurt yourself  sophy turned away pettishly  let me look  i am sure it must be very bad  have you done anything to it  no never mind  go back to baby  baby does not want me  you shall come and see how comfortably he is asleep if you will leave off crying and let me see that poor arm did you hurt it in the fall  the corner of the wall said sophy  oh did it not hurt him but then just as it seemed that she was sinking on that kind breast in exhaustion she collected herself and pushing albinia off exclaimed i did it i took him out i fell down with him i hurt his head ive killed him or made him an idiot for life  i did  who said so cried albinia transfixed  aunt maria said so  she said i did not feel  oh if i could only die before he grows up to let one see it  why wont you begin to hate me  my dear said albinia consoled on hearing the authority people often say angry things when they are shocked  your aunt had not seen mr bowles and we all think he was not in the least hurt only terribly frightened  dear dear child i am more distressed for you than for him  sophy could hold out no longer she let her head drop on the kind shoulder and seemed to collapse with burning brow throbbing pulses and sobs as deep and convulsive as had been those of her little brother  hastily calling lucy who was frightened subdued and helpful albinia undressed the poor child put her to bed and applied lily leaves and spirits to her arm  the smart seemed to refresh her but there had been a violent strain as well as bruise and each touch visibly gave severe pain though she never complained lucy insisted on hearing exactly how the accident had happened and pressed her with questions which albinia would have shunned in her present condition and it was thus elicited that she had taken maurice across the street to how him to mrs osborn  he had resented the strange place and strange people and had cried so much that she was obliged to run home with him at once  a knot of bawling men came reeling out of one of the many beer shops in tibbss alley and in her haste to avoid them she tripped close to the gatepost of willow lawn and fell with only time to interpose her arm between maurices head and the sharp corner  she was lifted up at once in the horror of seeing him neither cry nor move for in fact he had been almost stifled under her weight and all had since been to her a frightful phantom dream  albinia was infinitely relieved by this history showing that maurice could hardly have received any real injury and in her declarations that sophys presence of mind had saved him was forgetting to whom the accident was owing  lucy wanted to know why her sister could have taken him out of the house at all but albinia could not bear to have this pressed at such a moment and sent the inquirer down to order some tea which she shared with sophy and then was forced to bid her goodnight without drawing out any further confessions  but when the girl raised herself to receive her kiss it was the first real embrace that had passed between them  in the very early morning albinia was in the nursery and found her little boy bright and healthy  as she left him in glad hope and gratitude sophys door was pushed ajar and her wan face peeped out my dear child you have not been asleep all night exclaimed albinia after having satisfied her about the baby  no  does your arm hurt you  yes  does your head ache  rather  but they were not the old sulky answers and she seemed glad to have her arm freely bathed her brow cooled her tossed bed composed and her window opened so that she might make a fresh attempt at closing her weary eyes  she was evidently far too much shaken to be fit for the intended expedition even if her father had not decreed that she should be deprived of it  albinia had never seen him so much incensed for nothing makes a man so angry as to have been alarmed and he was doubly annoyed when he found that she thought sophy too unwell to be left as he intended to solitary confinement  he would gladly have given up the visit for his repugnance to society was in full force on the eve of a party but albinia by representing that it would be wrong to disappoint colonel bury and very hard on the unoffending gilbert and lucy succeeded in prevailing on him to accept his melancholy destiny and to allow her to remain at home with sophy and the babyone of the greatest sacrifices he or she had yet made  he was exceedingly vexed and therefore the less disposed to be lenient  the more albinia told him of sophys unhappiness the more he hoped it would do her good and he could not be induced to see her nor to send her any message of forgiveness for in truth it was less the babys accident that he resented than the eighteen months of surly resistance to the babys mother and at present he was more unrelenting than the generous forgiving spirit of his wife could understand though she tried to believe it manly severity and firmness  it would be time to pardon he said when pardon was asked  and albinia could not say that it had been asked except by misery  she has the best advocate in you said mr kendal affectionately and if there be any feeling in her such forbearance cannot fail to bring it out  i am more grieved than i can tell you at your present disappointment but it shall not happen again  if you can bring her to a better mind i shall be the more satisfied in sending her from home  edmund you do not think of it  my mind is made up  do you think i have not watched your patient care and the manner in which it has been repaid  you have sufficient occupation without being the slave of those childrens misconduct  sophy would be miserable  oh you must not  she is the last girl in the world fit to be sent to school  i will not have you made miserable at home  this has been a long trial and nothing has softened her  suppose this was the very thing  if it were what is past should not go unrequited and the change will teach her what she has rejected  hush dearest it is not that i do not think that you have done all for her that tenderness or good sense could devise but your time is too much occupied and i cannot see you overtasked by this poor childs headstrong temper  it is decided albinia say no more  i have failed thought albinia as he left the room  he decides that i have failed in bringing up his children  what have i done have i been mistaken have i been careless have i not prayed enough oh my poor poor sophy  what will she do among strange girls  oh how wretched how harsh how misunderstood she will be  she will grow worse and worse and just when i do think i might have begun to get at her  and it is for my sake  for me that her father is set against her and is driving her out from her home  oh what shall i do  winifred will promote it because they all think i am doing too much  i wonder what put that in edmunds head  but when he speaks in that way i have no hope  mr kendals anger took a direction with which she better sympathized when he walked down tibbss alley and counted the nine beer shops which had never dawned on his imagination and which so greatly shocked it that he went straight to the astonished pettilove and gave him a severe reprimand for allowing the houses to be made dens of iniquity and disorder  he was at home in time to meet the doctor and hear that maurice had suffered not the smallest damage and then to make another ineffectual attempt to persuade albinia to consign sophy to imprisonment with aunt maria after which he drove off very much against his will with lucy and gilbert both declaring that they did not care a rush to go to fairmead under the present circumstances  albinia had a sad sore sense of failure and almost of guilt as she lingered on the doorstep after seeing them set off  the education of edmunds children had been a cherished vision and it had resulted so differently from her expectations that her heart sank with gilbert there was indeed no lack of love and confidence but there was a sad lurking sense of his want of force of character and she had avowedly been insufficient to preserve him from temptation lucy whom externally she had the most altered was not of a nature accordant enough with her own for her to believe the effects deep or permanent and sophiapoor sophia  had what was kindly called forbearance been really neglect and want of moral courage  would a gentler less eager person have won instead of repelling confidence had her multiplicity of occupations made her give but divided attention to the more important home duty  alas alas she only knew that her husband thought his daughter beyond her management and for that very reason she would have given worlds to retain the uncouth perverse girl under her charge  she stood loitering for the sound of the river and the shade of the willows were pleasant on the glowing july day and having made all her arrangements for going from home she had no pressing employment and thus she waited musing as she seldom allowed herself time to do and thinking over each phase of her conduct towards sophy in the endeavour to detect the mistake and throughout came not exactly answering her query but throwing a light upon it her brothers warning that if she did not resign herself to rest quietly when rest was forced upon her she would work amiss when she did work  just then came a swinging of the gate a step on the walk and miss meadows made her appearance  a message had been sent up in the morning but grandmamma was so nervous that maria had trotted down in the heat so satisfy her  albinia was surprised to find that womanhood had thrown all their instincts on the babys side and was gratified by the first truly kind fellowfeeling they had shown her  she took maria into the morning room where she had left sophy lying on the sofa and ran up to fetch maurice from the nursery  when she came down having left the nurse adorning him she found that she had acted cruelly  sophy was standing up with her hardest face on listening to her aunts wellmeant rebukes on her want of feeling and hopes that she did regret the having endangered her brother and deprived her dear mamma of the party of pleasure at fairmead but aunt maria knew it was of no use to talk to sophy none  pray dont aunt maria said albinia gently drawing sophy down on the sofa again this poor child is in no state to be scolded  you are a great deal too good to her mrs kendalafter such wilfulness as last nightcarrying the dear baby out in the streeti never heard of such a thingbut what made you do it sophy wont you tell me that  no i know you wont no one ever can get a word from her  ah that sulky dispositionit is a very nasty tempercant you break through it sophy and confess it all to your dear mamma you would be so much better  but i know it is of no use poor child it is just like her father  albinia was growing very angry and it was well that maurices merry crowings were heard approaching  miss meadows was delighted to see him but as he had a great aversion to her the interview was not prolonged since he could not be persuaded to keep the peace by being held up to watch a buzzing fly as much out of sight of her as possible wrinkling up his nose and preparing to cry whenever he caught sight of her white bonnet and pink roses  miss meadows bethought her that grandmamma was anxious so she only waited to give an invitation to tea but merely to mrs kendal she would say nothing about sophy since disgracewellmeritedif they could only see some feeling  thank you said albinia some evening perhaps i may come since yon are so kind but i dont think i can leave this poor twisted arm to itself  miss meadows evaporated in hopes that sophy would be sensible ofand assurances that mrs kendal was a great deal toowith finally goodbye sophy i wish i could have told grandmamma that you had shown some feeling  i believe said albinia that you would only be too glad if you knew how  sophy gasped  albinia could not help feeling indignant at the misjudged persecution and yet it seemed to render the poor child more entirely her own since all the world besides had turned against her  kiss her maurice she said holding the little fellow towards her  that scratched arm of hers has spared your small brains from more than you guess  sophys first impulse was to hide her face but he thought it was bopeep caught hold of her fingers and laughed then came to a sudden surprised stop and looked up to his mother when the countenance behind the screen proved sad instead of laughing  ah baby you had better have done with me sophy said bitterly you are the only one that does not hate me yet and you dont know what i have done to you  i know some one else that cares for you my poor sophy said albinia and who would do anything to make you feel it without distressing you  if you knew how i wish i knew what to do for you  it is no use said sophy moodily i was born to be a misery to myself and every one else  what has put such a fancy in your head my dear said albinia nearly smiling  grandmammas betty said so she used to call me peter grievous and i know it is so  it is of no good to bother yourself about me  it cant be helped and theres an end of it  there is not an end of it indeed cried albinia  why sophy do you suppose i could bear to leave you so  im sure i dont see why not  why not continued albinia in her bright tender voice  why because i must love you with all my heart  you are your own dear papas child and this little mans sister  yes and you are yourself my poor sad lonely child who does not know how to bring out the thoughts that prey on her and who thinks it very hard to have a stranger instead of her own mother  i know i should have felt so  but i have behaved so ill to you cried sophy as if bent on repelling the proffered affection  i would not like you and i did not like you  never and i have gone against you every way i could  and now i love you because you are sorry for it  im notsophy had begun but the words turned into am i  i think you are and with the sweetest of tearful smiles she put an arm round the no longer resisting sophy and laying her cheek against the little brothers she kissed first one and then the other  i cant think why you are so said sophy still struggling against the undeserved love though far more feebly  i shall never deserve it  see if you dont when we pull together instead of contrary ways  but cried sophy with a sudden start from her as if remembering a mortal offence you drained the pond  i own i earnestly wished it to be drained but had you any reason for regretting it my dear  ah you did not know said sophy  he and i used to be always there  he  why will you make me say it cried sophy  edmund  i mean edmund  we always called it his pond  he made the little quay for his boatshe used to catch the minnows there  i could go and stand by it and think he was coming out to play and now you have had it dried up and his dear little minnows are all dead and she burst into a passion of tears that made maurice cry till albinia hastily carried him off and returned  my dear i am sorry it seemed so unkind  i do not think we could have let the pond stay for it was making the house unhealthy but if we had talked over it together it need not have appeared so very cruel and spiteful  i dont believe you are spiteful said sophy though i sometimes think so  the filial compliment was highly gratifying  and now sophy she said that i have told you why we were obliged to have the pond drained will you tell me what you wanted with baby at mrs osborns  i will tell said sophy but you wont like it  i like anything better than concealment  mrs osborn said she never saw him  she said you kept him close and that nobody was good enough to touch him so i promised i would bring him over and i kept my word  i know it was wrongandi did not think you would ever forgive me  but how could you do it  mrs osborn and all used to be so kind to us when there was nobody else  i wont cast them off because we are too fine and grand for them  i never thought of that  i only was afraid of your getting into silly ways and your papa did not wish us to be intimate there  and now you see he was right for good friends would not have led you to such disobedienceand by stealth too what i should have thought you would most have hated  albinia had been far from intending these last words to have been taken as they were  sophy hid her face and cried piteously with an utter selfabandonment of grief that albinia could scarcely understand but at last she extracted some broken words  false shabby yesoh i have been false  oh edmund edmund edmund the only thing i thought i still was  i thought i was true  oh by stealth  why couldnt i die when i tried when edmund did  and has life been a blank ever since  off and on said sophy  well why not  i am sure papa is melancholy enough  i dont like people that are always making fun i cant see any sense in it  some sorts of merriment are sad and hollow and wrong indeed said albinia but not all i hope  you know there is so much love and mercy all round us that it is unthankful not to have a cheerful spirit  i wish i could give you one sophy  sophy shook her head  i cant understand about mercy and love when edmund was all i cared for  but sophy if life is so sad and hard to you dont you see the mercy that took edmund away to perfect joy  remember not cutting you off from him but keeping him safe for you  no no cried sophy i have never been good since he went  i have got worse and worse but i did think i was true still that that one thing was left mebut now the sense of having acted a deception seemed to produce grief under which the stubborn pride was melting away and it was most affecting to see the child weeping over the lost jewel of truth which she seemed to feel the last link with the remarkable boy whose impress had been left so strongly on all connected with him  my dear the truth is in you still or you could not grieve thus over your failure said albinia  i know you erred because it did not occur to you that it was not acting openly by me but oh sophy there is something that would bring you nearer to edmund than hard truth in your own strength  i dont know what you mean said sophy  did you ever think what edmund is about now  i dont know said sophy  i only know that the one thing which is carried with us to the other world is love sophy and love that becomes greater than we can yet imagine  if you would think of him who redeemed and saved your dear edmund and who is his happiness his exceeding great reward your heart would warm and oh what hope and peace would come  edmund was good said sophy in a tone as if to mark the hopeless gulf between  and you are sorry  all human goodness begins from sorrow  it had even to be promised first for baby at his christening you know  oh sophy gods blessing can make all these tears come to joy  albinias own tears were flowing so fast that she broke off to hide them in her own room her heart panting with hope and yet with grief and pity for the piteous disclosure of so dreary a girlhood  after all childhood if not the happiest is the saddest period of lifepains griefs petty tyrannies neglects and terrors have not the alleviation of the experience that this also shall pass away time moves with a tardier pace and in the narrower sphere of interests there is less to distract the attention from the load of grievances  hereditary low spirits a precocious mind a reserved temper a motherless home the loss of her only congenial companion and the longenduring effect of her illness upon her health had all conspired to weigh down the poor girl and bring on an almost morbid state of gloomy discontent  her fathers second marriage by enlivening the house had rendered her peculiarities even more painful to herself and others and the cultivation of mind that was forced upon her made her more averse to the trifling and playfulness which while she was younger had sometimes brightened and softened her  and this was the girl whom her father had resolved upon sending to the selfish inconsiderate frivolous world of schoolgirls just when the first opening had been made the first real insight gained into her feelings the first appearance of having touched her heart  albinia felt baffled disappointed almost despairing  his stern decree once made was she knew wellnigh unalterable and though resolved to use her utmost influence she doubted its power after having seen that look of decision  nay she tried to think he might be right  there might be those who would manage sophy better  eighteen months had been a fair trial and she had failed  she prayed earnestly for whatever might be best for the child and for herself that she might take it patiently and submissively  sophy felt the heat of the day a good deal but towards the evening she revived and seemed so much cheered and refreshed by her tea that as the sound of the church bell came sweetly down in the soft air albinia said sophy i am going to take advantage of my holiday and go to the evening service  i suppose you had rather not come  i think i will returned sophy somewhat glumly but albinia hailed the answer joyfully as the first shamefaced effort of a reserved character wishing to make a new beginning and she took care that no remark not even a look should rouse the sullen sensitiveness that could so easily be driven back for ever  slowly they crept up the steps on the shady side of the hill watching how beyond the long shadow it cast over the town and the meadows the trees revelled in the sunset light and windows glittered like great diamonds where in the ordinary daylight the distance was too great for distinct vision  the church was cool and quiet and there was something in sophys countenance and reverent attitude that seemed as if she were consecrating a newlyformed resolution her eye was often raised as though in spite of herself to the name of the brother whose short life seemed inseparably interwoven with all the higher aspirations of his home  in the midst of the thanksgiving a sudden movement attracted albinia and she saw sophy resting her head and looking excessively pale  she put her arm round her and would have led her out but could not persuade her to move and by the time the blessing was given the power was gone and she had almost fainted away when a tall strong form stooped over her and mr dusautoy gathered her up in his arms and bore her off as if she had been a baby to the open window of his own drawingroom  put me down  the floor please said sophy feebly for all her remaining faculties were absorbed in dislike to the mode of conveyance  yes flat on the floor said mrs dusautoy rising with full energy and laying a cushion under sophys head reaching a scentbottle and sending her husband for cold water and sal volatile with readiness that astonished albinia unused to illness and especially to faintings and remorseful at having taken sophy out  was it the pain of her arm that had overcome her  no said sophy it was only my back  indeed you never told me you had hurt your back and albinia began describing the fall and declaring there must be a sprain  oh no said sophy kneeling always does it  does what my dear said albinia sitting on the floor by her and looking up to mrs dusautoy exceedingly frightened  makes me feel sick said sophy i thought it would go off as it always does it didnt but it is better now  no dont get up yet said mrs dusautoy as she was trying to move i would offer you the sofa it would be more hospitable but i think the floor is the most comfortable place  thank you much said sophy with an emphasis  do you ever lie down on it when you are tired asked the lady looking anxiously at sophy  i always wish i might  albinia was surprised at the interrogations that followed she did not understand what mrs dusautoy was aiming at in the close questioning which to her amazement did not seem to offend but rather to be gratifying by the curious divination of all sensations it made albinia feel as if she had been carrying on a deliberate system of torture when she heard of a pain in the back hardly ever ceasing aggravated by sitting upright growing severe with the least fatigue and unless favoured by day becoming so bad at night as to take away many hours of sleep  oh sophy sophy she cried with tears in her eyes how could you go on so  why did you never tell me  i did not like began sophy i was used to it  oh that barrier  albinia was in uncontrollable distress that the girl should have chosen to undergo so much suffering rather than bestow any confidence  sophy stole her hand into hers and said in her odd short way never mind it did not signify  yes said mrs dusautoy those things are just what one does get so much used to that it seems much easier to bear them than to speak about them  but to let oneself be so driven about cried albinia  oh sophy you will never do so again  if i had ever guessed  please hush  never mind said sophy almost crossly and getting up from the floor quickly as though resolved to be well  i have never minded long enough sighed albinia  what shall i do mrs dusautoy  what do you think it is  this was the last question mrs dusautoy wished to be asked in sophys presence  she had little doubt that it was spine complaint like her own but she had not intended to let her perceive the impression till after having seen mrs kendal alone  however albinias impetuosity disconcerted all precautions and sophys two great black eyes were rounded with suppressed terror as if expecting her doom  i think that a doctor ought to answer that question mrs dusautoy began  yes yes exclaimed albinia but i never had any faith in old mr bowles i had rather go to a thorough good man at once  yes certainly by all means  and then to whom  i will write to my aunt mary  it seems exactly like you  do you think it is the spine  i am afraid so  but my dear holding out her hand caressingly to sophy you need not be frightenedyou need not look at me as an example of what you will come toi am only an example of what comes of never speaking of ones ailments  and of having no mother to find them out cried albinia  indeed said mrs dusautoy anxious to console and encourage as well as to talk the young stepmother out of her selfreproach i do not think that if i had been my good aunts own child she would have been more likely to find out that anything was amiss  it was the fashion to be strong and healthy in that house and i was never really illbut i came as a little stunted dwining cockney and so i was considered ever afternever quite comfortable often forgetting myself in enjoyment paying for it afterwards but quite used to it we all thought it was only fanny and part of my london breeding yes we thought so in good faith even after the largest half of my life had been spent in yorkshire  and what brought it to a crisis  did they go on neglecting you exclaimed albinia  why my dear said the little lady a glow lighting on her cheek and a smile awakening my uncle took a new curate whom it was the family custom to call the goodnatured giant and whose approach put all of us young ladies in a state of great excitement  it was all in character with his goodnature you know to think of dragging the poor little shrimp up the hill to church and i believe he did not know how she would get on without his strong arm for do you know when he had the curacy of lauriston given him he chose to carry the starveling off with him instead of any of those fine handsome prosperous girls  dear mary and bessie how good they were and how kind and proud for me  i never could complain of not having sisters  well and mr dusautoy made you have advice  not he  why we all believed it cockneyism you know and besides i was so happy and so well that when we went to scotland i fairly walked myself off my legs and ended the honeymoon laid up in a little inn on loch katrine where john used regularly to knock his head whenever he came into the room  it was a fortnight before i could get to edinburgh and the journey made me as bad as ever  so the doctors were called in and poor john learnt what a crooked stick he had chosen but they all said that if i had been taken in hand as a child most likely i should have been a sound woman  the worst of it was that i was so thoroughly knocked up that i could not bear the motion of a carriage besides i suppose the doctors wanted a little amusement out of me for they would not hear of my going home  so poor john had to go to lauriston by himself and those were the longest dreariest six months i ever spent in my life though bessie was so good as to come and take care of me  but at last when i had nearly made up my mind to defy the whole doctorhood they gave leave and between water and steam john brought me to lauriston and ever since that i dont see that a backbone would have made us a bit happier  sophy had been intently reading mrs dusautoys face all through the narration from under her thick black eyelashes and at the end she drew a sigh of relief and seemed to catch the smile of glad gratitude and affection  there was a precedent which afforded incredible food to the tumultuous cravings of a heart that had been sinking in sullen gloom under the consciousness of an unpleasing exterior  the possibility of a goodnatured giant was far more present to her mind than the present probability of future suffering and restraint  ever rapid and eager albinia could think of nothing but immediate measures for sophys good and the satisfaction of her own conscience  she could not bear even to wait for mr kendals return but as her aunts were still in london she resolved on carrying sophy to their house on the following day for the best advice  it was already late and she knelt at the table to dash off two notes to put into the postoffice as she went home  one to mrs annesley to announce her coming with sophy baby and susan the other as follows                                              july 10th 9 pm dearest edmund  i find i have been cruelly neglectful  i have hunted and driven that poor child about till it has brought on spine complaint  the only thing i can do is to take her to have the best advice without loss of time so i am going tomorrow to my aunts  it would take too long to write and ask your leave  you must forgive this as indeed each word i have to say is forgive  she is so generous and kind  you know i meant to do my best but they were right i was too young                                              forgive yours                                                         a k   the dusautoys were somewhat taken by surprise but they knew too well the need of promptitude to dissuade her and sophia herself sat aghast at the commotion excited by the habitual discomfort of which she had thought so little  the vicar when he found mrs kendal in earnest offered to go with them and protect them but albinia was a veteran in independent railway travelling and was rather affronted by being treated as a helpless female  mrs dusautoy better aware of what the journey might be to one at least of the travellers gave advice and lent air cushions and albinia bade her good night with an almost sobbing thank you and an entreaty that if mr kendal came home before them she would tell him all about it  at home she instantly sent the stupefied sophy to bed astonished the little nurse ordered down boxes and bags and spent half the night in packing glad to be stirring and to tire herself into sleeping for her remorse and her anticipations were so painful that but for fatigue her bed would have been no restingplace     chapter ix    winifred ferrars was surprised by mr kendals walking into her garden with a perturbed countenance begging her to help him to make out what could be the meaning of a note which he had just received he was afraid that there was much amiss with the baby and heartily wished that he had not been persuaded to leave home but poor albinia wrote in so much distress that he could not understand her letter  more accustomed to albinias epistolary habits winifred exclaimed at the first glance what can you mean  there is not one word of the little one  it is only sophy  the immediate clearing of his face was not complimentary to poor sophy as he said can you be quite sure  i had begun to hope that albinia might at least have the comfort of seeing this little fellow healthy but let me seeshe says nursed andand dancedis it this poor child  no no it is hunted and driven thats the way she always will make her hs besides what nonsense the other would be  this poor child repeated mr kendal going up to london for advice  she would hardly do that with sophia  who ever heard of a baby of six months old having a spine complaint cried mrs ferrars almost angrily  i have lost one in that way he replied  a dead silence ensued till winifred to her great relief spied the feminine pronoun but could not fully satisfy mr kendal that the ups and downs were insufficient for the word him and each scrawl was discussed as though it had been a cuneiform inscription until he had been nearly argued into believing in the lesser evil  he then was persuaded that the meadowses had been harassing and frightening albinia into this startling measure  it was so contrary to his own nature that he hardly believed that it had actually taken place and that she must be in london by this time but at any rate he must join her there and know the worst  he would take the whole party to an hotel if it were too great a liberty to quarter themselves upon mrs annesley  winifred was as much surprised as if the chessking had taken a knights move but she encouraged his resolution assured him of a welcome at what the cousinhood were wont to call the family office and undertook the charge of gilbert and lucy  the sorrowful almost supplicating tone of his wifes letter would have sufficed to bring him to her even without his disquietude for his child whichever of them it might be and though albinias merry blueeyed boy had brought a renewed spring of hope and life his crashed spirits trembled at the least alarm  thus though the cheerful winifred had convinced his reason his gloomy anticipations revived before he reached london and with the stern composure of one accustomed to bend to the heaviest blows he knocked at mrs annesleys door  he was told that mrs kendal was out but on further inquiry learnt that sophy was in the drawingroom where he found her curled up in the corner of the sofa reading intently  she sprang to her feet with a cry of surprise but did not approach though he held out his arms saying in a voice husky with anxiety is the baby well sophia  yes she cried quite well he is out in the carriage with them then shrinking as he was stooping to kiss her she reddened reddening deeply papa i did very wrong i was sly and disobedient and i might have killed him  do not let us speak of that now my dear i want to hear of and again he would have drawn her into his embrace but she held out her hand with her repelling gesture and burst forth in her rude honesty i cant be forgiven only because i am ill  hear all about it papa and then say you forgive me if you can  i always was cross to mamma because i was determined i would be and i did not think she had any business with us  the more she was kind the more i did not like it and i thought it was mean in gilbert and lucy to be fond of her  no i have not done yet  i grew naughtier and naughtier till at last i have been false and sly andhave done this to baby and i would not have cared thenifif she would not have beenoh so good  sophy made no farther resistance to the arm that was thrown round her as her father said so good that she has overcome evil with good  my child how should i not forgive when you are sensible of your mistake and when she has so freely forgiven  sophy did not speak but she pressed his arm closer round her and laid her cheek gratefully on his shoulder  she only wished it could last for ever but he soon lifted her that he might look anxiously at her face while he said and what is all this my dear  i am afraid you are not well  her energies were recalled and squeezing his hand she said mind you will not let them say it was mammas fault  who is accusing her my dear  what is the matter  it is only my back said sophy there always was a stupid pain there but grandmammas betty said i made a fuss and that it was all laziness and i would not let any one say so again and i never told of it and it went on till the other night i grew faint at church and mrs dusautoy put mamma in such a fright that we all came here yesterday and there came a doctor this morning who says my spine is not straight and that i must lie on my back for a long time but never mind papa it will be very comfortable to lie still and read and i shall not be cross now she added reassuringly as his grasp pressed her close with a start of dismay  my dear i am afraid you hardly know what you may have to go through but i am glad you meet it bravely  but you wont let them say mamma did it  who should say so  aunt maria will and mamma will go and say so herself cried sophy she will say it was taking walks and carrying baby and its not true  i told the doctor how my back ached long before baby came or she either and he said that most likely the weakness had been left by the fever  so if it is any ones mismanagement it is aunt marias and if you wont tell her so i will  gently sophy that would hardly be grateful after the pains that she has taken with you and the care she meant to give  her care was all worry said sophy and it will be very lucky if i dont tell her so if she says her provoking things to mamma  but you wont believe them papa  most certainly not  yes you must tell her to be happy again continued sophy i cannot bear to see her looking sorrowful  last night when she fancied me asleep she criedoh till it made me miserable  and today i heard miss ferrars say to mrs annesley that her fine spirits were quite gone  you know it is very silly for i am the last person in all the world she ought to cry for  she has an infinite treasure of love said mr kendal and we have done very little that we should be blessed with it  there they are come home exclaimed sophy starting up as sounds were heard on the stairs and almost at the same moment albinia was in the room overflowing with contrition gladness and anxiety but something of sweetness in the first hasty greeting made the trust overcome all the rest and understanding his uppermost wish she stepped back to the staircase and in another second had put maurice into his arms blooming and contented and with a widemouthed smile for his papa  mr kendal held him fondly through all the hospitable welcomes of the aunts and his own explanations but to albinia it was all confusion and almost annoyance till she could take him upstairs and tell her own story  i am afraid you have been very much alarmed were his first words  i have done everything wrong from beginning to end said albinia oh edmund i am so glad you are come  now you will see the doctor and know whether it was as bad as all the rest to bring her to london  my dearest you must calm yourself and try to explain  you know i understand nothing yet except from your resolute little advocate downstairs and your own note which i could scarcely make out except that you were in great trouble  ah that note i wrote it in one of my impetuous fits  maurice used to say i ran frantic and grew irrational and so i did not know what i was saying to you and i brought that poor patient girl up here in all the heat and the journey hurt her so much that i dont know how we shall ever get her home again  oh edmund i am the worst wife and mother in the world and i undertook it all with such foolish confidence  mr kendal liked her impetuous fits as little as her brother did and was not so much used to them but he dealt with her in his quiet straightforward way  you are exaggerating now albinia and i do not wonder at it for you have had a great deal to startle and to try you  walking up and down is only heating and agitating you more sit down here and let me hear what gave you this alarm  the grave affection of his manner restrained her and his presence soothed the flutter of spirits though she still devoted herself with a sort of wilfulness to bear all the blame until he said this is foolish albinia it is of no use to look at anything but the simple truth  this affection of the spine must be constitutional and if neglect have aggravated the evil it must date from a much earlier period than since she has been under your charge  if any one be to blame it is myself for the apathy that prevented me from placing the poor things under proper care but i was hardly then aware that marias solicitude is always in the wrong place  but everybody declares that it was always visible and that no one could look at her without seeing that she was crooked  apres le coup said mr kendal  i grant you that a person of more experience might perhaps have detected what was amiss sooner than you did but you have only to regret the ignorance you shared with us all and you did your utmost according to your judgment  and a cruel utmost it was said albinia it is frightful to think what i inflicted and she endured in silence because i had not treated her so that she could bear to speak to me  that is over now said mr kendal you have conquered her at last pride could not hold out against such sweetness  it is her generosity said albinia i always knew she was the best of them all if one could but get at her  what have you done to her  i never heard her say half so much as she voluntarily said to me just now  poor dear  i believe the key of her heart was lost when edmund died and so all within was starved said albinia  yes as his eyes were suddenly raised and fixed on her i got to that at last no one has ever understood her since she lost her brother  she has a certain likeness to him  i knew she was his favourite sister but such a child as she was  children have deeper souls than you give them credit for said albinia  yes edmund you and sophy are very much alike  you had your study and poor sophy enclosed herself in a perpetual cocoon of study atmosphere and so you never found each other out till today  perhaps it was the influence of the frantic fit that caused her to make so direct a thrust but mr kendal was not offended  there was a good deal in the mere absence from habitual scenes and associations he always left a great deal of reserve behind him at bayford  you may be right albinia he said i sometimes think that amongst us you are like the old poets star confined into a tomb  such a compliment was a pretty reward for her temerity  returning to business she found that her journey was treated as more judicious than she deserved  the consequences had justified her decision  mr kendal knew it was the right thing to be done and was glad to have been spared the dreadful task of making up his mind to it  he sat down of his own accord to write a note to winifred beginning albinia was right as she always is and though his wife interlined albinia had no right to be right for she was inconsiderate as she always is she looked so brilliantly pretty and bright and was so full of sunny liveliness that she occasioned one of the very few disputes between her good aunts  miss ferrars declared that poor albinia was quite revived by the return to her old home and absence of care while mrs annesley insisted on giving the credit to mr kendal  they were perfectly agreed in unwillingness to part with their guests and as the doctor wished to see more of his patient the visit was prolonged to the enjoyment of all parties  sophy had received her sentence so easily that it was suspected that she did not realize the tedium of confinement and was relieved by being allowed to be inactive  until she should go home she might do whatever did not fatigue her but most sights and even the motion of the carriage were so fatiguing that she was much more inclined to remain at home and revel in the delightful world of books  the kind unobtrusive petting the absence of customary irritations the quiet highbred tone of the family so acted upon her as to render her something as agreeably new to herself as to other people  the glum mask was cast aside she responded amiably to kindness and attention allowed herself to be drawn into conversation and developed much more intelligence and depth than even albinia had given her credit for  one day when miss ferrars was showing mr kendal some illustrations of indian scenery a question arose upon the date of the native sovereign to whom the buildings were ascribed  mr kendal could not recollect but sophia looking up quietly pronounced the date and gave her reasons for it  miss ferrars asked how she could have learnt so much on an outoftheway topic  i read a book of the history of india up in the loft said sophy  that book exclaimed her father i wish you joy  i never could get through it  it is the driest chronicle i ever reada mere book of reference  what could induce you to read that  i would read anything about india and her tone though low and subdued betrayed such enthusiasm as could find nothing dry and this in a girl who had read aloud the reign of edward iii with stolid indifference  well i think i can promise you more interesting reading about india when we go home said mr kendal  the colour rose on sophys cheek  books out of papas study  could the world offer a greater privilege  she could scarcely pronounce thank you  very faithful to her birthplace said miss ferrars but she must have been very young when she came home  about five years old i believe said her father  you surely can remember nothing of talloon  i dont know said sophy mournfully i used  i thought indian children usually lost their eastern recollections very early said miss ferrars i never heard of one who could remember the sound of hindostanee a year after coming home  mr kendal entertained and gratified turned to his daughter and by way of experiment began a short sentence in hindostanee but the first sound brought a glow to her cheeks and with a hurried gesture she murmured please dont papa  albinia saw that feelings were here concerned which must not be played on in public and she hastily plunged into the discussion and drew it away from sophy  following her upstairs at bedtime she contrived to win from her an explanation  edmund had been seven years old at the time of the return to england fondly attached to some of the hindoo servants and with unusual intelligence and observation the gorgeous scenery and oriental habits of his first home had dwelt vividly in his imagination and he had always considered himself as only taken to england for a time to return again to india  thus he had been fond of romancing of the past and of the future and had never let his little sisters recollections fade entirely away  his father had likewise thought that it would save future trouble to keep up the boys knowledge of the language which would byandby be so important to them gilberts health had caused his studies to be often intermitted but edmund had constantly received instructions in the indian languages and whatever he learnt had been imparted to sophia  it was piteous to discover how much time the poor forlorn little girl had spent sitting on the floor in the loft poring over old grammars and phrasebooks and translations of missionary or government schoolbooks there accumulatedanything that related to india or that seemed to carry on what she had done with edmund and she had acquired just enough to give her a keen appetite for all the higher class of lore which she knew to reside in the unapproachable study those few familiar words from her father had overcome her because a trivial greeting in themselves they had been a kind of password between her and her brother  mr kendal was greatly touched and very remorseful for having left such a heart to pine in solitude while he was absorbed in his own lonely grief and albinia ventured to say i believe the greatest pleasure you could give her would be to help her to keep up the language  he smiled but said of what possible use could it be to her  i was not thinking of future use  it would be of immense present use to her to do anything with you and i can see that nothing would gratify her so much  besides i have been trying to think of all the new things i could set her to do  she must have lessons to fill up the day and i want to make fresh beginnings and not go back to the blots and scars of our old misunderstandings  you want me to teach her sanscrit because you cannot teach her italian  exactly so said albinia and the italian will spring all the better from the venerable root when we have forgotten how cross we used to be to each other over our relative pronouns  but there is hardly anything which i could let her read in those languages  very likely not but you can pick out what there is  do you remember the fable of the treasure that was to be gained by digging under the appletree and which turned out not to be gold but the fruit the consequence of digging  now i want you to dig sophy a sanscrit or a hindostanee or a persian treasure will do equally well as a pretext  if she had announced a taste for the differential calculus i should have said the same  only dig her as maurice dug me apropos to homer i wouldnt bother you only you see no one else could either do it or be the same to sophy  we will see how it is said mr kendal  with which albinia was obliged to be content but in the meantime she saw the two making daily progress in intimacy and mr kendal beginning to take a pride in his daughters understanding and information which he ascribed to albinia in spite of all her disclaimers  it was as if she had evoked the spirit of his lost son which had lain hidden under the sullen demeanour of the girl devoid indeed of many of edmunds charms but yet with the same sterling qualities and with resemblance enough to afford infinite and unexpected joy and compensation  mr kendal enjoyed his stay in town  he visited libraries saw pictures and heard music with the new zest of having a wife able to enter into his tastes  he met old friends and did not shrink immoderately from those of his wife nay he found them extremely agreeable and was pleased to see albinia welcomed  indeed his sojourn in her former sphere served to make him wonder that she could be contented with bayford and to find her of the whole party by far the most ready to return home  both he himself and sophy had an unavowed dread of the influence of willow lawn but albinia had a spring of spirits independent of place and though happy was craving for her duties anxious to have the journey over and afraid that london was making her little maurice pale  miss meadows was the first person whom they saw at willow lawn  two letters had passed both so conventionally civil that her state of mind could not be gathered from them but her first tones proved that coherence was more than ever wanting and no one attempted to understand anything she said while she enfolded sophy in an agitated embrace and marshalled them to the drawingroom where the chief of the apologies were spent upon sophys new couch which had been sent down the day before by the luggagetrain and which she and eweretta had attempted to put together in an impossible way failing which they had called in the carpenter who had made it worse  it was an untold advantage that she had to take the initiative in excuses  sophy was so meek with weariness that she took pretty well all the kind fidgeting that could not be averted from her and miss meadowss discourse chiefly tended to assurances that mrs kendal was right and grandmamma was nervousand poor mr bowlesit could not be expectedwith hints of the wonderful commotion the sudden flight to london had excited at bayford  as soon as mr kendal quitted the room these hints were converted into something between expostulation condolence and congratulation  it was so very fortunateso very lucky that dear mr kendal had come home with her forshe had said she would let mrs kendal hear if only that she might be on her guardpeople were so illnatured there never was such a place for gossipnot that she heard it from any one but mrs drury who really now had driven innot that she believed it but to ascertainfor mrs drury had been toldmentioning no namesoh no for fear of making mischiefshe had been told that mrs kendal had actually been into mr kendals study which was always kept locked up and there she had found something which had distressed her so much that she had gone to mr dusautoy and by his advice had fled from home to the protection of her brother in canada  without waiting for bluebeards asking for the key  oh maria cried albinia in a fit of laughter while sophia sat up on the sofa in speechless indignation  you may laugh mrs kendal if you please said maria with tart dignity i have told you nothing but the truth  i should have thought for my part but thats of no consequence it was as well to be on ones guard in a nest of vipers for edmunds sake if not for your own  and as this last speech convulsed albinia and rendered her incapable of reply miss meadows became pathetic  i am sure the pains i have taken to trace out and contradictand so nervous as grandmamma has beenim sure mrs drury said i that though edmund kendal does lock his study door nobody ever thought anything the housemaids go in to clean itand ive been in myself when the whitewashers were about the houseim sure mrs kendal is a most amiable young woman and you wouldnt raise reports  no she said but mrs osborn was positive that mrs kendal was nearly an hour shut up alone in the study the night of sophys accidentand so sudden she said the carriage being sent fornot a servant knew of itand then she said it was always the talk among the girls that mr kendal kept his study a forbidden place  then said sophia slowly as she looked full at her aunt it was the osborns who dared to say such wicked things  there now i never meant you to be there  you ought to be gone to bed child  it is not a thing for you to know anything about  i only want to know whether it was the osborns who invented these stories said sophy  my dear exclaimed albinia what can it signify  they are only a very good joke  i did not think there had been so much imagination in bayford  and off she went laughing again  they are very wicked said sophy aunt maria i will know if it was mrs osborn who told the story  sophys will was too potent for miss meadows and the admission was extracted in a burst of other odds and ends in the midst of which albinia beheld sophy cross the room with a deliberate determined step  flying after her she found her in the hall wrapping herself up  sophy what is this  what are you about  let me alone said sophy straining against her detaining hand i do not know when i shall recover again and i will go at once to tell the osborns that i have done with them  i stuck to them because i thought they were my mothers friends i did not guess that they would make an unworthy use of my friendship and invent wicked stories of my father and you  please dont make me laugh sophy for i dont want to affront you yes it is generous feeling i dont wonder you are angry but indeed silly nonsense like this is not worth it  it will die away of itself it must be dead already now they have seen we have not run away to canada  your heroics only make it more ridiculous  i must tell loo never to come here with her hypocrisy repeated sophy standing still but not yielding an inch  miss meadows pursued them at the same moment with broken protestations that they must forget it she never meant to make mischief c and the confusion was becoming worse confounded when mr kendal emerged from the study demanding what was the matter to the great discomfiture of maria who began hushing sophy and making signs to albinia that it would be dangerous for him to know anything about it  but albinia was already exclaiming heres a champion wanting to do battle with louisa osborn in our cause  oh edmund our neighbours could find no way of accounting for my taking french leave but by supposing that i took advantage of being shut in there while poor little maurice was squalling so furiously to rifle your secrets and detect something  so shocking that away i was fleeing to william in canada  obliging quietly said mr kendal  now dear edmundi knowfor my sakefor everythings sake remember you are a family man dont take any notice  i certainly shall take no notice of such folly said mr kendal and i wish that no one else should  what are you about sophia  tell mamma to let me go papa she exclaimed i must and will tell louisa that i hate her baseness and hypocrisy and then ill never speak to her again  why will mamma laugh  it is very wicked of them  wrong in them but laughing is the only way to treat it said mr kendal  go back to your sofa and forget it  your aunt and i have heard bayford reports before  sophy obeyed unwillingly she was far too much incensed to forget on her aunts taking leave and mr kendal offering his escort up the hill she rose up again and would have perpetrated a denunciation by letter had not albinia seriously argued with her and finding ridicule expediency and christian forgiveness all fail of hitting the mark said i dont know with what face you could attack louisa when you helped her to persecute poor genevieve because you thought she had an instrument of torture in her drawer  it was not i who said that said sophy blushing  you took part with those who did  and poor genevieve was a much more defenceless victim than papa or myself  i would not do so now  it does not take much individual blackness of heart to work up a fine promising slander  a surmise made in jest is repeated in earnest and all the other talebearers think they are telling simple facts  depend upon it the story did not get off from the osborns by any means as it came back to aunt maria  i should like to know  dont let us make it any worse and above all do not let us tell lucy  oh no said sophy emphatically  to albinias surprise no innuendo from mrs or miss meadows ever referred to her management having caused sophys misfortune and she secretly attributed this silence to mr kendals having escorted his sisterinlaw to her own house  sophys chief abode became the morningroom and she seemed very happy and tranquil thereshrinking from visitors but grateful for the kindness of parents brother and sister  mr kendal finding her really eager to learn of him began teaching her persian and was astonished at her promptness and intelligence he took increasing pleasure in her company gave her books to read and would sometimes tell the others not to stay at home for her sake as he should be about the house  he really gave up much time to her and used to carry her when the weather served to a couch in the garden for she could not bear the motion of wheels and was forbidden to attempt walking though she was to be in the air as much as possible so that albinia spent more time at home  the charge of sophy was evidently her business and after talking the matter over with mrs dusautoy she resigned though not without a pang the offices she had undertaken in the time of her superfluous activity and limited herself to occasional superintendence instead of undertaking constant employment in the parish  though she felt grieved and humiliated willow lawn throve the better for it and so did her own mind yes and even her temper which was far less often driven by overhaste into quick censure or unconsidered reply  her mistakes about sophia had been a lesson against onesided government  at first running into the other extreme she was ready to imagine that all the past illhumour had been the effect of her neglect and cruelty and sophys amiability almost warranted the notion  the poor girl herself had promised never to be cross again and fancied all temptation was over since she had found out mamma and papa was so kind to her  but all on a sudden down came the cloud again  nobody could detect any reason  affronts abounded not received with an explosion that would have been combated laughed at and disposed of but treated with silence and each sinking down to be added to the weight of cruel injuries  there was no complaint sophy obeyed all orders with her old form of dismal submission but everything proposed to her was distasteful and her answers were in the ancient surly style  if attempts were made to probe the malady her reserve was impenetrablenothing was the matter she wanted nothing was vexed at nothing  she pursued her usual occupations but as if they were hardships she was sullen towards her mamma snappishly brief with her aunt and sister and so ungracious and indifferent even with her father that albinia trembled lest he might withdraw the attention so improperly received when this dreary state of things had lasted more than a week he did tell her that if she were tired of the lessons it was not worth while to proceed but that he had hoped for more perseverance  the fear of losing these her great pride and pleasure overcame her she maintained her grim composure till he had left her but then fell into a violent fit of crying in which albinia found her and which dissolved the reserve into complaints that every one was very cruel and unkind and she was the most miserable girl in all the world papa was going to take away from her the only one thing that made it tolerable  reasoning was of no use to try to show her that it was her own behaviour that had annoyed him only made her mamma appear equally hardhearted and she continued wretched all the rest of the day refusing consolation and only so far improved that avowed discontent was better than sullenness  the next morning she found out that it was not the world that was in league against her but that she had fallen into the condition which she had thought past for ever  this was worst of all and her disappointment and dejection lasted not only all that long day but all the next making her receive all kindnesses with a brokendown woebegone manner and reply to all cheerful encouragements with despair about anything ever making her good  albinia tried to put her in mind of the source of all goodness but any visible acceptance of personal applications of religious teaching had not yet been accomplished  gradually all cleared up again and things went well till for some fresh trivial cause or no cause the whole process was repeated sulking injured innocence and bitter repentance  this time mr kendal pronounced this is low spirits far more than temper and he thenceforth dealt with these moods with a tender consideration that albinia admired though she thought at times that to treat them more like temper than spirits might be better for sophy but it was evident that the poor child herself had at present little if any power either of averting such an access or of shaking it off  the danger of her fathers treatment seemed to be that the humours would be acquiesced in like changes in the weather and that she might be encouraged neither to repent nor to struggle while her captivity made her much more liable to the tedium and sinking of heart that predisposed her to them  there seemed to be nothing to be done but to bear patiently with them while they lasted to console the victim afterwards lead her to prayer and resolute efforts and above all to pray for her as well as to avoid occasions of bringing them on but this was not possible since no one could live without occasional contradiction and sophy could sometimes bear a strong remonstrance or great disappointment when at others a hint or an almost imperceptible vexation destroyed her peace for days  mr kendal bore patiently with her variations and did his best to amuse away her gloom  it was wonderful how much of his own was gone and how much more alive he was  he had set himself to attack the five publichouses and seven beershops in tibbss alley and since his eyes had been once opened it seemed as if the disorders became more flagrant every day  at last he pounced on a misdemeanour which he took care should come before the magistrates and he was much annoyed to find the case dismissed for want of evidence  one sunday he beheld the end of a fray begun during servicetime he caused an information to be laid and went himself to the petty sessions to represent the case but the result was a nominal penalty  the admiral was a seeker of popularity and though owning that the town was in a shocking state and making great promises when talked to on general points yet he could never make up his mind to punish any poor fellow unless he himself were in a passion when he would go any length  the other magistrates would not interfere and all the satisfaction mr kendal obtained was being told how much he was wanted on the bench  one of the few respectable tibbss alleyites told him that it was of no use to complain for the publicans boasted of their impunity snapped their fingers at him and drank admiral osborns health as their friend  the consequence was that mr kendal took a magnanimous resolution ordered a copy of burns justice and at the september quarter sessions actually rode over to hadminster and took the oaths  on the whole the expectation was more formidable than the reality however much he disliked applying himself to business no one understood it better  the value of his good sense judgment and acuteness was speedily felt  mr nugent the chairman depended on him as his ally and often as his adviser and as he was thus made to feel himself of weight and importance his aversion subsided and he almost learnt to look forward to a chat with mr nugent or whether he looked forward to it or not there could be no doubt that he enjoyed it  though still shy grave silent and inert there was a great alteration in him since the time when he had had no friends no interests no pursuits beyond his study and there was every reason to think that in spite of the many severe shocks to his mauvaise honte he was a much happier man  his wife could not regret that his magisterial proceedings led to a coolness with the osborns augmented by a vestrymeeting at which mr dusautoy had begged him to be present  the admiral and his party surpassed themselves in their virulence against whatever the vicar proposed until they fairly roused mr kendals ire and he came out upon them all like a lion and with force appearing the greater from being so seldom exerted he represented mr dusautoys conduct in appropriate terms showing full appreciation of his merits and holding up their own course before them in its true light till they had nothing to say for themselves  it was the vicars first visible victory  the increased congregation showed how much way he had made with the poor and mr kendal taking his part openly drew over many of the tradespeople who had begun to feel the influence of his hearty nature and consistent uprightness and had become used to what had at first appeared innovations  mr dusautoy in thanking mr kendal begged him to allow himself to be nominated his churchwarden next easter and having consented while his blood was up there was no danger that however he might dislike the prospect he would falter when the time should come     chapter x    it was a green yule a christmas like an april day and even the lengthening days and strengthening cold of january attaining to nothing more than three slight hoarfrosts each quickly melting into mud and the last concluding in rain and fog  what would willow lawn have been without the drainage albinia often thought when she paddled down the wet streets and saw the fields flooded  the damp had such an effect upon sophys throat temper and whole nervous system that her moods had few intervals and albinia wrote to the surgeon a detail of her symptoms asking if she had not better be removed into a more favourable air  but he pronounced that the injury of the transport would outbalance the casual evils of the bad weather and as the rain and fog mitigated she improved but there were others on whom the heavy moist air had a more fatal effect  one morning mr kendal saw his wife descending the picturesque rugged stone staircase that led outside the house to the upper stories of the old block of buildings under the hill nearly opposite to willow lawn  she came towards him with tears still in her eyes as she said poor mrs simkins has just lost her little girl and i am afraid the two boys are sickening  what do you mean  is the fever there again exclaimed mr kendal in the utmost consternation  did you not know it  lucy has been very anxious about the child who was in her class  you have not taken lucy to a house with a fever  no i thought it safer not though she wanted very much to go  but you have been going yourself  it was a low lingering fever  i had not thought it infectious and even now i believe it is only one of those that run through an overcrowded family  the only wonder is that they are ever well in such a place  dear edmund dont be angry it is what i used to do continually at fairmead  i never caught anything and there is plenty of chloride of lime and all that  i never imagined you would disapprove  it is the very place where the fever began before said mr kendal almost under his breath  instead of going into the house he made her turn into the garden where little maurice was being promenaded in the sun  he stretched out from his nurses arms to go to them and albinia was going towards him but her husband held her fast and said i beg you will not take the child till you have changed your dress  albinia was quite subdued alarmed at the effect on him  you must go away at once he said presently  how soon can you be ready  you had better take lucy and maurice at once to your brothers  they will excuse the liberty when they know the cause  and pray what is to become of poor sophy  never going out there may be the less risk for her  i will take care of her myself  as if i was going to endure that cried albinia  no no edmund i am not likely to run away from you and sophy  you may send lucy off if you like but certainly not me or if you do i shall come back the same evening  i should be much happier if you were gone  thank you but what should i be  no if it were to be caught here which i dont believe now the pond is gone it would be of no use to send me away after i have been into the house with it  her resolution and sophys need prevailed and most unwillingly mr kendal gave up the point  she was persuaded that he was acting on a panic the less to be wondered at after all he had suffered  she thought the chief danger was from the effect of his fears and would fain have persuaded him to remain at fairmead with lucy but she was not prepared to hear him insist on likewise removing maurice  she had promised not to enter the sick room again and pleaded that the little boy need never be taken into the streetthat the fever was not likely to come across the running streamthat the fairmead nursery was full enough already  mr kendal was inexorable  i hope you may never see what i have seen he said gravely and albinia was silenced  a man who had lost so many children might be allowed to be morbidly jealous of the health of the rest  but it was a cruel stroke to her to be obliged to part with her noble little boy just when his daily advances in walking and talking made him more charming than ever her eyes were full of tears and she struggled to choke back some pettish rebellious words  you do not like to trust him with susan said mr kendal you had better come with him  no said albinia i ought to stay here and if you judge it right maurice must go  ill go and speak to susan  and away she ran for she had no power just then to speak in a wifely manner  it was not easy to respect a man in a panic so extremely inconvenient  he was resolved on an immediate start and the next few hours were spent in busy preparation and in watching lest the excited lucy should frighten her sister  albinia tried to persuade mr kendal at least to sleep at fairmead that night and after watching him drive off she hurried dashing away the tears that would gather again and again in her eyes to hold council with the dusautoys on the best means of stopping the course of the malady by depriving it of its victims  she had a quiet snug evening with sophy whom she had so much interested in the destitution of the sick children as to set her to work at some nightgear for them and she afterwards sat long over the fire trying to read to silence the longing after the little soft cheek that had never yet been laid to rest without her caress and foreboding that mr kendal would return from his dark solitary drive with his spirits at the lowest ebb  so late that she had begun to hope that winifred had obeyed her behest and detained him she heard his step and before she could run to meet him he had already shut himself into the study  she was at the door in a moment she feared he had thought her selfwilled in the morning and she was the more bent on rousing him she knockedshe opened the door  he had thrown himself into his armchair and was bending over the dreary smouldering sulky log and white ashes and his face as he raised his head was as if the whole load of care and sorrow had suddenly descended again  i am sorry you sat up was of course his beginning conveying anything but welcome but she knew that this only meant that he was in a state of depression  she took hold of his hand chilled with holding the reins told him of the good fire in the morningroom and fairly drew him upstairs  there the lamp burnt brightly and the red fire cast a merry glow over the shining chintz curtains and the two chairs drawn so cosily towards the fire the kettle puffing on the hearth and albinias choice little bedroom set of teachina ready on the small table the cheerfulness seemed visibly to diffuse itself over his face but he still struggled to cherish his gloom thank you but i would not have had you take all this trouble my dear  it would be a great deal more trouble if you caught a bad cold  i meant you to sleep at fairmead  yes they pressed me very kindly but i could not bear not to come home  and how did maurice comport himself  he talked to the horse and then went to sleep and he was not at all shy with his aunt after the first  he watched the children but had not begun to play with them  still i think he will be quite happy with lucy there and i hope it will not be for long  it was a favourable sign that mr kendal communicated all these particulars without being plied with questions and albinia went on with the more spirit  no i hope it may not be for long  we have been holding a great council against the enemy and i do hope that we have really done something  no you need not be afraid i have not been there again but we have been routing out the nucleus and hope we may starve out the fever for want of victims  you never saw such a swarm as we had to turn out  there were twentythree people to be considered for  twentythree  have you turned out the whole block  no i wish we had but that would have been seventyfive  this is only from those two tenements with one door  impossible  i should have thought so but the lawful inhabitants make up sixteen and there were seven lodgers  mr kendal gave a kind of groan and asked what she had done she detailed the measures  twentythree people in those two houses and seventyfive in the whole block of building  too true  and if you could only see the rooms  the windows that wont open the roofs that open too much the dirt on the staircases and oh the horrible smells  it shall not go on said mr kendal  i will look over the place  not till the fever is out of it hastily interposed albinia  he made a sign of assent and went on  i will certainly talk to pettilove and have the place repaired if it be at my own expense  albinia lifted up her eyes not understanding at whose expense it should be  the fact is continued mr kendal that there has been little to induce me to take interest in the property  old mr meadows was as you know a successful solicitor and purchased these various town tenements bit by bit and then settled them very strictly on his grandson  he charged the property with life incomes to his widow and daughters and to me but the land is in the hands of trustees until my sons majority and pettilove is the only surviving trustee  the burning colour mantled in albinias face and almost inaudibly she said i beg your pardon edmund i have done you moat grievous injustice  i thought you would not see  you did not think unjustly my dear  i ought to have paid more attention to the state of affairs and have kept pettilove in order but i knew nothing of english affairs and was glad to be spared the unpleasant charge  the consequence of leaving a man like that irresponsible never occurred to me  his whole conscience in the matter is to have a large sum to put into gilberts hands when he comes of age  why he upholds those dens of iniquity in tibbss alley on that very ground  poor gilbert  i am afraid a large sum so collected is not likely to do him much good and at oneandtwenty but that is one notion of faithfulness  albinia was much happier after that conversation  she could better endure to regret her own injustice than to believe her husband the cruel landlord and it was no small advance that he had afforded her an explanation which once he would have deemed beyond the reach of female capacity  in spite of the lack of little maurices bright presence which to albinias great delight his father missed as much as she did the period of quarantine sped by cheerfully  sophy had not a single sullen fit the whole time and albinia having persuaded mr kendal that it would be a sanatory measure to whitewash the study ceiling he was absolutely forced to turn out of it and live in the morningroom with all his books piled up in the diningroom  and on that great occasion albinia abstracted two fusty faded green canvas blinds from the windows carried them off with a pair of tongs and pushed them into a bonfire in the garden persuaded they were the last relics of the old fever  she had the laurels cut the curtains changed the windows cleaned and altogether made the room so much lighter that when mr kendal again took possession he did not look at all sure whether he liked it and though he was courteously grateful he did not avail himself of the den half so much as when it had more congenial gloom  but then he had the morningroom as a resort and it was one of albinias bargains with herself that as far as her own influence could prevent it neither he nor sophy should ever render it a literal boudoir  the sense of snugness that the small numbers produced was one great charm and made mr kendal come unusually far out of his shell  his chief sanatory precaution was to take albinia out for a drive or walk every day and these expeditions were greatly enjoyed  one day after a visit from her old nurse sophy received albinia with the words  oh mamma she said old nurse has been telling me such things  i shall never be cross with aunt maria again  it is such a sad story just like one in a book if she was but that kind of person  aunt maria  i remember mrs dusautoy once saying she gave her the idea of happiness shattered but  did she exclaimed sophy  i never thought aunt maria could have done anything but fidget everybody that came near her but old nurse says a gentleman was once in love with her and a very handsome young gentleman too  old mr pringles nephew it was a very fine young officer in the army  i want you to ask papa if it is true  nurse says that he wrote to make an offer for her very handsomely but grandpapa did not choose that both his daughters should go quite away so he locked the letter up and said no and never told her and she thought the captain had been trifling and playing her false and pined and fretted till she got into this nervous way and fairly wore herself out nurse says and came to be what she is now instead of the prettiest young lady in the town  and then mamma when grandpapa died she found the letter in his papers and one inside for her that had never been given to her and by that time there was no hope for captain pringle had gone out with his regiment and married a rich young lady in the indies  oh mamma you see she really is deserted and it is all mans treachery that has broken her heart  i thought people always died or went into conventsi dont mean that aunt maria could have done that but i did not think that way of hers was a broken heart  if she has had such troubles it should indeed make us try to be very forbearing with her said albinia  will you ask papa about it entreated sophy  yes certainly but you must not make sure whether he will think it right to tell us  poor aunt maria i do think some part of it must be true  but mamma is that really like deserted love  my dear i dont think i ever saw deserted love said albinia rather amused  i suppose troubles of any kind if noti mean i suppose vexationsmake people show their want of spirits in the way most accordant with their natural dispositions and so your poor aunt has grown querulous and anxious  if she has such a real grand reason for being unhappy i shall not be cross about it now except  sophy gave a sigh and albinia bade her good night  mr kendal had never heard the story before but he remembered many circumstances in corroboration  he knew that mr pringle had a nephew in the army he recollected that he had made a figure in marias letters to india and that he had subsequently married a lady in the mauritius and settled down on her fathers estate  he testified also to the bright gay youth of poor maria and his surprise at the premature loss of beauty and spirits and from his knowledge of old mr meadows he believed him capable of such an act of domestic tyranny  maria had always been looked upon as a mere child and if her father did not choose to part with her he would think it for her good and his own peace for her not to be aware of the proposal  he was much struck for he had not suspected his sisterinlaw to be capable of such permanent feeling  there was little to help her in driving it away said albinia few occupations or interests and very little change to prevent it from preying on her spirits  true said mr kendal a narrow education and limited sphere are sad evils in such cases  do you think anything can be a cure for disappointment asked sophy in such a solemn earnest tone that albinia was disposed to laugh but she knew that this would be a dire offence and was much surprised that sophy had so far broken through her reserve as to mingle in their conversation on such a subject  occupation said mr kendal but speaking rather as if from duty than from conviction  there are many sources of happiness even if shipwreck have been made on one venture  your aunt had few resources to which to turn her mind  every pursuit or study is a help stored up against the vacuity which renders every care more corroding  well said sophy in her blunt downright way i think it would take all the spirit out of everything  i hope you will never be tried said mr kendal with a mournful smile as if he did not choose to confess that she had divined too rightly the probable effect of trouble upon her own temperament  i suppose said albinia that the real cure can be but one thing for that as for any other trouble  i mean thy will be done  i dont suppose anything else would give energy to turn to other duties  but it would be more to the purpose to resolve to be more considerate to poor maria  i shall never be impatient with her again said sophy  and though at first the discovery of so romantic a cause for poor miss meadowss fretfulness dignified it in sophys eyes yet it did not prove sufficient to make it tolerable when she tormented the windowblinds teased the fire was shocked at sophys favourite studies or insisting on her wishing to see maria drury  nay the bathos often rendered her petty unconscious provocations the more harassing and sophy often felt in an agony of selfreproach that she ought to have known herself too well to expect to show forbearance with any one when she was under the influence of illtemper  in easter week mr ferrars brought lucy and maurice home and gilbert came for a short holiday  gilbert was pleased when he was called to go over the empty houses with his father mr ferrars and a mason  back they came horrified at the dreadful disrepair at the narrow area into which such numbers were crowded and still more at the ill odours which mr ferrars and the mason had gallantly investigated till they detected the absence of drains as well as convinced themselves that mending roofs floors or windows would be a mere mockery unless the whole were pulled down  mr ferrars was more than ever thankful to be a country parson and mused on the retribution that the miasma fostered by the avarice of the grandfather and the neglect of the father had brought on the family  dives cannot always scorn lazarus without suffering even in this life  gilbert in the glory of castlebuilding was talking eagerly of the thorough renovation that should take place the sweep that should be made of all the old tenements and the wide healthy streets and model cottages that should give a new aspect to the town  mr kendal prepared for the encounter with pettilove and his son begged to go with him to which he consented saying that it was time gilbert should have an opinion in a matter that affected him so nearly  gilberts opinion of the interview was thus announced on his return if there ever was a brute in the world it is that pettilove  then he wont consent to do anything  no indeed  say what my father or i would to him it was all of not the slightest use  he smiled and made little intolerable nods and regrettedbut there were the settlements and his late lamented partner  a parcel of stuff  not so much as a broken window will he mend  he says he is not authorized  quite true said mr kendal  the man is warranted in his proceedings and thinks them his duty though i believe he has a satisfaction in the power of thwarting me  im sure he has cried gilbert  i am sure there was spite in his grin when he pulled out that horrid old parchment with the lines a yard long and read us out the abominable old crabbed writing all about the houses messuages and tenements thereupon and a lot of lawyers jargon  im sure i thought it was left to peter pettilove himself  and when i came to understand it one would have thought it took my father to be the worst enemy we had in the world bent on cheating us  that is the assumption on which settlements are drawn up gilbert said his father  can nothing be done then said albinia  thus much said mr kendal  pettilove will not object to our putting the houses somewhat in repair as in fact that will be making a present to gilbert but he will not spend a farthing on them of the trust except to hinder their absolute falling nor will he make any regulation on the number of lodgers  as to taking them down that is as i always supposed out of the question though i think the trustees might have stretched a point being certain of both my wishes and gilberts  dont you think said mr ferrars looking up from his book that a sanatory commission might be got to override gilberts guardian  my guardian do not call him so muttered gilbert  i am afraid said mr kendal that unless your commission emulated of albinia and dusautoy they would have little perception of the evils  our local authorities are obtuse in such matters  agitate agitate murmured mr ferrars going on with his book  well said albinia at least there is one beershop less in tibbss alley  and if there are tolerable seasons i daresay paint whitewash and windows to open may keep the place moderately wholesome tillare you sixteen yet gilbert  five years  yes and then  gilbert came and sat down beside her and they built a scheme for the almshouses so much wanted  gilbert was sure the accumulation would easily cover the expense and albinia had many an old woman who it was hoped might live to enjoy the intended paradise there  yes yes i promise cried gilbert warming with the subject the first thing i shall do  no dont promise said albinia  do it from your heart or not at all  no dont promise gilbert said sophy  why not sophy he said goodhumouredly  because you are just what you feel at the moment said sophy  you dont think i should keep it  no  the grave answer fell like lead and albinia told her she was not kind or just to her brother  but she still looked steadily at him and answered i cannot help it  what is truth is truth and gilbert cares only for what he sees at the moment  what is truth need not always be fully uttered said albinia  i hope you may find it untrue  but sophys words would recur and weigh on her painfully     chapter xi    the summer had just begun when notice was given that a confirmation would take place in the autumn and lucys name was one of the first sent in to mr dusautoy  his plan was to collect his candidates in weekly classes of a few at a time and likewise to see as much as he could of them in private  oh mamma exclaimed lucy returning from her first class mr dusautoy has given us each a paper where we are to set down our christening days and our godfathers and godmothers  and only think i had not the least notion when i was christened  i could tell nothing but that mr wenlock was my godfather  it made me feel quite foolish not to know my godmothers  we were in no situation to have things done in order said mr kendal gravely  if i recollect rightly one of your godmothers was captain lees pretty young wife who died a few weeks after  and the other said lucy  your mother i believe he said  lucy employed herself in filling up her paper and exclaimed now i do not know the date  can you tell me that papa  it was the christmasday next after your birth he said  i remember that for we took you to spend christmas at the nearest station of troops and the chaplain christened you  lucy wrote down the particulars and exclaimed what an old baby i must have been  six months old  and i wonder when sophy was christened  i never knew who any of her godfathers and godmothers were  did you sophy  no she was looking up at her father  a sudden flush of colour came over his face and he left the room in haste  why sophy exclaimed lucy one would think you had not been christened at all  even the light lucy was alarmed at the sound of her own words  the same idea had thrilled across albinia but on turning her eyes on sophy she saw a countenance flushed anxious but full rather of trembling hope than of dismay  in a few seconds mr kendal came back with a thick red pocketbook in his hand and produced the certificate of the private baptism of sophia daughter of edmund and lucy kendal at talloon march 17th 1838  sophys face had more disappointment in it than satisfaction  i can explain the circumstances to you now said her father  at talloon we were almost out of reach of any chaplains and as you know were almost the only english  we always intended to take you to the nearest station as had been done with lucy but your dear mother was never well enough to bear the journey and when our next little one was born it was so plain that he could not live that i sent in haste to beg that the chaplain would come to us  it was then that you were both baptized and before the week was over he buried little henry  it was the first of our troubles  we never again had health or spirits for any festive occasion while we continued in india and thus the ceremony was never completed  in fact i take shame to myself for having entirely forgotten that you had never been received into the congregation  then i have told a falsehood whenever i said the catechism burst out sophy  lucy would have laughed and albinia could almost have been amused at the turn her displeasure had taken  it was not your fault said mr kendal quietly  he evidently wished the subject to be at an end excepting that in silence he laid before albinias eyes the certificate of the baptism of the twinbrothers not long after the first arrival in india  he then put the book in his pocket and began as usual to read aloud  oh dont go mamma said sophy when she had been carried to her own room at bedtime and made ready for the night  albinia was only too glad to linger in the hope to be admitted into some of the recesses of that untransparent nature and by way of assistance said i was not at all prepared for this discovery  sophy drew a long sigh and said if i had never been christened i should have thought there was some hope for me  that would have been too dreadful  how could you imagine your papa capable  i thought i had found out why i am so horrid exclaimed sophy  oh if i could only make a fresh beginning  mamma do pray give me a prayer book  albinia gave it to her and she hastily turned the pages to the order for private baptism  at least i have not made the promises and vows she said as if her stern conscientiousness obtained some relief  not formally made them said albinia but you cannot have a right to the baptismal blessings except on those conditions  mamma then i never had the sign of the cross on my forehead  it does not feel blest  and then hastily and low she muttered oh is that why i never could bear the cross in all my life  nay my poor sophy yon must not think of it like a spell  many bear the cross no better who have had it marked on their brows  can it be done now cried sophy eagerly  certainly i think it ought to be done  we will see what your father says  oh mamma beg him pray him exclaimed sophy  i know it will make me begin to be good  i cant bear not to be one of those marked and sealed  oh and mamma you will be my godmother  cant you if the gleams of goodness and brightness do find me out they are always from you  i think i might be dear child said albinia but mr dusautoy must tell us whether i may  but indeed i am afraid to see you reckon too much on this  the essential the regenerating grace is yours already and can save you from yourself and confirmation adds the restbut you must not think of any of these like a charm which will save you all further trouble with yourself  they do not kill the faults but they enable you to deal with them  even baptism itself you know has destroyed the guilt of past sin but does not hinder subsequent temptation  albinia hardly knew how far sophy attended to this caution for all she said was to reiterate the entreaty that the omitted ceremony might be supplied  mr kendal gave a ready consent as soon as he was told that sophy so ardently wished for itso willing indeed that albinia was surprised until he went on to say no one need be aware of the matter beyond ourselves  your brother and sister would i have no doubt act as sponsors  nay if ferrars would officiate we need hardly mention it even to dusautoy  it could take place in your sittingroom  but edmund began albinia aghast would that be the right thing i hardly think maurice would consent  you are not imagining anything so preposterous or inexpedient as to wish to bring sophia forward in church said mr kendal even if she were physically capable of it i should not choose to expose her to anything so painful or undesirable  i am afraid then said albinia that it will not be done at all it is not receiving her into the congregation to have this service read before halfadozen people in my sittingroom  better not have it done at all then said mr kendal  it is not essential  i will not have her made a spectacle  will you only consult mr dusautoy  i do not wish mr dusautoy to interfere in my family regulations  i mean that i have a great respect for him but as a clergyman and one wedded to form he would not take into account the great evil of making a public display and attracting attention to a girl of her age station and disposition  and in fact added mr kendal with the same scrupulous candour as his daughter always showed for the sake of my own position and the effect of example i should not wish this unfortunate omission to be known  i suspect said albinia that the example of repairing it would speak volumes of good  it is mere absurdity to speak of it said mr kendal  the poor child is not to leave her couch yet for weeks  sophy was told in the morning that the question was under consideration and lucy was strictly forbidden to mention the subject  when next mr kendal came to read with sophy she said imploringly papa have you thought  yes he said i have done so but your mamma thinks and on examination of the subject i perceive she is right that the service has no meaning unless it take place in the church  yes said sophy but you know i am to be allowed to go about in july  you will hardly be equal to any fatigue even then i fear my dear and you would find this publicity extremely trying and unpleasant  it would not last ten minutes said sophy and i am sure i should not care  i should have something else to think about  oh papa when my forehead aches with surliness it does feel so unblest so uncrossed and she put her hand over it and all the books and hymns seem not to belong to me  i think i shall be able to keep off the tempers when i have a right in the cross  ah my child i am afraid the tempers are a part of your physical constitution he returned mournfully  you mean that i am like you papa said sophy  i think i might at least learn to be really like you and if i must feel miserable not to be unkind and sulky  and then i should leave off even the being unhappy about nothing  her eyes brightened but her father shook his head sadly and said you would not be like me my dear if depression never made you selfish  but he added with an effort you will not suffer so much from low spirits when you are in better health and able to move about  oh no exclaimed sophy i often feel so sick of lying here that i feel as if i never could be sulky if only i might walk about and go from one room to another when i please  but papa you will let me be admitted into the church when i am able will you not  it shall be well weighed sophy  sophy knew her father too well and had too much reticence to say any more  he was certainly meditating deeply and reading too indeed he would almost have appeared to have a fit of the study but for little maurice a tyrannical little gentleman who domineered over the entire household and would have been grievously spoilt if his mother had not taken all the crossing the stout little will upon herself  he had a gallant pair of legs and the disposition of a young centaur he seemed to divide the world into things that could be ridden on and that could not and when he bounced at the study door with papa gee gee and lifted up his round rosy face and despotic blue eyes mr kendals foot was at his service and the study was brown no longer  the result of mr kendals meditations was an invitation to his wife to drive with him to fairmead  that was a most enjoyable drive the weather too hot and sunny perhaps for albinias preferences but thoroughly penetrating and giving energy to her eastindian husband and making the whole country radiant with sunny beautythe waving hayfields falling before the mowers scythe the ranks of haymakers tossing the fragrant grass the growing corn softly waving in the summer breeze the river blue with reflected sky the hedges glowing with stately foxgloves or with blushing wreaths of eglantine  and how cool fresh and fair was the beechavenue at fairmead  yet though albinia came to it with the fond tenderness of old association it was not with the regretful clinging of the first visit when it seemed to her the natural home to which she still really belonged  nor had she the least thought about producing an impression of her own happiness and scarcely any whether edmund would be amused and at ease though knowing he had a stranger to encounter in the person of winifreds sister mary reid  that was not a long day  it was only too short though mr and mrs kendal stayed three hours longer than on the last occasion  mr kendal faced mary reid without flinching and she having been previously informed that albinias husband was the most silent and shy man in existence began to doubt her sisters veracity  and albinia instead of dealing out a shower of fireworks to hide what if not gloom was at least twilight was now temperately bright talking naturally of what most concerned her with the sprightliness of her happy temper but without effort and gratifying winifred by a great deal more notice of the new niece and namesake than she had ever bestowed on either of her predecessors in their infant days moreover lucys two long visits had made mrs ferrars feel a strong interest in her and with a sort of maternal affection she inquired after the cuttings of the myrtle which she had given her  ah said albinia i never honoured gardening so much  i know you would never respect it in me  as you know i love a walk with an object and never could abide breaking my back pottering over a pink with a stem that wont support it and a calyx that wont hold it  and lucy converted you when i could not  if you had known my longing for some wholesome occupation for her such as could hurt neither herself nor any one else and the pleasure of seeing her engrossed by anything innocent making it so easy to gratify her  why a new geranium is a constant fund of ecstasy and i do not believe she was ever so grateful to her father in her life as when he gave her a forcingframe  anything is a blessing that makes people contented at home and takes them out of themselves  lucy is a very nice pleasant inmate her ready obligingness and facility of adapting herself make her very agreeable  yes said albinia she is the very woman taking her complexion from things around and so she will go smoothly through the world and be always preferred to my poor turbid deepsouled sophy  are you going to be very angry with me  ah you do not know sophy  poor dear child  i do so long that she could haveif it were but one day one hour of real free glowing happiness  i think it would sweeten and open her heart wonderfully just to have known it  if i could but see any chance of it but i am afraid her health will always be against her and oh that dreadful sense of depression  do you know winifred i do think love would be the best chance  now dont laugh i do assure you there is no reason sophy should not be very handsome  quite as handsome as the owls children my dear  well the owls are the only young birds fit to be seen  but i tell you sophys profile is as regular as her fathers and animation makes her eyes beautiful and she has grown immensely since she has been lying down so that she will come out without that disproportioned look  if her eyebrows were rather less marked and her complexionbut that will clear  yes we will make her a beauty when we are about it  and after all affection is the great charm and if she were attached it would be so intenselyand happiness would develop so much that is glorious only hidden down so deep  i hope you may find her a male albinia said winifred a little wickedly but take care  it might be kill or cure and i fancy when sunshine is attracted by shadow it is more often as it was in your case than vice versa  take care repeated albinia affronted  you dont fancy i am going beyond a vague wish do you  and rather a premature one  how old is sophy  towards fourteen but years older in thought and in suffering  albinia did not hear the result of the conference with her brother till she had resumed her seat in the carriage after having been surprised by mr kendal handing in three tall theological tomes they both had much to think over as they drove home in the lengthening shadows  albinia was greatly concerned that winifreds health had become affected and that her ordinary home duties were beyond her strength  albinia had formerly thought fairmead parsonage did not give her enough to do but now she saw the gap that she had left and she had fallen into a maze of musings over schemes for helping winifred before mr kendal spoke telling her that he had resolved that sophias admission into the church should take place as soon as she was equal to the exertion  albinia asked if she should speak to mr dusautoy but the manliness of mr kendals character revolted from putting off a confession upon his wife so he went to church the next morning and saw the vicar afterwards  mr dusautoys first thought was gratitude for the effort that the resolution must have cost both mr kendal and his daughter his next how to make the occasion as little trying to their feelings as was consistent with his duty and theirs  he saw sophy and tried to draw her out but though far from sullen she did not reply freely however he was satisfied and he wished her likewise to consider herself under preparation for confirmation in the autumn  she did all that he wished quietly and earnestly but without much remark her confidence only came forth when her feelings were strongly stirred and it was remarkable that throughout this time of preparation there was not the remotest shadow of illtemper  mr kendal insisted that her london doctor should come to see her at the years end  the improvement had not been all that had been hoped but it was decided that though several hours of each day must still be spent on her back she might move about join the meals and do whatever she could without overfatigue  it seemed a great release but it was a shock to find how very little she could do at first now that she had lost the habit of exertion and of disregard of her discomforts  she had quite shot up to more than the ordinary womans height and was much taller than her sisterbut this hardly gave the advantage albinia had hoped for she had a weak overgrown look and could not help stooping  a number of people in a room or even the sitting upright during a morning call seemed quite to overcome and exhaust her but still the return to ordinary life was such great enjoyment that she endured all with good temper  but now the churchgoing was possible a fit of exceeding dread came upon her  albinia found her with the tears silently rolling down her cheeks almost as if she were unconscious of them  oh mamma i can never do it  i know what i am  i cant let them say i will keep all the commandments always  it will not be true  it will be true that you have the steadfast purpose my dear  how can it be steadfast when i know i cant  it was the old story and all had to be argued through again how the obligation was already incurred at her baptism and how it was needful that she should be sworn to her own side of the great covenanthow the power would be given and the grace supplied but that the will and purpose to obey was requiredand then sophy recurred to that blessing of the cross for which she longed so earnestly and which again albinia feared she was regarding in the light of a talisman  mr ferrars was to be her godfather  mr kendal had wished aunt winifred as lucy called her to be the godmother but sophy had begged earnestly for mrs dusautoy whose kindness had made a great impression  there was not much liking between mrs ferrars and sophy  perhaps sophy had been fretted and angered by her quick decided ways and rather disgusted by the enthusiasm of her brother and sister about fairmead and she was not gratified by hearing that winifred was to accompany her husband in order to try the experiment of a short absence from cares and children  albinia on the contrary was highly pleased to have winifred to nurse and desirous of showing off sophys reformation  winifred arrived late in the day with an invalid look and a great inclination to pine for her baby  she was so much tired that albinia took her upstairs very soon and put her to bed sitting with her almost all the evening hoping that downstairs all was going on well  the next morning too went off very well  mr ferrars sought a private talk with his old godchild and though sophy scarcely answered she liked his kind frank affectionate manner and showed such feeling as he wished so that he fully credited all that his sister thought of her  otherwise sophy was kept quiet to gave her strength and collect her thoughts  at seven oclock in the evening there was not a formidable congregation  miss meadows who had been informed as late as could save offence had treated it as a freak of mrs kendal resented the injunction of secrecy and would neither be present herself nor let her mother come out  genevieve three old men and a child or two were the whole number present  the daily service at bayford was an offering made in faith by the vicar for as yet there was very little attendance  but said mr dusautoy it is the worship of god not an entertainment to please manit is all nonsense to talk of its answering or not answering  mr kendal was in a state of far greater suffering from shame than his daughter as indeed he deserved but he endured it with a gallant almost touching resignation  he was the only witness of her baptism and it seemed like a confession when he had to reply to the questions by whom and with what words this child had been baptized when she stood beside him overtopping her little godmother  she stood with tightlylocked hands and ebbing colour which came back in a flood when mr dusautoy took her by the hand and said we receive this child into the congregation and when he traced the cross on her brow she stood tremblingly her lips squeezed close together and after she returned to her place no one saw her face  albinia with her brother and lucy were at home by the short cut before the carriage could return  she met sophy at the halldoor kissed her and said now my dear you had better lie down and be quite quiet then followed winifred into the drawingroom and took her shawl and bonnet from her lingering for a happy twilight conversation  lucy came down and went to water her flowers and byandby tea was brought the gentlemen came in from their walk and mr kendal asked whether sophy was tired  albinia went up to see she found her on her couch in the morning room and told her that tea was ready  there was something not promising in the voice that replied and she said  no dont move my dear i will bring it to you you are tired  noill go down thank you  it was the gruff voice  indeed you had much better not my dear  it is only an hour to bedtime and you would only tire yourself for nothing  ill go  you are tired sophy said her father you had better lie down while you have your tea  no thank you growled sophy as though hurt by being told to lie down before company  her father put a sofacushion behind her but though she mumbled some acknowledgment it was so surly that mrs ferrars looked up in surprise and she would not lean back till fatigue gained the ascendancy  mr kendal asking her got little in reply but such a grunt that mrs ferrars longed to shake her but her father fetched a footstool and put it under her feet and grew a little abstracted in his talk as if watching her and his eye had something of the old habitual melancholy  so it went on  the nights rest did not carry off the temper  sophy was monosyllabic displeased if not attended to but receiving attention like an affront wanting nothing but offended if it were not offered  albinia was exceedingly grieved  she had some suspicion that sophy might have been hurt by her going to mrs ferrars instead of to her on their return from church and made an attempt at an apology but this was snubbed like an additional affront and she could only bide the time and be greatly disappointed at such an exhibition before the guests  winifred looked on forbearing to hurt albinias feelings by remarks but in private compensating by little outbreaks with her husband teasing him about his hopeful goddaughter laughing at albinias infatuation and railing at mr kendals endurance of the illhumour which she declared he promoted  maurice as usual was provoking  he had no notion of giving up his godchild he said and he had no doubt that edmund kendal could manage his own child his own way  because of his great success in that line  he is not what he was  he uses his sense and principle now and when they are fairly brought to bear i know no one whom i would more entirely trust  well it will be great good luck if i do not fall foul of miss sophy one of these days if no one else will  winifred was slightly irritable herself from weakness and on the last morning of her stay she could bear the sight no longer  sophy had twice been surly to lucys good offices had given albinia a look like thunder and answered her father with a sulky displeasure that made mrs ferrars exclaim as soon as he had left the room i should never allow a child of mine to peak to her father in that manner  sophy swelled  she did not think mrs ferrars had any right to interfere between her and her father  her silence provoked winifred to continue i wonder if you have any compunction for having spoilt all yourall mrs kendals enjoyment of our visit  i am not of consequence enough to spoil any ones pleasure  that was the last effort  albinia came into the room with little maurice holding her hand and flourishing a whip  he trotted up to the sofa and began instantly to whip sister sophy serve her right if i had but the whip thought mrs ferrars as his mother hurried to snatch him off  leaning over sophys averted face she saw a tear under her eyelashes but took no notice  three seconds after sophy reared herself up and with a rigid face and slow step walked out of the room  have you said anything to her asked albinia  i could not help it said winifred narrating what had past have i done wrong  edmund cannot bear to have anything harsh said to her in these moods especially about her behaviour to himself  he thinks she cannot help itbut it may be well that she should know how it appears to other people for i cannot bear to see his patient kindness spurned  only you know she values it in her heart  i am afraid we shall have a terrible agony now  albinia was right  it was the worst agony poor sophy had ever undergone  she had been all this time ignorant that it was a cross fit only imagining herself cruelly neglected and cast aside for the sake of mrs ferrars but the wakening time had either arrived or had been brought by that reproach and she beheld her conduct in the most abhorrent light  after having desired to be pledged to her share of the covenant and earnestly longed to bear the cross to be sworn in as soldier and servant to have put her neck under the yoke of her old master ere the cross had dried upon her brow to have been meanly jealous ungrateful disrespectful vindictive oh misery misery hopeless misery  she would take no word of comfort when albinia tried to persuade her that it had been partly the reaction of a mind wrought up to an occasion very simple in its externals and of a body fatigued by exertion and then in warmhearted candour professed that she herself had been thoughtless in neglecting sophy for winifred  still less comfort would she take in her fathers free forgiveness and his sad entreaties that she would not treat these fits of low spirits as a crime for they were not her fault but that of her constitution  then one cant help being hateful and wicked  nothing is of any use  i had rather you had told me i was mad said poor sophy  she was so spent and exhausted with weeping that she could not come downindeed between grief and nervousness she would not eat and albinia found mr kendal mournfully persuading her when a stern command would have done more good  albinia spoke it sophy you have put your father to a great deal of pain already if you are really grieving over it you will not hurt him more by making yourself ill  the strong will came into action on the right side and sophy sat up took what was offered but what was she that they should care for her when she had spoilt mammas pleasure  better go and be happy with mrs ferrars  sophys next visitor came up with a manly tread and she almost feared that she had made herself ill enough for the doctor but it was mr ferrars with a kind face of pitying sympathy  may i come to wish my godchild goodbye he said  sophy did not speak and he looked compassionately at the prone dejection of the whole figure and the pale sallow face so piteously mournful  he took her hand and began to tell her of the godfathers present that he had brought hera little book of devotions intended for the time when she should be confirmed  sophy uttered a feeble thank you but a hopeless one  ah you are feeling as if nothing would do you any good said mr ferrars  papa says so she answered  not quite said mr ferrars  he knows that your low spirits are the effect of temperament and health and that you are not able to prevent yourself from feeling unhappy and aggrieved  and perhaps you reckoned on too much sensible effect from church ordinances  now joy help all these blessings are seldom revealed to our consciousness but are matters of faith and you must be content to work on in faith in the dark before you feel comfort  i cannot but hope that if you will struggle even when you are hurt and annoyed to avoid the expression of vexation the morbid temper will wear out and you will both be tempted and suffer less as you grow older and sophyforgive me for askingdo you pray in this unhappy state  i cannot  it is not true  make it true  take some verse of a psalm  shall i mark you some repeat them even if you seem to yourself not to feel them  there is a holy power that will work on you at last and when you can truly pray the dark hour will pass  mark them said sophy  there was some space while she gave him the book and he showed her the verses  then he rose to go  i wish i had not spoilt the visit she said wistfully at last  we shall see you again and we shall know each other better he said kindly  you are my godchild now sophy and you know that i must remember you constantly in prayer  yes she faintly said  and will you promise me to try my remedy  i think it will soften your heart to the graces of the blessed comforter  and even if all seems gloom within look out see others happy try to rejoice with them and peace will come in  now goodbye my dear godchild and the god of peace bless you and give you rest     chapter xii    mr dusautoy had given notice of the day of the confirmation when mr kendal called his wife  i wonder he said my dear whether sophia can spare you to take a walk with me before church  sophy who was well aware that a walk with him was the greatest and rarest treat to his wife gave gracious permission and in a few minutes they were walking by the bright canalside under the calm evening sunshine and deep blue sky of early autumn  mr kendal said not a word and albinia leaning on his arm listened as it were to the stillness or rather to the sounds that marked itthe gurgling of the little streams let off into the watercourses in the meadows the occasional plunge of the rat from the banks the sounds from the town softened by distance and the faroff cawings of the rooks which she could just see wheeling about as little black specks over the plantations of woodside or watching the swallows assembling for departure sitting in long ranks like an ornament along the roof of a neighbouring barn  long long it was before mr kendal broke silence but when at length he did speak his words amazed her extremely  albinia poor sophias admission into the church has not been the only neglect  i have never been confirmed  i intend to speak to dusautoy this evening but i thought you would wish to know it first  thank you  i suppose you went out to india too young  poor maria says truly that no one thought of these things in our day at least so far as we were concerned  i must explain to you albinia how it is that i see things very differently now from the light in which i once viewed them  i was sent home from india at six years old to correspondents and relations to whom i was a burthen  i was placed at a private school where the treatment was of the harsh style so common in those days  the boys always had more tasks than they could accomplish and were kept employed by being always in arrears with their lessons  this pressed less heavily upon me than on most but though i seldom incurred punishment there was a sort of hard distrust of me i believe because the master could not easily overwhelm me with work so as to have me in his power  i know i was often unjustly treated and i never was popular  yes i can imagine you extremely miserable  you can understand my resolution that my boys should not be sent to england to be homeless and how i judged all schools by my own experience  i stayed there too late till i was beyond both tormentors and masters and was left to an unlimited appetite for books chiefly poetry  our religious instruction was a nullity and i am only surprised that the results were not worse  india was not likely to supply what education had omitted  looking back on old journals and the like i am astonished to see how unsettled my notions weremy sublimity which was really ignorant childishness and yet my perfect unconsciousness of my want of christianity  i dare say you cannot believe it was yourself any more than i can what brought other thoughts  practical obligations made me somewhat less dreamy and my dear boy edmund did much for me but all so insensibly that i can remember no marked change  i do not know whether you will understand me when i say that i had attained to somewhat of what i should call personal religion such as we often find apart from the church  but edmund you always were a churchman  i was but i viewed the church merely as an establishmenthuman not divine  i had learnt faith from holy scripture from my boy from the infants who passed away so quickly and i better understood how to direct the devotional tendencies that i had never been without but the sacramental system had never dawned on my comprehension nor the real meaning of christian fellowship  thence my isolation  you had never fairly seen the church  never  it might have made a great difference to me if dusautoy had been here at the time of my trouble  when he did come i had sunk into a state whence i could not rouse myself to understand his principles  i can hardly describe how intolerable my life had become  i was almost resolved on returning to india  i believe i should have done so if you had not come to my rescue  what would you have done with the children  to say the truth i had idolized their brother to such an exclusive degree that i could not turn to the others when he was taken from me  i deserved to lose him and since i have seen this unfortunate strain of melancholy developed in poor sophia who so much resembles him i have been the more reconciled to his having been removed  i never understood what the others might be until you drew them out  albinia paused afraid to press his reserve too far and the next thing she said was i think i understand your distinction between personal religion and sacramental truth  it explains what has often puzzled me about good devout people who did not belong to the church the visible church cannot save without this individual personal religion but without having recourse to the church there is she could not find the word  there is a loss of external aid he said nay of much more there is no certainty of receiving the benefits linked by divine power to her ordinances  faith in fact while acknowledging the great object of faith refuses or neglects to exercise herself upon the very subjects which he has set before her and in effect would accept him on her terms not on his own  it was not refusal on your part said albinia  no it was rather indifference and imaginary superiority  but i have read and thought much of late and see more clearly  if i thought of this rite of confirmation at all it was only as a means of impressing young minds  i now see every evidence that it is the completion of baptismal grace and without like poor sophia expecting that effects would ever have been perceptible i think that had i known how to seek after the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength i might have given way less to the infirmities of my character and have been less wilfully insensible to obvious duties  then you have made up your mind  yes  i shall speak to mr dusautoy at once  and she said feeling for his sensitive shyness no one else need know itat least  i should not wish to conceal it from the children he answered with his scrupulous candour  he was supine when thought more ill of than he deserved but he always defended himself from undeserved credit  whom do you think i have for a candidate said mr dusautoy that evening  another now  i thought you were talking to mr kendal about the onslaught on the pringle pew  what do you think of my churchwarden himself  you dont mean that he has never been confirmed  so he tells me he went out to india young and was never in the way of such things  well it will be a great example  take care what you do  he will never endure having it talked of  i think he has made up his mind and is above all nonsense  i am sure it is well that i need not examine him  i should soon get beyond my depth  and what good did his depth ever do to him indignantly cried mrs dusautoy till that dear good wife of his took him in hand  dont you remember what a log he was when first we camehow i used to say he gave you subscriptions to get rid of you  well well fanny whats the use of recollecting all our foolish first impressions  i always told you he was the most able man in the parish  fanny laughed merrily at this piece of sagacity as she said ay the most able and the least practicable and the best of it is that his wife has not the most distant idea that she has been the making of him  she nearly quarrelled with me for hinting it  she would have it that edmund had it all in him and had only recovered his health and spirits  and indeed it was no wonder she was happy  this step taken of free will by mr kendal was an evidence not only of a powerful reasoning intellect bowed to an act of simple faith but of a victory over the false shame that had always been a part of his nature  nor did it apparently cost him as much as his consent to sophys admission into the church the first effort had been the greatest and he was now too much taken up with deep thoughts of devotion to be sensitive as to the eyes and remarks of the world  the very resolution to bend in faithful obedience to a rite usually belonging to early youth and not obviously enforced to human reason nor made an express condition of salvation was as a pledge that he would strive to walk for the future in the path of selfdenying obedience  who that saw the manly wellknit form kneeling among the slight youthful ones around and the thoughtful sorrowmarked brow bowed down beneath the apostolic hand could doubt that such faith and such humble obedience would surely be endowed with a full measure of the spirit of ghostly might to lead him on in his battle with himself  those young ones needed the sevenfold veil between them and the fires of youth but surely the freshening and renewing came most blessedly to the man weary already with sin and woe and tired out alike with himself and the world because he had lived to himself alone      chapter xiii    old mr pringle never stirred beyond his parlour and was invisible to every one except his housekeeper and doctor but his tall square curtained pew was jealously locked up and was a grievance to the vicar who having been foiled in several attempts was meditating a fresh one if as he told his wife he could bring his churchwarden up to the scratch when one sunday morning the congregation was electrified by the sound of a creak and a shake and beheld a stout hale sunburnt gentleman fighting with the disused door and finally gaining the victory by strength of hand admitting himself and a boy among the dust and the cobwebs  had mr pringle or rather his housekeeper made a virtue of necessity and if so who could it be  albinia hailed the event as a fertile source of conjecture which might stave off dangerous subjects in the sunday call but there was no opportunity for any discussion for maria was popping about settling and unsettling everything and everybody in a state of greater confusion than ever inextricably entangling her inquiries for sophy with her explanations about the rheumatism which had kept grandmamma from church and jumping up to pull down the venetian blind which descended awry and went up worse  the lines got into such a hopeless complication that albinia came to help her while mr kendal stood dutifully by the fire in the sentrylike manner in which he always passed that hour bending now and then to listen and respond to some meek remark of old mrs meadows and now and then originating one  as to assisting maria in any pother he well knew that would be a vain act of chivalry and he generally contrived to be insensible to her turmoils  who could that have been in old pringles seat he presently began appropriating albinias cherished morsel of gossip but he was not allowed to enjoy it for miss meadows broke out  oh edmund this blind i beg your pardon but if you would help  he was obliged to move to the window and nervously clutching his arm she whispered youll excuse it i know but dont mention it not a word to mamma  mr kendal looked at albinia to gather what could be this dreadful subject but the next words made it no longer doubtful  ah you were away theres no use in explainingbut not a word of sam pringle  it would only make her uneasy she gasped in a floundering whisper stopping suddenly short for at that moment the stranger and his son were entering the garden so near them that they might have seen the three pairs of eyes levelled on them through the wide open end of the unfortunate blind which was now in the shape of a fan  albinias cheeks glowed with sympathy and she longed for the power of helping her marvelling how a being so nervously restless and devoid of selfcommand could pass through a scene likely to be so trying  the bell sounded and the loud hearty tones of a manly voice were heard  albinia looked to see whether her help were needed but miss meadowss whole face was brightened and moving across the room with unusually even steps she leant on the arm of her mothers chair saying mamma it is captain pringle  you remember samuel pringle  he settled in the mauritius you know and he was at church this morning with his little boy  there was something piteous in the searching look of inquiry that mrs meadows cast at her daughters face but maria had put it aside with an attempt at a smile as captain pringle was announced  he trod hard and spoke loud and his curly grizzled hair was thrown back from a bronzed open face full of broad heartiness as he walked in with outstretched hand exclaiming well and how do you do shaking with all his might the hand that maria held out  and how are you mrs meadows  you see i could not help coming back to see old friends  old friends are always welcome sir said the old lady warmly my son mr kendal sirmrs kendal she added with a becoming oldfashioned movement of introduction  very glad to meet you said the captain extending to each such a hearty shake of the hand that albinia suspected he was taking her on trust for marias sister  your little boy asked mrs meadows  ayarthur come and make the most of yourself my man said he thumping the shy boy on the back to give him courage  ive brought him home for his schoolingquite time you see though what on earth im to do without him  the boy looked miserable at the words  ay ay continued his father youll do well enough  im not afraid for you master but that youll be happy as your father was before you when once you have fellows to play with you  here is mr kendal will tell you so  it was an unfortunate appeal but mr kendal made the best of it saying that his boy was very happy at his tutors  a private tutor eh said the rough captain id not thought of thatneither home nor school  i had rather do it thoroughly and trust to numbers to choose friends from and be licked into shape  poor little arthur looked as if the process would be severe and by way of consolation mrs meadows suggested a piece of cake  maria moved to ring the bell  it was the first time she had stirred since the visitor came in and he getting up at the same time that she might not trouble herself their eyes met  im very glad to see you again he exclaimed catching hold of her hand for another shake but bless me you are sadly altered im sorry to see you looking so ill  we all grow old you know said maria endeavouring to smile but half strangled by a tear and looking at that moment as she might have done long ago  you find many changes  i hope you find mr pringle pretty well said albinia thinking this might be a relief and accordingly the kindhearted captain began ruefully to describe the sad alterations that time had wrought  then he explained that he had had little correspondence with home and had only landed three days since so that he was ignorant of all bayford tidings and began asking after a multitude of old friends and acquaintance  the kendals thought all would go on the better in their absence and escaped from the record of deaths and marriages each observing to the other as they left the house that there could be little doubt that nurses story was true but both amazed by the effect on maria who had never been seen before to sit so long quiet in her chair was his wife alive  albinia thought not but could not be certain his presence was evidently happiness to miss meadows but would this last  would this renewal soothe her or only make her more restless and unhappy  albinia found that sophys imagination bad been quicker than her own lucy had brought home the great news of the stranger and she had leapt at once to the conclusion that it must be the hero of nurses story but she had had the resolution to keep the secret from her sister who was found reproaching her with making mysteries  when lucy heard that it was captain pringle she was quite provoked  only mr pringles nephew she said disdainfully  what was the use of making a fuss  i thought it was some one interesting  sophy was able to walk to church in the evening but was made to go in to rest at the vicarage before returning home  while this was being discussed before the porch albinia felt a pressure on her arm and looking round saw maria meadows  can you spare me a few moments she said and albinia turned aside with her to the flagged terrace path between the churchyard and vicarage garden in the light of a halfmoon  you were so kind this morning began maria that i thoughtyou see it is very awkwardnot that i have any ideabut if you would speak to edmundi know he is not in the habitmorning visits and  do you wish him to call  he had been thinking of it  maria would have been unbounded in her gratitude but catching herself up she disclaimed all personal interestonly she said edmund knew nothing of anything that had passedif he did he would see they would feel  i think said albinia kindly that we do know that you had some troubles on that score  old nurse said something to sophy but no other creature knows it  ah exclaimed maria that is what comes of trusting any one  i was so ill when i found out how it had been that i could not keep it from nurse but from mamma i didmy poor father being just gone and alli could not have had her know how much i felt itthe discovery i meanand it is what i wish her never to do  but oh mrs kendal think what it was to find out that when i had been thinking he had been only trifling with me all those years to find that he had been so unkindly treated  there was his own dear letter to me never unsealed and there was another to my father saying in a proudspirited way that he did not know what he had done to be so served and he wished i might find happiness for i would never find one that loved me as well  i who had turned against him in my heart  it was cruel indeed  and you kept it from your mother said albinia beginning to honour her  my poor father was just gone you know and i could not be grieving her with what was passed and over and letting her know that my father had broken my heart as indeed i think he did though he meant it all for the best  but oh i thought it hard when lucy had married the handsomest man in the country and gone out to india without a word against it that i might not please myself because i was papas favourite  it was very hard not to be made aware of his intentions  yea said maria for it gave me such a bitter restless feeling against himthough i ought to have known him better than to think he would give one minutes pain he could help and then when i knew the truth the bitterness all went to poor papas memory and yet perhaps he never meant to be unkind either  albinia said some kind words and maria went on  but what i wanted to say was thisplease dont let mamma suspect one bit about it and next if edmund would not mind showing him a little attention  do you think he would my dear  i do so wish that he should not think we were hurt by his marriage and you see two lone women can do nothing to make it agreeable besides that it would not be proper  is his wife living  my dear i could not make up my tongue to askthe poor dear boy there and allbut it is all the same  i hope she is for i would not see him unhappy and you dont imagine i have any folly in my headoh no for i know what a fright the fret and the wear of this have made me and besides i never could leave mamma  so i trust his wife is living to make him happy and i shall be more at peace now i have seen him again since he turned his horse at bobbles leigh and said i should soon hear from him again  indeed i think you will be happier  there is something very soothing in taking up old feelings and laying them to rest  i hope even now there is less pain than pleasure  i cant help it said maria  i do hope it is not wrong but his very voice has got the old tone in it as if it were the old lullaby that my poor heart has been beating for all these years  who would have thought of maria speaking poetically  but her words did indeed seem to be the truth  in spite of the embarrassment of her situation and the flutter of her feelings she was in a state of composure unexampled  albinia had just gratified her greatly by a few words on captain pringles evident goodnature when a tread came behind them  ha you here exclaimed the loud honest voice  we were taking a turn in the moonlight said albinia  a beautiful night  beautiful  arthur and i have been a bit of the way home with old goldsmith  theres an evergreen to be sure and noware you bound homewards maria  maria clung to albinias arm  perhaps in the days of the last parting she had been less careful to be with a chaperon  ah i forgot said the captain your way lies the other side of the hill  i had very nearly walked into willow lawn this morning only luckily i bethought me of asking  i hope you will yet walk into willow lawn said albinia  ah thank you i should like to see the old place  i dare say it may be transmogrified now but i think i could find my way blindfold about the old garden  i say maria do you remember that jolly teaparty on the lawn when the frog made one too many  that i do maria could not utter more and albinia said she was afraid he would miss a great deal  i reckoned on that when i came home  changes everywhere but after the one great change he added mournfully the others tell less one has the less heart to care for an old tree or an old path  albinia felt sure he could mean only one great change but they were now at mrs meadowss door and maria wished them good night giving a most grateful squeeze of the hand to mrs kendal  where are you bound now asked the captain  back to the vicarage to take up my husband and the girls said albinia but good night  i am not afraid  the captain however chose to continue a squire of dames and walked at her side presently giving utterance to a sound of commiseration ah well poor maria i never thought to see her so altered  why she had the prettiest bloomi dare say you rememberbut i beg your pardon somehow i thought you were her elder sister  mr kendals first wife was said albinia pitying the poor man but captain pringle was not a man for awkwardness and the short whistle with which he received her answer set her off laughing  i beg your pardon he said recovering himself but you see i am all astray like a man buried and dug up again so no wonder i make strange blunders and my poor uncle is grown so childish that he does not know one person from another and began by telling me maria meadows had married and gone out to india  i had not had a letter these seven years so i thought it was high time to bring my boy home and renew old times though how i am ever to go back without him  is be your only one  yes  i lost his mother when he was six years old and we have been all the world to each other since till i began to think i was spoiling him outright and it was time he should see what old england was made of  albinia had something like a discovery to impart now but she hated the sense of speculating on the poor mans intentions  he talked so much that he saved her trouble in replying and presently resumed the subject of marias looks  she has had a harassed life i fear said albinia  eh old meadows was a terrible old tyrant i believe but she was his pet  i thought he refused her nothingbut theres no trusting such a turk  oh ah i dare say as if replying to something within  and then having come to the vicarage wicket albinia took leave of him and ran indoors answering the astonished queries as to how she had been employed walking home with aunt maria and captain pringle   it was rather a relief at such a juncture that lucys curious eyes should be removed  mr ferrars came to talk his wifes state over with his sister  her children were too much for winifred and he wished to borrow lucy for a few weeks till a governess could be found for them  it struck albinia that this would be an excellent thing for genevieve durant and she at once contrived to ask her to tea and privately propound the plan  genevieve faltered much of thanks and said that madame was very good but the next morning a note was brought in which caused a sudden change of countenance   my dear madame  i was so overwhelmed with your kindness last night and so unwilling to appear ungrateful that perhaps i left you under a false impression  i entreat you not to enter on the subject with my grandmamma or my aunt  they would grieve to prevent what they would think for my advantage and would i am but too sure make any sacrifice on my account but they are no  longer young and though my aunt does not perceive it i know that the real work of the school depends on me and that she could not support the fatigue if left unassisted  they need their little genevieve likewise to amuse them in their evenings and forgive me madame i could not without ingratitude forsake them now  thus though with the utmost sense of your kindness i must beg of you to pardon me and not to think me ungrateful if i decline the situation so kindly offered to me by mr ferrars thanking you ten thousand times for your too partial recommendation and entreating you to pardon                           your most grateful and humble servant                                         genevieve celeste durant   there said albinia tossing the note to her brother who was the only person present excepting gilbert  poor albinia he said it is hard to be disappointed in a bit of patronage  i never meant it as patronage said albinia slightly hurt  i thought it would help you and rescue her from that school  there will she spend the best years of her life in giving a secondrate education to thirdrate girls not one of whose parents can appreciate her till she will grow as wizened and as wooden as mademoiselle herself  happily said mr ferrars there are worse things than being spent in ones duty  she may be doing an important work in her sphere  so does a horse in a mill exclaimed albinia but you would not put a hunter there  yes yes i know education and these girls wanting right teaching but she poor child has been but half educated herself and has not time to improve herself  if she does good it is by force of sheer goodness for they all look down upon her as much as vulgarity can upon refinement  i told her so exclaimed gilbert i told her it was the only way to teach them what she was worth  what did you know of the matter asked albinia and the colour mounted in the boys face as he muttered she was overcome when she came down she said you had been so kind and we were obliged to walk up and down before she could compose herself for she did not want the old ladies to know anything about it  and did she not wish to go  no though i did the best i could  i told her what a jolly place it was and that the children would be a perfect holiday to her  and i showed her it would not be like going away for she might come over here whenever she pleased and when i have my horse i would come and bring her word of the old ladies once a week  inducements indeed said mr ferrars  and she could not be incited by any of these  no said gilbert she would not hear of leaving the old women she was only afraid it would vex mrs kendal and she could not bear not to take the advice of so kind a friend she said  you are not going to be angry with her he added  no said albinia one cannot but honour her motives though i think she is mistaken and i am sorry for her but she knows better than to be afraid of me  with which assurance gilbert quitted the room and the next moment hearing the front door she exclaimed i do believe he is gone to tell her how i took the announcement  maurice gave a significant hem to which his sister replied nonsense  very romantic consolations and confidences  not at all  they have been used to each other all their lives and he used to be the only person who knew how to behave to her so no wonder they are great friends  as to anything else she is nineteen and he not sixteen  one great use of going to school is to save lads from that silly pastime  i advise you to look to these moonlight escortings  one would think you were an old dowager maurice  i suppose colonel bury may not escort miss mary  ah albinia you are a very naughty child still  of course when you are here to keep me in order i wish i never were so at other times when it is not so safe  mr kendal was kind and civil to captain pringle and though the boisterous manner seemed to affect him like a thunderstorm maria imagined they were delighted with one another  maria was strangely serene and happy her querulous nervous manner smoothed away as if rest had come to her at last and even if the renewed intercourse were only to result in a friendship there was hope that the troubled spirit had found repose now that misunderstandings were over and the sore sense of illusage appeased  yet albinia was startled when one day mr kendal summoned her saying it is all over she has refused him  impossible she could only have left half her sentence unsaid  too certain  she will not leave her mother  is that all  of course it is  he told me the whole affair and certainly mr meadows was greatly to blame  he let maria give this man every encouragement believing his property larger and his expectations more secure than was the case and when the proposal was made having discovered his mistake he sent a peremptory refusal giving him reason to suppose her a party to the rejection  captain pringle sailed in anger but it appears that his return has revived his former feelings and that he has found out that poor maria was a greater sufferer than himself  why does he come to you  to consult me  he wishes me to persuade poor old mrs meadows to go out to the mauritius which is clearly impossible but maria must not be sacrificed again  would the drurys make her comfortable  or could she not live alone with her maid  she might live here  albinia  think a little  i can think of nothing else  let her have the morning room and sophys little room and lucy and i would do our best for her  no that is out of the question  i would not impose such charge upon you on any consideration  albinias face became humble and remorseful  yes she said perhaps i am too impatient and flighty  that was not what i meant he said but i do not think it right that a person with no claims of relationship should be made a burthen on you  no claims edmund said she softly  in whose place have you put me  he was silent then said no it must not be my kind albinia  she is a very good old lady but sophy and she would clash and i cannot expose the child to such a trial  i dare say you are right pensively said albinia perceiving that her plan had been inconsiderate and that it would require the wisdom tact and gentleness of a model woman to deal with such discordant elements  what are you going to do as he took up his hat  are you going to see maria  may i come with you  if you please but do not mention this notion  there is no necessity for such a tax on you and such arrangement should never be rashly made  he asked whether miss meadows could see him and awaited her alone in the diningroom somewhat to the surprise of his wife but either he felt that there was a long arrear of kindness owing or feared to trust albinias impulsive generosity  meantime albinia found the poor old lady in much uneasiness and distress  her daughter fancied it right to keep her in ignorance of the crisis but maria was not the woman to conceal her feelings and her nervous misery had revealed all that she most wished to hide too timid to take her confidence by storm her mother had only exchanged surmises and observations with betty and was in a troubled condition of affectionate curiosity and anxiety  albinia was a welcome visitor since it was a great relief to hear what had really taken place and to know that mr kendal was with maria  ah that is kind she said but he must tell her not to think of me  i am an old woman good for nothing but to be put out of the way and she has gone through quite enough  you will not let her give it up  tell her i have not many more years to live and anything is good enough for me  that would hardly comfort her said albinia affectionately but indeed dear grandmamma i hope we shall convince her that we can do something to supply her place  ah my dear you are very kind but nobody can be like a daughter but dont tell maria sopoor dear loveshe may never have another chance  such a beautiful place out there and mr pringles property must come to him at last  bless me what will sarah drury say  and such a good attentive manbesides she never would hear of any one elseher poor papa never knewoh she must have him it is all nonsense to think of me  i only wish i was dead out of the way  there was a strong mixture of unselfish love and fear of solitude of the triumph of marrying a daughter and dread of separation of affection and of implanted worldliness touching albinia at one moment and paining her at another but she soothed and caressed the old lady and was a willing listener to what was meant for a history of the former transaction but as it started from old mr pringles grandfather it had only proceeded as far as the wedding of the captains father and mother when it was broken off by mr kendals entrance  oh my dear mr kendal and what does poor maria say  it is so kind in you  i hope you have taken her in hand and told her it is quite another thing now and her poor dear papa would think so  she must not let this opportunity pass for she may never have another  did you tell her so  i told her that under the circumstances she has no alternative but to accept captain pringle  oh thank you  and does she  she has given me leave to send him to her  i am so much obliged  i knew that nobody but you could settle it for her poor dear girl she is so young and inexperienced and one is so much at a loss without a gentleman  but this is very kind i did not expect it in you mr kendal  and will you see mr pettilove and do all that is proper about settlements as her poor dear papa would have done  poor pettilove he was once very much in love with maria  in this mood of triumph and felicity the old lady was left to herself and her daughter  albinia on the way home begged to hear how mr kendal had managed maria and found that he had simply told her in an authoritative tone that after all that had passed she had no choice but to accept captain pringle and that he had added a promise equally vague and reassuring of being a son to mrs meadows  such injunctions from such a quarter had infused new life into maria and in the course of the afternoon albinia met the captain with the mother and daughter one on each arm maria in recovered bloom and brilliancy and mrs meadowss rheumatism forgotten in the glory of exhibiting her daughter engaged  for forms sake secrecy had been mentioned but the world of bayford had known of the engagement a fortnight before took place  sophy had been questioned upon it by mary wolfe two hours ere she was officially informed and was sore with the recollection of her own ungracious professions of ignorance  so it is true she said  i dont mind since arthur is not a girl  mr kendal laughed so heartily that sophy looked to albinia for explanation but even on the repetition of her words she failed to perceive anything ridiculous in them  why mamma she said impressively if you had been like aunt maria i should she paused and panted for sufficient strength of phrasei should have run away and begged  papa laughs but i am sure he remembers when grandmamma and aunt maria wanted to come and live here  he looked as if he remembered it only too well  well papa pursued sophy we heard the maids saying that they knew it would not do for all mr kendal was so still and steady for miss meadows would worret the life out of a lead pincushion  hem said mr kendal  albinia do you think after all we are doing captain pringle any kindness  he is the best judge  nay he may think himself bound in honour and compassionhe may be returning to an old ideal  people like captain pringle are not apt to have ideals said albinia nor do i think maria will be so trying  do you remember that creeper of lucys all tendrils and catching leaves which used to lie sprawling about entangling everything till she gave it a prop when it instantly found its proper development and offered no further molestation  all was not however smooth water as yet  the captain invaded mr kendal the next morning in despair at maria having recurred to the impossibility of leaving her mother and wanting him to wait till he could reside in england  this could not be till his son was grown up and ten years were a serious delay  mr kendal suspected her of a latent hope that the captain would end by remaining at home but he was a man sense and determination who would have thought it unjustifiable weakness to sacrifice his sons interests and his own usefulness  he would promise that if all were alive and well he would bring maria back in ten or twelve years time but he would not sooner relinquish his duties and he was very reluctant to become engaged on such terms  no one less silly than poor maria would have thought of such a proposal was mr kendals comment afterwards to his wife  twelve years  no one would be able to live with her by that time  i cannot help respecting the unselfishness said albinia  one sided unselfishness quoth mr kendal  i am sick of the whole business i wish i had never interfered  i cannot get an hour to myself  he might be excused for the complaint on that day of negotiations and counternegotiations which gave no one any rest especially after mrs drury arrived with all the rights of a relation set on making it evident that whoever was to be charged with mrs meadows it was not herself and enforcing that nothing could be more comfortable than that lucy kendal should set up housekeeping with her dear grandmamma  every one gave advice and nobody took it mrs meadows cried maria grew hysterical the captain took up his hat and walked out of the house and albinia thought it would be very good in him ever to venture into it again  the next morning mr kendal ordered his horse early and hastened his breakfast told albinia not to wait dinner for him and rode off by one gate without looking behind him as the other opened to admit captain pringle  she marvelled whither he had fled and thought herself fortunate in having only two fruitless discussions in his absence  not till eight oclock did he make his appearance and then it was in an unhearing unseeing mood so that nothing could be extracted except that he did not want any dinner and it was not till late in the evening that he abruptly announced lucy is coming home on wednesday  colonel bury will bring her to woodside  what have you heard from maurice  no i have been at fairmead  you  today  how was winifred  betteri believe  how does she like the governess  i did not hear  gradually something oozed out about lucy having been happy and valuable and after sophy had gone to bed he inquired how the courtship was going on  worse than ever albinia said  i suppose it must end in this  in what  if there is no more satisfactory arrangement i suppose we must receive mrs meadows  if albinia could but have heard what a scolding her brother was undergoing from his vivacious wife  as if poor albinia had not enough on her hands  of all inmates in the world  when mr kendal himself did not like it  well  maurice would certainly have advised sinbad to request the honour of taking the old man of the sea for a promenade a cheval  there was an end of albinia  there would never be any room in her house and she would never be able to come from home  and after having seen her worked to death he to advise  i did not advise i only listened  what he came for was to silence his conscience and his wife by saying your brother thinks it out of the question  now to this my conscience would not consent  more shame for it then  i could not say i thought these two peoples happiness should be sacrificed or the poor old woman left desolate  albinia has spirits and energy for a worse infliction and edmund kendal himself is the better for every shock to his secluded habits  if it is a step i would never dare advise still less would i dare dissuade  well i thought mr kendal at least had more sense  ay nothing is so provoking as to see others more unselfish than ourselves  all i have to say concluded mrs ferrars walking off is i wish there was a law against people going and marrying two wives  albinia was in no haste to profit by her husbands consent to her proposal  the more she revolved it the more she foresaw the discomfort for all parties  she made every effort to devise the more satisfactory arrangement but nothing would occur  the drurys would not help and the poor old lady could not be left alone  her maid betty who had become necessary to her comfort was not a trustworthy person and could not be relied on either for honesty or for not leaving her mistress too long alone and when the notion was broached of boarding mrs meadows with some family in the place the conviction arose that when she had grandchildren there was no reason for leaving her to strangers  finally the proposal was made and as instantly rejected by maria it was very kind but her mother could never be happy at willow lawn never and the tone betrayed some injury at such a thing being thought possible  but just as the kendals had begun to rejoice at having cleared their conscience at so slight a cost captain pringle and miss meadows made their appearance and maria presently requested that mrs kendal would allow her to say a few words  i am afraid you thought me very rude and ungrateful she began but the truth was i did not think dear mamma would ever bear to live here my poor dear sister and all but since that i have been talking it over with the dear captainthinks that since you are so kind and dear edmundmore than i could ever have dared to expect that i could not do better than just to sound mamma  there was still another vicissitude mrs meadows would not hear of being thrust on any one and was certain that maria had extorted an invitation she would never be a burden upon any one young people liked company and amusement and she was an old woman in every ones way she wished she were in her coffin with poor dear mr meadows who would have settled it all  maria fell back into the depths of despair and all was lugubrious till mr kendal in the most tender and gentle manner expressed his hopes that mrs meadows would consider the matter telling her that his wife and children would esteem it a great privilege to attend on her and that he should be very grateful if she would allow them to try to supply marias place and albinia in her coaxing tone described the arrangement how the old furniture should stand in the sittingroom and how lucy would attend to her carpetwork and what nice walks the sunny garden would afford and how pleasant it would be not to have the long hill between them till grandmamma forgot all her scruples in the fascination of that sweet face and caressing manner she owned that poor old willow lawn always was like home and finally promised to come  before the evening was over the weddingday was fixed  what sophy briefly termed the fuss about aunt maria had been so tedious that it almost dispelled all poetical ideas of courtship if captain pringle had been drowned at sea and aunt maria pined herself into her grave it would have been much more proper and affecting  sophy heard of the arrangement without remark and quietly listened to albinias explanation that she was not to be sent up to the attics but was to inhabit the spare room which was large enough to serve her for a sittingroom  but in the evening mr kendal happened in her absence to take up the book which she had been reading and did not perceive at once on her entrance that she wanted it  when he did so he yielded it with a few kind words of apology but this vexation had been sufficient to bring down the thundercloud which had been lowering since the morning  there were no signs of clearance the next day but albinia had too much upon her hands to watch the symptoms and was busy making measurements for the furniture in the morningroom when mr kendal came in  i have been thinking he said that it is a pity to disturb this room  i dare say mrs meadows would prefer that belowstairs  it used to be her parlour where she always sat when i first knew the house  the diningroom  how could we spare that  no the study  albinia remained transfixed  we could put the books here and in the diningroom he continued until next spring when as your brother said we can build a new wing on the drawingroom side  and what is to become of you she continued  perhaps you will admit me here he said smiling for he was pleased with himself  turn me out when i am in the way  oh edmund how delightful  see we shall put your high desk under the window and your chair in your own corner  this will be the pleasantest place in the house with you and your books  dear winifred she did me one of her greatest services when she made me keep this room habitable  and i think sophy will not object to give up her present little room for my dressingroom  shall you my dear said he anxious to judge of her temper by her reply  i dont care she said i dont want any difference made to please me i think that weak  sophy began albinia indignantly but mr kendal stopped her and made her come down to consider of the proposal in the study  that study once an oppressive rival to the bride now not merely vanquished but absolutely abandoned by its former captive  dont say anything to her said mr kendal as they went downstairs  of course her spirits are one consideration but were it otherwise i could not see you give up your private room  it is very kind in you but indeed i can spare mine better than you can said albinia  i am afraid you will never feel out of the whirl  yours would be a loss to us all said mr kendal  the more inmates there are in a house the more needful to have them well assorted  just so and that makes me afraid  of me  no albinia i will try not to be a check on your spirits  you  oh i meant that we should disturb you  you never disturb me albinia and it is not what it was when the childrens voices were untrained and unsubdued  i cant say much for master maurices voice  he smiled he had never yet found those joyous notes de trop and he continued your room is of value and use to us all mine has been of little benefit to me and none to any one else  i wish i could as easily leave behind me all the habits i have fostered there  edmund it is too good  when poor sophy recovers her senses she will feel it for i believe that morning room would have been a great loss to her  it was too much to ask in her present state  i should have come to the same conclusion without her showing how much this plan cost her for nothing can be plainer than that while she continues subject to these attacks she must have some retreat  yet ventured albinia if you think solitude did you no good do you think letting these fits have their swing is good for sophy  i cannot drive her about  they must not be harshly treated he answered quickly  resistance can only come from within compulsion is worse than useless  poor child it is piteous to watch that state of dull misery  on other grounds i am convinced this is the best plan  the communication with the offices will prevent that maid from being always on the stairs  mrs meadows will have her own visitors more easily and will get out of doors sooner and i think she will be better pleased  yes it will be a much better plan for every one but mr kendal himself said albinia and if he can be happy with us we shall be all the happier  so this was the old sittingroom  yes i knew them first here he said  it used to be cheerful then and i dare say you can make it the same again  we must dismantle it before mrs meadows or maria come to see it or it will remind them of nothing but the days when i was recovering and anything but grateful for their attention  yes he added poor mrs meadows bore most gently and tenderly with a long course of moroseness  i am glad to have it in my power to make any sort of amends though it is chiefly through you  albinia might well be very happy  it was her moment of triumph and whatever might be her fears for the future and uneasiness at sophys discontent nothing could take away the pleasure of finding herself deliberately preferred to the study  sophy did not fail to make another protest and when told that it was not solely on her account the shame of having fancied herself so important rendered her illhumour still more painful and deplorable  it was vain to consult her about the arrangements she would not care about anything except that by some remarkable effect of her perverse condition she had been seized with a penchant for maize colour and blue for the bridesmaids and was deeply offended when albinia represented that they would look like a procession of macaws and her aunt declared that sophy herself would be the most sacrificed by such colours  she made herself so grim that maria broke up the consultation by saying goodhumouredly yes we will settle it when lucy comes home  yes muttered sophy lucy is ready for any sort of nonsense  mr and mrs kendal went to woodside to meet lucy hoping that solitude would be beneficial  albinia grieved at the manifestations of these her sullen fits if only because they made lucy feel herself superior  in truth lucy was superior in temper amiability and all the qualities that smooth the course of life and it was very pleasant to greet her pretty bright face so full of animation  dear grandmamma going to live with us  oh how nice  i can always take care of her when you are busy mamma  that accommodating spirit was absolute refreshment and long before albinia reached home the task of keeping the household contented seemed many degrees easier  a grand wedding was expected so all the bayford flys were bespoken three deep a cake was ordered from gunter and so many invitations sent out that albinia speculated how all were to come alive out of the little diningroom  and mr kendal the presiding gentleman  he had hardly seemed aware of his impending fate till the last evening when as the family were separating at night he sighed disconsolately and said i am as bad as you are sophy  it awoke her first comfortable smile  experience had however shown him that such occasions might be survived and he was less to be pitied than his daughter who felt as if she and her great brown face would be the mark of all beholders poor sophy all scenes were to her like daguerreotypes in a bad light she saw nothing but herself distorted  and yet she was glad that the period of anticipation had consumed itself and its own horrors and found herself not insensible to the excitement of the occasion  lucy was joyous beyond description looking very pretty and solicitously decorating her sister while both bestowed the utmost rapture on their stepmothers appearance  having learnt at last what bayford esteemed a compliment she had commissioned her london aunts to send her what she called an unexceptionable garment and so well did they fulfil their orders that not only did her little son scream mamma pretty pretty and gilbert stand transfixed with admiration but it called forth mr kendals first personal remark albinia you look remarkably well and mrs meadows reckoned among the honours done to her maria that mrs kendal wore a beautiful silk dress and a lace bonnet sent down on purpose from london  maria meadows made a very nice bride leaning on her brotherinlaw and not more agitated than became her well  the haggard restless look had long been gone repose had taken away the lean sharpness of countenance the really pretty features had fair play and she was astonishingly like her niece lucy and did not look much older  her bridegroom was so beaming and benignant that it might fairly be hoped that even if force of habit should bring back fretfulness he had a stock of happiness sufficient for both  the chairs were jammed so tight round the table that it was by a desperate struggle that people took their seats and mr dusautoys conversation was a series of apologies for being unable to keep his elbows out of his neighbours way while carving and poor sophy whose back was not two feet from the fire was soon obliged to retreat  she had gained the door before any one perceived her and then her brother and sister both followed albinia was obliged to leave her to their care being in the innermost recesses where moving was impossible  there was not much the matter she only wanted rest and gilbert undertook to see her safely home  i shall be heartily glad to get away he said  there is no breathing in there and theyll begin talking the most intolerable nonsense presently  besides i want to be at home to take baby down to the gate to halloo at the four white horses from the kings head come along sophy  mind you dont make her walk too fast said the careful lucy and take care how you take off your muslin sophy you had better go to the nursery for help  gilbert did not seem inclined to hurry his sister as they came near madame belmarches  he lingered and presently said should you be too tired to come in here for a moment it was an intolerable shame that none of them were asked  mamma did beg for genevieve but there was so little room and the drurys did not like it  mrs drury said it would only be giving her a taste for things above her station  then mrs drury should never come out of the scullery  i am sure she looks as if her station was to black the kettles cried gilbert with some domestic confusion in his indignation  didnt she look like a housekeeper with her mistresss things on by mistake  she did not look like mamma certainly said sophy  mamma looked no more aware that she had on those pretty things than if she had been in her old grey  mammayesmrs drury might try seventy years to look like mamma or genevieve either  put genevieve into satin or into brown holland you couldnt help her looking ten times more the lady than mrs drury ever will  but come in i have got a bit of the cake for them here and they will like to see you all figged out as they have missed all the rest of the show  aunt maria might have cared for her old mistress  sophy wished to be amiable and refrained from objecting  it was a holiday in honour of cette chere eleve of fiveandtwenty years since and the present pupils were from their several homes watching for the first apparition of the four greys from the kings head with the eight white satin rosettes at their eight ears  madame belmarche and her daughter were discovered in the parlour cooking with a stew pan over the fire a concoction which sophy guessed to be a conserve of the roseleaves yearly begged of the pupils which were chiefly useful as serving to be boiled up at any leisure moment to make a cosmetic for mademoiselles complexion she had diligently used it these fortyfive years but the effect was not encouraging as brown wrinkled with her frizzled front awry with not stainless white apron and a long pewter spoon she turned round to confront the visitors in their wedding finery  but what frenchwoman ever was disconcerted  away went the spoon forward she sprang both hands outstretched and her little black eyes twinkling with pleasure  ah but this is goodness itself said she in the english wherein she flattered herself no french idiom appeared  you are come to let us participate in your rejoicing  let me but summon genevieve the poor child is at every free moment trying to perfectionnate her music in the schoolroom  madame belmarche had arisen to receive the guests with her dignified courtesy and heartfelt felicitations which were not over when genevieve tripped in all freshness and grace with her neat little collar and the dainty black apron that so prettily marked her slender waist  one moment and she had arranged a restingplace for sophy and as she understood gilberts errand quickly produced from a cornercupboard a plate on which he handed it to the two other ladies who meanwhile paid their compliments in the most perfect style  the history of the morning was discussed and madame belmarche described her sisters wedding and the curiosity which she had shared with the bride for the first sight of le futur when the two sisters had been brought from their convent for the marriage  but how could she get to like him cried sophy  my sister was too well brought up a young girl to acknowledge a preference replied madame belmarche  ah my dear you are english you do not understand these things  no said sophy i cant understand how people can marry without loving  how miserable they must be  on the contrary my dear especially if one continued to live with ones mother  it is far better to earn the friendship and esteem of a husband than to see his love grow cold  and was your sister happy asked sophy abruptly  ah my dear never were husband and wife more attached  my brotherinlaw joined the army of the prince de conde and never was seen after the day of valmy and my sister pined away and died of grief  my daughter and granddaughter go to the catholic buryingground at hadminster on her fete day to dress her grave with immortelles  now sophy knew why the strip of garden grew so many of the greyleaved woollystemmed little yellowandwhite everlasting flowers  good madame began to regret having saddened her on this day of joy  oh no said sophy i like sad things best  mais non my child that is not the way to go through life said the old lady affectionately  look at me how could i have lived had i not always turned to the bright side  do not think of sorrow it is always near enough  this conversation had made an impression on sophy who took the first opportunity of expressing her indignation at the system of mariages de convenance  and mamma she said if people began with love it always grew cold now has not papa loved you better and better every day  albinia could not be displeased though it made her blush and she could not answer such a home push  we dont quite mean the same things she said evasively  madame is thinking of passion independent of esteem or confidence  but sophy this is enough even for a weddingday  let us leave it off with our finery and resume daily life  only tell me one thing mamma  well  she paused and brought it out with an effort  it had evidently occupied her for a long time  mamma must not every one with feeling be in love once in their life  well done reserve thought albiniabut she is only a child after all not a blush only those great eyes seeming ready to devour my answer  what ought it to be  whatever it is she will brood on it till her time comes  i must begin or i shall grow nervous dear sophy these are not things good to think upon  there is quite enough to occupy a christian womans heart and soul without thatno need for her feelings to shrivel up for want of exercise  no i dont believe in the passion once in the life being a fate and pray dont you my sophy or you may make yourself very silly or very unhappy or both  sophy drew up her head and her brown skin glowed  albinia feared that she had said the wrong thing and affronted her but it was all working in the dark  at any rate the sullenness was dissipated and there were no tokens of a recurrence  sophy set herself to find ways of making amends for the past and as soon as she had begun to do little services for grandmamma she seemed to have forgotten her gloomy anticipations even while some of them were partly realized  for as it would be more than justice to human nature to say that mrs meadowss residence at willow lawn was a perfect success so it would be less than justice to call it a failure  to put the darker side first  grandmammas interest in life was to know the proceedings of the whole household and comment on each now albinia could endure housewifely advice some espionage on her servants and even counsel about her child but she could not away with the anxiety that would never leave sophy alone tried to force her sociability and regretted all extra studies unable to perceive the delicate treatment her disposition needed  and sophy in the intolerance of early girlhood was wretched at hearing poor grandmammas petty views and narrow ignorant prejudices  she might resolve to be filial and agreeable but too often found herself just achieving a moody disgusted silence or else bursting out with some true but unbecoming reproof  on the whole all did well  mrs meadows was happy she enjoyed the animation of the larger party liked their cheerful faces grew fond of maurice and daily more dependent on lucy and mrs kendal probably she had never before had so much of her own way and her gentle placid nature was left to rest instead of being constantly worried  her soninlaw was kind and gracious though few words passed between them and he gave her a sense of protection  indeed his patience and goodhumour were exemplary he never complained even when he was driven from the diningroom by the tablecloth to find maurice rioting in the morningroom and a music lesson in the drawingroom or still worse when he heard the drurys everywhere and he probably would have submitted quietly for the rest of his life had not albinia insisted on bringing forward the plan of building  when captain and mrs pringle returned to bayford to take leave they found grandmamma so thoroughly at home that maria could find no words to express her gratitude  maria herself could hardly have been recognised she had grown so like her husband in look and manner  if her sentences did not always come to their legitimate development they no longer seemed blown away by a frosty wind but pushed aside by fresh kindly impulses and her pride in the captain and the rest in his support had set her at peace with all the world and with herself  a comfortable comely happy matron was she and even her few weeks beyond the precincts of bayford had done something to enlarge her mind  it was as if her education had newly begun  the fixed aim and the union with a practical man had opened her faculties not deficient in themselves but contracted and nipped by the circumstances which she had not known how to turn to good account  such a fresh stage in middle life comes to some few like the midsummer shoot to repair the foliage that has suffered a spring blight but it cannot be reckoned on and mrs pringle would have been a more effective and selfpossessed woman a better companion to her husband and with more root in herself had maria meadows learnt to tune her nerves and her temper in the overthrow of her early hopes     chapter xiv    maurice ferrars was a born architect with such a love of brick and mortar that it was meritorious in him not to have overbuilt fairmead parsonage  with the sense of giving him an agreeable holiday his sister wrote to him in february that gilberts little attic was at his service if he would come and give his counsel as to the building project  mr kendal disliked the trouble and disturbance as much as maurice loved it but he quite approved and submitted provided they asked him no questions he gave them free leave to ruin him and set out to take sophy for a drive leaving the brother and sister to their calculations  of ruin there was not much danger mr kendal had a handsome income and had always lived within it and albinias fortune had not appeared to her a reason for increased expense so there was a sufficient sum in hand to enable mr ferrars to plan with freedom  a new drawingroom looking southwards with bedrooms over it was the matter of necessity and albinia wished for a baywindow and would like to indulge lucy by a conservatory filling up the angle to the east with glass doors opening into the drawingroom and hall maurice drew and she admired and thought all so delightful that she began to be taken with scruples as to luxury  no said maurice these are not mere luxuries  you have full means and it is a duty to keep your household fairly comfortable and at ease  crowded as you are with rather incongruous elements you are bound to give them space enough not to clash  they dont clash except poor sophy  gilbert and lucy are elements of union with more plaster of paris than stone in their nature  pray has kendal made up his mind what to do with gilbert  i have heard nothing lately i hope he is grown too old for india  gilbert is rather too well off for his good said mr ferrars the benefit of a profession is not evident enough  i know what i wish  if he could but be mr dusautoys curate in five or six years time what glorious things we might do with the parish  eh is that his wish  i have sometimes hoped that his mind is taking that turn  he is ready to help in anything for the poor people  once he told me he never wished to look beyond bayford for happiness or occupation but i did not like to draw him out because of his fathers plans  why what have you drawn  the almshouses  i could do no other when i was improving gilberts house for him  that would be the real improvement  how pretty  i will keep them for him  the second post came in bringing a letter from gilbert to his father and albinia was so much surprised that her brother asked whether gilbert were one of the boys who only write to their father with a reason  he can write more freely to me said albinia and it comes to the same thing  i am not in the least afraid of anything wrong but perhaps he may be making some proposal for the future  i want to know how he is  fancy his being so foolish as to go out bathing  i am afraid of his colds  many times during the consultation did mr ferrars detect albinias eye stealing wistfully towards that e kendal esq and when the proper owner came in he was evidently as much struck for he paused as if in dread of opening the letter  her eyes were on his countenance as he read and did not gather much consolation  i am afraid this is serious at last he said  his cold exclaimed albinia  yes said mr kendal reading aloud sentence by sentence with gravity and consideration   i do not wish to alarm mrs kendal and therefore address myself at once to you for i do not think it right to keep you in ignorance that i have had some of the old symptoms  i do not wish to make any one uneasy about me and i may have made light of the cold i caught a month since but i cannot conceal from myself that i have much painful cough an inclination to shortness of breath and pain in the back and shoulders especially after long reading or writing  i thought it right to speak to mr downton but people in high health can understand nothing short of a raging fever however at last he called in the parish surgeon a stupid ignorant fellow who understands my case no more than his horse and treats me with hyoscyamus as if it were a mere throatcough  i thought it my duty to speak openly since though i am quite aware that circumstances make little difference in constitutional cases i know you and dear mrs kendal will wish that all possible means should be used and i think it   mr kendal broke down and handed the letter to his wife who proceeded   i think it best you should be prepared for the worst as i wish and endeavour to be and truly i see so much trial and disappointment in the course of life before me that it would hardly be the worst to me except   that sentence finished albinias voice and stealing her hand into her husbands she read on in silence   for the additional sorrow to you and my grief at bringing pain to my more than mother but she has long known of the presentiment that has always hung over me and will be the better prepared for its realization if it would be any satisfaction to you i could easily take a ticket and go up to london to see any physician you would prefer  i could go with price who is going for his sisters birthday and i could sleep at his fathers house but in that case i should want three pounds journey money and i should be very glad if you would be so kind as to let me have a sovereign in advance of my allowance as price knows of a capital secondhand bow and arrows  with my best love to all                                    your affectionate son                                                gilbert kendal   albinia held the letter to her brother to whom she looked for something cheering but behold a smile was gaining uncontrollably on the muscles of his cheeks though his lips strove hard to keep closely shut  she would not look at him and turning to her husband exclaimed we will take him to london ourselves  i am afraid that would be inconvenient observed maurice  that would not signify continued albinia i must hear myself what is thought of him and how i am to nurse him  oh taking it in time dear edmund we need not be so much afraid  maurice will not mind making his visit another time  i only meant inconvenient to the birthday party drily said her brother  maurice cried she you dont know the boy  i have no doubt that he has a cold  and i know there is a great deal more the matter cried albinia we have let him go away to be neglected and badly treated  my poor dear boy  edmund i will fetch him home tomorrow  you had better send me said maurice mischievously for he saw he was diminishing mr kendals alarm and had a brotherly love of teasing albinia and seeing how pretty she looked with her eyes flashing through wrathful tears and her foot patting impetuously on the carpet  you she cried you dont believe in him  you fancy all boys are made of iron and steelyou would only laugh at himyou made us send him therei wish  gently gently my dear albinia said her husband dismayed at her vehemence just when it most amused her brother  you cannot expect maurice to feel exactly as we do and i confess that i have much hope that this alarm may be more than adequate  he thinks it all a scheme said albinia in a tone of great injury  no indeed albinia answered her brother seriously i fully believe that gilbert imagines all that he tells you but you cannot suppose that either the tutor or doctor could fail to see if he were so very ill  certainly not assented mr kendal  and low spirits are more apt to accompany a slight ailment than such an illness as you apprehend  i believe you are right said mr kendal  where is the letter  albinia did not like it to come under discussion but could not withhold it and as she read it again she felt that neither maurice nor her cousin fred could have written the like but she was only the more impelled to do battle and when she came to the unlucky conclusion she exclaimed i am sure that was an afterthought  i dare say price asked him while he was writing  whats this asked mr kendal coming to the presentiment  she hesitated afraid both of him and of maurice but there was no alternative  poor gilbert she said  it was a cry or call from his brother just at last  it has left a very deep impression  indeed said his father much moved  yes  edmund gave a cry such as was not to be forgotten and the sigh told how it had haunted his own pillow but i had not thought that gilbert was in a condition to notice it  did he mention it to you  yes not long after i came he thinks it was a call and i have never known exactly how to deal with it  it is a case for very tender handling said maurice  i should have desired him never to think of it again said mr kendal decidedly  mere nonsense to dwell on it  their names were always in edmunds mouth and it was nothing but accident  you should have told him so albinia  and he walked out of the room  ah it will prey upon him now said albinia  yes i thought he only spoke of driving it away because it was what he would like to be able to do  but things do not prey on people of his age as they do on younger ones  i wonder if i did right said albinia  i never liked to ask you though i wished it  i could not bear to treat it as a fancy  how was i to know if it may not have been intended to do him good  and you see his father says it was very remarkable  do you imagine that it dwells much upon his mind  not when he is wellnot when it would do him good said albinia it rather haunts him the instant he is unwell  he makes it a superstition then poor boy  you thought me hard on him albinia but really i could not help being angry with him for so lamentably frightening his father and you  let us see how he is before you find fault with him said albinia  youre as bad as if you were his mother or worse exclaimed maurice  oh maurice i cant help it  he had no one to care for him till i came and he is such a very dear fellowhe wants me so much  mr ferrars agreed to go with mr kendal to traversham  he thought his father would be encouraged by his presence and he was not devoid of curiosity  albinia would not hear of staying at home in fact maurice suspected her of being afraid to trust gilbert to his mercy  with a trembling heart she left the train at the little traversham station making resolutions neither to be too angry with the negligent tutor nor to show gilbert how much importance she attached to his illness  as they walked into the village they heard a merry clamour of tongue and presently met five or six boys and a few paces behind them mr downton  ah he exclaimed i am glad you are come  i would have written yesterday but that i found your boy had done so  i shall be very glad to have him cheered up about himself  i will turn back with you  you go on price  they are setting out for one of hullahs classes so we shall have the house clear  i hope there is not much amiss said mr kendal  a tedious cold said the tutor but the doctor assures me that there is nothing wrong with his chest and i do believe he would not cough half so much if he were not always watching himself  who has been attending him  lee the union doctor a very good man with a large family albinia could have beaten him  indeed he continued perceiving some dissatisfied looks i think you will find that a little change is all that he wants  i hope you can give a good account of him in other respects said mr kendal  oh yes in every way he is the most goodnatured lad in the world and quite the small boys friend  perhaps he has been a little more sentimental of late but that may be only from being rather out of order  ill call him  the last words were spoken as they entered the parsonage where opening a door he said here kendal heres a new prescription for you  albinia had a momentary view of a tabbycat and kitten a volume of poetry a wiryhaired terrier and gilbert all lying promiscuously on the hearthrug before the two last leaped up the one to bark and the other to come forward with outstretched hand and glad countenance  he looked flushed and languid but the roaring fire and close room might account for that and though when the subject was mentioned he gave a short uncomfortable cough albinias mind was so far relieved that she was in doubt with whom to be angry and prepared to stand on the defensive should her brother think him too well  the gentlemen went away together and gilbert grasping her hand gave way to one of his effusions of affectionso kind to come to himhe knew he had her to trust to whatever happenedand he leant his cheek on his hand in a melancholy mood  dont be so piteous gibbie she said  you were quite right to tell us you were not well only you need not have been so very doleful i dont like papa to be frightened  i thought it was no use to go on in this way said gilbert with a cough it was the old thing over again and nobody would believe i had anything the matter with me  and he commenced a formidable catalogue of symptoms which satisfied her that maurice would think him fully justified  just at a point where it was not easy to know what next to say the kitten began to play tricks with her mothers tail and a happy diversion was made gilbert began to exhibit the various drolleries of the animals to explain the friendship between dog and cat and to leave off coughing as he related anecdotes of their sagacity and finally when the gentlemen returned laughing was the first sound they heard and mrs kendal was found sitting on the floor at play with the livestock  they had come to fetch her to see the church and schools and on going out she found that mr ferrars had moved and carried that gilbert should be taken home at once and on the way be shown to a physician at the county town  from this she gathered that maurice was compassionate and though of course he would make no such admission she had reason afterwards to believe that he had shown mr downton that the pupils health ought to have met with a shade more attention  with gilbert wrapped up to the tip of his nose they set off and found the doctor at home  nothing could have been more satisfactory to albinia for it gave her a triumph over her brother without too much anxiety for the future  the physician detected the injury to the lungs left by an attack that the boy had suffered from in his first english winter and had scarcely outgrown when albinia first knew him  the recent cold had so far renewed the evil that though no disease actually existed the cough must be watched and exposure avoided in fact a licence for petting to any extent was bestowed and therewith every hope of recovery  albinia and her son sat in their corners of the carriage in secret satisfaction while mr kendal related the doctors opinion to mr ferrars but one of them at least was unprepared for the summingup under the circumstances gilbert is most fortunate  a few years in his native climate will quite set him up  oh but he is too old for haileybury burst out albinia in her consternation  nearly old enough for john kendals bank eh gilbert  oh cried albinia pray dont let us talk of that while poor gilbert is so ill  hm said mr kendal with interrogative surprise almost displeasure and no more was said  albinia felt guilty as she remembered that she had no more intended to betray her dislike to the scheme than to gratify gilbert by calling him so ill  aristocratic and military she had no love for the monied interest and had so sedulously impressed on her friends that mr kendal had been in the civil service and quite unconnected with the bank that mr ferrars had told her she thought his respectability depended on it and she was ashamed that her brother should hear her give way again so foolishly to the weakness  gilbert became the most talkative as they drew near home and was the first to spring out and open the hall door displaying his two sisters harnessed tandemfashion with packthread and driven at full speed by little maurice armed with the veritable carriage whip  the next moment it was thrown down with a rapturous shout and maurice was lost to everything but his brother  oh girls how could you let him serve you so began the horrified albinia  sophy will be laid up for a week  never mind said sophy dropping on a chair  poor little fellow he wished it so much  i tried to stop her mamma said lucy but she will do as maurice pleases  see this is the way they will spoil my boy the instant my back is turned said albinia  whats the use of all i can do with him if every one else will go and be his bondslave  i do believe sophy would let him kill her if he asked her  it is no real kindness said mr kendal  their goodnature ought not to go beyond reason  the elder maurice could hardly help shrugging his shoulders  well did he know that mr kendal would have joined the team if such had been the will of that sovereign in scarlet merino who stood with one hand in gilberts and the whip in the other  come here maurice quoth albinia put down the whip and she extracted it from his grasp with grave resolution against which he made no struggle gave it to lucy to be put away and seated him on her knee  now listen maurice poor sister sophy is tired and you are never to make a horse of her  do you hear  yes said maurice fidgeting  mind if ever you make a horse of sophy mamma will put you into the black cupboard  you understand  sophy shant be horse said maurice  sophy naughty lazy horse boy has gibbie  theres gratitude said mr ferrars as boy slid off his mammas knee stood on tiptoe to pull the door open and ran after gilbert to grandmammas room  yes said albinia no one is grateful for services beyond all reason  so sophy mind into the cupboard he goes the very next time you are so silly as to be a horse  to punish which of them asked her brother  sophy knows said albinia  sophy was too miserable to smile  sarah anne drury had been calling and on hearing of gilberts indisposition had favoured them with mammas remarks and when mrs kendal was blamed sophy had indignantly told sarah anne that she knew nothing about it and had no business to interfere  then followed the accusation that mrs kendal had set the whole family against their old friends and sophy had found all her own besetting sins charged upon her stepmother  my dear said albinia dont you know that if a royal tiger were to eat up your cousin john in india the drurys would say mrs kendal always let the tigers run about loose  nor am i sure that your faults are not my fault  i helped you to be more exclusive and intolerant and i am sure i tried your temper when i did not know what was the matter with you  nono said the choked voice  it would have been an immense comfort to cry or even to be able to return the kiss but she was a great deal too wretched to be capable of any demonstration physically exhausted by being driven about by maurice mentally worn out by the attempts to be amiable which had degenerated into wrangling full of remorse for having made light of her brothers illness and for that reason persuaded that she was to be punished by seeing it become fatal  not a word of all this did she say but dejected and silent she spent the evening in a lonely corner of the drawingroom while her brother in the full pleasure of returning home and greatly enjoying his invalid privileges was discussing the projected improvements  talking at last brought back his cough with real violence and he was sent to bed albinia went up with him to see that his fire burnt  he set mr ferrarss drawing of the almshouses over his mantelshelf i shall nail it up tomorrow he said  i always wanted a picture here and thats a jolly one to look to  it would be a beautiful beginning she said  i think your life would go the better for it gibbie  i suppose old nurse would be too grand for one he said but i should like to have her so near  and you must mind and keep old mrs baker out of the union for it  and that famous old blind sailor  i shall put him up a bench to sit in the sun and spin his yarns on and tell him to think himself at greenwich  albinia went down only afraid that his being so very good was a dangerous symptom  sophy was far from well in the morning and albinia kept her upstairs and sent her godfather to make her a visit  he always did her good he knew how to probe deeply and help her to speak and he gave her advice with more experience than his sister and more encouragement than her father  sophy said little but her eyes had a softened look  one good thing about sophy said he afterwards to his sister is that she will never talk her feelings to death  that reserve is my great pain  i dont get at the real being once in six months  so much the better for people living together  well i was thinking that you and i are a great deal more intimate and confidential when we meet now than we used to be when we were always together  people cant be often confidential from the innermost when they live together said maurice  since i have been a kendal such has been my experience  it was the same before only we concealed it by an upper surface of chatter said maurice  as iron sharpeneth iron so doth a man the countenance of his friend but if the mutual sharpening went on without intermission both irons would wear away and no work would be done  arent you coming with me  edmund is going to drive me to woodside to meet the ponycarriage from home  i wish i could but you see what happens when i go out pleasuring  well you can take one element of mischief with youthat imp maurice  yees  papa would like it if you do  i should like you to come on worse terms  very well then and sophy is safe i had already asked genevieve to come and read to her this afternoon  if gilbert can spare me i will go  gilbert did not want her and begged lucy not to think of staying indoors on his account  he was presently left in solitary possession of the drawingroom whereupon he rose settled his brown locks at the glass arranged his tie brushed his cuffs leisurely walked upstairs and tapped at the door of the morningroom meekly asking may i come in with a cough at each end of the sentence  oh gilbert cried his anxious sister starting up  are you come to see me and she would have wheeled round her fathers armchair for him but genevieve was beforehand with her and he sank into it saying pathetically ah thank you miss durant you are come to a perfect hospital  oh this is too much as she further gave him a footstool  oh no thank you sophy for she would have handed genevieve her own pillow for his further support this is delightful reclining pathetically in his chair  this is not like traversham  where they would not believe he was ill said sophy  i hope he does not look so very ill said genevieve cheerfully but this rather hurt the feelings of both the one said oh but he is terribly pale the other coughed and said looks are deceitful  that is the very reason said genevieve  you dont look deceitful enough to be so illso ill as miss sophie fears now you are at home and well cared for you will soon be well  care would have prevented it all said sophy  and not brought me home said gilbert  home is home on any terms no one there had the least idea a fellow could ever be unwell or out of spirits  ah you must have been ill cried his sister you who never used to be miserable  gilbert gave a sigh  they were such mere boys he said  monsieur votre precepteur asked genevieve  ah he was otherwise occupied  there is some mystery beneath said genevieve turning to sophy who exclaimed abruptly oh is he in love  sophy goes to the point said gilbert smiling the picture of languid comfort but i own there are suspicious circumstances  he always has a photograph in his pocket and price has seen him looking at it  ah depend upon it miss sophy it is all a romance of these young gentlemen said genevieve turning to her with a droll provoking air of confidence ce pauvre monsieur had the portrait of his sister  catch me carrying sophys face in my waistcoat pocket cried gilbert forgetting his languor  speak for yourself mr gilbert laughed genevieve  and he writes letters every day and wont let any of us put them into the post for him but we know the direction begins with miss  oh the curious boys cried genevieve  if i could only hint to this poor tutor to let them read miss downton on one  i assure you cried gilbert price has laid a bet that shes an heiress with forty thousand pounds and red hair  mr price is an impertinent  i hope you will inform me how he looks when he is the loser  but he has seen her  he met mr downton last christmas in regent street in a swell carriage with a lady with such carrots he thought her bonnet was on fire and mr downton never saw price though he bowed to him and you know nobody would marry a woman with red hair unless she was an heiress  miss sophy whispered genevieve prepare for a redhaired sisterinlaw  i predict that every one of the pupils of the respectable mr downton will marry ladies with lively chestnut locks  what you think me so mercenary genevieve said gilbert  i only hope to see this schoolboy logic well revenged said genevieve  mrs price shall have locks of orange red and for mrs gilbert kendalah we will content ourselves with her having a paler shadesandy gold  no said gilbert speaking slowly turning round his eyes  i could tell you what mrs g kendals hair will be  genevieve let this drop and said you do not want me goodbye miss sophie  going why you came to read to me genevieve exclaimed sophy  ah i beg your pardon i have been interrupting you all this time cried gilbert i never meant to disturb you  pray let me listen  and genevieve read while gilbert resumed his reclining attitude with halfclosed eyes listening to the sweet intonations and pretty refined accent of the ancien regime  sophy enjoyed this exceedingly she made it her especial occupation to take care of gilbert and enter into his fireside amusements this indisposition had drawn the two nearer together and essentially unlike as they were their two characters seemed to be fitting well one into the other  his sentiment accorded with her strain of romance and they read poetry and had discussions as they sat over the fire growing constantly into greater intimacy and confidence sophy waited on him and watched him perpetually and her assiduity was imparting a softness and warmth quite new to her while the constant occupation kept affronts and vexations out of her sight and made her amiable  gilberts health improved though with vicissitudes that enforced the necessity of prudence  rash when well and desponding at each renewal of illness he was not easy to manage but he was always so gentle grateful and obliging that he endeared himself to the whole household  it was no novelty for him to be devoted to his stepmother and his little brother but he was likewise very kind to lucy and spent much time in helping in her pursuits he was becoming companionable to his father and could play at chess sufficiently well to be a worthy antagonist in mr kendals scientific and interminable games  he would likewise play at backgammon with grandmamma and could entertain her for hours together by listening to her long stories of the old bayford world  he was a favourite in her little society and would often take a hand at cards to make up a rubber nay even when not absolutely required he was very apt to bestow his countenance upon the little parties where he had the pleasure of being treated as a great man and which at least had the advantage of making a variation in his imprisonment during the east winds  madame belmarche and her daughter and grandchild were sometimes of the party and on these occasions sophy always claimed genevieve and usually succeeded in carrying her off when gilbert would often join them  their books and prints were a great treat to her gilbert had a beautiful illustrated copy of longfellows poems and the engravings and evangeline were their enjoyment gilbert regularly proffering the loan of the book and she as regularly refusing it and turning a deaf ear to gentle insinuations of the pleasure of knowing that an book of his was in her hands  gilbert had never had much of the schoolboy manner and he was adopting a gentle pathetic tone at which albinia was apt to laugh but in her absence was often verged upon tendresse especially with genevieve  she however by her perfect simplicity and lively banter always nipped the bud of his sentiment she had known him from a child and never lost the sense of being his elder treating him somewhat as a boy to be played with  perfectly aware of her own position her demeanour frank and gracious as it was had something in it which kept in check other bayford youths less gentlemanlike than gilbert kendal  if she never forgot that she was dancingmasters daughter she never let any one else forget that she was a lady  when the building began gilbert had a wholesome occupation saving his father some trouble andnot quite so much expense by overlooking the workmen  mr kendal was glad to be spared giving orders and speaking to people and would always rather be overcharged than be at the pains of bargaining or inquiring  it was gilberts own house he said and it was good for the boy to take an interest in it and not to be too much interfered with  so the bay window and the conservatory were some degrees grander than mr ferrars had proposed but all was excused by the pleasure and experience they afforded gilbert and it was very droll to see maurice following him about after the workmen watching them most knowingly and deep in mischief at every opportunity  once he had been up to his knees in a tempting blancmangerlike lake of lime many times had he hammered or cut his fingers and once his legs had gone through the new drawingroom ceiling where he hung by the petticoats screaming till rescued by his brother  the room was under these auspices finished and was a very successful affairthe conservatory in which the hall terminated and into which a side door of the drawingroom opened gave a bright fragrant flowery air to the whole house and the low fireplace and comfortable fanshaped fender made the room very cheerful  fresh delicatelytinted furniture chosen con amore by the london aunts had made the apartment very unlike old willowlawn and albinia had so much enjoyed setting it off to the best advantage that she sent word to winifred that she was really becoming a furniture fancier  it was a very pretty paper and some choice prints hung on it but albinia and sophy had laid violent hands on all the bestlooking books and kept them for the equipment of one of the walls  the rest were disposed for mr kendals delectation in the old drawingroom henceforth to be named the library  lucy thought it sounded better and he was quite as willing as albinia was that the name of study should be extinct  meantime mr downton had verified the boys prediction by writing to announce that he was about to marry and give up pupils  gilbert was past seventeen and it was time to decide on his profession  albinia had virtuously abstained from any hint adverse to the house of kendal and kendal for she knew it hurt her husbands feelings to hear any disparagement of the country where he had spent some of his happiest years  he was fond of his cousins and knew that they would give his son a safe and happy home and he believed that the climate was exactly what his health needed  sophy fired at the idea  her constant study of the subject and her vivid imagination had taken the place of memory which could supply nothing but the glow of colouring and the dazzling haze which enveloped all the forms that she would fain believe that she remembered  she and her father would discuss indian scenery as if they had been only absent from it a year she envied gilbert his return thither but owned that it was the next thing to going herself and was already beginning to amass a hoard of english gifts for the old ayahs and bearers who still lived in her recollection in preparation for the visit which on his first holiday her brother must pay to her birthplace and first home  gilbert however took no part in this enthusiasm he made no opposition but showed no alacrity and at last his father asked albinia whether she knew of any objection on his part or any design which he might be unwilling to put forward  with a beating heart she avowed her cherished scheme  is this his own proposal asked mr kendal  no he has never spoken of it but your plan has always seemed so decided that perhaps he thinks he has no choice  that is not what i wish said his father  if his inclinations be otherwise he has only to speak and i will consider  shall i sound him suggested albinia dreading the timidity that always stood between the boy and his father  do not inspire him with the wish and then imagine it his own said mr kendal and then thinking he had spoken sternly added i know you would be the last to wish him to take holy orders inconsiderately but you have such power over him that i question whether he would know his wishes from yours  albinia began to disavow the desire of actuating him  you would not intend it but he would catch the desire from you and i own i would rather he were not inspired with it  if he now should express it i should fear it was the unconscious effort to escape from india  if it had been his brother edmund i would have made any sacrifice but i do not think gilbert has the energy or force of character i should wish to see in a clergyman nor do i feel willing to risk him at the university  oh edmund why will you distrust oxford  why will you not believe what i know through maurice and his friends  if my poor boy had either the disposition or the discipline of your brother i should not feel the same doubt  maurice had no discipline except at school and when william licked him cried albinia  you know he was but eleven years old when my father died and my aunts spoilt us without mitigation  i said the disposition repeated mr kendal i can see nothing in gilbert marking him for a clergyman and i think him susceptible to the temptations that you cannot deny to exist at any college  nor would i desire to see him fixed here until he has seen something of life and of business for which this bank affords the greatest facilities with the least amount of temptation  he would also be doing something for his own support and with the lifeinterests upon his property he must be dependent on his own exertions unless i were to do more for him than would be right by the other children  then i am to say nothing to him  i will speak to him myself  he is quite old enough to understand his prospects and decide for himself  but edmund cried albinia with sudden vehemence you are not sacrificing gilbert for maurices sake  she had more nearly displeased him than she had ever done before though he looked up quietly saying certainly not  i am not sacrificing gilbert and i should do the same if maurice were not in existence  she was too much ashamed of her foolish fancy to say more and she cooled into candour sufficient to perceive that he was wise in distrusting her tact where her preference was so strong  but she foresaw that gilbert would shrink and falter before his father and that the conference would lead to no discovery of his views and she was not surprised when her husband told her that he could not understand the boy and believed that the truth was that he would like to do nothing at all  it had ended by mr kendal in a sort of despair undertaking to write to his cousin john for a statement of what would be required after which the decision was to be made  meantime mr kendal advised gilbert to attend to arithmetic and bookkeeping and offered to instruct him in his longforgotten hindostanee  sophy learnt all these with all her heart but gilbert always had a pain in his chest if he sat still at any kind of study     chapter xv    colonel bury was the most openhearted old bachelor in the country his imagination never could conceive the possibility of everybody not being glad to meet everybody his house could never be too full his dinnerparties of a few friends overflowed the diningroom and his nobody meant always at least six bodies  every season was fertile in occasions of gathering old and young together to be made happy and little mary ferrars at five years old had told her mamma that the colonels parties made her quite dissipated  one bright summer day his beaming face appeared at willowlawn with a peremptory invitation  his nephew and heir had newly married a friend of albinias girlhood and was about to pay his wedding visit too happy to keep his guests to himself the colonel had fixed the next thursday for a fete and wanted all the world to come to itthe kendals every one of themif they could only sleep therebut albinia brought him to confession that he had promised to lodge five people more than the house would hold and the aunts were at the parsonage where nobody ventured to crowd their servants  but there was a moonand though mr kendal would not allow that she was the harvest moon the hospitable colonel dilated on her as if she had been bed board and lodging and he did not find much difficulty in his persuasions  few invitations ever gave more delight albinia appreciated a holiday to the utmost and the whole family was happy at sophys chance of at length seeing fairmead and taking part in a little gaiety  and if mr kendals expectations of pleasure were less high he submitted very well smiled benignantly at the felicity around him and was not once seen to shudder  sarah anne drury had been invited to enliven grandmamma and every one augured a beautiful day and perfect enjoyment  the morning was beautiful but alas sophy was hors de combat far too unwell to think of making one of the party  she bore the disappointment magnanimously and even the pity  every one was sorry and gilbert wanted her to go and wait at fairmead parsonage for the chance of improving promising to come and fetch her for any part of the entertainment and her father told her that he had looked to her as his chief companion while the gay people were taking their pleasure no one was uncomfortably generous enough to offer to stay at home with her but lucy suggested asking genevieve to come and take care of her  nay said sophy it would be much better if she were to go in my stead  gilbert and lucy both uttered an exclamation and sophy added she would have so much more enjoyment than i could  oh it would quite make up for my missing it  my dear said grandmamma you dont know what you are talking of it would be taking such a liberty  there need be no scruples on that score said albinia the colonel would only thank me if i brought him half bayford  then cried sophy you think we may ask her  oh i should like to run up myselfand a look of congratulation and gratitude passed between her and her brother  no indeed you must not let me go said lucy ill just finish this cup of tea  my dear my dear interposed mrs meadows pray consider  she is a very good little girl in her way but it is only giving her a taste for things out of her station  oh dont say that dear grandmamma interposed albinia one good festival does carry one so much better through days of toil  ah well my dear you will do as you think proper but considering who the poor child is i should call it no kindness to bring her forward in company  something passed between the indignant gilbert and sophy about french counts and marquises but lucy managed much better  dear me grandmamma nobody wishes to bring her forward  she will only play with the children and see the fireworks and no one will speak to her  albinia averted further discussion till grandmamma had left the breakfasttable when all four appealed with one voice to mr kendal who saw no objection whereupon lucy ran off while albinia finished her arrangements for the wellbeing of grandmamma sophy and maurice who were as difficult to manage as the fox goose and cabbage   at every turn she encountered gilbert touching up his toilette at each glass and seriously consulting her and sophy upon the choice between lilac and lemoncoloured gloves and upon the bows of his fringed necktie  my dear gilbert said albinia on the fifth anxious alternative it is of no use  no living creature will be the wiser and do what you will you will never look half so well as your father  gilbert flung aside muttering something about fit to be seen but just then lucy hurried in  oh mamma she wont goshe is very much obliged but she cant go  cant she must cried albinia and gilbert together  she says you are very kind but that she cannot  i said everything i could i told her she should wear sophys muslin mantle or my second best polka  no doubt you went and made a great favour of it said gilbert  no i assure you i did not i persuaded her with all my might i said mamma wished it and we all wished it and i am sure she would really have been very glad if she could have gone  it cant be the school it is holiday time said gilbert  ill go and see what is the matter  no i will go said albinia i will ask the old ladies to luncheon here and that will make her happy and make it easier for sophy to get on with sarah anne drury  lucy had seen genevieve alone albinia took her by storm before madame belmarche whose little black eyes sparkled as she assured mrs kendal that the child merited that and every other pleasure and when genevieve attempted to whisper objections silenced her with an embrace saying ah my love where is your gratitude to madame have no fears for us  your pleasure will be ours for months to come  the liquid sweetness of genevieves eyes spoke of no want of gratitude and with glee which she no longer strove to repress she tripped away to equip herself and albinia heard her clear young voice upstairs singing away the burthen of some queer old french ditty  albinia found gilbert and sophy in disgrace with lucy for having gathered the choicest flowers which they were eagerly making up into bouquets  genevieves was ready before she arrived in the prettiest tremor of gratitude and anticipation and presented to her by gilbert whilst sophy looked on and blushed crimson face neck and all as genevieve smelt and admired the white roses that had so cruelly been reft from lucys beloved tree  with every advantage of pretty features good complexion and nice figure the english lucy in her blueandwhite checked silk worked muslin mantle and white chip bonnet with blue ribbons was eclipsed by the small swarthy french girl in that very old black silk dress and white trimmed coarse straw bonnet just enlivened by little pink bows at the neck and wrists  it had long been acknowledged that genevieve was unrivalled in the art of tying bows and those pink ones were paragons redolent of all her own fresh sprightly archness and refinement  albinia herself was the best representative of english good looks and never had she been more brilliant her rich chestnut hair waving so prettily on the rounded contour of her happy face her fair cheek tinted with such a healthy fresh bloom her grey eyes laughing with merry softness her whole person so alert and elastic with exuberant life and enjoyment that grandmamma was as happy in watching her as if she had been her own daughter and stroked down the broad flounces of her changeable silk and admired her black lace as if she felt the whole family exalted by mrs kendals appearance  it was a merry journey through the meadows and cornfields laughing in the summer sunshine and in due time they saw the flag upon fairmead steeple and albinia nodded to curtseying old friends at the cottage doors  the lodge gate swung open wide and the wellknown striped marquee was seen among the trees in the distance as they went up the carriage road but at the little iron gate leading to the shrubbery there was a halt mr ferrars called to the carriage to stop and opened the door  at the same moment albinia gave a cry of wonder and exclaimed why fred is william here  no at montreal but very well was the answer with a hearty shake of the hand  edmund it is fred ferrars said albinia  why maurice you never told us  he took us by surprise yesterday  yes i landed yesterday morning went to the family office found belraven was nowhere and the aunts at fairmead and so came on here explained fred as be finished shaking hands with all the party and walked on beside albinia  he was tall freshcoloured a good deal like her with a long fair moustache and light handsome figure and lucy though rather disconcerted at genevieve being taken for one of themselves began eagerly to whisper her conviction that he was lord belravens brother mammas first cousin captain in the 25th lancers and aidedecamp to general ferrars  it was the first meeting since an awkward parting  the only son of a foolish second marriage and early left an orphan frederick ferrars bad grown up under the good aunts charge somewhat neglected by his halfbrother by many years his senior  he was little older than albinia and a merry bantering affection had always subsisted between them till he had begun to give it the air of something more than friendship  albinia was however of a nature to seek for something of depth and repose on which to rely for support and anchorage  freds vivacious disposition had never for a moment won her serious attachment she was very fond of him but no more her heart was set on sharing her brothers life as a country pastor  she went to fairmead fred was carried off by the general to canada and she presently heard of his hopeless attachment to a lovely yankee whom he met on board the steamer  all this was now cast behind the seven most eventful years of albinias life and in the dignity of her matronhood she looked more than ever on poor fred as a boy and was delighted to see him again and to hear of her brother william  a few steps brought them to the shade of the large cedartree where was seated winifred and mrs annesley was with her  the greetings had hardly been exchanged before the colonel came upon them in all his glory with his pretty shy bride niece on his arm looking very like the alice percy of the old times when fred used to tease the two girls  genevieve was made heartily welcome and sophias absence deplored and then the colonel carried off the younger ones to the archery giving his arm to the muchflattered lucy and followed by gilbert and genevieve with willie and mary adhering to them closely and their governess in sight  mr ferrars and mr kendal fell into one of their discussions and paced up and down the shady walk while albinia sat in the complete contentment between alice and winifred with fred ferrars on the turf at their feet living over again the bygone days laughing over ancient jokes resuscitating past scrapes tracing the lot of old companions or telling mischievous anecdotes of each other for the very purpose of being contradicted  they were much too lighthearted to note the lapse of time till maurice came to take his wife home thinking she had had fatigue enough  mrs annesley went with her and albinia on looking for her husband was told that he had fallen in with some old indian acquaintances and charles bury presently came to find his wife and conduct the party to luncheon  there was no formal meal but a perpetual refection laid out in the diningroom for relays of guests  fred took care of albinia and here they met miss ferrars who had been with one of her old friends to whom she was delighted to exhibit her nephew and niece in their prime of good looks  but i must go said albinia having found the provisions i must secure that mr kendal and the children are not famished  fred came with her and she turned down the long alley leading to the archeryground  he felt old times so far renewed as to resume their habits of confidence and began i suppose the general has not told you what has brought me home  he has not so much as told me you were coming  ay ay of course you know how he treats those things  ohh said albinia perfectly understanding  but continued frederick eagerly even he confesses that she is the very sweetesti mean as albinia smiled at this evident embellishment even he has not a word of objection to make except the old story about married officers  and who is she fred  oh mamma there you are and lucy joined them as they emerged on the bowlinggreen where stood the two bright targets and the groups of archers whose shafts for the most part flew far and wide  where are the rest my dear are they shooting  yes gilbert has been teaching genevievethere she is shooting now  the little light figure stood in advance  gilbert held her arrows and another gentleman appeared to be counselling her  there seemed to be general exultation when one of her arrows touched the white ring outside the target  that has been her best shot said lucy  i am sure i would not shoot in public unless i knew how  do you not like shooting asked captain ferrars and lucy smiled and lost her discontented air  it hurts my fingers she said and i have always so much to do in the garden  albinia asked if she had had anything to eat  oh yes the colonel asked gilbert to carve in the tent there for the children and governesses said lucy he and genevieve were very busy there but i found i was not of much use so i came away with the miss bartons to look at the flowers but now they are shooting and i could not think what had become of you  and lucy bestowed her company on albinia and the captain reducing him to dashing disconnected talk till they met mr kendal searching for them in the same fear that they were starving and anxious to introduce his wife to his indian friends  when at the end of the path albinia looked round the lancer had disappeared and lucy was walking by her father trying to look serenely amused by a discussion on the annexation of the punjaub  the afternoon was spent in pleasant loitering chiefly with miss ferrars who asked much after sophy lamented greatly over winifreds delicate health and was very anxious to know what could have brought fred home being much afraid it was some fresh foolish attachment  ominous notes were heard from the band and the colonel came to tell them that there was to be dancing till it was dark enough for the fireworks his little alice had promised him her first countrydance fred ferrars emerged again with a halflaughing halfimploring for the sake of old times albinia  weve been partners before  youll take care of lucy said albinia turning to her aunt but mr winthrop had already taken pity on her and albinia was led off by her cousin to her place in the fast lengthening rank  how she enjoyed it  she had cared little for london balls after the first novelty but these fairmead dances on the turf had always had an arcadian charm to her fancy and were the more delightful after so long an interval in the renewal of the old scene and the recognition of so many familiar faces  with bounding step and laughing lips she flew down the middle more exhilarated every moment exchanging merry scraps of talk with her partner or bright fragments as she poussetted with pair after pair and when the dance was over with glowing complexion and eyes still dancing she took freds arm and heard the renewal of his broken storythe praise of his emily the fairest of canadians whom even the general could not dislike though thorough soldier as he was he would fain have had all military men as devoid of encumbrances as himself and thought an officers wife one of the most misplaced articles in the world  poor fred had been in love so often that he laboured under the great vexation of not being able to persuade any of his friends to regard his passion seriously but albinia was quite sisterly enough to believe him this time and give full sympathy to his hopes and fears  far less wealth had fallen to his lot than to that of his cousins and his marriage must depend on what his brother would do for him a point on which he tried to be sanguine and albinia encouraged him against probability for lord belraven was never liberal towards his relations and had lately married an expensive wife with whom he lived chiefly abroad  this topic was not exhausted when fred fell a prey to the colonel who insisted on his dancing again and albinia telling him to do his duty he turned towards a group that had coalesced round miss ferrars consisting of lucy gilbert genevieve and the children from the parsonage and at once bore off the little frenchwoman leaving more than one countenance blank  lucy and willie did their best for mutual consolation while albinia undertook to preside over her niece and a still smaller partner in red velvet in a quadrille it was amusing to watch the puzzled downright motions of the sturdy little bluff king hal and the earnest precision of the prim little damsel and albinia hovering round now handing one now pointing to the other keeping lightly out of every ones way and far more playful than either of the small performers in this solemn undertaking  as it concluded she found that mr kendal had been watching her with much entertainment and she was glad to take his arm and assure herself that he had not been miserable but had been down to the parsonage where he had read the newspaper in peace and had enjoyed a cup of tea in quiet with winifred and mrs annesley  the dancing had been transferred to the tent which presented a very pretty scene from without looking through the drooping festoons of evergreens at the lamps and the figures flitting to and fro in their measured movements while the shrubs and dark foliage of the trees fell into gloom around and above the sky assumed the deep tranquil blue of night the pale bright stars shining out one by one  the kendals were alone in the terrace far enough from the gay tumult to be sensible of the contrast  how beautiful said albinia it is like a poem  i was just thinking so he answered  this is the best part of all she said feeling though hardly expressing to herself the repose of his lofty silent serenity standing aloof from gaiety and noise  she could have compared him and her lively cousin to the evening stillness contrasted with the mirthful scene in the tent and though her nature seemed to belong to the busy world her best enjoyment lay with what calmed and raised her above herself and she was perfectly happy standing still with her arm upon that of her silent husband  these things are well imagined said he  the freedom and absence of formality give space for being alone and quiet  yes said albinia saucily when that is what you go into society for  you have me there he said smiling but i must own how much i enjoyed coming back from the parsonage by myself  i am glad we brought that little genevieve she seems to be so perfectly in her element  i saw her amusing a set of little children in the prettiest most animated way and afterwards when the young people were playing at some game her gestures were so sprightly and graceful that no one could look at the english girls beside her indeed i think she was making quite a sensation your cousin seemed to admire her very much  if she were but in another station she would shine anywhere  how much you have seen edmund  i have been a spectator you an actor he said smiling  her quiescence did not long continue for the poor people had begun to assemble on the gravel road before the front door to see the fireworks and she hurried away to renew her acquaintance with her village friends guessing at them in the dark asking after old mothers and daughters at service inquiring the names of new babies and whether the old ones were at school and excusing herself for having become quite a stranger  in the midstwhishhiss with steady swiftness up shot in the dark purple air the first rocket bursting and scattering a rain of stars there was an audible gasp in the surrounding homely world a few little cries and a big boy clutched tight hold of her arm saying i be afeard  she was explaining away his alarms when she heard her brothers voice and found her arm drawn into his  here you are then he said i thought i heard your voice  oh maurice i have hardly seen you  let us have a nice quiet turn in the park together  he resisted saying i dont approve of parents and guardians losing themselves  what have you done with all your children  what have you done with yours retorted she  i left willie and mary at the window with their governess i came to see that these other children of mine were orderly  most proper prudential and exemplary maurice his sister laughed now i have an equally hearty belief in my children being somewhere sure to turn up when wanted  come i want to get out from the trees to look for colonel burys harvest moon for i believe she is an imposition  no im not coming  you dont understand your duties  your young ladies ought always to know where to find you and you where to find them  oh maurice what must you have suffered before you imported winifred to chaperon me  you are in so mad a mood that i shall attempt only one moral maxim and that is that no one should set up for a chaperon till she has retired from business on her own account  thats a stroke at my dancing with poor fred but it was his only chance of speaking to me  not particularly at the dancing  well then  youll see byandbye  it was not your fault if those girls were not in all sorts of predicaments  i believe you think life is made up of predicaments  and i want to hear whether william has written to you anything about poor fred  only that he is more mad than ever and that he let him go thinking that there is no chance of belraven helping him but that it may wear itself out on the journey  a revolving circle shedding festoons of purple and crimson jets of fire made all their talk interjectional and they had by this time reached the terrace where all the company were assembled the open windows at regular intervals casting bewildering lights on the heads and shoulders in front of them  then out burst a grand wheatsheaf of yellow flame with crimson ears and beards by whose light albinia recognised gilbert standing close to her in the shadow and asked him where the rest where  i cant tell lucy and my father were here just now  are you feeling the chill gilbert asked albinia struck by something in his tone  you had better look from the window  he neither moved nor made answer but a great illumination of colonel burys coatofarms with roman candles and chinese trees at the four corners engrossed every eye and flashing on every face enabled albinia to join mr kendal who was with lucy and miss ferrars  no one knew where genevieve was but albinia was confident that she could take good care of herself and was not too uneasy to enjoy the grand representation of windsor castle and the finale of interlaced ciphers amidst a multitude of little fretful sputtering tongues of flame  then it was amid good nights donning of shawls and announcing of carriages that captain ferrars and miss durant made their appearance together having been looking everywhere for mrs kendal and it was not in the nature of a brother not to look a little arch though albinia returned him as resolute and satisfied a glance as could express well what of that  in consideration of the night air mr kendal put gilbert inside the carriage and mounted the box to revel in the pleasures of silence the four within talked incessantly and compared adventures  lucy had been gratified by being patronized by miss ferrars and likewise had much to say of the smaller fry and went into raptures about many a dear little thing none of whom would however stand a comparison with maurice gilbert was critical upon every ones beauty and genevieve was more animated than all telling anecdotes with great piquancy and rehearsing the comical yankee stories she had heard from captain ferrars  she had enjoyed with the zest and intensity of a peculiarly congenial temperament and she seemed not to be able to cease from working off her excitement in repetitions of her thanks and in discussing the endless delights the day had afforded  but the day had begun early and the way was long so remarks became scanty and answers were brief and went astray and albinia thought she was travelling for ever to montreal when she was startled by a pettish exclamation from lucy is that all  it was not worth while to wake me only to see the moon  i beg your pardon said genevieve but i thought mrs kendal wished to see it rise  thank you genevieve said albinia opening her sleepy eyes she is as little worth seeing as a moon can well be a waning moon does well to keep untimely hours  why do you think she is so much more beautiful in the crescent mrs kendal said genevieve in the most wakeful manner  im sure i dont know said albinia subsiding into her corner  is it from the situation of the mountains in the moon continued the pertinacious damsel  in africa said albinia wellnigh asleep but genevieves laugh roused her again partly because she thought it less mannerly than accorded with the girls usual politeness  no mere sleep was allowed her an astronomical passion seemed to have possessed the young lady and she dashed into the tides and the causes of the harvestmoon and volcanoes and thunderbolts and lord rosses telescope forcing her tired friend to reply by direct appeals till albinia almost wished her in the moon herself and was rejoiced when in the dim greyness of the early summer dawn the carriage drew up at madame belmarches house  as the light from the weary maids candle flashed on genevieves face it revealed such a glow of deep crimson on each brown cheek that albinia perceived that the excitement must have been almost fever and went to bed speculating on the strange effects of a touch of gaiety on the hereditary french nature startling her at once from her graceful propriety and humility of demeanour into such extraordinary obtrusive talkativeness  she heard more the next morning that vexed her  lucy was seriously of opinion that genevieve had not been sufficiently retiring  she herself had heedfully kept under the wing of marys governess mamma or miss ferrars and nobody had paid her any particular attention but genevieve had been with gilbert half the day had had all the gentlemen round her at the archery and in the games had no end of partners in the dances and had walked about in the dark with captain ferrars  lucy was sure she was taken for her sister and whenever she had told people the truth they had said how pretty she was  you are jealous lucy sophy said  lucy protested that it was quite the reverse  she was glad poor little jenny should meet with any notice there was no cause for jealousy of her and she threw back her head in conscious beauty only she was sorry for jenny for they were quite turning her head and laughing at her all the time  albinias candour burst out as usual say no more about it my dear it was a mistake from beginning to end  i was too much taken up with my own diversion to attend to you and now you are punishing me for it  i left you to take care of yourselves and exposed poor little genevieve to unkind remarks  i dont know what i said began lucy  i dont mean to blame her it was just as she always is with gilbert so very french  that word settled itlucy pronounced it with ineffable pity and contemptshe was far less able to forgive another for being attractive than for trying to attract  sophy looked excessively hurt and grieved and in private asked her stepmother what she thought of genevieves behaviour  my dear i cannot tell i think she was off her guard with excitement but all was very new to her and there was every excuse i was too happy to be wise so no wonder she was  and do you think captain ferrars was laughing at her  i wish you would tell her mamma  gilbert says he is a fine flourishing officer in moustaches who he is sure flirts with and breaks the heart of every girl he meets  if he is right mamma it would cure genevieve to tell her so and you would not mind it though he is your cousin  poor fred said albinia  i am sorry gilbert conceived such a notion  but genevieves heart is too sensible to break in that way even if fred wished it and i can acquit him of such savage intentions  i never should have seen any harm in all that genevieve did last night if she had not talked us to death coming home  still i think she was off her balance and i own i am disappointed  but we dont know what it is to be born french     chapter xvi    mrs kendal dear madame a great favour could you spare me a few moments  a blushing face was raised with such an expression of contrite timidity that albinia felt sure that the poor little frenchwoman had recovered from her brief intoxication and wanted to apologize and be comforted so she said kindly  i was wishing to see you my dear i was afraid the day had been too much for you i was certain you were feverish  ah you were so good to make excuses for me  i am so ashamed when i think how tedious how disagreeable i must have been  it was why i wished to speak to you  never mind apologies my dear i have felt and done the like many a timeit is the worst of enjoying oneself  oh that was not alli could not help itenjoymentno stammered genevieve  if you would be kind enough to come this way  she opened her grandmothers back gate the entrance to a slip of garden smothered in laurels and led the way to a small green arbour containing a round table transformed by calico hangings into what the embroidered inscription called autel a lamour filial et maternel bearing a plaster vase full of fresh flowers but ere albinia had time to admire this achievement of french sentiment genevieve exclaimed clasping her hands oh madame pardon me you who are so good  you will tell no one you will bring on him no trouble but you will tell him it is too foolishyou will give him back his billet and forbid him ever to send another  spite of the confidence about emily spite of all unreason such was the family opinion of freds propensity to fall in love that albinias first suspicion lighted upon him but as her eye fell on the pink envelope the handwriting concerned her even more nearly  gilbert she cried  my dear what is this  do you wish me to read it  yes for i cannot  genevieve turned away as in his best hand and bad it was albinia read the commencement   my hope my joy my genevieve   in mute astonishment albinia looked up and met genevieves eyes oh madame you are displeased with me she cried in despair misinterpreting the look but indeed i could not help it  my dear child said albinia affectionately putting her arm round her waist and drawing her down on the seat beside her indeed i am not displeased with you you are doing the very best thing possible by us all  think i am your sister and tell me what is the meaning of all this and then i will try to help you  oh madame you are too good said genevieve weeping and kindly holding the trembling hand albinia finished the letter herself silly boy  genevieve dear girl you must set my mind at rest this is too childishthis is not the kind of thing that would touch your affections i am sure  oh pour cela non said genevieve  oh no i am grateful to mr gilbert kendal for even as a little boy he was always kind to me but for the resthe is so young madame even if i could forget  i see said albinia  i am sure that you are much too good and sensible at your age to waste a moments thought or pain on such a foolish boy as he certainly is genevieve though not so foolish in liking you whatever he may be in the way of expressing it  though of course albinia had floundered into a dreadful bewilderment between her sense of genevieves merits and of the incompatibility of their station and she plunged out by asking and how long has this been going on  genevieve hesitated  to speak the truth madame i have long seen that like many other youths he would bevery attentive if one were not guarded but i had known him so long that perhaps i did not soon enough begin to treat him en jeune homme  and this is his first letter  oh yes madame  he complains that you will not hear him  do you dislike to tell me if anything had passed previously  thursday was slightly whispered  thursday ah now i begin to understand the cause of your being suddenly moonstruck  ah madame pardon me  i seeit was the only way to avoid a teteatete said albinia well done genevieve  what had he been saying to you my dear  poor genevieve cast about for a word and finally faltered out des sottises madame  that i can well believe said albinia  well my dear  i think pursued genevieve that he was vexed because i would not let him absorb me exclusively at fairmead and began to reproach me and protest  and like a wise woman you waked the sleeping dragon said albinia was this all  no madame so little had passed that i hoped it was only the excitement and that he would forget but on saturday he met me in the flagged path and oh he said a great deal though i did my best to convince him that he could only make himself be laughed at  i hoped even then that he was silenced and that i need not mention it but i see he has been watching me and i dare not go out alone lest i should meet him  he called this morning and not seeing me left this note  do your grandmother and aunt know  oh no  i would far rather not tell them  need i  oh madame surely you can speak to him and no one need ever hear of it implored genevieve  you have promised me that no one shall be told  no one shall my dear  i hope soon to tell you that he is heartily ashamed of having teased you  no one need be ashamed of thinking you very dear and goodyou cant help being loveable but master gibbie has no right to tell you so and well put an end to it  he will soon be in india out of your way  goodbye  albinia kissed the confused and blushing maiden and walked away provoked yet diverted  she found gilbert alone and was not slow in coming to the point endeavouring to model her treatment on that of her brother the general towards his aidedecamp in the like predicaments  gilbert i want to speak to you i am afraid you have been making yourself troublesome to miss durant  you are old enough to know better than to write such a note as this  he was all one blush made an inarticulate exclamation and burst out that abominable treacherous old wooden doll of a mademoiselle  no miss belmarche knows nothing of it  no one ever shall if you will promise to drive this nonsense out of your head  nonsense  mrs kendal with a gesture of misery  gilbert you are making yourself absurd  he turned about and would have marched out of the room but she pursued him you must listen to me  it is not fit that you should carry on this silly importunity  it is exceedingly distressing to her and might lead to very unpleasant and hurtful remarks  seeing him look sullen she took breath and considered  she came to me in great trouble and begged me to restore your letter and tell you never to repeat the liberty  he struck his hand on his brow crying vehemently cruel girl  she little knows meyou little know me if you think i am to be silenced thus  i tell you i will never cease  i am not bound by your pride which has sneered down and crushed the loveliest  not mine said albinia disconcerted at his unexpected violence  yes he exclaimed  i know you could patronize but a step beyond and it is all the same with you as with the restyou despise the jewel without the setting  no said albinia so far from depreciating her i want to convince you that it is an insult to pursue her in this ridiculous underhand way  you do me no justice said gilbert loftily you little understand what you are pleased to make game of and with one of his sudden alternations he dropped into a chair calling himself the most miserable fellow in the world unpitied where he would gladly offer his life and his tenderest feelings derided and he was so nearly ready to cry that albinia pitied him and said ill laugh no more if i can help it gibbie but indeed you are too young for all this misery to be real  i dont mean that you are pretending but only that this is your own fancy  fancy said the boy solemnly  the happiness of my life is at stake  she shall be the sharer of all that is mine the moment my property is in my own hands  and do you think so highminded a girl would listen to you and take advantage of a fancy in a boy so much younger and of a different class  it would be ecstasy to raise her and lay all at her feet  so it might if it were worthy of her to accept it  gilbert if you knew what love is you would never wish her to lower herself by encouraging you now  she would be called artfuldesigning  if she loved me he said disconsolately  i wish i could bring you to see how unlikely it is that a sensible superior woman could really attach herself to a mere lad  an unprincipled person might pretend it for the sake of your propertya silly one might like you because you are goodlooking and wellmannered but neither would be genevieve  there is no use in saying any more he said rising in offended dignity  i cannot let you go till you have given me your word never to obtrude your folly on miss durant again  have you anything else to ask me cried gilbert in a melodramatic tone  yes how would you like your father to know of this  it is her secret and i shall keep it unless you are so selfish as to continue the pursuit and if so i must have recourse to his authority  oh  mrs kendal he said actually weeping you have always pitied me hitherto  a man should not ask for pity said albinia but i am sorry for you for she is an admirable person and i see you are very unhappy but i will do all i can to help you and you will get over it if you are reasonable  now understand me i will and must protect genevieve and i shall appeal to your father unless you promise me to desist from this persecution  the debate might have been endless if mr kendal had not been heard coming in  you promise she said  yes was the faint reply in nervous terror of immediate reference to his father and they hurried different ways trying to look unconcerned  never mind said albinia to herself  was not fred quite as bad about me and look at him now  yes gilbert must go to india it will cure him or if it should not his affection will be respectable and worth consideration  if he were but older and this were the genuine article i would fight for him but  and she sat down to write a loving note to genevieve  her sanguine disposition made her trust that all would blow over but her experience of the cheerful buoyant ferrars temperament was no guide to the morbid kendal disposition gilbert lay on the grass limp and doleful till the fall of the dew when he betook himself to a sofa and in the morning turned up his eyes reproachfully at her instead of eating his breakfast  about eleven oclock the fairmead ponycarriage stopped at the door containing mr ferrars the captain aunt gertrude and little willie  albinia her husband and lucy were soon in the drawingroom welcoming them and lucy fetched her little brother who had been vociferous for three days about cousin fred the real soldier but now struck with awe at the mighty personage stood by his mamma profoundly silent and staring  he was ungracious to his aunt and still more so to willie the latter of whom was despatched under lucys charge to find gilbert but they came back unsuccessful  nor did sophy make her appearance she was reported to be reading to grandmammamrs meadows preferred to miss ferrars there was more in this than albinia could make out and she sat uneasily till she could exchange a few words with lucy  my dear what is become of the other two  i am sure i dont know what is the matter with them said lucy gilbert is gone outnobody knows whereand when i told sophy who was here she said captain ferrars was an emptyheaded coxcomb and she did not want to see him  oh the geese murmured albinia to herself till the comical suspicion crossed her mind that gilbert was jealous and that sophy was afraid of falling a victim to the redoubtable lady killer  luncheontime produced sophy grave and silent but no gilbert and mr kendal receiving no satisfactory account of his absence said very strange and looked annoyed  captain ferrars seemed to have expected to see his bright little partner of thursday for he inquired for her and willie imparted the information that fred had taken her for sophy all the time  fred laughed and owned it but asked if she were not really the governess  a governess said albinia but not ours and an explanation followed during which sophy blushed violently and held up her head as if she had an iron bar in her neck  a pity said the lancer when he had heard who she was and under his moustache he murmured to albinia she is rather in emilys style  oh fred thought albinia after all it may be lucky that you arent going to stay here  when albinia was alone with her brother she could not help saying maurice you were right to scold me i reproached you with thinking life made up of predicaments  i think mine is made of blunders  ah i saw you were harassed today said her brother kindly  whenever one is happy one does something wrong  i guess  you are generous not to say you warned me months ago  mind it is no fault of hers she is behaving beautifully but oh the absurdity and the worst of it is i have promised not to tell edmund  then dont tell me  you have a judgment quite good enough for use  no i have not  i have only sense and that only serves me for what other people ought to do  then ask albinia what mrs kendal ought to do  gilbert came in soon after their departure with an odd dishevelled abstracted look and muttering something inaudible about not knowing the time  his depression absolutely courted notice but as a slight cough would at any time reduce him to despair he obtained no particular observation except from sophy who made much of him flushed at genevieves name and looked reproachful that it was evident that she was his confidante  several times did albinia try to lead her to enter on the subject but she set up her screen of silence  it was disappointing for albinia had believed better things of her sense and hardly made allowance for the different aspect of the lovesorrows of seventeen viewed from fifteen or twentysixvexatious too to be treated with dry reserve and probably viewed as a rock in the course of true love and provoking to see perpetual teteatetes that could hardly fail to fill sophys romantic head with folly  at the end of another week albinia received the following note   dear and most kind madame  i would not trouble you again but this is the third within four days  i returned the two former ones to himself but he continues to write  may i ask your permission to speak to my relatives for i feel that i ought to hide this no longer from them and that we must take some measures for ending it  he does me the honour to wait near the house and i never dare go out sincefor i will confess all to you madamehe met me by the river on monday  i am beginning to fear that his assiduities have been observed and i should be much obliged if you would tell me how to act your kind perseverance in your goodness towards me is my greatest comfort and i hope that you will still continue it for indeed it is most unwillingly that i am a cause of perplexity and vexation to you entreating your pardon                          your most faithful and obliged servant                                              genevieve celeste durant   what was to be done  that broken pledge overpowered albinia with a personal sense of shame and though it set her free to tell all to her husband she shrank from provoking his stern displeasure towards his son and feared he might involve genevieve in his anger  she dashed off a note to her poor little friend telling her to do as she thought fit by her aunt and grandmother and then sought another interview with the reluctant gilbert to whom she returned the letter saying oh gilbert at least i thought you would keep your word  i think he said angrily trying for dignity though bewrayed by his restless eyes and handsi think it is too much to accuse me ofofwhen i never saidwhat word did i ever give  you promised never to persecute her again  there may be two opinions as to what persecution means said gilbert  i little thought of subterfuges  i trusted you  mrs kendal hear me he passionately cried  you knew not the misery you imposed  to live so near and not a word not a look  i bore it as long as i could but when sophy would not so much as take one message human nature could not endure  well if you cannot restrain yourself like a rational creature some means must be taken to free miss durant from a pursuit so injurious and disagreeable to her  ay he cried you have filled her with your own prejudices and inspired her with such a dread of the hateful fences of society that she does not dare to confess  for shame gilbert you are accusing her of acting a part  no he exclaimed all i say is that she has been so thrust down and forced back that she cannot venture to avow her feelings even to herself  oh said albinia you conceited person  well cried the boy so much nettled by her sarcasm that he did not know what he said i thinkconsideringconsidering our situations i might be worth her consideration  who put that in your head asked albinia  you are too much a gentleman for it to have come there of its own accord  he blushed excessively and retracted  no no  i did not mean that  no i only mean i have no fair playshe will not even think oh if i had but been born in the same station of life  gilbert making entrechats with a little fiddle  it had nearly overthrown her gravity and she made no direct answer only saying well gilbert these talks are useless  i only thought it right to give you notice that you have released me from my engagement not to make your father aware of your folly  he went into an agony of entreaties and proffers of promises but no more treaties of secrecy could he obtain she would only say that she should not speak immediately she should wait and see how things turned out  by which she meant how soon it might be hoped that he would be safe in the calcutta bank where she heartily wished him  she sought a conference with genevieve and took her out walking in the meadows for the poor child really needed change and exercise the fear of gilbert had made her imprison herself within the little garden till she looked sallow and worn  she said that her grandmother and aunt had decided that she should go in a couple of days to the convent at hadminster to remain there till mr gilbert went to indiathe superior was an old friend of her aunt and genevieve had often been there and knew all the nuns  albinia was startled by this project  my dear i had much rather send you to stay at my brothers oranywhere  are you sure you are not running into temptation  not of that kind said genevieve  the priest mr ohara is a goodnatured old gentleman not in the least disposed to trouble himself about my conversion  and the sisters  good old ladies they have always been very kind to me and petted me exceedingly when i was a little child but for the rest still seeing albinias anxious lookoh they would not think of it i dont believe they could argue they are not like the newfashioned roman catholics of whom you are thinking madame  and are there no enthusiastic young novices  i should think no one would ever be a novice there said genevieve  you seem to be bent on destroying all the romance of convents genevieve  i never thought of anything romantic connected with the reverend mothers rejoined genevieve and yet when i recollect how they came to hadminster i think you will be interested  you know the family at hadminster hall in the last century were roman catholics and a daughter had professed at a convent in france  at the time of the revolution her brother the esquire wrote to offer her an asylum at his house  the day of her arrival was fixedbehold a stagecoach draws up to the doorblack veils insideblack veils clustered on the roofa black veil beside the coachman on the boxeighteen nuns alight and the poor old infirm abbess is lifted out  they had not even figured to themselves that the invitation could be to one without the whole sisterhood  and what did the esquire do with the good ladies  he took them as a gift from providence he raised a subscription among his friends and they were lodged in the house at hadminster where something like a sisterhood had striven to exist ever since the days of james ii  are any of these sisters living still  only poor old mother therese who was a little pensionnaire when they came and now is blind and never quits her bed  there are only seven sisters at present and none of them are less than fiveandforty  and what shall you do there genevieve  if they have any pupils from the town perhaps i may help to teach them french  and i shall have plenty of time for my music  oh madame would you lend me a little of your music to copy  with all my heart  any books  oh that would be the greatest kindness of all  and if it were not presuming too much if madame would let me take the pattern of that beautiful point lace that she sometimes wears in the evening then i should make myself welcome  and put out your eyes my dear  but you may turn out my whole lacedrawer if you think anything there will be a pleasure to the old ladies  ah you do not guess the pleasure madame  needlework and embroidery is their excitement and delight  they will ask me closely about all i have seen and done for months past and the history of the day at fairmead will be a fete in itself  well my dear it is very right of you and i do feel very thankful to you for treating the matter thus  pray tell your grandmamma and aunt to pardon the sad revolution we have made in their comfort and that i hope it will soon be over  genevieve took no leave  albinia sent her a goodly parcel of books and workpatterns and she returned an affectionate note but did not attempt to see lucy and sophy  the next indian mail brought the expected letter giving an exact account of the acquirements and habits that would be required of gilbert with a promise of a home where he would be treated as a son and of admission to the firm after due probation  the letter was so sensible and affectionate that mr kendal congratulated his son upon such an advantageous outset in life  gilbert made slight reply but the next morning sophy sought albinia out and with some hesitation began to tell her that gilbert was very anxious that she would intercede with papa not to send him to calcutta  you now sophy cried albinia  you who used to think nothing equal to india  i wish it were i said sophy but you know  well said albinia coldly  sophy was too shy to begin on that tack and dashed off on another  oh mamma he is so wretched  he cant bear to thwart papa but he says it would break his heart to go so far away and that he knows it would kill him to be confined to a desk in that climate  you know papa thinks that nothing would confirm his health so much as a few years without an english winter  ones own instinct began sophy then breaking off she added mamma you never were for the bank  i used not to see the expediency and i did not like the parting but now i understand your fathers wishes and the sort of allegiance he feels towards india so that gilberts reluctance will be a great mortification to him  so it will said sophy mournfully i am sure it is to me  i always looked forward to gilberts going to talloon and seeing the dear old bearer and taking all my presents there but you see of course mamma he cannot bear to go  sophy dear said albinia you have been thinking me a very hardhearted woman this last month  i have been longing to have it out  not hardhearted said sophy looking down only i had always thought you different from other people  and you considered that i was worldly and not romantic enough  is that it sophy  i thought you knew how to value her for herself so good and so admirablea lady in everythingwith such perfect manners  i thought you would have been pleased and proud that gilberts choice was so much nobler than beauty or rank or fashion could make it said sophy growing enthusiastic as she went on  well my dear perhaps i am  but mamma you have done all you could to separate them you have shut genevieve up in a convent and you want to banish him  it sounds very grand and worthy of a cruel stepdame said albinia but my dear though i do think genevieve in herself an admirable creature worthy of any ones love what am i to think of the way gilbert has taken to show his admiration  and is it not very hard cried sophy that even you who own all her excellences should turn against him and give in to all this miserable conventionality that wants riches and station and trumpery worldly things and crushes down true love in two young hearts  sophy dear i am afraid the love is not proved to be true in the one heart and i am sure there is none in the other  mamma  tis her selfcommand  nonsense  his attentions are nothing but distress to her  sensible grownup young women are not apt to be flattered by importunity from silly boys  has he told you otherwise  he thinkshe hopes at leastand i am sureit is all stifled by her sense of duty and fear of offending you or appearing mercenary  all delusion said albinia theres not a spark of consciousness about her  i see you dont like to believe it but it is my great comfort  think how she would suffer if she did love him  nay think before you are angry with me for not promoting it how it would bring them into trouble and disgrace with all the world even if your father consented  have you once thought how it would appear to him  you can persuade papa to anything   sophy you ought to know your father better than to say that cried albinia as if it had been disrespect to him  then you think he would never allow it  you really think that such a creature as genevieve as perfect a lady as ever existed must always be a victim to these hateful rules about station  no said albinia certainly not but if she were in the very same rank if all else were suitable gilberts age would make the pursuit ridiculous  only three years younger sighed sophy  but if they were the same age  do you mean that no one ever ought to marry if they love ever so much where the station is different  no but that they must not do so lightly but try the love first to see whether it be worth the sacrifice  if an attachment last through many years of adverse circumstances i think the happiness of the people has been shown to depend on each other but i dont think it safe to disregard disparities till there has been some test that the love is the right stuff or else they may produce illtemper regrets and unhappiness all the rest of their lives  if gilbert went on for years mamma  i did not say that sophy  suppose continued the eager girl he went out to calcutta and worked these five years and was made a partner  then he would be twoandtwenty nobody could call him too young and he would come home and ask papas consent and you  i should call that constancy said albinia  and he would take her out to calcutta and have no drurys and osborns to bother her  oh  it would be beautiful  i would watch over her while he was gone  ill go and tell him  stop sophy not from methat would never do  i dont think papa would think twentytwo such a great age  but he would have loved her five years said sophy  and you said yourself that would be constancy  true but sophy i have known a youth who sailed brokenhearted and met a lady just in the style of the former one on board the steamer  sophy made a gesture of impatient disdain and repeated do you allow me to tell gilbert that this is the way  not from me  i hold out no hope  i dont believe genevieve cares for him and i dont know whether his father would consent but seeing sophys look of disappointment i see no harm in your suggesting it for it is his only chance with either of them and would be the proof that his affection was good for something  and you think her worth it  i think her worth anything in the worldthe more for her behaviour in this matter  i only doubt if gilbert have any conception how much she is worth  away went sophy in a glow that made her almost handsome while albinia as usual wondered at her own imprudence  at luncheon sophy avoided her eye and looked crestfallen and when afterwards she gave a mute inquiring address shook her head impatiently  it was plain that she had failed and was too much pained and shamed by his poorness of spirit to be able as yet to speak of it  next came gilbert who pursued albinia to the morningroom to entreat her interference in his behalf appealing piteously to her kindness but she was obdurate  if any remonstrance were offered to his father it must be by himself  gilbert fell into a state of misery threw himself about upon the chairs and muttered in the fretfulness of childish despair something about its being very hard when he was owner of half the town to be sent into exileit was like jealousy of his growing up and being master  take care gilbert said albinia with a flash of her eye that he felt to his backbone  i dont mean it cried gilbert springing towards her in supplication  ive heard it said thats all and was as angry as you but when a fellow is beside himself with misery at being driven away from all he lovesnot a friend to help himhow can he keep from thinking all sorts of things  i wonder what people dare to say it cried albinia wrathfully but he did not heed he was picturing his own future misfortunestoil climatefeverscholerasthugscoups de soleilgenuine dread and repugnance working him up to positive agony  gilbert said albinia this is trumpery selftorture  you know this is a mere farrago that you have conjured up  your father would neither thrust you into danger nor compel you to do anything to which you had a reasonable aversion  go and be a man about it in one way or the other  either accept or refuse but dont make these childish lamentations  they are cowardly  i should be ashamed of little maurice if he behaved so  and you will not speak a word for me  no  speak for yourself and she left the room  days passed on till she began to think that after all gilbert preferred calcutta cholera thugs and all to facing his father but at last he must have taken heart from his extremity for mr kendal said with less vexation than she had anticipated so our plans are overthrown  gilbert tells me he has an invincible dislike to calcutta  had you any such idea  not till your cousins letter arrived  what did you say to him  he was so much afraid of vexing me that i was obliged to encourage him to speak freely and i found that he had always had a strong distaste to and dread of india  i told him i wished he had made me aware of it sooner and desired to know what profession he really preferred  he spoke of oxford and the bar and so i suppose it must be  i do not wonder that he wishes to follow his traversham friends and as they are a good set i hope there may not be much temptation i see you are not satisfied albinia yet your wishes were one of my motives  thank youonce i should said albinia but edmund i see how wrong it was to have concealed anything from you and thereupon she informed him of gilberts passion for genevieve durant which astonished him greatly though he took it far less seriously than she had expected and was not displeased at having been kept in ignorance and spared the trouble of taking notice of it and thus giving it importance  it will pass off he said  she has too much sense and principle to encourage him and if you can get her out of bayford for a few years he will be glad to have it forgotten  poor genevieve  she must break up her grandmothers home after all  it will be a great advantage to her  you used to say that it would be most desirable for her to see more of the world  away from this place she might marry well  any ones son but yours said albinia smiling  the connexion would be worse here than anywhere else but i was not thinking of any one in our rank of life  there are many superior men in trade with whom she might be very happy  poor child sighed albinia  i cannot feel that it is fair that she should be banished for gilberts faults and i am sorry for the school you cannot think how much the tone was improving  if it could be done without hurting her feelings i should gladly give her a year at some superior finishing school which might either qualify her for a governess or enable her to make this one more profitable  oh thank you cried albinia yet i doubt  however her services would be quite equivalent in any school to the lessons she wants ill write to mrs elwood and she was absorbed in the registeroffice in her brain when mr kendal continued  this is quite unexpected  i could not have supposed the boy so foolish  however if you please i will speak to him tell him that i was unaware of his folly and insist on his giving it up  i should be very glad if you would  gilbert was called and the result was more satisfactory than albinia thought that genevieve deserved  his frenzy had tended to wear itself out and he had been so dreadfully alarmed about india and his father that in his relief gratitude and fear of being sent out he was ready to promise anything  before his father he could go into no rhapsodies and could only be miserably confused  personally said mr kendal it is creditable that you should be attracted by such estimable qualities but these are not the sole consideration  equality of station is almost as great a requisite as these for producing comfort or respectability and nothing but your youth and ignorance could excuse your besetting any young woman with importunities which she had shown to be disagreeable to her  there was no outcry of despair only a melancholy muttering  then mr kendal pronounced his decree in terms more explicit than those in which albinia had exacted the promise  he said nothing about persecution nor was he unreasonable enough to command an instant immolation of the passion he only insisted that gilbert should pay no marked attention and attempt no unsanctioned or underhand communication  unless he thought he had sufficient selfcommand to abstain his father must take further measures  as if fearing that this must mean kendal and kendal he raised his head and with a deep sigh undertook for his own selfcommand  mr kendal laid his hand on his shoulder with kind pity told him he was doing right and that while he acted openly and obediently he should always meet with sympathy and consideration  two difficult points remainedthe disposing of the young people gilbert was still over young for the university as well as very backward and illprepared and the obstinate remains of the cough made his father unwilling to send him from home  and his presence made genevieves absence necessary  the place had begun to loom in the distance  a former governess of albinias who would have done almost anything to please her had lately been left a widow and established herself in a suburb of london with a small party of pupils  she had just begun to feel the need of an additional teacher and should gladly receive genevieve provided she fulfilled certain requisites of which luckily french pronunciation stood the foremost  the terms were left to albinia who could scarcely believe her good fortune and went in haste to discuss the matter with the belmarches  it almost consoled her for what she had been exceedingly ashamed to announce the change of purpose with regard to gilbert which was a sentence of banishment to the object of his folly  nothing pained her more than the great courtesy and kindness of the two old ladies to whom it was such a cruel stroke they evidently felt for her and appeared to catch at mrs elwoods offer and when albinia proposed that her salary should be a share in the instructions of the masters agreed that this was the very thing they had felt it their duty to provide for her if they had been able to bring themselves to part with her  so said good madame belmarche smiling sadly you see it has been for the dear childs real good that our weakness has been conquered  genevieve was written to and consented to everything and when mr kendal took gilbert away to visit an old friend his wife called for genevieve at the convent to bring her home  albinia could not divest herself of some curiosity and excitement in driving up to the oldfashioned red brick house with two tall wings projecting towards the street and the front door in the centre between them with steps down to it  she had not been without hopes of a parlour with a grille or at least that a lay sister would open the door but she saw nothing but a very ordinarylooking old maidservant and close behind her was genevieve with her little box quite readyno excuse for seeing anything or anybody else  if genevieve were sad at the proposal of leaving home and going among strangers she took care to hide all that could pain mrs kendal and her cheerful french spirit really enjoyed the prospect of new scenes and bounded with enterprise at the hope of a new life and fresh field of exertion  perhaps after all she said smiling they may make of me something really useful and valuable and it will all be owing to you dear madame  drawing and italian  when i can teach them i shall be able to make grandmamma easy for life  genevieve skipped out of the carriage and into her aunts arms as if alive only to the present delight of being at home again  it was a contrast to sophys dolorous visage  poor sophy she was living in a perpetual strife with the outward tokens of sulkiness forcing herself against the grain to make civil answers and pretend to be interested when she felt wretched and morose  that gilbert after so many ravings should have relinquished from mere cowardice that one hope of earning genevieve by honourable exertion had absolutely lowered her trust in the exalting power of love and her sense of justice revolted against the decision that visited the follies of the guilty upon the innocent  she was yearning over her friend with all her heart pained at the separation and longing fervently to make some demonstration but the greater her wish the worse was her reserve  she spent all her money upon a beautiful book as a parting gift and kept it beside her missing occasion after occasion of presenting it and falling at each into a perfect agony behind that impalpable yet impassable barrier of embarrassment  it was not till the very last evening when genevieve had actually wished her goodbye and left the house that she grew desperate  she hastily put on bonnet and cloak and pursued genevieve up the street overtaking her at last and causing her to look round close to her own door  my dear miss sophy cried genevieve what is the matter  you are quite overcome  this book said sophyit was all she could say  loveyes said genevieve  admirationno  you shall not say that cried sophy  i have found what is really dignified and disinterested and you must let me admire you jenny it makes me comfortable  genevieve smiled  i would not commit an egoism she said but if the sense of admiration do you good i wish it had a worthier cause  theres no one to admire but you said sophy  i think it very unfair to send you away and though it is nobodys fault i hate good sense and the way of the world  oh do not talk so  i am only overwhelmed with wonder at the goodness i have experienced   if it had happened with any other family oh how differently i should have been judged  oh when i think of mrs kendal i am ready to weep with gratitude  yes mamma is mamma and not like any one else but even she is obliged to be rational and do the injustice whatever she feels said sophy  oh not injusticekindness  i shall be able to earn more for grandmamma  it is injustice said sophy not hers perhaps but of the world it makes me so angry to think that youyou should never do anything but wear yourself out in drudging over tiresome little children  little children are my brothers and sisters as i never had any said genevieve  oh  i always loved them they make a home wherever they are  i am thankful that my vocation is among them  in dread of a token from gilbert genevieve would not notice it but pursued you must come in and restyou must have my aunts salts  nono said sophy not there as genevieve would have taken her to the little parlour but opening the door of the schoolroom she sank breathless into a sitting position on the carpetless boards  genevieve shut the door and kneeling down found sophys arms thrown round her pressing her almost to strangulation  oh i wanted to do iti never could  wont you have the book genevieve  it is my keepsakeonly i could not give it because  is it your keepsake indeed dear miss sophy said genevieve  oh if it is yourshow i shall value itbut it is too beautiful  nothing is too beautiful for you genevieve said sophy fervently  and it is your gift  but i am frightenedit must have cost began genevieve still a little on her guard  dear dear miss sophy forgive me if i do seem ungrateful but indeed i ought to askifif it is all your own gift  mine yes said sophy on the borders of offence  i know what you mean genevieve but you may trust me  i would not take you in  genevieve was blushing intensely but taking courage she bestowed a shower of ardent embraces and expressions of gratitude mingled with excuses for her precaution  oh it was so very kind in miss sophy she said it would be such a comfort to remember she had feared she too was angry with her  angry oh no cried sophy her heart quite unlocked but the more i loved and admired the more i could not speak  and if they drive you to be a governess  if you had a situation like what we read of  perhaps i shall not said genevieve laughing  every one has been so good to me hitherto  and then i am not reduced from anything grander  i shall always have the children you know  how i should hate them quoth sophy  they are my pleasure  besides i have always thought it a blessing that my business in life though so humble should be what may do direct good  if only i do not set them a bad example or teach them any harm  not much danger of that said sophy smiling  well i cant believe it will be your lot all your life  you will find some one who will know how to love you  no said genevieve i am not in a position for marriagegrandmamma has often told me so  things sometimes happen pursued sophy  mamma said if gilbert had been older or even ifif he had been in earnest and steady enough to work for you in india then it mightand surely if gilbert could care for youpeople higher and deeper than he would like you better still  hush said genevieve they would only see the objections more strongly  no do not put these things in my head  i know that unless a teacher hold her business as her mission and put all other schemes out of her mind she will work with an absent distracted halfhearted attention and fail of the task that the good god has committed to her  then you would never even wish  it would be seeking pomps and vanities to wish said genevieve a schoolroom is a good safe cloister probably less dull than the convent  if i wish at all it will be that i may be well shut up there for i know that in spite of myself my manners are different from your english ones  i cannot make them otherwise and that amuses people and i cannot help liking to please and so i become excited  i enjoy society so much that it is not safe for me  so dont be sorry dear sophy it is a fit penance for the vanity that elated me too much that evening at fairmead  mademoiselle belmarche was here attracted by the voices  sophy started up from the ground made some unintelligible excuse and while mademoiselle was confounded with admiration at the sight of the book inflicted another boaconstrictor embrace and hurried away     chapter xvii    planets hostile to the tender passion must have been in the ascendant for the result of captain ferrarss pursuit of his brother to italy was the wholesome certainty that his own slender portion was all he had to reckon upon  before returning to canada he came to bayford to pour out his troubles to his cousin and to induce her if he could induce no one else to advise his immediate marriage  it was the first time he had been really engaged and his affection had not only stood three months absence but had so much elevated his shatterbrained though frank and honest temperament that albinia conceived a high opinion of emily and did her best to persuade him to be patient and wait for promotion  sophy likewise approved of him this time perhaps because he was so opposite a specimen of the genus lover from that presented by her brother  gilbert had not been able to help enjoying himself while from home but his spirits sank on his return he lay about on the grass in doleful dejection studied little but l e l lost appetite and reproachfully fondled his cough but albinia was now more compassionate than sophy whom she was obliged to rebuke for an unsisterly disregard toward his woes  i cant help it said sophy i cant believe in him now  yes you ought to believe that he is really unhappy and be more gentle and considerate with him  if it had been earnest he would have sacrificed himself instead of genevieve  ah sophy some day you will learn to make excuses for other people and not be so intolerant  i never make excuses  except for maurice said albinia  if you viewed other people as you do him your judgments would be gentler  sophys conscientiousness like her romance was hard high and strict but while she had as little mercy on herself as on others and while there were some soft spots in her adamantine judgment there was hope that these would spread and without lowering her tone make her more merciful  she corresponded constantly with genevieve who seemed very happily placed mrs elwood was delighted with her and she with mrs elwood and her lively letters showed no signs of pining for home  sophy felt as if it were a duty to her friend to do what in her lay to prevent the two old ladies from being dull and spent an hour with them every week not herself contributing much to their amusement but pleasing them by the attention and hearing much that was very curious of their oldworld recollections  ever since that unlucky pennyclubday when she had declared that she hated poor people she had been let alone on that subject and though principle had made her use her needle in their behalf shyness and reserve had kept her back from all intercourse with them but in her wish to compensate for genevieves absence she volunteered to take charge of her vacant sundayschool class and obtained leave to have the girls at home on the afternoons for an hour and a half this was enough for one who worked as she did making a conscience of every word and toiling to prepare her lessons writing out her questions beforehand and begging for advice upon them  my dear said albinia you must alter thisyou see this question does not grow out of the last answer  yes said sophy that must have been what puzzled them last sunday they want connexion  nothing like logic to teach one to be simple said albinia  i cant see the use of all this trouble put in lucy  why cant you ask them just what comes into your head as i always do  suppose mistakes came into my head  oh they would not find it out if they did  i declarewhats thispersian  are you going to teach them persian  no it is greek  you see it is a piece of a psalm a quotation rather different in the new testament  i wrote it down to ask papa what it is in hebrew  bythebye sophy continued lucy how could you let susan price come to church with lace sleevesabsolute lace sleeves  had she  thereyou never see anything  mamma would not it be more sensible to keep their dress in order than to go poking into hebrew which cant be of use to any one  there was more reason than might appear in what lucy said the girls of her class were more orderly and fonder of her than sophys of the grave young lady whose earnestness oppressed them and whose shyness looked dislike and pride  as to finding fault with their dress she privately told albinia that she could not commit such a discourtesy and was answered that no one but mrs dusautoy need interfere  i will go and ask mrs dusautoy what she wishes said albinia  i should be glad if she would modify lucys sumptuary laws  to fall foul of every trifle only makes the girls think of their dress  albinia found mrs dusautoy busied in writing notes on mourning paper  here is a note i had written to you she said  i am sending over to hadminster to see if any of the curates can take the services tomorrow  albinia looked at the note while mrs dusautoy wrote on hurriedly she read that there could be no daily services at present the vicar having been summoned to paris by the sudden death of mrs cavendish dusautoy  as the image of a wellendowed widow always trying to force her way into higher society arose before albinia she could hardly wait till the letter was despatched to break out in amazement  was she a relation of yours  even the name never made me think of it  it is a pity she cannot have the gratification of hearing it poor woman said mrs dusautoy but it is a fact that she did poor george dusautoy the honour to marry him  mr dusautoys brother  ayhe was a young surgeon just set up in practice exactly like johnnay some people thought him still finerlooking  she was a miss greenaway cavendish a stockbrokers heiress of a certain age  oh expressively cried albinia  you may say so returned mrs dusautoy  she made him put away his profession and set up for taste and elegant idleness  and he submitted  there was a great deal of the meek giant in him and he believed implicitly in the honour she had done him  it would have been very touching if it had not been so provoking to see how patiently and humbly that fine young man gave up all that would have made him happy to bend to her caprices and pretensions  did you ever see them together  no i never saw her at all and him only once  i never knew john really savage but once and that was at her not letting him come to our wedding but she did give him leave of absence for one fortnight when we were at lauriston  how happy the brothers were  it did one good to hear their great voices about the house and they were like boys on a stolen frolic when john took him to prescribe for some of our poor people  he used to talk of bringing us his little sonthe one pleasure of his lifebut he never was allowed  oh how i used to long to stir up a mutiny cried mrs dusautoy quite unknowing that she ruled her own lion with a leash of silk  if she had appreciated him it would have been bearable but to her he was no more than the handsome young doctor whom she had made a gentleman and not a very good piece of work of it either  little she recked of the great loving heart that had thrown itself away on her and the patience that bore with her and she tried to hinder all the liberal bountiful actions that were all he cared to do with his means  i wish the boy may remember him  how long has he been dead  these ten years  he was drowned in a lake storm in switzerlandpeople clung to him and he could not swim  it was johns one great griefhe cannot mention him even now  and really she added smiling i do believe he has brought himself to fancy it was a very happy marriage she has always been very civil but she has been chiefly abroad and never would take his advice about sending her boy to school  what becomes of him now  he is our charge  she was on the way home from italy when she was taken ill at paris and died at the end of the week  how old is he  about nineteen i fancy  he must have had an odd sort of education but if he is a nice lad it will be a great pleasure to john to have something young about the house  i was thinking that mr dusautoy hardly wanted more cares  so have i said her friend smiling and i have been laying a plot against him  you see he is as strong as a lion and never yet was too tired to sleep but it is rather a tempting of providence to keep 3589 people and fourteen services in a week resting upon one man  exactly what his churchwarden has preached to him  moreover he cannot be in two places at once let alone halfadozen now my lancashire people have written in quest of a title for holy orders for a young man who has just gone through cambridge with great credit and it strikes me that he might at once help john and cram master algernon  and gilbert cried albinia  oh if you will import a tutor for gilbert we shall be for ever beholden to you  i had thought of him  i have no doubt that he is much better taught than algernon but i am not afraid of this poor fellow bringing home bad habits and they will be good companions  i reckon upon you and mr kendal as great auxiliaries and i dont think john will be able to withstand our united forces  on the way home on emerging from the alley albinia encountered gilbert just parting with another youth who walked off quickly on the tremblam road while she inquired who it was  that said gilbert oh that was young tritton  he has been away learning farming in scotland  we speak when we meet for old acquaintance sake and that  the bayford mind was diverted from the romance of genevieve by the enormous fortune of the vicars nephew whose capital was in their mouths and imaginations swelled into his yearly income  swarms of cards of inquiry were left at the vicarage and mrs meadows and lucy enjoyed the reflected dignity of being able to say that mrs kendal was continually there  and so she was for mrs dusautoy was drooping though more in body than visibly in spirit and needed both companionship and assistance in supporting the charge left by her absent atlas  he was not gone a moment longer than necessary and took her by surprise at last while albinia and sophy were sitting on the lawn with her when she welcomed the nephew and the vicar holding out a hand to each and thanked them for taking care of fanny  here algernon he continued here are two of our best friends mrs kendal and miss sophy  there was a stiff bow from a stiff altitude  the youth was on the gigantic dusautoy scale looking taller even than his uncle from his manner of holding himself with his chin somewhat elevated  he had a good ruddy sunburnt complexion shining brown hair and regular features and albinia could respond heartily to the good vicars exclamation as he followed her down to the gate for the sake of saying  wellgrown lad isnt that  and a very goodhearted fellow too poor boythe very picture of his dear father  well and how has fanny been  he stayed to be reassured that his return was all his fanny wanted and then hurried back to her while albinia and sophy pursued their way down the hill  news for grandmamma  we must give her a particular description of the hero  how ugly he thought me said sophy quaintly  my dear i believe that is the first thing you think of when you meet a stranger  i saw it this time returned sophy  his chin went up in the air at once  he set me down for mrs kendal and you for miss sophy  nonsense said albinia for the inveterate youthfulness of her bright complexion and sunny hair was almost a sore subject with her your always fancying that every one is disgusted with you is as silly as if you imagined yourself transcendently beautiful  it is mere selfoccupation and helps to make you blunt and shy  mamma said sophy tell me one thing  did you ever think yourself pretty  i have thought myself looking so under favourable circumstances but thats all  you are as far from ugliness as i am and have as little need to think of it  as far as features go theres the making of a much handsomer woman in you than in me  sophy laughed  a certain yearning for personal beauty was a curious part of her character and she would have been ashamed to own the pleasure those few words had given her or how much serenity and forbearance they were worth and her goodhumour was put to the proof that evening for grandmamma had a teaparty bent on extracting the full description of the great algernon greenaway cavendish dusautoy esquire  lucys first sight was less at her ease  elizabeth osborn with whom she kept up a fitful intimacy summoned her mysteriously into her garden to show her a peephole through a little dusty window in the toolhouse whence could be descried the vicarage garden and mr cavendish dusautoy as with a cigar in his mouth and his hands in his pockets       stately stept he east the wa and stately stept he west   lucy was so much amused that she could not help reporting it at home where gilbert forgot his sorrows in building up a mischievous romance in honour of the hole in the sweet and lovely wall  but the parents feud did not seem likely to hold out  a hundred thousand pounds on one side of the wall and three single daughters on the other mrs osborn was not the woman to trust to the walls hole and so mr dusautoys enemy laid down her colours and he was too kindhearted to trace her sudden politeness to the source  mr dusautoy acceded to the scheme devised by his wife and measures were at once taken for engaging the curate  when albinia went to talk the matter over at the parsonage lucy accompanied her but the object of her curiosity was not in the room and when she had heard that he was fond of drawing and that his horses were to be kept at the kings head stables the conversation drifted away and she grew restless and begged mrs dusautoy to allow her to replenish the faded bouquets on the table  no sooner was she in the garden than mrs dusautoy put on an arch look and lowering her voice said  oh it is such fun  he does despise us so immensely  despiseyou  he is a good boy faithful to his training  now his poor mothers axioms were that the english are vulgar country english more vulgar fanny dusautoy the most vulgar  i wish we always as heartily accepted what we are taught  he must be intolerable  no he is very condescending and patronizing to the savages  he really is fond of his uncle and john is so much hurt it i notice his peculiarities that i have been dying to have my laugh out  can mr dusautoy bear with pretension  it is not pretension only calm faith in the lessons of his youth look she added becoming less personal at lucys reentrance and pointing to a small highlyvarnished oilpainting of a red terra cotta vase holding a rose a rhododendron before it and half a watermelon grinning behind newly severed by a knife  is that what people bring home from italy nowadays said albinia  that is an original production  did mr cavendish dusautoy do that cried lucy  genre is his style was the reply  his mother was resolved he should be an amateur and i give his master great credit  especially for that not being a madonna said albinia  i congratulate you on his having so safe an amusement  yes it disposes of him and of the spare room  he cannot exist without an atelier  just then the vicar entered  ah algernons picture began he who had never been known to look at one except the fat cattle in the illustrated news  what do you think of it  has he not made a good hand of the pitcher  albinia gratified him by owning that the pitcher was round and lucy was in perfect rapture at the dear little spots in the rhododendron  a poor way of spending a lads time said the uncle but it is better than nothing and i call the knife very good i declare you might take it up and he squeezed up his eyes to enhance the illusion  a slow and wide opening of the door admitted the lofty presence of algernon cavendish dusautoy with another small picture in his hand becoming aware of the visitors he saluted them with a dignified movement of his head and erecting his chin gazed at them over it  so you have brought us another picture algernon said his uncle mrs kendal has just been admiring your red jar  have you a taste for art demanded mr cavendish dusautoy turning to her with magnificent suavity  i used to be very fond of drawing  genre is my style he pursued almost overthrowing her gravity by the original of his aunts imitation  i took lessons of old barbouilleexcellent master  truth and nature those were his maxims and from the moment i heard them i said this is my man we used positively to live in the borghese  there as he walked backwards after adjusting his production in the best light  a snipe said albinia  a snipe that i killed in the pontine marshes  there is very good shooting about anxur said albinia  you have been at rome  he permitted himself a little animation at discovering any one within the pale of civilization  for one fortnight in the course of a galloping tour with my two brothers said albinia  all the continent in one long vacation  that was much to be regretted  it is my maxim to go through every museum thoroughly  i cant regret said albinia  i should be very sorry to give up my bright indistinct haze of glorious memories though i was too young to appreciate all i saw  for my part i have grown up among works of art  my whole existence has been moulded on them and i feel an inexpressible void without them  i shall be most happy to introduce you into my atelier and show you my notes on the various musees  i preserved them merely as a trifling memorial but many connoisseurs have told me that i ought to print them as a catalogue raisonnee for private circulation of course  i should be sorry to interfere with murray but on the whole i decided otherwise i should be so much bored with applications  mrs dusautoys wicked glance had so nearly demolished the restraint on her friends dimples that she turned her back on her and commended the finish of a solitary downy feather that lay detached beside the bird  my maxim is truth to nature at any cost of pains said the youth not exactly gratified for homage was his native element but graciously proceeding to point out the merits of the composition  albinias composure could endure no more and she took her leave mr dusautoy coming down the hill with her to repeat and this time somewhat wistfully  a fine lad is he not poor fellow  with perfect sincerity she could praise his good looks  he has had a quantity of sad stuff thrust on him by the people who have been about his poor mother said mr dusautoy  she could never bear to part with him and no wonder poor thing and she must have let a very odd sort of people get about her abroadtheyve flattered that poor lad to the top of his bent you see but hes a very good boy for all that very warmhearted  he must be very amiable for his mother to have been able to manage him all this while  just what i say cried the vicar his honest face clearing  many youths would have run into all that is bad brought up in that way but only consider what disadvantages he has had  when we get him to see his real standing a little betteri say could not you let us have your young people to come up this evening have a little music and make it lively  i suppose fanny and i are growing old though i never thought so before  will you come lucy theres a good girl and bring your brother and sister  the lads must be capital friends  lucy promised with sparkling eyes and the vicar strode off saying he should depend on the three  gilbert supposed he was in for it but did not see the use of it he was sick of the name of that polysyllable and should see enough of him when mr hope came worse luck  the result of the evening was that lacy was enraptured at the discovery that this most accomplished hero sang italian songs to the loveliest guitar in the world and was very much offended with sophy for wishing to know whether mamma really thought him so very clever  immediately after the ordination arrived mr hope a very youthful small and delicatelooking man whom mr dusautoy could have lifted as easily as his own fanny with short sight timid nature scholarly habits weak nerves and an inaudible voice  of great intellect having read deeply and reading still more deeply he had the utmost dread of ladies and not even his countrywoman mrs dusautoy could draw him out  he threw his whole soul into the work winning the hearts of the infantschool and the old women but discomfiting the congregation by the weakness of his voice and the length and depth of his sermons  there was one in especial which very few heard and no one entered into except sophy who held an hours argument over it with her father till they arrived at such lengthy names of heresies that poor grandmamma asked if it were right to talk persian on a sunday evening  he conscientiously tutored his two pupils but there was no common ground between him and them  excepting his extra intellect there was no boyhood in him  a townbred scholar a straight constitutional upon a clean road was his wildest dream of exercise he had never mounted a horse did not know a chicken from a partridge except on the table was too shortsighted for pictures and esteemed no music except gregorians  the two youths were far more alive to his deficiencies than to his endowments algernon contemned him for being a booksellers son with nothing to live on but his fellowship and curacy and gilbert looked down on his ignorance of every matter of common life and excessive bashfulness  mr dusautoy would have had less satisfaction in the growing intimacy between the lads had he known that it had been cemented by inveigling poor mr hope into a marsh in search of cottongrass which at gilberts instigation algernon avouched to be a new sort of indian corn grown in italy for feeding silkworms  an intimacy there was rather from constant intercourse than from positive liking  gilbert saw through and disdained young dusautoys dulness and selfconsequence but goodnatured kindly and unoccupied he had no objection to associate with him showing him english ways trying to hinder him from needlessly exposing himself and secretly amused with his pretension  algernon with his fine horses expensive appointments and lofty air was neither a discreditable nor unpleasing companion  mr kendal had given his son a horse which without costing the guineas that algernon had refused for each of his steeds was a very respectablelooking animal and the two young gentlemen starting on their daily ride were a grand spectacle for more than little maurice  gilbert had suffered some eclipse  once he had been the grand parti the only indisputable gentleman but now mr cavendish dusautoy had entirely surpassed him both in selfassertion and in the grounds for it  his incipient dandyisms faded into insignificance beside the splendours of the heir of thousands and he who among all his faults had never numbered conceit or forwardness had little chance beside such an implicit believer in his own greatness  nor was bayford likely to diminish that faith  the nonadorers might be easily enumeratedhis uncle and aunt his tutor his groom mr and mrs kendal gilbert and sophy the rest all believed in him as thoroughly as he did in himself  his wealth was undoubted his accomplishments were rated at his own advertisement and his magnanimous condescension was esteemed at full value  really handsome goodnatured and sociable he delighted to instruct his worshippers by his maxims and to bend graciously to their homage the young ladies had but one cynosure  few eyes were there that did not pursue his every movement few hearts that did not bound at his approach few tongues that did not chronicle his daily comings and goings  it would save much trouble said albinia if a court circular could be put into the bayford paper  the kendals were the only persons whom algernon regarded as in any way on a footing with him  finding that the lady was a ferrars and had been in italy he regarded her as fit company and whenever they met favoured her with the chief and choicest of his maxims little knowing how she and his aunt presumed to discuss him in private  without being illdisposed he had been exceedingly ill taught his mother the child of a grasping vulgar father had little religious impression and that little had not been fostered by the lax habits of a selfexpatriated englishwoman and very soon after his arrival at bayford his disregard of ordinary english proprieties had made itself apparent  on the first sunday he went to church in the morning but spent the evening in pacing the garden with a cigar and on the afternoon of that day week his aunt was startled by the sound of horses hoofs on the road  mr dusautoy was at school and she started up met the young gentleman and asked him what strange mistake could have been made  he made her a slight bow and loftily said he was always accustomed to ride at that hour  but not on sunday she exclaimed  he was not aware of any objection  she told him his uncle would be much displeased he replied politely that he would account to his uncle for his conduct begged her pardon but he could not keep his horse waiting  mrs dusautoy went back fairly cried at the thought of her husbands vexation and the scandal to the whole town  the vicar was of course intensely annoyed though he still could make excuses for the poor boy and laid all to the score of ignorance and foreign education  he made algernon clearly understand that the sunday ride must not be repeated  algernon mumbled something about compromising his uncle and offending english prejudices by which he reserved to himself the belief that he yielded out of magnanimity not because he could not help it but he could not forgive his aunt for her peremptory opposition he became unpleasantly sullen and morose as regularly as the sunday came round and revenged himself by pacing the verandah with his cigar or practising anything but sacred music on his keybugle in his paintingroom  the youth was really fond of his uncle but he had imbibed all his mothers contempt for her sisterinlaw  used to be wheedled by an idolizing mother and to reign over her court of parasites he had no notion of obeying and a direct command or opposition roused his sullen temper of passive resistance  when he found that little nobody of a mrs john dusautoy so far from being a flatterer or an adorer of his perfections inclined to laugh at him and bent on keeping him in order all the enmity of which he was capable arose in his mind and though in general goodnatured and not aggressive he had a decided pleasure in doing what she disapproved and thus asserting the dignity of a greenaway cavendish dusautoy  the atelier was a happy invention  certainly wearisome noises and an aroma of havannahs would now and then proceed therefrom but he was employed there the chief part of the day and fortunately his pictures were of small size and took an infinite quantity of labour so that they could not speedily outrun all the vicarage walls  he favoured the university of oxford by going up with gilbert for matriculation when to the surprise of mr hope he was not plucked they were to begin their residence at the easter term  mrs dusautoy did not confess even to albinia how much she looked forward to easter  in early spring a sudden and short illness took away madame belmarches brave spirit to its rest after sixty years of exile and poverty cheerfully borne  there had been no time to summon genevieve and her aunt would not send for her but decided on breaking up the school which could no longer be carried on and going to live in the hadminster convent and thus as mr kendal hoped all danger of renewed intercourse between his son and genevieve ended  gilbert looked pale and wretched and sophy hoped it was with compunction at having banished genevieve at such a moment but not a word was saidand that page of early romance was turned     chapter xviii    it was a beautiful july afternoon the air musical with midsummer hum the flowers basking in the sunshine the turf cool and green in the shade and the breeze redolent of indescribable freshness and sweetness compounded of all fragrant odours the present legacy of a past days shower  like the flowers themselves albinia was feeling the delicious repose of refreshed nature as in her pretty pink muslin her white drapery folded round her and her bright hair unbonnetted she sat reclining in a low garden chair at the door of the conservatory a little pale a little weak but with a sweet happy languor a soft tender bloom  there was a step in the conservatory and before she could turn round her brother maurice bent over her and kissed her  maurice you have come after all  yes the school inspection is put off  how are you as he sat down on the grass by her side  oh quite well  what a delicious afternoon we shall have  edmund will be at home directly  mrs meadows has absolutely let gilbert take her to drink tea at the drurys  only i am sorry sophy should miss you for she was so good about going because lucy wanted to do something to her fernery  of course you are come for sunday and the christening  yesthat is to throw myself on dusautoys mercy  we will send mr hope to fairmead said albinia and see whether winifred can make him speak  we cant spare the vicar for he is our godfather and you must christen the little maiden  i thought the three elder ones were to be sponsors  gilbert is shy said albinia afraid of the responsibility and perhaps he is almost too near the very next to ourselves  his father would have preferred mr dusautoy from the first and only yielded to my wish  i wish you had come two minutes sooner she was being paraded under that wall but now she is gone in asleep  her father writes grand things of her  does he said albinia colouring and smiling at what could not be heard too often he is tolerably satisfied with the young woman and he thinks her like edmund and so she must be for she is just like him  she will have such beautiful eyes  it is very good of her to take after him since maurice wont  and she is to be another albinia  i represented the confusion and how i always meant my daughter to be winifred but theres no doing anything with him  it is only to be a second name  a w k  think if she should marry a mr ward  no she would not be awkward if she were so awarded  it wont spell maurice cried albinia laughing as their nonsense as usual rose to the surface but how is winifred  as well as could be hoped under the affliction of not being able to come and keep you in order  she fancied me according to the former pattern said albinia smiling i could have shown her a better specimen not that it was any merit for there were no worries and edmund was so happy that it was pleasure enough to watch him  i was coming every day to judge for myself but i thought things could not be very bad while he wrote such flourishing accounts  no there were no more ponds said albinia and grandmamma happily was quite well cured i believe by the excitement  lucy took care of her and sophy read to mehow we have enjoyed those readings oh and aunt gertrude has found a delightful situation for genevieve a barristers family with lots of little childreneighty pounds a year and quite ready to value her so she is off my mind  maurice boy come here she called as she caught sight of a creature prancing astride on one stick and waving another  on perceiving a visitor the urchin came careering up bouncing full tilt upon her and clasping her round with both his stalwart arms gently gently boy she said bending down and looking with proud delight at her brother as she held between her hands a face much like her own as fair and freshly tinted but with a peculiar squareness of contour large blue eyes with dark fringes brimming over with mischief and fun a bold broad brow and thick light curls  there was a spring and vigour as of perpetual irrepressible life about the whole being and the moment he had accepted his uncles kiss he poised his lance and exclaimed you are bonaparte im the duke  indeed said mr ferrars at once seizing a wand and bestriding the nearest bench  two or three charges rendered the boy so uproarious that presently he was ordered off and to use the old apple tree as bonaparte  what a stout fellow said mr ferrars as he went off at a plunging gallop i should have taken him for at least five years old  so he might be said albinia for strength and spirithe is utterly fearless and never cries much as he knocks himself about he will do anything but learn  the rogue he once knew all his letters but no sooner did he find they were the work of life than he forgot every one and was never so obstreperous as when called upon to say them  i gave up the point but i foresee some fine scenes  his minding no one but you is an old story  i hope at least the exception continues  i have avoided testing it  i want all my forces for a decisive battle  i never heard of such a masterful imp she continued with much more exultation than anxiety his sisters have no chance with him he rules them like a young turk  theres the pony  sophy will let him have it as a right and it is the work of my life to see that she is not defrauded of her rides  you dont mean that that child rides anything but a stick  one would think he had been born in boots and spurs  legitimately he only rides with some one leading the pony but i have my suspicions that by some preternatural means he has been on the ponys back and round the yard alone and that papa prudentially concealed it from me  i confess i should not like it said her brother gravely  oh i dont mind that kind of thing  a real boy cant be hurt and i dont care how wild he runs so long as he is obedient and truthful  and true i think he is to the backbone and i know he is reverend  we had such a disturbance because he would not say his prayers  proof positive  yes it was said albinia  it did not seem to him orthodox without me and when he was let into my room again it was the prettiest sight  when he had been told of his little sister all he said was that he did not want little girlsgirls were stupid  ah that came of your premature introduction to my albinia  not at all  it was partly as williams own nephew and partly because pleasure was expected from him  but when he actually saw the little thing that sturdy face grew so very soft and sweet and when we told him he was her protector he put both his hands tight together and said ill be so good  when he is with her another child seems to shine out under the bluff pickle he generally ishe walks so quietly and thinks it such an honour to touch her  she will be his best tutor said maurice smiling but breaking off  a sudden shriek of deadly terror rang out over the garden from the river  a second or two sufficed to show them lucy at the other end of the footbridge that led across the canal to the towingpath she did not look round till albinia clutching her demanded where is he  unable to speak lucy pointed down the towingpath along which a horse was seen rushing wildlya figure pursuing it  it was hitched up herehe must have scrambled up by the gate  oh mamma mamma he has run after him but oh  mr ferrars gave lucys arm a squeeze a hint not to augment the horror  something he said of let meand you had better but albinia heard nothing and was only bent on pressing forward  the canal and path took a wide sweep round the meadow and the horse was still in sight galloping at full speed with a small heap on its back as they trusted but the rapid motion and their eyes strained and misty with alarm caused an agony of uncertainty  albinia pointed across the meadows in anguish at not being able to make herself understood and hoarsely said the gate  mr ferrars caught her meaning and the next moment had leaped over the gutter and splashed into the water meadow but in utter hopelessness of being beforehand with the runaway steed  how could that gate be other than fatal  the horse was nearing itthe pursuer far behindmr ferrars not half way over the fields  there was a loud cry from lucyhe is caught caught  a loud shout came back was caught up and sent on by both the pursuers all right  albinia had stood in an almost annihilation of conscious feeling even when her brother strode back to her repeating all safe thanks be to god she neither spoke nor relaxed that intensity of watching a few seconds more and she sprang forward again as the horse was led up by a young man at his side and on his back laughing and chattering sat master maurice  algernon dusautoy strode a few steps behind somewhat aggrieved but that no one saw  the elder maurice lifted down the younger one who as he was clasped by his mother exclaimed oh mamma bamfylde went so fast  i am to ride home again  he said sohes my cousin  albinia scarcely heard her brother however had turned to thank the stranger for her and exclaimed i should say you were an omore  im ulick from the loughside lodge was the answer  is cousin winifred here  no this is my sister mrs kendal but  albinia held out her hand and grasped his i cantmaurice speak she said  the little maurice persisted in his demand to be remounted for the twelve yards to their own gate but nobody heard him his uncle was saying a few words of explanation to the stranger and algernon dusautoy was enunciating something intended as a gracious reception of the apologies which no one was making  all albinia thought of was that the little unruly hand was warm and struggling prisoned in her own all her brother cared for was to have her safely at home  he led her across the bridge and into the garden where they met mr kendal who had taken alarm from her absence lucy ran up with her story and almost at the same moment albinia springing to him murmured oh edmund the great mercymaurice but there she found herself making a hoarse shriek with a mingled sense of fright and shame she smothered it but there was an agony of suffocation she felt her husbands arms round her heard his voice and her boys scream of terrorfelt them all unable to help her and sank into unconsciousness  mr ferrars helped mr kendal to carry his wifes inanimate form to her room  they used all means of restoration but it was a long heavy swoon and a slow painful revival  mr kendal would have been in utter despair at hearing that the doctor was out but for his brother with his ready resources and cheerful encouragement and finally she lifted her eyelids and as she felt the presence of her two dearest guardians whispered where is he  lucy reported that he was with susan and albinia after hearing her husband again assure her that he was quite safe lay still from exhaustion but so calm that her brother thought them best alone and drew lucy away  in about a quarter of an hour mr kendal came down saying that she was quietly asleep and he had left the nurse with her  he had yet to hear the story and when he understood that the child had been madly careering along the towingpath on the back of young dusautoys most spirited hunter and had been only stopped when the horse was just about to leap the tall gate he was completely overcome  when he spoke again it was with the abrupt exclamation that child  lucy bring him down  in marched the boy full of life and mischief though with a large red spot beneath each eye  maurice  gilbert had often heard that tone but maurice never and he tossed back his head with an innocent look of fearless wonder maurice i find you have been a very naughty disobedient boy  when you rode the pony round the yard did not i order you never to do so again  i did not do it again boldly rejoined maurice  speak the truth sir  what do you mean by denying what you have done exclaimed his father angrily  i didnt ride the pony indignantly cried the child i rode a horse saddled and bridled  dont answer me in that way thundered mr kendal and much incensed by the nice distinction and not appreciating the sincerity of it he gave the child a shake rough enough to bring the red into his face but not a tear  you knew it was very wrong and you were as near as possible breaking your neck  you have frightened your mamma so as to make her very ill and i am sorry to find you most mischievous and unruly not to be trusted out of sight  now listen to me i shall punish you very severely if you act in this disobedient way again  papa angry was a novel spectacle at which maurice looked as innocently and steadily as ever so completely without fear or contrition that he provoked a stern do you hear me sir and another shake  maurice flushed and his chest heaved though he did not sob and his father uncomfortable at such sharp dealing with so young a child set him aside with the words there now recollect what i have told you and walked to the window where he stood silent for some seconds while the boy stood with rounded shoulders perplexed eye and finger on his pouting lip and mr ferrars newspaper in hand watched him under his eyelids and speculated what would be the best sort of mediation or whether the young gentleman yet deserved it  he knew that his own willie would have been a mere quaking sobbing mass of terror under such a shake and he would like to have been sure whether that sturdy silence were obstinacy or fortitude  the sound of the doorbell made mr kendal turn round and laying his hand on the little fellows fair head he said there maurice well say no more about it if you will be a good boy  run away now but dont go into your mammas room  maurice looked up tossed his curls out of his eyes shook himself felt the place on his arm where the grip of the hand had been and galloped off like the young colt that he was  albinia awoke refreshed though still shaken and feeble and surprised to find that dinner was going on downstairs  her own meal presently put such new force into her that she felt able to speak maurices name without bursting into tears and longing to see both her little ones beside her she told the nurse to fetch the boy but received for answer no master maurice said he would not come and the manner conveyed that it had been defiantly said  master maurice was no favourite in the nursery and he was still less so when his mamma disregarding all mandates set out to seek him  already she heard from the stairs the wrangling with susan that accompanied all his toilettes and she found him the picture of firm solid fairness in his little robe de nuit growling through the combing of his tangled locks  though ordinarily scornful of caresses he sprang to her and hugged her as she sat down on a low chair and he knelt in her lap whispering with his head on her shoulder and his arms round her neck mamma were you dead  no maurice she answered with something of a sob or i should not have my dear dear little boy throttling me now  but why would you not come down to me  papa said i must not  oh that was quite right my boy and though she unclasped the tight arms she drew him nestling into her bosom  oh maurice it has been a terrible day  does my little boy know how good the great god has been to him and how near he was never seeing mamma nor his little sister again  her great object was to make him thankful for his preservation but with a child knowing nothing of death and heedless of fear this was very difficult  the rapid motion had been delightful excitement or if there had been any alarm it was forgotten in the triumph  she had to change her note and represent how the poor horse might have run into the river or against a post  maurice looked serious and then she came to the high moral tonemounting strangers horses without leavewould papa would gilbert think of such a thing  the full lip was put out as though under conviction and he hung his head  you wont do it again said she  no  she told him to say his prayers guiding the confession and thanksgiving that she feared he did not fully follow  as he rose up and saw the tears on her cheeks he whispered mamma did it make you so  cause and effect were a great puzzle to him but that swoon was the only thing that brought home to him that he had been guilty of something enormous and when she owned that his danger had been the occasion he stood and looked then standing bolt upright with clasped hands and rosy feet pressed close together he said with a long breath ill never get on bamfylde again till im a big boy  as he spoke mr kendal pushed open the halfclosed door and albinia looking up said heres a boy who knows he has done wrong papa  never was more welcome excuse for lifting the gallant child to his breast and lavishing caresses that would have been tender but for the strong spirit of riot which turned them into a game at romps cut short by mr kendal as soon as the noise grew very outrageous thats enough tonight good night  and when they each had kissed the monkey face tossing about among the clothes maurice might have heard more pride than pain in the i never saw such a boy with which they shut the door  this is not prudent said mr kendal  do you think i could have rested till i had seen him and he said you had told him not to come down  i would have brought him to you  you are looking very ill you had better go to bed at once  no i should not sleep  pray let me grow quiet first  now you know you trust mauriceold maurice and ill lie on the sofa like any mouse if youll bring him up and let him talk  you know it will be an interesting novelty for you to talk and me to listen and he has not seen the baby  albinia gained her point but mr kendal and lucy first tucked her up upon the sofa till she cried out you have swathed me hand and foot  how am i to show off that little awk  ill take care of that said mr kendal and so he did fully doing the honours of the little daughter who had already fastened on his heart  but cried albinia breaking into the midst who or what are we ungrateful monsters never to have thought of the man who caught that dreadful horse  you shall see him as soon as you are strong enough said mr kendal your brother and i have been with him  oh i am glad i could not rest if he had not been thanked  and can anything be done for him  what is he  i thought he was a gentleman  maurice smiled and mr kendal answered yes he is mr goldsmiths nephew and i am pleased to find that he is a connexion of your brother  one of the omores cried albinia  oh maurice is it really one of winifreds omores  even so replied mr ferrars the very last person i should have expected to meet on the banks of the baye  it was that clever son of the captains for whose education mr goldsmith paid and it seems had sent for to consider of his future destination  he only arrived yesterday  a very fine young man said mr kendal i was particularly pleased with his manner and it was an act of great presence of mind and dexterity  it is all a maze and mystery to me said albinia do tell me all about it  i cant make out how the horse came there  i understood that young dusautoy was calling here said mr kendal i wondered at even his coolness in coming in by that way and at your letting him in  i saw nothing of him said albinia  perhaps he was looking for gilbert  no said lucy looking up from her work with a slight blush and demure voice of secret importance he had only stepped in for a minute to bring me a new fern  indeed said her father i was not aware that he took interest in your fernery  he knows everything about ferns said lucy  mrs cavendish dusautoy once had a conservatory filled with the rarest specimens and he has given me a great many directions how to manage them  oh if he could get you to listen to his maxims i dont wonder at anything exclaimed albinia  he had only just come in with the adiantium and was telling me how hydraulic power directed a stream of water near the roots among his mothers fuci said lucy rather hurt  he had fastened up his horse quite securely and nobody could have guessed that maurice could have opened that gate to cross the bridge far less have climbed up the rail to the horses back  i never shall forget my fright when we heard the creatures feet and mr cavendish dusautoy began to run after it directly  as foolish a thing as he could have done said mr kendal not impressed with mr cavendish dusautoys condescension in giving chase  it was well poor little maurice was not abandoned to your discretion and his resources  it seems continued mr ferrars that young omore was taking a walk on the towingpath and was just so far off as to see without being able to prevent it this little monkey scramble from the gate upon the horses neck  how it was that he did not go down between i cant guess the beast gave a violent start as well it might jerked the reins loose and set off full gallop  seeing the child clinging on like a young panther he dashed across the meadow to cut him off at the turn of the river and it was a great feat of swiftness i assure you to run so lightly through those marshy meadows so as to get the start of the runaway then he crept up under cover of the hedge so as not to startle the horse and had hold of the bridle just as he paused before leaping the gate  he said he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the urchin safe and looking more excited than terrified  yes he was exceedingly struck with maurices spirit said mr kendal who when the fright and anger were over could begin to be proud of the exploit  they fraternized at once said mr ferrars  maurice imparted that his name was maurice ferrars kendal and ulick in all good faith and irish simplicity discovered that they were cousins  oh edmund he must come to the christening dinner  mind said maurice you know he is not even my wifes cousin only nephew to her second cousins husband  for shame maurice cousin is that cousinly does  very well only dont tell the aunts that winifred saddled all the omores upon you  not an omore but should be welcome for his sake  nor an irishman said mr ferrars  albinia suffered so much from the shock that she could not make her appearance till noon on the following day  then after sitting a little while in the old study to hear that grandmamma had not been able to sleep all night for thinking of maurices danger and being told some terrible stories of accidents with horses she felt one duty done and moved on to the drawingroom in search of her brother  she found herself breaking upon a teteatete  a sweet full voice with strong cadences was saying something about duty and advice and she would have retreated but her brother and the stranger both sprang up and made her understand that she was by no means to go away  no introduction was wanted she grasped the hand that was extended to her and would have said something if she could but she found herself not strong enough to keep from tears and only said i wish little maurice were not gone out with his brother but you will dine with us and see him tomorrow  with the greatest pleasure if my uncle and aunt will spare me  they must said albinia you must come to meet your old friend and cousin she added mischievously glancing at maurice but he did not look inclined to disavow the relationship and the youth was not a person whom any one would wish to keep at a distance  he seemed about nineteen or twenty years of age not tall but well made and with an air of great ease and agility rather lounging and careless yet alert in a moment  the cast of his features at once betrayed his country by the rounded temples with the free wavy hair the circular form of the eyebrow the fully opened dark blue eye looking almost black when shaded the short nose and the wellcut chin and lips with their outlines of sweetness and of fun all thoroughly irish but of the best style and with a good deal of thought and mind on the brow and determination in the mouth  albinia had scarcely a minute however for observation for he seemed agitated and in haste to take leave nor did her brother press him to remain since she was still looking very white and red and too fragile for anything but rest  with another squeeze of the hand she let him go while he with murmured thanks and head bent in enthusiastic honour to the warm kindness of one so sweet and graceful took leave  mr ferrars followed him into the hall leaving the door open so that she heard the words goodbye ulick ill do my best for you  all i can say is that i respect you  dont respect me too soon he answered maybe youll have to change your mind  the situation may like me no better than i the situation  no what you will you can do i trust to your perseverance  as my poor mother does  well with patience the snail got to rome and if it is to lighten her load i must bear it  many thanks mr ferrars  good morning  good morning only ulick excuse me but let me give you a hint if the situation is to like you you must mind your irish  then you must not warm my heart with your kindness was the answer no no never fear when im not with any one who has seen ballymakilty i can speak english so that i could not be known for a galway man  not that im ashamed of my country he added and the next moment the door shut behind him  how could you scold him for his irish exclaimed albinia as her brother reentered it sounds so pretty and characteristic  i fear mr goldsmith may think it too characteristic  i am sure edmund might well call him prepossessing  i hope mr goldsmith is going to do something handsome for him  poor lad  mr goldsmith considers that he has purchased him for a permanent fixture on a high stool  it is a sad disappointment for he had been doing his utmost to prepare himself for college and he has so far distinguished himself at school that i see that a very little help would soon enable him to maintain himself at the university  i could have found it in my heart to give it to him myself it would please winifred  oh let us help i am sure edmund would be glad  no no this is better for all  remember this is the goldsmiths only measure of conciliation towards their sister since her marriage and it ought not to be interfered with  poor ulick says he knows this is the readiest chance of being of any use to his family and that his mother has often said she should be happy if she could but see one of the six launched in a way to be independent  there are those three eldest little better than squireens never doing a thing but loafing about with their guns  i used to long for a horsewhip to lay about them till they spoke to me and then not one of the rogues but won my heart with his fun and goodnature  then i suppose it is a great thing to have one in the way of moneymaking  hem  the celtic blood is all in commotion  this boys business was to ask my candid opinion whether there were anything ungentlemanlike in a clerkship in a bank  it was well it was not you  now maurice dont you know how glad i should have been if gilbert would have been as wise  yes you have some common sense after all which is more than ulick attributes to his kith and kin  when i had proved the respectability of banking to his conviction ill not say satisfaction he made me promise to write to his father  he is making up his mind to what is not only a great vexation to himself and very irksome employment but he knows he shall be looked down upon as having lost caste with all his family  it really is heroism cried albinia  it is said mr ferrars he does not trust himself to face the clan and means to get into harness at once so as to clench his resolution and relieve his parents from his maintenance immediately  is he to live with that formal miss goldsmith  no  in solitary lodgings after that noisy family and easy home  i cant think how he will stand it  i should not wonder if the galwegian was too strong after all  we must do all we can for him cried albinia edmund likes him already  cant he dine with us every sunday  i know you will be kind said mr ferrars  only see how things turn out before you commit yourself  ah  i have said the unlucky word which always makes you fly off  there was little fear that ulick omore would not win his way with mr and mrs kendal recommended as he was and with considerable attractions in the frankness and brightness of his manner  he was a very pleasant addition to the party who dined at willow lawn after the christening  no one had time to listen to mr cavendish dusautoys maxims and he retired rather sullenly to lean against the mantelpiece and marvel why the kendals should invite an irish bankers clerk to meet him  gilbert likewise commented on the guest with a muttered observation on his sisters taste last year it was all the polysyllable now it would be all the irishman     chapter xix    there was a war of supremacy in the kendal household  albinia and her son were greek to greek and if physical force were on her side her own tenderness was against her  as to allies maurice had by far the majority of the household the muchtormented susan was her mistresss sole supporter  mr kendal and sophy might own it inexpedient to foster his outrecuidance but they so loved to do his bidding so hated to thwart him and so grieved at his being punished that they were little better than gilbert lucy grandmamma or any of the maids or men  the moral sense was not yet stirred and the boy seemed to be trying the force of his will like the strength of his limbs  even as he delighted to lift a weight the moment he saw that it was heavy so a command was to him a challenge to see how much he would undergo rather than obey but his resistance was so open gay and free that it could hardly be called obstinacy and he gloried in disappointing punishment  the dark closet lost all terror for him he stood there blowing the horn through his hand content to follow an imaginary chase and when untimely sent to bed he stole susans scissors and cut a range of stables in the sheets  the short sharp infliction of pain answered best but his father though he could give a shake when angry could not strike when cool and albinia was forced to turn executioner though with such tears and trembling that her culprit looked up reassuringly saying never mind mamma i shant  he did however mind her tears they bore in upon him the sense of guilt and after each transgression he could not be at peace till he had marched up to her holding out his hand for the blow and making up his face not to wince and then would cling round her neck to feel himself pardoned  justice came to him in a most fair and motherly shape  the brightest the merriest of all his playmates was mamma he loved her passionately and could endure no cloud between himself and her so that he was slowly learning that submission to her was peace and pleasure and rebellion mere pain to both  she established ten minutes of daily lessons but even she could not reach beyond the capture of his restless person his mind was out of reach and keen as he was in everything else towards a  b  ab he was an unmitigated dunce  nor did he obey any one who did not use authority and force of will and though perfectly simple and sincere he was too young to restrain himself without the assistance of the controlling power so that in his mothers absence he was tyrannical and violent and she never liked to have him out of her sight and never was so sure that he was deep in mischief as when she had not heard his voice for a quarter of an hour  albinia said mr kendal one relenting autumn day when november strove to look like april i thought of walking to pay farmer graves for the corn  will you come with me  delightful i want to see what maurice will say to the turkeycock  is it not too far for him  he would run quite as many miles in the garden said albinia who would have walked in dread of a court of justice on her return had not the scarlet hose been safely prancing on the road before her  this way then said mr kendal i must get this draft changed at the bank  come maurice you will see a friend there  do you know edmund said albinia as they set forth my conscience smites me as to that youth i think we have neglected him  i cannot see what more we could have done  if his uncle does not bring him forward in society we cannot interfere  it must be a forlorn condition said albinia he is above the other clerks and he seems to be voted below the bayford elite since the polysyllable has made it so very refined  one never meets him anywhere now it is too dark to walk after the banking hours  cannot we ask him to come in some evening  we cannot have our evenings broken up said mr kendal  i should be glad to show him any kindness but his uncle seems to have ruled it that he is to be considered more as his clerk than as one of his family and i doubt if it would be doing him any service to interfere  they were now at the respectable old freestone building with goldsmith inscribed on the iron windowblinds and a venerable date carved over the door  inside those blinds came high and let in but little light over the tall desks at which were placed the blackhorsehair perches of the clerks old mr goldsmith himself occupying a lower throne more accessible to the clients  one of the high stools stood empty and albinia making inquiry mr goldsmith answered with a dry dissatisfied cough that more as he called him had struck work and gone home with a headache  indeed said albinia i am sorry to hear it  mr hope said he thought him not looking well  he has complained of headache a good deal lately said mr goldsmith  young men dont find it easy to settle to business  albinias heart smote her for not having thought more of her sons rescuer and she revolved what could or what might have been done it really was not easy to show him attention considering gilberts prejudice against his accent and mr kendals dislike to an interrupted evening and all she could devise was a future call on miss goldsmith  but for maurice it would have been a silent walk and though her mind was a little diverted by his gallant attempt to bestride the largest pig in the farmyard she was sure mr kendal was musing on the same topic and was not surprised when as they returned he exclaimed i have a great mind to go and see after that poor lad  this way then said albinia turning down a narrow muddy street parallel with the river  impossible said mr kendal he can never live at the wharves  yes said albinia he told me that he lodged with an old servant of the goldsmiths pratts wife at the lower wharf  she pointed to the name of pratt over a shopwindow in a house that had once seen better days but which looked so forlorn that mr kendal would not look the slatternly maid in the face while so absurd a question was asked as whether mr omore lived there  the girl without further ceremony took them up a dark stair and opened the door of a twilight room where albinias first glimpse showed her the young man with his head bent down on his arms on the table as close as possible to the forlorn black fire of the grim dull sulky coal of the county which had filled the room with smoke and blacks  the window opened to clear it only admitted the sickly scent of decaying weed from the river to compete with the perfume of the cobblers stockintrade  ulick started up pale and astonished and mr kendal struck with consternation chiefly thought of taking away his wife and child from the infected atmosphere and made signs to albinia not to sit down but she was eagerly compassionate  it was nothing said ulick only his head was rather worse than usual and he thought it time to give in when the threes put lapwings feathers in their caps just like the fives  are you subject to these headaches  it is only homesickness he said  ill have got over it soon  i must come and see after you my good friend said mr kendal with suppressed impatience and anxiety  i shall return in a moment or two but i am sure you are not well enough for so many visitors taking you by surprise  come  he was so peremptory that albinia found herself on the staircase before she knew what she was about  the fever panic had seized mr kendal in full force he believed typhus was in the air and insisted on her taking maurice home at once while he went himself to fetch mr bowles  she did not in the least credit fever to be in the chill touch of that lizard hand and believed that she could have been the best doctor but there was no arguing while he was under this alarm and she knew that she might be thankful not to be ordered to observe a quarantine  when mr kendal returned home he looked much discomposed though his first words were thank heaven it is no fever  albinia we must look after that poor lad he is positively poisoned by that pestiferous river and bad living  bowles said he was sure he was not eating meat enough  i dare say that greasy woman gives him nothing fit to eat  albinia you must talk to himfind out whether old goldsmith gives him a decent salary  he ought not to be in those lodgings another day  i suppose miss goldsmith had no notion what they were  i fancy she never saw the lower wharf in her life  i never did till today said mr kendal  it was all of a piece the whole streetthe roomthe furniturewhy the paper was coming off the walls  what could they be dreaming of  and there he was trying to read a little edition of prodentius printed at salamanca which he picked up at a bookstall at galway  it must have belonged to some priest educated in spain  he says any latin book was invaluable to him  he is infinitely too good for his situation and the goldsmiths are neglecting him infamously  look out some rooms fit for him albinia  i will try  let me seeif i could only recollect any but mr hope has the only really nice ones in the place  somewhere he must be if it is in this house  there is poor old madame belmarches still empty with bridget keeping it  i wish he could have rooms there  well why not  pettilove told me it must be let as two tenements if the old woman could take half a lodger would pay her rent said mr kendal promptly  you had better propose it  and the goldsmiths asked albinia  i will show him the lower wharf  the next afternoon mr kendal desired his wife to go to the bank and borrow young omore for her walking companion  really i dont know whether i have the impudence  i will come and do it for you  you will do best alone with the lad i want you to get into his confidence and find out whether old goldsmith treats him properly  i declare but that i know john kendal so well this would be enough to make me rejoice that gilbert is not thrown on the world  albinia knew herself to be so tactless that she saw little hope other doing anything but setting him against his relations but her husband was in no frame to hear objections so she made none and only trusted she should not be very foolish  at least the walk would be a positive physical benefit to the slave of the desk  ulick omore was at his post and said his head was well but his hair stuck up as if his fingers had been many times run through it he was much thinner and the wearied countenance whitened complexion and spiritless sunken eyes were a sad contrast to the glowing freshness and life that had distinguished him in the summer  mr kendal told the banker that it had been decided that his nephew needed exercise and that mrs kendal would be glad of his company in a long walk  mr goldsmith seemed rather surprised but consented whereupon the young clerk lighted up into animation and bounded out of his prison house with a springy step learnt upon mountain heather  mr kendal only waited to hear whither they were bound  oh as far as we can go on the woodside road said albinia  i think the prescription i used to inflict on poor sophy will not be thrown away here  i always fancy there is a whiff of sea air upon the hill there  ulick smiled at such a fond delusion bred up as he had been upon the wildest seacoast exposed to the full sweep of the atlantic storm she set him off upon his own scenery to the destruction of his laborious english as he dwelt on the glories of his beloved rocks rent by fierce sea winds and waves into fantastic grotesque or lovely shapes with fiords of exquisite blue sea between the variety of which had been to him as the gentle foliage of tamer countries not a tree stood near the town of ballymakilty but the wild crags the sparkling waters the broad open hills and the bogs with their intensely purple horizon held fast upon his heart and he told of white sands reported to be haunted by mermaids and crevices of rock where the tide roared and gave rise to legends of sea monsters and giants turned to stone  he was becoming confidential and intimate when in a lowered voice he mentioned the banshees crag where the shrouded messenger of doom never failed to bewail each dying child of the omore and where his own old nurse had actually beheld her keening for the uncle who was killed among the caffres  albinia began to know how she ought to respect the omores  they were skirting the side of the hill with a dip of green meadowland below them rising on the other side into coppices  the twang of the horn and the babbling cry of the hounds reminded albinia that the hunting season had begun and looking over a gate she watched the particoloured forms of the dogs glancing among the brushwood opposite and an occasional red coat gleaming out through the hedge above  just then the cry ceased the dogs became silent and scattered hither and thither bewildered  ulick looked eagerly then suddenly vaulted over the gate went forward a few steps looked again pointed towards some dark object which she could barely discern put his finger in his ear and uttered an unearthly screech incomprehensible to her but well understood by the huntsman and through him by the dogs which at once simultaneously dashed in one direction and came pouring into the meadow over towards him down went their heads up went their curved tails the clatter and rushing of hoofs and the apparition of red coats showed the hunters all going round the copse while at the same moment away with winged steps bounded her companion flying headlong like the wind so as to meet the hunt             ask me not what the lady feels            left in that dreadful hour alone   laughed albinia to herself  well done speed  edmund might be satisfied theres not much amiss  through the hedgeover the meadowa flying leap over the streamit is more like a bird than a manup again  does he mean to follow the hunt all the rest of the way  rather irish i must say  and i do believe they will all come down this lane  i must walk on it wont do to be overtaken here between these high hedges  ah  i thought he was too much of a gentleman to leave mehere he comes  how much in his way i must be i never saw such a runner not a bit does he slacken for the hilland what bright cheeks and eyes  what good it must have done him  i beg ten thousand pardons cried he as he came up scarcely out of breath  i declare i forgot you i could not help it when i saw them at a check   you feel for the hunter as i do for the fox said albinia  is yours one of the great hunting neighbourhoods  that it is he cried  my grandfather had the grand stud  he and his seven sons were out three times in the week and there was a mount for whoever wanted it  and this generation is not behind the last  ah and why would it be exclaimed the boy the last remnant of english pronunciation forsaking him  my uncle connel has the best mare on this side the bridge of athlone  i mean that side  and how is it with you asked albinia  weve got no horsesthat is except my fathers mare and the colt and fir darrigthe swishtailed ponyand the blind donkey that brings in the turf  so we younger ones mostly go hunting on foot and after all i believe thats the best sport  bryan always comes in before any of the horses and we all think it a shame if we dont  i see where you learnt the swiftness of foot that was so useful last july said albinia  that oh but bryan would have been up long before me said ulick hed have made for the lock not the gate  you should see what sport we have when the fox takes to the corrig dearg up among the rocksand little rosie upon fir darrig with her hair upon the wind and her colour like the morning cloud glancing in and out among the rocks like the fairy of the glen  there are those that think her the best part of the hunt they say the english officers at ochlochtimore would never think it worth coming out but for her  i dont believe that you know he added laughing though i like to fetch a rise out of ulick at the great house by telling him of it  how old is she  fifteen last april and she is like an april wind when it comes warm and frolicking over the sea  so wild and free and yet so gentle and soft  ellen and mary are grave and steady and work hard every stitch of my stockings was poor marys knitting except what poor old peggy would send up for a compliment but rosiei dont think she does a thing but sing and ride and row the boat and keep the house alive  my mother shakes her head but i dont know what shell say when she gets my aunts letter  my aunt goldsmith purses up her lips and says ill write to advise my sister to send her daughters to some good school  ellen maybe might bear one but ah the thought of little rosie in a good school  like her brother ulick in a good bank eh  why he cried they always called me the steady englishman  albinia laughed but at that moment the sounds of the hunt again occupied them and all were interpreted by ulick with the keenest interest but he would not run away again though she exhorted him not to regard her  presently it swept on out of hearing and byandbye they reached the summit of the hill and looked forth on the dark pine plantations on the opposite undulation standing out in black relief against a sky golden with a pale pure pearly november sunset a daffodil sky flecked with tiny fleeces of soft brightyellow light reminding albinia of fouques beautiful dream of aslaugas golden hair showing the gates of heaven to her devoted knight  she looked for her companions sympathy in her admiration but the woods seemed to oppress him and his panting sigh showed how real a thing was hemen  oh my poor sun he broke out i pity you for having to go down before your time into these black stifling woods that rise up to smother you like giantsand not into your own broad cool atlantic laughing up your own sparkles of light  we inland people can hardly appreciate your longing for space  its a very prison said ulick the horizon is choked all round and one cant breathe in these staid stiff hedges and enclosures and he threw out his arms and flapped them over his breast with a gesture of constraint  you seem no friend to cultivation  why your meadows would be pretty things if they were a little greener said ulick but one gets tired of them and of those straight lines of ploughed field  theres no sense of liberty it is like the man whose prison walls closed in upon him  and he gave another weary sigh his step lost elasticity and he moved on heavily  you are tired i have brought you too far  tired by a bit of a step like this cried the boy disdainfully as he straightened himself and resumed his brisk tread  but it did not last  i had forgotten that you had not been well she said  pshaw muttered ulick then resumed aye mr kendal brought in the doctor upon mevery kind of himbut i do assure you tis nothing but home sickness i was nearly as bad when i went to st columba but i got over it then and i will again  it may be so in part said albinia kindly but let me be impertinent ulick for my sister winifred told me to look after you surely you give it every provocation  such a change of habits is enough to make any one ill  should you not ask your uncle for a holiday and go home for a little while  dont name it i beg of you cried the poor lad in an agitated voice it would only bring it all over again  ive promised my mother to do my part and with his help i will  let the columns run out to all eternity and the figures crook themselves as spitefully as they will ive vowed to myself not to stir till ive got the better of the villains  ah said albinia they have blackened your eyes like the bruises of material antagonists  yes it is a gallant battle but indeed you must give yourself all the help you can for it would be doing your mother no good to fall ill  ive no fears said ulick i know very well what is the matter with me and that if i dont give way it will go off in time youve given it a good shove with your kindness mrs kendal he added with deep emotion in his sensitive voice only you must not talk of my going home or youll undo all you have done  then i wont we must try to make you a home here  and in the first place those lodgings of yours you can never be comfortable in them  ah you saw my fire smoking  i never shall learn to make a coal fire burn  not only that said albinia but you might easily find rooms much better furnished and fitter for you  i do assure you exclaimed ulick you scarcely saw it  why i dont think theres a room at the big house in better order or so good  at least said albinia repressing her deduction as to the big house of ballymakilty you have no particular love for the localitythe river smellthe stock of good leather c  its all bayford and town smell together said ulick i never thought one part worse than another begging your pardon mrs kendal  and i am sure she continued that woman can never make your meals comfortable  yes i see i am right and i assure you hard headwork needs good living and you will never be a match for the rogues in black and white without good beefsteaks  now confess whether she gives you dinners of old shoeleather  a man cant sit down to dinner by himself cried ulick impatiently  tea with a book are all that is bearable  and you never go outnever see any one  i dine at my uncles every sunday said ulick  is that all the variety you have  why my uncle told me he would not have me getting into what he calls idle company  ive dined once at the vicarage and drunk tea twice with mr hope but it is no use thinking of iti couldnt afford it and thats the truth  have you any books  what can you find to do all the evening  i have a few that bear reading pretty often and mr hope as lent me some  ive been trying to keep up my greek and then i do believe theres some way of simplifying those accounts by logarithms if i could but work it out  but my mother told me to walk and i assure you i do take a constitutional as soon as i come out at halfpast four every day  well i have designs and mind you dont traverse them or i shall have to report you at home  i have a lodging in my eye for you away from the river and a nice clean tidy irishwoman to keep you in order make your fires and cram you if you wont eat and see if she does not make a man of you  stop stop mrs kendal cried ulick distressed  you are very kind but it cant be  excuse me it is economy of the wrong sort to live in a gutter and catch agues and fevers  only think if it was my boy gilbert should i not be obliged to any one that would tyrannize over him for his good  besides what i propose is not at all beyond such means as mr kendal tells me are the least mr goldsmith ought to give you  do you dislike going into particulars with me  you know i am used to think for gilbert and i am a sort of cousin  you are kindness itself said ulick and there i suppose i must go to the bottom of it and it is no news that pence are not plenty among the omores though it is no fault of my uncle  see there what my poor dear mother says  he drew a letter from his pocket and gave a page to her   i miss you sorely my boy it said i know the more what a support and friend you have been to me now that you are so far away but all is made up to me in knowing you to be among my own people and the instrument of reconciliation with my brother as you well know how great has been the pain of the estrangement caused by my own pride and wilfulness  i cannot tell you how glad i am that he approves of you and that you are beginning to get used to the work that was my own poor fathers for so long  bred up as you have been my mountain lad i scarcely dared to hope that you would be able to sit down quietly to it with all our hopes of making you a scholar so suddenly frustrated but i might have put faith in your loving heart and sense of duty to carry you through anything  i feel as if a load were off my mind since you and bryan are so happily launched  the boy has not once applied for money since he joined and if you write to him pray beg him to be careful for it would wellnigh drive your father mad to be pressed any morethe poor mare has been sold at a dead loss and the carrickhumbug quarry company pays no dividends so how we are to meet the christmas bills i cannot guess  but as you remember we have won over worse times and now providence has been so good to you and bryan what have i to do but be thankful and hope the best   ulick watched her face and gave her another note saying mournfully you see they all but my mother think that if i am dragging our family honour through the mire ive got something by it  poor bryan he knows no betterhes younger than me by two years  the young ensign made a piteous confession of the first debt he had been able to contract for twenty pounds with a promise that if his brother would help him out of this one scrape he would never run into another  i am very sorry for you ulick said albinia and i hate to advise you to be selfish but it really is quite impossible for you to be paymaster for all your brothers debts  if it were connel i know it would be of no use said ulick  but bryanyou see he has got a startthey gave him a commission and he is the finest fellow of us all and knows what his word is and keeps it  maybe if i get on i may be able to save and help him to his next step and then if redmond could get to college my mother would be a happy woman and all thanks to my uncle  then it is this twenty pounds that is pinching you now  is that it  you see my uncle said he would give me enough to keep me as a gentleman and his nephew but not enough to keep all the family as he said  after my christmas quarter i shall be up in the world again and then there will be time to think of the woman you spoke ofa connaught woman did you say  when albinia reported this dialogue to her husband he was much moved by this simple selfabnegation  there is nothing for it he said but to bring him here till christmas and by that time we will take care that the new lodgings are cheap enough for him  he must not be left to the mercy of old goldsmith and his sister  even albinia was astonished but mr kendal carried out his intentions and went in quest of his new friend while no one thought of objecting except grandmamma  i suppose my dear she said that you know what mr goldsmith means to do for this young man  i am sure i dont said albinia  really  ah well im an old woman and i may be wrong but my poor dear mr meadows would never encourage a bankers clerk about the house unless he knew what were his expectations  irish too  if there was a thing mr meadows disliked more than another it was an irishman  he said they were all adventurers  however ulicks first evening at willow lawn was on what he called a headache day  he could not have taken a better measure for overcoming grandmammas objections  poor dear mr meadows worldly wisdom was not sufficiently native to her to withstand the sight of anything so pale and suffering especially as he did not rebel against answering her close examination which concluded in her pronouncing these intermitting attacks to be agueish and prescribing quinine  to take medicines is an effectual way of gaining an old ladys love  ulick was soon established in her mind as a very pretty behaved young gentleman  in the evenings when mr kendal read aloud ulick listened and enjoyed it from the corner where he sheltered his eyes from the light  he was told that he ought to go to bed quickly but after the ladies were in their rooms a long buzzing murmur was heard in the passage and judicious peeping revealed the two gentlemen each candle in hand the one with his back against the wall at the top of the stairs the other leaning upon the balusters three steps below and there they stayed till the clock struck one and ulicks candle burnt out  what could you be talking about asked the aggrieved albinia  prometheus vinctus composedly returned mr kendal  ulicks eagerness in collecting every crumb of scholarship was a great bond of union but there was still more in the bright open demonstrative nature of the youth which had a great attraction for the reserved serious mr kendal and scarcely a day had passed before they were on terms of intimacy almost like an elder and younger brother  admitted into the family as a connexion ulick at once viewed the girls as cousins and treated them with the same easy grace of goodnatured familiarity as if they had been any of the nineteen miss omores around ballymakilty  how is your head now asked mr kendal  you are late this evening  yes said ulick entering the drawingroom which was ruddy with firelight and fragrant with the breath of the conservatory and leaning over an armchair as he tried to rub the aching out of his brow there were some accounts to finish up and my additions came out different every time  a sure sign that you ought to have left off  i was just going to have told my uncle i was good for nothing today when i heard old johns mumbling something to him about mr more being unwell and looking up i saw that cold grey eye twinkling at me as much as to say he was proud to see how soon an irishman could be beaten  so what could i do but give him look for look and go on with eight and seven and five and two as unconcerned as he was  well said mr kendal you know i think that your uncles apparent indifference may be his fashion of being your best friend  id take it like sunshine in may from a stranger and be proud to disappoint him said ulick but to call himself my uncle and use my mothers own eyes to look at me that way thats the stroke and to think that im only striving to harden myself by force of habit to be exactly like him  id rather enlist tomorrow if that would not be his greatest triumph he cried pressing his hands hard on his temple  it is very childish but i could forgive him anything but using my mothers eyes that way  you will yet rejoice in the likeness said mr kendal  you must believe in more than you can trace and when your perseverance has conquered his esteem the rest will follow  follow  the rest as you call it would go before at home sighed ulick wearily  esteem is like fame what i want begins without it and lives as well with or without it  perhaps said his friend mr goldsmith would think it weakness to show preference to a relation before it was earned  ah then cried ulick in a quaint irish tone heaven have mercy on the little children  yes the doctrine can only be consistently held by a solitary man  where would we be but for inconsistency exclaimed ulick  i do not like to hear you talk in that manner said sophy inconsistency is mere weakness  ah then you are the dangerous character said ulick with a droll gesture of sheltering himself behind the chair  i did not call myself consistent i wish i were she said gravely  how she must love the french returned ulick confidentially turning to her father  not at all i detest them  then you are inconsistent for theyre the very models of uncompromising consistency  yes to bad principles said sophy  robespierre was a prime specimen of consistency to good principle  sophy turned to her father and with an odd dubious look asked him is be teasing me  hed be proud to have the honour ulick made answer so that mr kendals smile grew broad  it was the funniest thing to see ulick sporting with sophys gravity constraining her to playfulness with something of the compulsion exercised by a large frolicsome puppy upon a sober old dog of less size and strength  i do not like to see powers wasted on paradox she said even as the grave senior might roll up his lip and snarl  im in earnest sophy pursued ulick changing his note to eagerness  la grande nation herself finds that logic was her bane consistency was never made for man  why where would this world be if it did not go two ways at once  sophy did laugh at this irish version of the centripetal and centrifugal forces but she held out  the earth describes a circle i like straight lines  much we shall have of the right direction unless we are content to turn right about face said ulick  the best path of life is but a herringbone pattern  what does he know of herringboning asked mrs kendal coming in at the moment with a white cashmere cloak folded picturesquely over her delicate blue silk  ulick in a moment assumed a less careless attitude as he answered  i found my poetical illustration on the motion of the earth too much for her so i descended to the herringbone as more suited to her capacity  there he is mamma said sophy pleading that consistency is the most ruinous thing in the world  i thought as much said albinia  prometheus and his kin do most abound when ulicks head is worst and papa is in greatest danger of being late  mr kendal turned round looked at the timepiece and marched off  but mamma continued sophy driving straight at her point what do you think of consistency  oh mamma cried lucy coming into the room in a flutter of white there you are in your beautiful blue  have you really put it on for the drurys  sophy bit her lip neither pleased at the interruption nor at the taste  have you a graduated scale of dresses for all your friends lucy asked ulick  everybody has i suppose said lucy  ah then i shall know how to judge how i stand in your favour  i never knew so well what the garb of friendship meant  you must know which way her scale goes said albinia laughing at sophys evident affront at the frivolous turn the conversation had taken  that needs no asking quoth ulick unadorned adorned the most for the nearest the hearth  thats all conceit said lucy  maybe familiarity breeds contempt  no no when young ladies despise they use a precision that says tis myself i care for and not you  what an observer cried lucy  now then interpret my dress tonight  how can you lucy muttered the scandalized sophy  well sophy as you will have him to torment with philosophy this whole evening i think you might give him a little respite said lucy goodhumouredly  i want to know what my dress reveals to him and drawing up her head where two coral pins contrasted with her dark braids and spreading out her full white skirts and cerise trimmings she threw her figure into an attitude and darted a merry challenge from her lively black eyes while ulick availed himself of the permission to look critically and sophy sank back disgusted  miss kendal can when she is inclined produce as much effect with her beams of the second order as with all her splendours displayed  stuff said lucy  stuff indeed more sincerely murmured sophy  say something in earnest said lucy  you professed to tell what i thought of the people  i hope youll never put on such new white gloves where im the party chiefly concerned  what do you mean  they are a great deal too unexceptionable  if there were something coquettish in the manner of these two it did not give albinia much concern  it was in him only irish and fred ferrars had made her believe that it was rather a sign of the absence of love than of its presence  she saw much more respect and interest in his mischievous attacks on sophys gravity and though lucy both pitied him and liked chattering with him it was all the while under the secret protest that he was only a bankers clerk  sophy was glad of the presence of a third person to obviate the perils of her evenings with grandmamma and she beheld the trio set off to their dinnerparty without the usual dread of being betrayed into wrangling  mr omore devoted himself to the old ladys entertainment he amused her with droll stories and played backgammon with her  then she composed herself to her knitting and desired them not to mind her she liked to hear young people talk cheerfully whereupon sophy by way of light and cheerful conversation renewed the battle of consistency with a whole broadside of heavy metal  when the dinersout came home they found the war raging as hotly as ever a great many historical facts and wise sayings having been fired off on both sides and neither having found out that each meant the same thing  however the hours had gone imperceptibly past them which could not be said for the others  the halfyearly dinners at mr drurys were albinias dread nearly as much as mr kendals aversion  he was certain whatever he might intend to fall into a fit of absence and she was almost equally sure to hear something unpleasant and to regret her own reply  on the whole however mr kendal came away on this evening the least dissatisfied for mr goldsmith had asked him with some solicitude whether he thought that lad young more positively unwell and had gone the length of expressing that he seemed to be fairly sharp and stuck to his work  mr kendal seized the moment for telling his opinion of ulick and though mr goldsmith coughed and looked dry and almost contemptuous he was perceptibly gratified and replied with a maxim evidently intended both as an excuse for himself and as a warning to the kendals that young men were always spoilt by being made too much ofin his younger daysc  lucy meantime was undergoing the broad banter of her unrefined cousins on the subject of the irish clerk  a very little grace in the perpetration would have made it grateful to her vanity but this was far too broad raillery and made her hold up her head with protestations of her perfect indifference to which her cousins manifested incredulity visiting on her with some petty spite their small jealousies of her higher pretensions and of the attention which had been paid to her by mr cavendish dusautoy  not that he will ever look at you again lucy you need not flatter yourself said the amiable sarah anne  harry wolfe writes that he was flirting with a beautiful young lady who came to see oxford and that he is spending quantities of money  it is nothing to me i am sure retorted lucy  besides gilbert says no such thing  gilbert oh no exclaimed miss drury why he is just as bad himself  papa said from what mrs wolfe told him he would not take 500 pounds to pay mr gilberts bills  albinia had been hearing much the same story from mrs drury though not so much exaggerated and administered with more condolence  she did not absolutely believe and yet she could not utterly disbelieve so the result was a letter to gilbert with an anxious exhortation to be careful and not to be deluded into foolish expenditure in imitation of the polysyllable and as no special answer was returned she dismissed the whole from her mind as a drury allegation  the horse chanced to be lame so that gilbert could not be met at hadminster on his return from oxford but much earlier than the omnibus usually lumbered into bayford he astonished sophy who was lying on the sofa in the morningroom by marching in with a free and easy step and a loose coat of the most novel device  no one else at home he asked  only grandmamma  we did not think the omnibus would come in so soon but i suppose you took a fly as there were three of you  as if we were going to stand six miles of bus with the wolfe cub no dusautoy brought his horse down with him and i took a fly said gilbert  well and whats the matter with captain has the irishman been riding him  sophy bit her lip to prevent an angry answer and was glad that maurice rushed in fall of uproarious joy  hollo boy how you grow  what have you got there  its my new popgun that ulick made me ill shoot you cried maurice retiring to a suitable distance  i declare the child has caught the brogue  is the fellow here still  what fellow coldly asked sophy  why this pet of my fathers  bang cried maurice and a pellet passed perilously close to gilberts eyes  dont child  pray is this bankers clerk one of our fixtures sophy  i dont know why you despise him unless it is because it is what you ought to be yourself sophy was provoked into retorting  apparently my father has a monomania for the article  gilbert intended to speak with provoking coolness but another fraternal pellet hit him fall in the nose and the accompanying shout of glee was too much for an already irritated temper  with passion most unusual in him he caught hold of the child and exclaiming you little imp what do you mean by it he wrenched the weapon out of his hand and dashed it into the fire in the midst of an energetic for shame from his sister  maurice with a furious naughty gilbert struck at him with both his little fists clenched and then precipitated himself over the fender to snatch his treasure from the grate but was instantly captured and pulled back struggling kicking and fighting with all his might till to the equal relief of both brothers sophy held up the popgun in the tongs one end still tinged with a red glow smoky blackened and perfumed maurice made one bound she lowered it into his grasp as the last red spark died out and he clasped it as siegfried did the magic sword  there maurice i didnt mean it said gilbert heartily ashamed and sorry kiss and make it up and then put on your hat and well come up to old smiths and get such a jolly one  the forgiving child had already given the kiss glad to atone for his aggressions but then was absorbed in rubbing the charred wood amazed that while so much black came off on his fingers the effect on the weapon was not proportionate and then tried another shot in a safer direction  come said gilbert put that black affair into the fire and come along  no said maurice it is my dear gun that ulick made me and it shant be burnt  what not if i give you a famous onelike a real one with a stock and barrel said gilbert anxious to be freed from the tokens of his ebullition  no no still stoutly said the constant maurice  i dont want new guns ive got my dear old one and ill keep him to the end of his days and mine and he crossed his arms over it  thats right maurice said sophy stick to old friends that have borne wounds in your service  well its his concern if he likes such a trumpery old thing said gilbert  come here boy you dont bear malice  come and have a ride on my back  the practical lesson dont shoot at your brothers nose would never have been impressed had not mamma on coming in found maurice and his popgun nearly equally black and by gradual unfolding of cause and effect learnt his forgotten offence  she reminded him of ancient promises never to aim at human creatures assured him that gilbert was very kind not to have burnt it outright and to the great displeasure and temporary relief of all the family sequestrated the weapon for the rest of the evening  sophy told her in confidence that gilbert had been the most to blame which she took as merely an instance of sophys blindness to maurices errors for the explosion had so completely worked off the oxford dash that he was perfectly meek and amiable  considering the antecedents such a contrast to himself as young omore could hardly fail to be an eyesore walking tame about the home and specially recommended to his friendship but so goodnatured was he and so attractive was the irishman that it took much influence from algernon dusautoy to keep up a thriving aversion  albinia marvelled at the power exercised over gilbert by one whose intellect and pretensions he openly contemned but perceived that obstinacy and undoubting selfsatisfaction overmastered his superior intelligence and principle and that while perceiving all the follies of the polysyllable gilbert had a strange propensity for his company and therein always resumed the fast man disdainful of the clerk  he did not like ulick better for being the immediate cause of the removal of the last traces of the belmarche family from their old abode which had been renovated by pretty shamrock chintz furniture the pride of the two irish hearts  indeed it was to be feared that bridget would assist in the perpetuation of those rolling rs which caused mr goldsmiths brow to contract whenever his nephew careered along upon one  his departure from willow lawn was to take place at christmas  the ferrars party were coming to keep the two consecutive birthdays of sophy and maurice at bayford would take him back for christmasday to fairmead and on his return he would take possession of his new rooms  maurices fete was to serve as the occasion of paying off civilities to a miscellaneous young party but as grandmammas feelings would have been hurt had not sophys been equally distinguished it was arranged that mrs nugent should then bring her eldest girl to meet the ferrarses at an early tea  just as albinia had descended to await her guests gilbert came down and presently said with wouldbe indifference oh bytheby dusautoy said he would look in  the polysyllable cried albinia thunderstruck what possessed you to ask him when you knew i sacrificed mr dusautoy rather than have him to spoil it all  i didnt ask him exactly replied gilbert it was old bowles who met us and tried to nail us to eat our mutton with him as he called it  i had my answer and dusautoy got off by saying he was engaged to us and desired me to tell you he would make his excuses in person  he can make no excuse for downright falsehood  hem quoth gilbert  you wouldnt have him done into drinking old bowless surgery champagne  one comfort is that he wont get any dinner said albinia vindictively  i hope hell be ravenously hungry  he may not come after all said gilbert and albinia laying hold of that hope had nearly forgotten the threatened disaster as her party appeared by instalments and winifred owned to her that sophy had grown betterlooking than could have been expected  her eyes had brightened the cloudy brown of her cheeks was enlivened she held herself better and the less childish dress was much to her advantage  but above all the moody look of suffering was gone and her face had something of the grave sweetness and regular beauty of that of her father  seventeen said mrs ferrars by the time she is seventy she may be a remarkably handsome woman  the teadrinking was in lively operation when after a thundering knock mr cavendish dusautoy was ushered in with the air of a prince honouring the banquet of his vassals saying i told kendal i should presume on your hospitality i beg you will make no difference on my account  of which gracious permission albinia was resolved to avail herself she left all the insincerity to her husband and would by no means allow grandmamma to abdicate the warm corner  she suspected that he wanted an introduction to mrs nugent and was resolved to defeat this object unless he should condescend to make the request so she was well satisfied to see him wedged in between papa and sophy while a prodigious quantity of irish talk was going on between mrs nugent and mr omore with contributions of satire from mr ferrars which kept every one laughing except little nora nugent and mary ferrars who were deep in the preliminaries of an eternal friendship and held the ends of each others crackers like a pair of doves  lucy however was ill at ease at the obscurity which shrouded the illustrious guest and in her anxiety gave so little attention to her two neighbours that willie ferrars affronted at some neglect exclaimed why lucy what makes you screw your eyes about so you cant attend to any one  it is because polly silly is there shouted master maurice from his throne beside his mamma  to the infinite relief of the halfchoked albinia little mary ferrars with whom her cousin had been carrying on a direful warfare all day fitted on the cap shook her head gravely at him and after an appealing look of indignation first at his mamma then at her own was overheard confiding to nora nugent that maurice was a very naughty boyshe was sorry to say a regular spoilt child  but how should you hinder miss kendal from attending  ill tell you darling  poor lucy she is very fond of me and i dare say she wanted me to sit next to her but you know she will have me for three days and i have you only this one evening  ill go and speak to her after tea when we go into the drawingroom and then she wont mind  lucy after an agony of blushes had somewhat recovered on finding that no one seemed to apply her brothers speech and when the benevolent mary made her way to her and thrust a hand into hers only a feeble pressure replied to these romantic blandishments so anxious was she to carry to mrs kendal the information that mr cavendish dusautoy had been so obliging as to desire his servant to bring his guitar and keybugle  we are much obliged said albinia but look at that face and she turned lucy towards willies openmouthed dismayed countenance  you must tell him the company are not sufficiently advanced in musical science  but mamma it would gratify him  very likelyand without listening further albinia turned to willie who had all day been insisting that papa should introduce her to the new game of the showman  infinitely delighted to be relieved from the fear of the guitar willie hunted all who would play into another room whence they were to be summoned one by one back to the drawingroom by the showman mr ferrars who shrugged his shoulders at the task but undertook it and first called for mrs kendal  she found him stationed before the red curtains which were closely drawn and her husband and the three elder ladies sitting by as audience  pray madam may i ask what animal you would desire to have exhibited to you out of the vast resources that my menagerie contains  choose freely i undertake that whatever you may select you shall not be disappointed  what not if i were to ask for a black spider monkey said albinia to whom it was very charming to be playing with maurice again  mr kendal looked up in entertained curiosity mrs nugent smiled as if she thought the showmans task impossible and winifred stretched out to gain a full view  a black spider monkey he said slowly  allow me to ask madam if you are acquainted with the character of the beast  it doesnt scratch does it said she quickly  that is for you to answer  i never knew it do so  it does chatter a great deal but it never scratched that i knew of  nor i said the showman since it was young  do you think age renders it graver and steadier  not a bit  it is always frisky and troublesome and i never knew it get a bit better as it grew older  winifred laughed outright  mr kendals lips were parted by his smile  i wonder what sort of a mother it would make said the showman  all animals are good mothers of course  i meant is it a good disciplinarian  if you mean cuffing its young one for playing exactly the same tricks as itself  exactly and what would be the effect of letting it and its young one loose in a great scholars study  there wouldnt be much study left  and would it be for his good  really mr showman you ask very odd questions  shall we try said albinia with a skip backward so as to lay her hand on the shoulder of her own great scholar while the showman drew back the curtain observingi wish maam i could show it and its young one together but the young specimen is unfortunately asleep behold the original black spider monkey  there stood the monkey with sunny brown locks round the laughing glowing face and one white paw still lying on the scholars shoulderwhile his face made no assurance needful that it was very good for him  the mirror concealed behind the curtains was the menagerie  albinia clapped her hands with delight and pronounced it the most perfect of games  and now let us have willie said mrs ferrars it will conduce to the harmony of the next room  willie already initiated hoped to puzzle papa as a platypus ornithoryncus but was driven to allow that it was a nondescript animal neither fish flesh nor good redherring useless and very fond of grubbing in the mud and if it were not at botany bay it ought to be  the laughter that hailed his defence of its nose as well nothing particular precipitated the drawing up of the curtain and his apparition in the glass and then nora nugent being called the inseparable mary accompanied her arminarm simpering an announcement that they liked nothing so well as a pair of dear little lovebirds  oh unpitying papa to draw from the unsuspicious nora the admission that they were very dull little birds of no shape at all who always sat hunched up in a corner without any fun and people said their love was all stupidity and pretence in fact if she had one she should call it silly polly or polly silly  to silence willies exultation in his sisters discomfiture he was sent to fetch lucy whose impersonation of an argus pheasant would not have answered well but for a suggestion of albinia that she was eyes all over for any delinquency in school  ulick omore owning with a sigh that he should like to see no beast better than a snipe gave rise to much ingenuity by being led to describe it as of a class migratory hard to catch food for powder given to long bills there he guessed something and stood on the defensive but could not deny that its element was bogs but that it had been seen skimming over water meadows and finding sustenance in banks whereupon the curtain rose  ulick rushed upon the battles of his nation and was only reduced to quiescence by the entrance of sophy who expressed a desire to see a coral worm apparently perplexing the showman who to gain time hemmed and said a very unusual species maam which set all the younger ones in a double giggle such as confused sophy to find herself standing up with every one looking at her and listening for her words  i thought you undertook for any impossibility in earth air or water  well maam do you take me for a mere mountebank  but when ladies and gentlemen take such unusual fanciesand for an animal thatyou would not aver that it is often found from home  never i should say  nor that it is accessible  certainly not  and why is it so maam  why said sophy bewildered into forgetting her natural history it lives at the bottom of the sea thats one thing  where truth lives said a voice behind  i beg to differ observed albinia  truth is a fresh water fish at the bottom of a well besides i thought coral worms were always close to the surface  but below itnot in everybodys view said sophyan answer which seemed much to the satisfaction of the audience but the showman insisted on knowing why and whether it did not conceal itself  it makes stony caves for itself out of sight said sophy almost doubting whether she spoke correctly  well surely it does so  most surely said an acclamation so general that she did not like it  if she had been younger she would have turned sulky upon the spot and mr ferrars almost doubted whether to bring ont his final query  pray maam do you think this creature out of reach in its selfmade cave at the bottomno below the surface of the sea would be popular enough to repay the cost of procuring it  ah thats too bad burst out the hibernian tones  why is not the best of everything hidden away from the common eye  out of sightstony caveit is the secret worker that lays the true solid foundation raises the new realms and forms the precious jewels the torrent of rs was irresistible  police order cried the showman  an irish mob has got in and theres an end of everything  so up went the curtain and the polyp appeared becoming rapidly red coral as she perceived what the exhibition was and why the politeness of the green isle revolted from her proclaiming her own unpopularity  but all she did was to turn gruffly aside and say it is lucky there are no more ladies to come mr showman or the mob would turn everything to a compliment  gilberts curiosity was directed to the laughing jackass and with too much truth he admitted that it took its tone from whatever it associated with and caught every note from the song of the lark to the bray of the donkey then laughed goodhumouredly when the character was fitted upon himself  that is all is it not asked the showman  i may retire into private life  oh no cried willie you have forgotten mr dusautoy  i was afraid you had said lucy or you could not have left him to the last  i am tempted to abdicate said mr ferrars  no albinia said  he must have his share and no one but you can do it  where can he be the pause becomes awful  willie is making suggestions said gilbert his imagination would never stretch farther than a lion  its what he thinks himself and no mistake  he is big enough to be the elephant said little mary  the halfreasoning said ulick softly and i can answer for his trunk i saw it come off the omnibus  ladies and gentlemen if you persist in such disorderly conduct the exhibition will close cried the showman waving his wand as willie trumpeted mr cavendish dusautoy in and on the demand what animal he wanted to see twitched him as flibbertigibbet did the giant warder and caused him to respondthe giraffe  has it not another name sir  a short or a long one more or less syllables  camelopard  a polysyllabic word certainly said algernon looking with a puzzled expression at the laughers behind and almost imagining it possible that he could have made an error he repeated camelleopard  yes it is a polysyllableas indeed he had added an unnecessary syllable  most assuredly said the showman looking daggers at his suffocating sister  may i ask you to describe the creature  seventeen feet from the crown to the hoof but falls off behind said the accurate mr dusautoy beautiful tawny colour  nearly as good as a lion added gilbert but algernon fancying the game was by way of giving useful instruction to the children went on in full swing  handsomely mottled with darker brown a ruminating animal so gentle that in spite of its size none of my little friends need be alarmed at its vicinity  inhabits the african deserts but may be bred in more temperate latitudes  i myself saw an individual in the jardin des plantes which was popularly said never to bend its neck to the ground but i consider this a vulgar delusion for on offering it food it mildly inclined its head  let us hope the present specimen is equally condescending said mr ferrars  eh what i see myself said mr cavendish dusautoy with a tone so inappreciably grand in mystification that the showman had no choice but to share the universal convulsion of laughter while willie rolling on the floor with ecstasy shouted yes it is you that are the thing with such a long name that it cant bend its head to the ground  but too goodnatured to be annoyed at folly said mr ferrars perceiving that it was no sport to him  this is the way my mischievous uncle has served us all in turn said lucy advancing we have all been shown up and there was mamma a monkey and i an argus pheasant  ah i see said the gentleman  these are your rural pastimes of the season  yes i can take my share in good part just as i have pelted the masks at the carnival  even a giraffe can bend his head and do at rome as rome does murmured ulick  but instead of heeding the audacious irishman algernon patronized the showman by thanks for his exhibition and then sitting down by lucy asked if he had ever told her of the tricks that he and il principe odorico moretti used to play at ems on the old baron sprawlowsky while mr ferrars leaning over his sisters chair said aside i beg your pardon albinia i should not have yielded to willie  this rural pastime is only in season en famille  never mind it served him right  it may have served him right but had we the right to serve him  i forgive your prudence for the sake of your folly  could not oxford have lessened his pomposity  it comes too late said maurice  before ulick went to bed his pen and ink had depicted the entire caravan  the lovebirds were pressed up together with the individual features of the two young ladies and completely little parrots the snipe ran along the bars of the cage looking exactly like all the omores  the monkey showed nothing but the hands but one held maurice and the other was clenched as if to cuff him and grandest of all was as in duty bound camelopardelis giraffa thrown somewhat backwards with such a majestic form such a stalking attitude loftily ruminating face and legs so like the cavendish dusautoys last new pair of trousers that albinia could not help reserving it for the private delectation of his aunt fanny  it and its young one said mr kendal as he looked at her portrait and the name delighted him so much that he for some time applied it with a smile whenever his wife gave him cause to remember how much there was of the monkey in her composition  it was the merriest christmas ever known at willow lawn and the first time there had been anything of the atmosphere of family frolic and fun  the lighting up of sophy was one great ingredient hitherto mirth had been merely endured by her whereas now improved health and spirits had made her take her share amuse others and be amused and cease to be hurt by the jarring of chance words  lucy was lively as usual but rather more excited than albinia altogether liked she was doubly particular about her dress more disdainful of the common herd and had a general air of exaltation that made albinia rejoice when the polysyllable the horses the keybugle and genre painting disappeared from the bayford horizon     chapter xx    if the end of the vacation were a relief on lucys account albinia would gladly have lengthened it on gilberts  letters from his tutor had disquieted his father there had been an expostulation followed by promises and afterwards one of the usual scenes of argument complaint excuse lamentation and wish to amend but lastly a murmur that it was no use to talk to a father who had never been at the university and did not know what was expected of a man  the aspect of oxford had changed in albinias eyes since the days of her brother  alma mater had been a vision of pealing bells chanting voices cloistered shades bright watersthe source of her most cherished thoughts the abode of youth walking in the old paths of pleasantness and peace and she knew that to faithful hearts old oxford was still the same  but to her present anxious gaze it had become a field of snares and temptations whither she had been the means of sending one unguarded and unstable  once under the influence of a good soundhearted friend he might have been easily led right but his intimacy with young dusautoy seemed to cancel all hope of this and to be like a rope about his neck drawing him into the same career and keeping aloof all better influences  algernon with his pride pomposity and false refinement was more likely to run into ostentations expenditure than into coarse dissipation and it might still be hoped that the two youths would drag through without public disgrace but this was felt to be a very poor hope by those who felt each sin to be a fatal blot and trembled at the selfindulgent way of life that might be a more fatal injury than even the ban of the authorities  she saw that the anxiety pressed heavily on mr kendal and though both shrank from giving their uneasiness force by putting it into words each felt that it was everpresent with the other  mr kendal was deeply grieving over the effects for the former state of ignorance and apathy of the evils of which he had only recently become fully sensible  living for himself alone without cognizance of his membership in one great universal system he had needed the sense of churchmanship to make him act up to his duties as father neighbour citizen and man of property and when aroused he found that the time of his inaction had bound him about with fetters  a tone of mind had grown up in his family from which only sophy had been entirely freed seeds of ineradicable evil had been sown mischiefs had grown by neglect abuses been established by custom and his own personal disadvantages his mauvaise honte his reserved apparently proud manner his slowness of speech dislike to interruption and overvehemence when excited had so much increased upon him as in spite of his efforts to be serious hindrances kind liberal painstaking and conscientious as he had become he was still looked upon as hard stern and tyrannical  his ten years of inertness had strewn his path with thorns and briars even beyond his own household and when he looked back to his neglect of his son he felt that even the worst consequences would be but just retribution  once such feelings would have wrapt him in morbid gloom now he strove against his disposition to sit inert and hidden he did his work manfully and endeavoured not to let his want of spirits sadden the household  nor was he insensible to the cheerful healthy atmosphere of animation which had diffused itself there and the bright discussions of the trifling interests of the day  ulick omore was also a care to him which did him a great deal of good  that young gentleman now lived at his lodgings but was equally at home at willow lawn and his knock at the library door when he wished to change a book usually led to some prometheus discussion and sometimes to a walk if mr kendal thought him looking pale or to dining and to spending the evening  his scrapes were peculiar  he had thoroughly mastered his work and his active mind wanted farther scope so that he threw himself with avidity into deeper studies and once fell into horrible disgrace for being detected with a little plato on his desk  mr goldsmith nearly gave him up in despair and pronounced that he would never make a man of business  he made matters worse by replying that this was the best chance of his not being a man of speculation  if he were allowed to think of nothing but money he should speculate for the sake of something to do  before mr goldsmith had half recovered the shock mr dusautoy and mr hope laid violent hands upon young omore for the evening school twice a week which almost equally discomposed his aunt  she had never got over the first blow of mr dusautoys innovations and felt as if her nephew had gone over to the enemy  she was doubly ungracious at the sunday dinner and venomously critical of the choirs chanting mr hopes voice and the vicars sermons  the worst scrape came in march  the willow lawn ladies were in the lower end of the garden which towards the river was separated from the lane that continued tibbs alley by a low wall surmounted by spikes and with a disused wicket always locked and nearly concealed by a growth of laurels when out brake a horrible hullabaloo in that region of evil report the shouts and yells coming nearer and becoming so distinct that they were about to retreat when suddenly a dark figure leapt over the gate and into the garden amid a storm of outcries  as he disappeared among the laurels albinia caught up maurice lucy screamed and prepared to fly and sophy started forward exclaiming it is ulick mamma his face is bleeding  but as he emerged she retreated for she had a nervous terror of the canine race and in his hand at arms length he held by the neck a yellow dog a black pot dangling from its tail  take care he shouted as albinia set down maurice and was running up to him he may be mad  maurice was caught up again lucy shrieked and sophy tottering against an appletree faintly said he has bitten you  no not he it was only a stone said ulick as best he might with a fast bleeding upper lip  they were hunting the poor beast to deathi believe hes no more mad than i amonly with the fright but best make sure  fetch some milk lucy said albinia  take maurice with you  no dont take the poor thing down to the river hell only think you are going to drown him  go maurice dear  maurice safe albinia was able to find ready expedients after sir fowell buxtons celebrated example  she brought ulick the gardeners thick gauntlets from the toolhouse and supplied him with her knife with which he set the poor creature free from the instrument of torture and then let him loose with a pan of milk before him in the oldfashioned summerhouse through the window of which he could observe his motions and if he looked dangerous shoot him  nothing could look less dangerous the poor creature sank down on the floor and moaned licked its hind leg and then dragged itself as if famished to the milk lapped a little eagerly but lay down again whining as if in pain  ulick and albinia called to it and it looked up and tried to wag its tail whining appealingly  my poor brute he cried theyve treated you worse than a heathen  thats alllet me see what i can do for you  yes but yourself ulick said albinia as in his haste he took down his handkerchief from his mouth i do believe your lip is cut through  you had better attend to that first  no no thank you said ulick eagerly theyve broken the poor wretchs leg and he was the next moment sitting on the summerhouse floor lifting up the animal tenderly regardless of her expostulation that the injured frightened creature might not know its friends  but she did it injustice it wagged its stumpy tail and licked his fingers  she offered to fetch rag for his surgery and he farther begged for some slight bits of wood to serve as splints he and his brothers had been dogdoctors before  as she hurried into the house sophy who had sunk on a sofa in the drawingroom looking deadly pale called out is he bitten  no no cried albinia hurrying on the dog is all safe  it has only got a broken leg  maurice with whom lucy had all this time been fighting came out with her to see the rest of the adventure and thought it very cruel that he was not permitted to touch the patient which bore the operation with affecting fortitude and gratitude and was then consigned to a basket lined with hay and left in the summerhouse mr kendal being known to have an almost eastern repugnance to dogs  then ulick had leisure to be conducted to the morningroom and be rendered a less ghastly spectacle by some very uncomfortable stickingplaster moustaches which hardly permitted him to narrate his battle distinctly  he thought the boys even of tibbs alley would hardly have ventured any violence after he had interfered but for some young men who aught to have known better he fancied he had seen young tritton of robbles leigh and he was sure of an insolent groom whom mr cavendish dusautoy to the great vexation of his uncle had recently sent down with a horse to the kings head  they had stimulated the boys to a shout of paddy and a shower of stones and ulick expected credit for great discretion in having fled instead of fought  ah if brian and connel had but been there wouldnt we have put them to the rout  nothing would then serve him but going back to tibbs alley to trace the dogs history and meantime lucy from the end of the passage beckoned to albinia and whispered mysteriously that sophy would not have any one know it for the worldbut said lucy i found her absolutely fainting away on the sofa only she would not let me call you and ordered that no one should know anything about it  but mamma there was a redhot knittingneedle sticking out of the fire and i am quite sure that she meant if ulick was bitten to burn out the place  albinia believed sophy capable of both the resolution and its consequence but she agreed with lucy that no notice should be taken and would not seem aware that sophy was much paler than usual  the dog as well as ulick could make out was a waif or stray belonging to a gipsy deported that morning by the police and on whom its masters sins had been visited  so without scruple he carried the basket home to his lodgings and on the way had the misfortune to encounter his uncle while shirtfront coat and waistcoat were fresh from the muddy and bloody fray and his visage in the height of disfigurement  mr goldsmith looked on the whole affair as an insult to every goldsmith of past ages  a mere street row  he ordered mr more to his lodgings and said be should hear from him tomorrow  ulick came down to willow lawn in the dark almost considering himself as dismissed not knowing whether to be glad or sorry and wanting to consult mr kendal whether it would be possible to work his way at college as mr hope had done or even wondering whether he might venture to beg for a recommendation to kendal and kendal  mr kendal was so strongly affected that he took up his hat and went straight to mr goldsmith to put the matter before him in a true light  true light or false it was intolerable in the bankers eyes and it took a great deal of eloquence to persuade him that his nephew was worth a second trial  fighting in tibbs alley over a gipsys dog and coming back looking like a ruffian  mr goldsmith wished him no harm but it would be a disgrace to the concern to keep him on and miss goldsmith whom mr kendal heartily wished to gag chimed in with her old predictions of the consequences of her poor sisters foolish marriage  the final argument was mr kendals declaration of the testimonials with which he would at once send him out to calcutta to take the situation once offered to his own son  no sooner did mr goldsmith hear that his nephew had an alternative than he promised to be lenient and finally dispatched a letter to u more esquire with a very serious rebuke but a promise that his conduct should be overlooked provided the scandal were not repeated and he should not present himself at the bank till his face should be fit to be seen  mr kendal mounted him the next morning on gilberts horse and sent him to fairmead  the dog was left in charge of bridget who treated it with abundant kindness but failed to obtain the exclusive affection which the poor thing lavished upon its rescuer  by the time ulick came home it had arrived at limping upon three legs and was bent on following him wherever he went  disreputable and heinously ugly it was of tawny currish yellow whence it was known as the orangeman with a bulldog countenance and the legs that did not limp were bandy  albinia called it the tripod but somehow it settled into the title of hyder ali to which it was said to answer the most readily though it would in fact answer anything from ulick and nothing from any one else  ever at his heels the brazen tripod contrived to establish an entrance at willow lawn scratched till mr kendal would interrupt a prometheus talk to let him in at the library door and gradually made it a matter of course to come into the drawingroom and repose upon sophys flounces  this was by way of compensation for his misadventures elsewhere  he was always bringing ulick into trouble shut or tie him up as he might he was sure to reappear when least wanted  he had been at church he had been in miss goldsmiths drawingroom he had been found times without number curled up under ulicks desk  mr goldsmith growled hints about hanging him and old mr johns who really was fond of his bright young fellow clerk gave grave counsel but ulick only loved his protege the better and after having exhausted an irish vocabulary of expostulation succeeded in prevailing on him to come no farther than the street except on very wet days when he would sometimes be found on the mat in the entry looking deplorably beseeching and bringing on his master an irate heres that dog again  would that no one fell into worse scrapes sighed mr dusautoy when he heard of ulicks disasters with hyder ali and it was a sigh that the house of kendal reechoed  nobody could be surprised when towards the long vacation tidings came to bayford that after long forbearance on the part of the authorities the insubordination and riotous conduct of the two young men could be endured no longer  it appeared that young dusautoy with his weak head and obstinate will had never attempted to bend to rules but had taken every reproof as an insult and defiance  young men had not been wanting who were ready to take advantage of his lavish expenditure and to excite his disdain for authorities  they had promoted the only wit he did understand broad practical jokes and mischief and had led him into the riot and gambling to which he was not naturally prone  gilbert kendal with more sense and principle had been led on by the contagion around him and at last an outrageous wine party had brought matters to a crisis  the most guilty were the most cunning and the only two to whom the affair could actually be brought home were dusautoy and kendal  the sentence was rustication and the tutor wrote to mr dusautoy as the least immediately affected to ask him to convey the intelligence to mr kendal  the vicar was not a man to shrink from any task however painful but he felt it the more deeply as in spite of his partiality he was forced to look on his own favourite algernon as the misleader of gilbert and when he overtook the sisters on his melancholy way down the hill he consulted them how their father would bear it  oh i dont know said lucy hell be terribly angry  i should not wonder if he sent gilbert straight off to india should you sophy  i hope he will do nothing in haste exclaimed mr dusautoy  i do believe if those two lads were but separated or even out of such company they would both do very well  yes exclaimed lucy and after all they are such absurd regulations treating men like schoolboys wanting them to keep such regular troublesome hours  mr cavendish dusautoy told me that there was no enduring the having everything enforced  if things had been enforced on poor algernon earlier this might never have been sighed his uncle  im sure i dont see why papa should mind it so much continued lucy  mr cavendish dusautoy told me his friend lord reginald raymond had been rusticated twice and expelled at last  what do you think of it sophy asked the vicar anxiously  i dont feel as if any of us could ever look up again she answered very low  why no not that exactly  it is not quite the right way to take these things sophy said mr dusautoy  boys may be very foolish and wrongheaded without disgracing their family  sophy did not answerit was all too fresh and sore and she did not find much consolation in the number of youths whom lucy reckoned up as having incurred the like penalty  when they entered the house and mr dusautoy knocked at the library door she followed lucy into the garden without knowing where she was going and threw herself down upon the grass miserable at the pain which was being inflicted upon her father and with a hardened resentful feeling between contempt and anger against the brother who for very weakness could so dishonour and grieve him  she clenched her hand in the intensity of her passionate thoughts and impulses and sat like a statue while lucy from time to time between the tying up of flowers and watering of annuals came up with inconsistent exhortations not to be so unhappyfor it was not expulsionit was sure to be unjustnobody would think the worse of them because young men were foolishall men of spirit did get into scrapes  it was lucky for lucy that all this passed by sophys ear as unheeded as the babbling of the brook  she did not move till roused by ulick omore coming up from the bridge telling that he had met some irish haymakers in the meadows and saying he wanted to beg a frock for one of their children  i think i can find you one said lucy if you will wait a minute but dont go in mr dusautoy is there  is anything the matter he exclaimed  every one must soon know said lucy it is of no use to keep it back sophy  only my brother and mr cavendish dusautoy have got into a scrape about a wine party and are going to be rusticated but wait ill fetch the frock  sophy had almost run away while her sister spoke but the kind look of consternation and pity on ulicks face deterred her he in soliloquy repeated as if confounded by the greatness of the misfortune poor gilbert  poor gilbert burst from sophy in irritation at misplaced sympathy i thought it would be papa and mamma you cared for  with reason returned ulick but i was thinking how it must break his heart to have pained such as they  i wish he would feel it thus exclaimed sophy but he never will  oh banish that notion sophy cried ulick recoiling at the indignation in her dark eyes next to grieving my mother i declare nothing could crush me like meeting a look such as that from a sister of mine  how can i help it she said reserve breaking down in her vehemence when i think how much papa has sufferedhow much gilbert has to make up to himhow mamma took him for her ownhow they have borne with him and set their happiness on him and yielded to his fancies only for him to disappoint them so cruelly and just because he cant say no  i hope he wont come home i shall never know how to speak to him   but all that makes it so much the worse for him said ulick in a tone of amazement  yes you cant understand she answered if he had had one spark of feeling like you he would rather have died than have gone on as he has done  surely many a man may be overtaken in a fault and never be wrong at heart said ulick  theres many a worse sin than what the world sets a blot upon and i believe that is just why homes were made  lucy came back with the frock and ulick thanking her sped away while sophy slowly went upstairs and hid herself on her couch  for a woman to find a man thinking her overhard and severe is sure either to harden or to soften her very decidedly and it was a hard struggle which would be the effect  there was an inclination at first to attribute his surprise to the lax notions and foolish fondness of his home where no doubt far worse disorders than gilberts were treated as mere matters of course  but such strong pity for the offender did not seem to accord with this and the more she thought the more sure she became that it was the fresh charity and sweetness of an innocent spirit believing all things and separating the fault from the offender  his words had fallen on her ear in a sense beyond what he meant  pride and uncharitable resentment might be worse sins than mere weakness and excess  she thought of the elder son in the parable who unknowing of his brothers temptation and sorrow closed his heart against his return and if her tears would have come she would have wept that she could not bring herself to look on gilbert otherwise than as the troubler of her fathers peace  when her mother at last came upstairs she only ventured to ask gently how does papa bear it  it did not come without preparation was the answer and at first we were occupied with comforting mr dusautoy who takes to himself all the shame his nephew will not feel for having drawn poor gilbert into such a set  and papa still asked sophy  he is very quiet and it is not easy to tell  i believe it was a great mistake though not of his making to send gilbert to oxford at all and i doubt whether he will ever go back again  oh mamma not conquer this and live it down cried sophy but then changing she sighed and said if he would  yes a great deal depends upon how he may take this and what becomes of algernon dusautoy though i suppose there is no lack of other tempters  your papa has even spoken of india again he still thinks he would be more guarded there but all depends on the spirit in which we find him  one thing i hope that i shall leave it all to his fathers judgment and not say one word  the next post brought a penitent letter from gilbert submitting completely to his father only begging that he might not see any one at home until he should have redeemed his character and promising to work very hard and deny himself all relaxation if he might only go to a tutor at a distance  this did not at all accord with mr kendals views  he had an unavowed distrust of gilberts letters he did not fancy a tutor thus selected and believed the boy to be physically incapable of the proposed amount of study  so he wrote a very grave but merciful summons to willow lawn  albinia went to meet the delinquent at hadminster and was struck by the different deportment of the two youths  algernon dusautoy whose servant had met him sauntered up to her as if nothing had happened carelessly hoped all were well at bayford and in spite of her exceeding coldness talked on with perfect ease upon the chances of a war with russia and had given her three or four maxims before gilbert came up with the luggage van with a bag in his hand and a hurried bewildered manner unable to meet her eye  he handed her into the carriage seated himself beside her and drove off without one unnecessary word while algernon mounting his horse waved them a disengaged farewell and cantered on  albinia heard a heavy sigh and saw her companion very wan and sorrowful dejection in every feature in the whole stoop of his figure and in the nervous twitch of his hands  the contrast gave an additional impulse to her love and pity and the first words she said were your father is quite ready to forgive  i knew he would be so he answered hardly able to command his voice i knew you would all be a great deal too kind to me and that is the worst of all  no gilbert not if it gives you resolution to resist the next time  he groaned and it was not long before she drew from him a sincere avowal of his follies and repentance  he had been led on by assurances that every one did the like by fear of betraying his own timidity by absurd dread of being disdained as slow all this working on his natural indolence and love of excitement had combined to involve him in habits which had brought on him this disgrace  it was a hopeful sign that he admitted its justice and accused no one of partiality the reprimand had told upon him and he was too completely struck down even to attempt to justify himself exceedingly afraid of his father and only longing to hide himself such was his utter despair that albinia had no scruples in encouraging him and assuring him with all her heart that if taken rightly the shock that brought him to his senses might be the blessing of his life  he did not take comfort readily though soothed by her kindness he could not get over his excessive dread of his father and each attempt at reassurance fell short  at last it came out that the very core of his misery was this that he had found himself for part of the journey in the same train with miss durant and two or three children  he could not tell her where he was going nor why and he had leant back in the carriage and watched her on the platform by stealth as she moved about lovelier and more graceful than ever but how could he present himself to her in his disgrace and misery  oh mrs kendal i forgive my father but my life was blighted when i was cut off from her  no gilbert you are wrong  there is no blighting in a worthy disinterested attachment  to be able to love and respect such a woman is a good substantial quality in you and ought to make you a higher and better man  gilbert turned round a face of extreme amazement  i thought he said i thought you and went no farther  i respect your feeling for her more than when it was two years younger she said i should respect it doubly if instead of making you ashamed it had saved you from the need of shame  do you give me any hope cried gilbert his face gleaming into sudden eager brightness  things have not become more suitable said albinia and his look lapsed again into despondency but she added each step towards real manhood force of character and steadiness would give you weight which might make your choice worth your fathers consideration and you worth that of genevieve  oh would you but have told me so before  it was evident to your own senses said albinia and she thought of the suggestion that sophy had made  too late too late sighed gilbert  no never too late  you have had a warning you are very young and it cannot be too late for winning a character and redeeming the time  and you tell me i may love her repeated gilbert so intoxicated with the words that she became afraid of them  i do not tell you that you may importune her or disobey your father  i only tell you that to look up and work and deny yourself in honour of one so truly noble is one of the best and most saving of secondary motives  i shall honour you gilbert if you do so use it as to raise and support you though of course i cannot promise that she can be earned by it and even that motive will not do alone however powerful you may think it  neither of them said more but gilbert sighed heavily several times and would willingly have checked their homeward speed  he grew pale as they entered the town and groaned as the gates swung back and they rattled over the wooden bridge  it was about four oclock and he said hurriedly as with a sort of hope i suppose they are all out  he was answered by a whoop of ecstasy and before he was well out of the carriage he was seized by the joyous maurice shouting that he had been for a ride with papa without a leading rein  happy age for both too young to know more than that the beloved playfellow was at home again  little albinia studied her brother till the small memory came back and she made her pretty signs for the wellremembered dancing in his arms  from such greetings gilberts wounded spirit could not shrink much as he dreaded all others and carrying the baby and preceded by maurice while he again muttered that of course no one was at home he went upstairs  albinia meantime tapped at the library door  she knew mr kendal to be there yearning to forgive but thinking it right to have his pardon sought and she went in to tell him of his sons keen remorse and deadly fear  displeased and mournful mr kendal sighed  he has little to fear from me would he but believe so  he ought to have come to me but  that but meant repentance for oversternness in times past  let me send him to you  i will come said mr kendal willing to spare his son the terror of presenting himself  there was a pretty sight in the morningroom  gilbert was on the floor with the two children maurice intent on showing how nearly little albinia could run alone and between ordering and coaxing drawing her gently on her beautiful brown eyes opened very seriously to the great undertaking and her round soft hands with a mixture of confidence and timidity trusted within the sturdy ones of her small elder while gilbert knelt on one knee and stretched out a protecting arm really to grasp the little one if the more childish brother should fail her and his countenance lighted up with interest and affection was far more prepossessing than when so lately it had been full of cowering almost abject apprehension  was it a sort of instinctive feeling that the little sister would be his best shelter that made him gather the child into his arms and hold her before his deeply blushing face as he rose from the floor she merrily called out papa  maurice loudly began to recount her exploits and thus passed the salutation at the end of which gilbert found that his father was taking the little one from him and giving her to her mother who carried her away calling maurice with her  have you nothing to say to me said mr kendal after waiting for some moments but as gilbert only looked up to him with a piteous scared uncertain glance be added you need not fear me i believe you have erred more from weakness than from evil inclinations and i trust in the sincerity of your repentance  these kind words softened gilbert he assured his father of his thanks for his kindness no one could grieve more deeply or be more anxious to atone in any possible manner for what he had unwittingly done  i believe you gilbert said his father but you well know that the only way of atoning for the past as well as of avoiding such wretchedness and disgrace for the future is to show greater firmness  i know it is said gilbert sorrowfully  i cannot look into your heart added mr kendal  i can only hope and believe that your grief for the sin is as deep or deeper than that for the public stigma for which comparatively i care little  gilbert exclaimed that so indeed it was and this was no more than the truth  out of sight of temptation and in that pure atmosphere the loud revel and coarse witticisms that had led him on were only loathsome and disgusting and made him miserable in the recollection  i am ready to submit to anything he added fervently  as long as you forgive me i am ready to bear anything  i forgive you from my heart said mr kendal warmly  i only wish to consider what may be most expedient for you  i should scarcely like to send you back to oxford to retrieve your character unless i were sure that you would be more resolute in resisting temptation no do not reply your actions during this time of penance will be a far more satisfactory answer than any promises  i had thought of again applying to your cousin john to take you into his bank though you could not now go on such terms as you might have done when there was no error in the background and i still sometimes question whether it be not the safer method  whatever you please said gilbert i deserve it all  nay do not look upon my decision whatever it may be as punishment but only as springing from my desire for your real welfare  i will write to your cousin and ask whether he still has a vacancy but without absolutely proposing you to him and we will look on the coming months as a period of probation during which we may judge what may be the wisest course  i will only ask one other question gilbert and you need not be afraid to answer me fully and freely  have you any debts at oxford  a few stammered gilbert with a great effort  can you tell me to whom and the amount  he tried to recollect as well as he could while completely frightened and confused by the gravity with which his father was jotting them down in his pocketbook  well gilbert he concluded you have dealt candidly with me and you shall never have cause to regret having done so  and now we will only feel that you are at home and dwell no longer on the cause that has brought you  come out and see what we have been doing in the meadow  gilbert seemed more overthrown and broken down by kindness than by reproof  he hardly exerted himself even to play with maurice or to amuse his grandmother and though his sisters treated him as usual he never once lifted up his eyes to meet sophys glance and scarcely used his voice  nothing could be more disarming than such genuine sorrow and sophy pardoning him with all her heart and mourning for her past want of charity watched him longing to do something for his comfort and to evince her tenderness but only succeeded in encumbering every petty service or word of intercourse with a weight of sad consciousness     chapter xxi    i had almost written to ask your pardon said mrs dusautoy as albinia entered her drawingroom on the afternoon following  i should like by way of experiment to know what would put that boy out of countenance  he listened with placid graciousness to his uncles lecture and then gave us to understand that he was obliged for his solicitude and that there was a great deal of jealousy and misrepresentation at oxford but he thought it best always to submit to authorities however unreasonable  and this morning after amiably paying his respects to me he said he was going to inquire for gilbert  i intimated that willow lawn was the last place where he would be welcome but he was far above attending to me  did gilbert see him  gilbert was in the garden with us when we were told he was in the house  poor fellow he shuddered and looked as if he wanted me to guard him so i sent him out walking with maurice while i went in and found lucy entertaining the gentleman  i made myself as cold and inhospitable as i could but i am afraid he rather relishes a dignified retenue  poor boy  i wonder what on earth is to be done with him  i never before knew what johns love and patience were  do you think he will remain here  i cannot tell we talk of tutors but john is really i believe happier for having him here and besides one can be sure the worst he is doing is painting a lobster  however much would depend on what you and mr kendal thought  if he and gilbert were doing harm to each other everything must give way  if people of that age will not keep themselves out of harms way nobody can do it for them said albinia and as long as gilbert continues in his present mood there is more real separation in voluntarily holding aloof than if they were sent far apart only to come together again at college  gilbert did continue in the same mood  the tender cherishing of his home restored his spirits but he was much subdued and deeply grateful as he manifested by the most eager and affectionate courtesy such as made him almost the servant of everybody without any personal aim or object except to work up his deficient studies and to avoid young dusautoy  he seemed to cling to his family as his protectors and to follow the occupations least likely to lead to a meeting with the polysyllable he was often at church in the week rode with his father went parish visiting with the ladies and was responsible when maurice fished for minnows in the meadows  nothing could be more sincerely desirous to atone for the past and enter on a different course and no conduct could be more truly humble or endearing  the imaginary disdain of ulick omore was entirely gone and perceiving that the irishmans delicacy was keeping him away from willow lawn gilbert himself met him and brought him home in the delight of having heard of a naval cadetship having been offered to his brother and full of such eager joy as longed for sympathy  happy fellow gilbert murmured to himself  younger in years more childish in character poor gilbert had managed to make his spirit worldworn and weary compared with the fresh manly heart of the irishman all centered in the kindred points of heaven and home and enjoying keenly for the very reason that he bent dutifully with all his might to a humble and uncongenial task  yet somehow admire and esteem as he would there arose no intimacy or friendship between gilbert and ulick their manners were frank and easy but there was no spontaneous approach no real congeniality nor exchange of mind and sympathy as between ulick and mr kendal albinia had a theory that the friendship was too much watched to take sophy hated herself for the recurring conviction that gilbert was not the kind of stuff though she felt day by day how far he excelled her in humility gentleness and sweet temper  when the goldsmiths gave their annual dinnerparty albinia felt a sudden glow at the unexpected sight of ulick omore  i am only deputy for the orange man he said it is hyder ali who ought to be dining here  yes it is his doing id back him against any detective  what heroism have you been acting together  we had just given farmer martin l120 in notes when as he went out we heard little hyder growling and giving tongue and a fellow swearing as if he was at the fair of monyveagh and the farmer hallooing thieves  i found little hyder had nailed the rascal fast by the leg just as he had the notes out of the farmers pouch  i collared him johns ran for the police and the rascal is fast  what a shame to cheat mr kendal of the committal  the policeman said he was gone out so we had the villain up to the admiral with the greater satisfaction as he was a lodger in one of the admirals pet publichouses in tibbs alley  ah when gilbert is of age said albinia woe to tibbs  so you are a testimonial to the tripod  so i suspect for i found an invitation when i came home i would have run down to tell you but i had been kept late and one takes some getting up for polite society  there was a great deal of talk about hyders exploit and some disposition to make mr omore the hero of the day but this was quickly nipped by his uncles dry shortness and the superciliousness with which mr cavendish dusautoy turned the conversation to the provision of pistols couriers and guards for travelling through the abruzzi  the polysyllabic courage and false alarms on such a scale completely eclipsed a real pickpocket caught by a gipsys cur and a bankers clerk  not that ulick perceived any disregard until later in the evening when the young kendals arrived and of course he wanted each and all to hear of his tripods achievement  he met with ready attention from sophy and gilbert who pronounced that as the cat was to whittington so was hyder to omore but when in his overflowing he proceeded to lucy she had neither eyes nor ears for him and when the vicar told her mr omore was speaking to her she turned with an air of petulance so that he felt obliged to beg her pardon and retreat  the bayford parties never lasted later than a few minutes after ten but when once mr cavendish dusautoy and miss kendal had possession of the piano and guitar there was no conclusion  song succeeded song they wanted nothing save their own harmony and hardly waited for miss goldsmiths sleepy thanks  the vicar hated late hours and the kendals felt every song a trespass upon their hosts but the musicians had their backs to the world and gave no interval so that it was eleven oclock before mr kendal in desperation laid his hand on his daughter and barbarously carried her off  the flirtation was so palpable that albinia mused on the means of repressing it but she believed that to remonstrate would only be to give lucy pleasure and held her peace till a passion for riding seized upon the young lady  the old pony had hard service between sophys needs and maurices exactions but lucys soul soared far above ponies and fastened upon gilberts steed  and pray what is gilbert to ride  oh papa does not always want captain or mr cavendish dusautoy would lend him bamfylde  thank you returned gilbert satirically  next morning lucy radiant with smiles announced that all was settled  mr cavendish dusautoys lady elmira would be brought down for her to try this afternoon so gilbert might keep his own horse and come too which permission he received with a long whistle and glance at mrs kendal and then walked out of the room  how disobliging said lucy  well then sophy you must make your old hat look as well as you can for i suppose it will not quite do to go without anyone  sophy like her brother looked at mrs kendal and with an eye of indignant appeal and entreaty while albinias countenance was so full of displeasure that lucy continued earnestly o mamma you cant object  you used to go out riding with papa when he was at colonel burys  well lucy exclaimed her sister i did not think even you capable of such a comparison  its all the same said lucy tartly blushing a good deal  sophy leapt up to look at her and albinia trying to be calm and judicious demanded what is the same as what  why algernon and me was the equally precise reply  in stately horror sophy rose and seriously marched away leaving by her look and manner a species of awe upon both parties and some seconds passed ere with crimson blushes albania ventured to invite the dreaded admission by demanding now lucy will you be so good as to tell me the meaning of this extraordinary allusion  why to be surei know it was very different  papa was so old and there were us faltered lucy but i meant you would know how it all ishow those things  stop lucy am i to understand by those things that you wish me to believe you and mr cavendish dusautoy are on the game terms asno i cant say it  i dont know what you mean said lucy growing frightened i never thought there could be such an uproar about my just going out riding  you have led me to infer so much more that it becomes my duty to have an explanation at least she added thinking this sounded cold i should have hoped you would have given me your confidence  o but you always would make game of him cried lucy  not now this is much too serious if you have been led to believe that his attentions are not as i supposed because you are the only girl about here whom he thinks worthy of his notice  its a great deal more said lucy with more feeling and less vanity than had yet been apparent  and what has he been making you think my poor child said albinia i know it is very distressing but it would be more right and safe if i knew what it amounts to  not much after all said lucy her tone implying the reverse and though her cheeks were crimson not averse to the triumph of the avowal nor enduring as much embarrassment as her auditor only he made me sure of ithe saidnow mamma you have made me so i must that he had changed his opinion of english beautyyou know mamma  and another time he said he had wandered europe over toto find loveliness on the banks of the baye  wasnt it absurd  and he says he does not think it half so much that a woman should be accomplished herself as that she should be able to appreciate other peoples talentsand once he said the principessa bianca di moretti would be very much disappointed  well my dear said albinia kindly putting her arm round lucys waist perhaps by themselves the things did not so much require to be told  i can hardly blame you and i wish i had been more on my guard and helped you more  only if he seems to care so little about disappointing this lady might he not do the same by you  but shes an italian and a roman catholic exclaimed lucy  albinia could not help smiling and lucy perceiving that this was hardly a valid excuse for her utter indifference towards her grandisons clementina continued i meanof course there was nothing in it  very possibly but how would it be if byandby he told somebody that miss kendal would be very much disappointed  o mamma cried lucy hastily detaching herself you dont know  i cannot tell my poor lucy said albinia  i fear there must be grief and trouble any way if you let yourself attend to him for you know even if he were in earnest it would not be right to think of a person who has shown so little wish to be good  lucy stood for a few moments before the sense reached her mind then she dropped into a chair and exclaimed  i see how it is  youll treat him as grandpapa treated captain pringle but i shall break my heart quite and she burst into tears  my dear your father and i will do our best for your happiness and we would never use concealment  whatever we do shall be as christian people working together not as tyrants with a silly girl  lucy was pleased and let albinia take her hand  then i will write to decline the horse  it would be far too marked  but oh mamma you wont keep him away  i shall not alter our habits unless i see cause  he is much too young for us to think seriously of what he may have said and i entreat you to put it out of your mind for it would be very sad for you to fix your thoughts on him and then find him not in earnest and even if he were you know it would be wrong to let affection grow up where there is no real dependence upon a persons goodness  the kindness soothed lucy and though she shed some tears she did not resist the decision   indeed she was sensible of that calm determination of manner which all the family had learnt to mean that the measures thus taken were unalterable whereas the impetuous impulses often were reversed  many a womans will is like the tide ever fretting at the verge of the boundary but afraid to overpass it and only tempting the utmost limit in the certainty of the recall and lucy perhaps felt a kind of protection in the curb even while she treated it as an injury  she liked to be the object of solicitude and was pleased with albinias extra kindness while perhaps there was some excitement in the belief that algernon was missing her so she was particularly amenable and not much out of spirits  the original meadows character and bayford breeding had for a time been surmounted by albinias influence and training but so ingrain was the old disposition that a touch would at once reawaken it and the poor girl was in a neutral state coloured by whichever impression had been most recent  albinias hopes of prevailing in the end increased when mrs dusautoy told her with a look of intelligence that algernon was going to stay with a connexion of his mother a mr greenaway with six daughters very stylish young ladies  six stylish young ladies  albinia could have embraced them all and actually conferred a cordial nod on mr cavendish dusautoy when she met him on the way home  but as she entered the house so ominous a tone summoned her to the library that she needed not to be told that mr cavendish dusautoy had been there  i told him said mr kendal that he was too young for me to entertain his proposal and i intimated that he had character to redeem before presenting himself in such capacity  i hope you made the refusal evident to his intellect  he drove me to be more explicit than i intended  i think he was astonished  he stared at me for full three minutes before he could believe in the refusal  poor lad it must be real attachment there could be no other inducement  and lucy is exceedingly pretty  mr kendal glanced at the portrait over the mantelpiece smiled sadly and shook his head  poor dear continued albinia what a commotion there will be in her head but she has behaved so well hitherto that i hope we may steer her safely through above all if one of the six cousins will but catch him in the rebound  have you spoken to her  is it necessary  so asked her grandfather said albinia smiling as he a little out of countenance muttered something of foolish affairmere childand turn her head  thats done said albinia we have only to try to get it straight besides it would hardly be just to let her think he had meant nothing and i have promised to deal openly with her otherwise we can hardly hope for plain dealing from her  and you think it will be a serious disappointment  she is highly flattered by his attention but i dont know how deep it may have gone  i wish people would let ones daughters alone exclaimed mr kendal  you will talk to her then albinia and dont let her think me more harsh than you can help and come and tell me how she bears it  wont you speak to her yourself  do you think i must he said reluctantly you know so much better how to manage her  i think you must do this dear edmund she said between decision and entreaty  she knows that i dislike the man and may fancy it my doing it she only hears it at second hand  if you speak there will be no appeal and besides there are moments when the really nearest should have no gobetweens  we were not very near without you he said  if it were sophy i should know better what to be about  sophy would not put you in such a fix  so i have fancied he paused smiling while she waited in eager curiosity such as made him finish as if ashamed  i have thought our likings much the same  have you never observed what i mean  oh i never observe anything  i did not find out maurice and winifred till he told me  who do you think it is  i always thought love would be the making of sophy  i see she is another being  what is your guess mr hope  mr kendal made a face of astonishment at such an improbable guess and was driven into exclaiming how could any one help thinking of omore  oh only too delightful cried albinia  why didnt i think of itbut then his way is so free and cousinly with us all  there may be nothing in it said mr kendal and under present circumstances it would hardly be desirable  if old mr goldsmith acts as he ought continued albinia we should never lose our sophyand what a son we should have he has so exactly the bright temper that she needs  well well that is all in the clouds said mr kendal  i wish the present were equally satisfactory  ah i had better call poor lucy  come back with her pray called mr kendal nervously  albinia regretted her superfluous gossip when lucy appeared with eyes so sparkling and cheeks so flushed that it was plain that she had been in all the miseries of suspense  her countenance glowed with feeling that lifted her beyond her ordinary dolllike prettiness albinias heart sank with compassion as she held her hand and her father stood as if struck by something more like the vision or his youth than he had been prepared for each feeling that something genuine was present and respecting it accordingly  lucy said mr kendal tenderly i see i need not tell you why i have sent for you  you are very young my dear and you must trust us to care for your happiness  yes  lucy looked up wistfully  this gentleman has some qualities such as may make him shine in the eyes of a young lady but it is our duty to look farther and i am afraid i know nothing of him that could justify me in trusting him with anything so precious to me  lucys face became full of consternation her hand lay unnerved in albiniaa pressure and mr kendal turned his eyes from her to his wife as he proceeded  i have seen so much wretchedness caused by want of religious principle that even where the morals appeared unblemished i should feel no confidence where i saw no evidence of religion and i should consider it as positively wrong to sanction an engagement with such a person  now you must perceive that we have every means of forming an opinion of this young man and that he has given us no reason to think he would show the unselfish care for your welfare that we should wish to secure  albinia tried to make it comprehensible  you know my dear we have always seen him resolved on his own way and not caring how he may inconvenience his uncle and aunt  we know his temper is not always amiable and differently as you see him you must let us judge  wrenching her hand away lucy burst into tears  her father looked at albinia as if she ought to have saved him this infliction and she began a little whispering about not distressing papa which checked the sobs and enabled him to say there thats right my dear i see you are willing to submit patiently to our judgment and i believe you will find it for the best  we will do all in our power to help you and make you happy and bending down he kissed her and left her to his wife  in such family scenes logic is less useful than the power of coming to a friendly conclusion lucys awe of her father was a great assistance she was touched with his unwonted softness and did not apprehend how total was the rejection  but what he was spared was reserved for albinia  there was a lamentable scene of sobbing and weeping beyond all argument and only ending in physical exhaustion which laid her on the bed all the rest of the day  gilbert and sophy could not but be aware of the cause of her distress  the former thought it a great waste  tell lucy he said that if she wishes to be miserable for life she has found the best way  he is a thoroughbred tyrant at heart pigheaded and obstinate and with the very worst temper i ever came across  not a soul can he feel for nor admire but himself  his wife will be a perfect slave  i declare i would as soon sell her to legree  sophys views of the gentleman were not more favourable but she was in terror lest lucy should have a permanently broken heart after the precedent of aunt maria  and on poor sophy fell the misfortune of being driven up by grandmammas inquiries to own that the proposal had been rejected  shade of poor dear mr meadows didst thou not stand aghast  five thousand a year refused  grandmamma would have had a fit if she had not conceived a conviction that imparted a look of shrewdness to her mild simple old face  of course mr kendal was only holding off till the young man was a little older  he could have no intention of letting his daughter miss such a match and dear lucy would have her carriage and be presented at court  sophy argued vehemently against this and poor grandmamma who had with difficulty been taught worldly wisdom as a duty and always thought herself good when she talked prudently began to cry  sophy quite overcome was equally distressing with her apologies albinia found them both in tears and sophy was placed on the sicklist by one of her peculiar headaches of selfreproach  it was a time of great perplexity  lucy cried incessantly bursting out at every trifle but making no complaints and submitting so meekly that the others were almost as unhappy as herself  she was first cheered by the long promised visit from mrs annesley and miss ferrars  albinia had now no fears of showing off home or children and it was a great success  the little awk was in high beauty and graciously winning and maurices likeness to his uncle william enchanted the aunts though they were shocked at his mammas indifference to his constant imperilling of life and limb and grievously discomfited his sisters by adducing children who talked french and read history whereas he could not read dog without spelling and had peculiar views as to b and d p and q however if he could not read he could ride and mrs annesley scarcely knew the extent of the favour she conferred when she commissioned gilbert to procure for him a pony as his private property  miss ferrars had not expected one of the thirtysix omores to turn up here  she gave some good advice about hasty intimacies and as it was received with a defence of the gentility of the omores the two good ladies agreed that dear albinia was quite a child still not fit for the care of those girls and it would be only acting kindly to take lucy to brighton and show her something of the world or albinia would surely let her fall a prey to that irish clerk  they liked lucys pretty face and obliging ways and were fond of having a young lady in their house they saw her looking ill and depressed and thought sea air would be good for her and though lucy fancied herself past caring for gaiety and was very sorry to leave home and mamma she was not insensible to the refreshment of her wardrobe and the excitement and honour of the invitation  at night she cried lamentably and clung round albiniaa neck sobbing oh mamma what will become of me without you but in the morning she went off in very fair spirits and albinia augured hopefully that soon her type of perfection would be no longer polysyllabic  her first letters were deplorable but they soon became cheerful as her mornings were occupied by lessons in music and drawing and her evenings in quiet parties among the friends whom the aunts met at brighton  aunt gertrude wrote to announce that her charge had recovered her looks and was much admired and this was corroborated by the prosperous complacency of lucys style  albinia was more relieved than surprised when the letters dwindled in length and number well knowing that the family office was not favourable to leisure and devoid of the epistolary gift herself she always wondered more at peoples writing than at their silence and scarcely reciprocated lucys effusions by the hurried notes which she enclosed in the wellfilled envelopes of gilbert and sophy who like their father could cover any amount of sheets of paper     chapter xxii    there cried ulick omore i may wish you all goodbye  theres an end of it  mr kendal stood aghast  hes insulted my father and my family cried ulick and does he think ill write another cipher for him  your uncle  dont call him my uncle  i wish id never set eyes on his wooden old face to put the family name and honour in the power of such as he  what has he done to you  he has offered to take me as his partner cried ulick with flashing eyes and as an outcry arose not in sympathy with his resentment he continued vehemently stay you have not heard twas on condition id alter my name leave out the o that has come down to me from them that were kings and princes before his grandfathers broke stones on the road  he offered to take you into partnership repeated mr kendal  do you think i could listen to such terms cried the indignant lad give up the o  why i would never be able to face my brothers  but ulick  dont talk to me mr kendal i wouldnt sell my name if you were to argue to me like plato nor if his bank were the bank of england  i might as well be an englishman at once  then this was the insult  and enough too but it wasnt all  when i answered speaking as coolly i assure you as im doing this minute what does he do but call it a folly and taunt us for a crew of irish beggars  beggars we may be but well not be bought by him  well this must have been an unexpected reception of such a proposal  you may say that  the english think everything may be bought with money  id have overlooked his ignorance poor old gentleman if he would not have gone and spoken of my o as vulgar  vulgar  so when i began to tell him how it began from tigearnach the omore of ballymakilty that was tanist of connaught in the time of king mac murrough and that killed phadrig the odonoghoe in single combat at the fight of shochknockmorty and bit off his nose calling it a sweet morsel of revenge what does he do but tell me i was mad and that he would have none of my nonsensical tales of the savage irish so i said i couldnt stand to hear my family insulted and thenwould you believe it he would have it that it was i that was insolent and when i was not going to apologize for what i had borne from him he said he had always known how it would be trying to deal with one of our family no better than making a silk purse out of a sows ear and im obliged for the compliment said i quite coolly and politely but no irish pig would sell his ear for a purse and so i came away quite civilly and reasonably  aye i see what you would do mr kendal but i beg with all my heart you wont  there are some things a gentleman should not put up with and ill not take it well of you if you call it my duty to hear my father and his family abused  ill despise myself if i could  you dont cried he turning round to albinia  oh no but i think you should try to understand mr goldsmiths point of view  i understand it only too well if that would do any good  point of viewwhy tis the farmyard cocks point of view strutting on the top of that bank of his own and patronizing the free pheasant out in the woods  more fool i for ever letting him clip my wings but hes seen the last of me  no dont ask me to make it up  it cant be done  what can be done to the boy asked albinia how can he be brought to hear reason  leave him alone mr kendal said aside while ulick in a torrent of eager cadences protested his perfect sanity and reason and mr kendal quietly left the room again to start on a peacemaking mission but it was unpromising for mr goldsmith began by declaring he would not hear a single word in favour of the ungrateful young dog  mr kendal gathered that young omore had become so valuable and that cold and indifferent as mr goldsmith appeared he had been growing so fond and so proud of his nephew as actually to resolve on giving him a share of the business and dividing the inheritance which had hitherto been destined to a certain andrew goldsmith brought up in a relations office at bristol  surprised at his own graciousness and anticipating transports of gratitude his dismay and indignation at the reception of his proposal were extreme especially as he had no conception of the offence he had given regarding the unfortunate o as a badge of hibernianism and vulgarity i put it to you mr kendal as a sensible man whether it would not be enough to destroy the credit of the bank to connect it with such a name as that looking like an irish haymakers  i should be ashamed of every note i issued  it is unlucky said mr kendal and a difficulty the lad could hardly appreciate since it is a good old name and the o is a special mark of nobility  and what has a banker to do with nobility  pretty sort of nobility too at that dogkennel of theirs in ireland and his father a mere adventurer if ever there lived one  but i swore when he carried off poor ellen that his speculation should do him no good and ive kept my word  i wish i hadnt been fool enough to meddle with one of the concern  no no tis no use arguing mr kendal i have done with him  i would not make him a partner not if he offered to change his name to john smith  i never thought to meet with such ingratitude but it runs in the breed  i might have known better than to make much of one of the crew  yet it is a pity too we have not had such a clearheaded trustworthy fellow about the place since young bowles died he has a good deal of the goldsmith in him when you set him to work and makes his figures just like my poor father  i thought it was his writing the other day till i looked at the date  clever lad very but it runs in the blood  i shall send for andrew goldsmith  one secret of mr kendals power was that he never interrupted but let people run themselves down and contradict themselves and all he observed was however it may end you have done a great deal for him  even if you parted now he would be able to find a situation  whyyes said mr goldsmith the lad knew nothing serviceable when he came we had an infinity of maggots about algebra and logarithms to drive out of his head but now he really is nearly as good an accountant as old johns  you would be sorry to part with him and i cannot help hoping this may be made up  you dont bring me any message  ive said ill listen to nothing  no the poor boys feelings are far too much wounded said mr kendal  whether rightly or wrongly he fancies that his father and family have been slightingly spoken of and he is exceedingly hurt  his father  im sure i did not say a tenth part of what the fellow richly deserves  if the young gentleman is so touchy he had better go back to ireland again  nothing more favourable could mr kendal obtain though he thought mr goldsmith uneasy and perhaps impressed by the independence of his nephews attitude  it was an arduous office for a peacemaker where neither party could comprehend the feelings of the other but on his return he found that ulick had stormed himself into comparative tranquillity and was listening the better to the womankind because they had paid due honour to the amiable ancestral tigearnach and all his guttural posterity whose savage exploits and bloody catastrophes acted as such a sedative that by the time he had come down to uncle bryan of the kaffir war he actually owned that as to the mighty o mr goldsmith might have erred in sheer ignorance  after all said albinia u omore is rather personal in writing to a creditor  it might be worse said ulick laughing if my name was john  i omore would be a dangerous confession  but ill not be come round even by your fun mrs kendal ill not part with my fathers name  no that would be base said sophy  who would wish to persuade you added albinia  i am sure you are right in refusing with your feelings i only want you to forgive your uncle and not to break with him  id forgive him his ignorance but my mother herself could not wish me to forgive what he said of my father  and how if he thinks this explosion needs forgiveness  he must do without it said ulick  no i was cool i assure you cool and collected but it was not fit for me to stand by and hear my father insulted  albinia closed the difficult discussion by observing that it was time to dress and sophy followed her from the room burning with indignant sympathy  it would be meanly subservient to ask pardon for defending a father whom he thought maligned said albinia and sophy took exception at the word thought  ah of course he cannot be deceived said albiniabut no sooner were the words spoken than she was halfstartled halfcharmed by finding they had evoked a glow of colour  how do you think it will end asked sophy  i can hardly fancy he will not be forgiven and yetit might be better  yes i do think he would get on faster in india said sophy eagerly he could do just as gilbert might have done  was it possible for albinia to have kept out of her eyes a significant glance or to have disarmed her lips of a merry smile of amused encouragement  how she had looked she knew not but the red deepened on sophys whole face and after one inquiring gaze from the eyes they were cast down and an ineffable brightness came over the expression softening and embellishing  what have i done thought albinia  never mindit must have been all there or it would not have been wakened so easilyif he goes they will have a scene first  but when mr kendal came back he only advised ulick to go to his desk as usual the next day as if nothing had happened  and ulick owned that turn out as things might he could not quit his work in the first ardour of his resentment and with a great exertion of christian forgiveness he finally promised not to give notice of his retirement unless his uncle should repeat the offence  this time albinia durst not look at sophy  rather according to his friends hopes than his own he was able to report at the close of the next day that he had not had a word from his uncle except a nod and thus the days passed on andrew goldsmith did not appear and it became evident that he was to remain on sufferance as a clerk  nor did albinia and sophy venture to renew the subject between themselves  at first there was consciousness in their silence soon their minds were otherwise engrossed  mrs meadows was suddenly stricken with paralysis and was thought to be dying  she recovered partial consciousness in the course of the next day but was constantly moaning the name of her eldest and favourite granddaughter and when telegraph and express train brought home the startled and trembling lucy she was led at once to the sick bedwhere at her name there was the first gleam of anything like pleasure  and where have you been my dear this long time  ive been atat brighton dear grandmamma said lucy so much agitated as scarcely to be able to recall the name or utter the words  andi say my dear love said mrs meadows earnestly and mysteriously have you seen him  poor lucy turned scarlet with distress and confusion but she was held fast and grandmamma pursued im sure he has not his equal for handsomeness and stateliness and there must have been a pair of you  dear grandmamma we must let lucy go and take off her things she shall come back presently but she has had a long journey interposed albinia seeing her ready to sink into the earth  but mrs meadows had roused into eagerness and would not let her go i hope you danced with him dear she went on and its all nonsense about his being high and silent  your papa is bent on it and youll live like a princess in india  she takes you for your mothershe means papa whispered albinia not without a secret flash at once of indignation at perceiving how his first love had been wasted yet of exultation in finding that no one but herself had known how to love him but poor lucy completely and helplessly overcome could only exclaim in a faltering voice oh grandmamma dont and albinia was forced to disengage her support her out of the room and leaving her to her sister hasten back to soothe the old lady who had been terrified by her emotion it had been a great mistake to bring her in abruptly when tired with her journey and not fully aware what awaited her  but there was at that time reason to think all would soon be over and albinia was startled and confused  albinia had hitherto been the only efficient nurse of the family sophys presence seemed to stir up instincts of the old wrangling habits and the invalid was always fretful when left to her so that to her own exceeding distress she was kept almost entirely out of the sick room  lucy on the other hand was extremely valuable there her bright manner and unfailing chatter always amused if needful and her light step and tender hand made her useful and highly appreciated by the regular nurse  for the first few days they watched in awe for the last dread summons but gradually it was impossible not to become in a manner habituated to the suspense so that common things resumed their interest and though sophy was pained by the incongruity it could not have been otherwise without the spirits and health giving way under the strain  nothing could be more trying than to have the mind wrought up to hourly anticipation of the last parting and then the delay without the reaction of recovery the spirit beyond all reach of intercourse and the mortal frame languishing and drooping  mr kendal had from the first contemplated the possibility of the long duration of such lingering and did his utmost to promote such enlivenment and change for the attendants as was consistent with their care of the sufferer  they never dared to be all beyond call at once since a very little agitation might easily suffice to bring on a fatal attack and albinia and lucy were forced to share the hours of exercise and employment between them and often albinia could not leave the house and garden at all  gilbert was an excellent auxiliary and would devote many an hour to the cheering of the poor shattered mind  his entrance seldom failed to break the thread of melancholy murmurs and he had exactly the gentle bright attentive manner best fitted to rouse and enliven nothing could be more irreproachable than his conduct and his consideration and gentleness so much endeared him that he had never been so much at peace  all he dreaded was the leaving what was truly to him the sanctuary of home he feared alike temptation and the effort of resistance and could not bear to go away when his grandmother was in so precarious a state and he could so much lighten mrs kendals cares both by being with her and by watching over maurice  his parents were almost equally afraid of trusting him in the world and the embodiment of the militia for the county offered a quasi profession which would keep him at home and yet give him employment  he was very anxious to be allowed to apply for a commission and pleaded so earnestly and humbly that it would be his best hope of avoiding his former errors that mr kendal yielded though with doubt whether it would be well to confine him to so narrow a sphere  meantime the corps was quartered at bayford and filled the streets with awkward louts in red jackets who were inveterate in mistaking the right for the left gilbert had a certain shy pride in his soldiership and maurice stepped like a young field marshal when he saw his brother saluted  nothing had so much decided this step as the finding that young dusautoy was to return to his college after easter  he was at the vicarage again marking his haughty avoidance of the kendal family and to their great joy lucy did not appear distressed she was completely absorbed in her grandmother and shrank from all allusion to her lover  had the small flutter of vanity been cured by a glimpse beyond her own corner of the world  but soon albinia became sensible of an alteration in gilbert  he had no sooner settled completely into his new employment than a certain restless dissatisfaction seemed to have possessed him  he was fastidious at his meals grumbled at his horse scolded the groom had fits of petulance towards his brother and almost neglected mrs meadows  no one could wonder at a youth growing weary of such attendance but his tenderness and amiability had been his best points and it was grievous to find them failing  albinia would have charged the alteration on his brother officers if they had not been a very steady and humdrum set whose society gilbert certainly did not prefer  she was more uneasy at finding that he sometimes saw algernon dusautoy though for lucys sake he always avoided bringing his name forward  a woman was ill in the bargemans cottage by the towingpath and albinia had walked to see her  as she came downstairs she heard voices and beheld mr hope evidently on the same errand with herself talking to gilbert  she caught the words ere she could safely descend the rickety staircase gilbert was saying  oh some happy pair from the high street  i beg your pardon said mr hope i am so blind i really took it for your sister but our shopkeepers daughters do dress so  albinia looking in the same direction beheld in a walk that skirted the meadow towards the wood two figures of which only one was clearly visible it was nearly a quarter of a mile off but there was something about it that made her exclaim why thats mr cavendish dusautoy whom can he be walking with  gilbert started violently at hearing her behind him and a word or two of greeting passed with mr hope then there was some spying at the pair but they were getting further off and disappeared in the wood while gilbert screwing up his eyes and stammering declared he did not know it might be he did not think any one could be recognised at such a distance and then saying that he had fallen in with mr hope by chance he hastened on  the curate made a brief visit and walked home with her examining her on her impression that the gentleman was young dusautoy and finally consulting her on the expediency of mentioning the suspicion to the vicar in case he should be deluding some foolish tradesmans daughter  albinia strongly advised his doing so she had much faith in her own keen eyesight and could not mistake the majestic mien of algernon she thought the vicar ought at once to be warned but felt relieved that it was not her part to speak  she was very glad when mr hope took an opportunity of telling her that young dusautoy was going to the greenaways in a day or two  as to gilbert it was as if this departure had relieved him from an incubus he was in better spirits from that moment and returned to his habits of kindness to both grandmamma and maurice  the manifold duties of head sicknurse governess and housekeeper were apt to clash and valiant and unwearied as albinia was she was obliged perforce to leave the children more to others than she would have preferred  little albinia was all docility and sweetness and already did such wonders with her ivory letters that the exulting sophy tried to abash maurice by auguring that she would be the first to read to which undaunted he replied shell never be a boy nevertheless maurice was developing a species of conscience rendering him trustworthy and obedient out of sight better in fact alone with his own honour and his mothers commands than with any authority that he could defy  he knew when his father meant to be obeyed and gilbert managed him easily but he warred with lucy ruled sophy and had no chivalry for any one but little albinia nor obedience except for his mother and was a terror to maidservants and elder children  with much of promise he was anything but an agreeable child and whilst no one but herself ever punished contradicted or complained of him albinia had a task that would have made her very uneasy had not her mind been too fresh and strong for oversense of responsibility  each immediate duty in its turn was sufficient for her  maurices shadowlike pursuit of gilbert often took him off her hands  it might sometimes be troublesome to the elder brother and now and then rewarded with a petulant rebuff but maurice was only the more pertinacious and on the whole his allegiance was requited with ardent affection and unbounded indulgence  nay once when maurice and his pony one or both were swept on by the whole hunt and obliged to follow the hounds gilbert in his anxiety took leaps that he shuddered to remember while the urchin sat the first gallantly and though he fell into the next ditch scrambled up on the instant and was borne by his spirited pony over two more amid universal applause  mr nugent himself rode home with the brothers to tell the story papa and mamma were too much elated at his prowess to scold  the eventful year 1854 had begun and general ferrars was summoned from canada to a command in the east  on his arrival in england he wrote to his brother and sister to meet him in london and the aunts delighted to gather their children once more round them sent pressing invitations only regretting that there was not room enough in the family office for the younger branches  mr ferrars first measure was to ride to willow lawn  knocking at the door of his sisters morningroom he found maurice with a pouting lip back rounded and legs twisted standing upon his elbows which were planted upon the table on either side of a calico spellingbook  mr kendal stood up straight before the fire looking distressed and perplexed and albinia sat by a little worn a little irritable and with the expression of a wilful victim  all greeted the newcomer warmly and maurice exclaimed mamma i may have a holiday now  not till you have learnt your spelling  there was some sharpness in the tone and maurices shoulderblades looked sulky  in consideration of his uncle began mr kendal but she put her hand on the boy saying you know we agreed there were to be no holidays for a week because we did not use the last properly  he moved off disconsolately and his father said i hope you are come to arrange the journey to london  is winifred coming with you  no a hurry and confusion and the good aunts would be too much for her you will be the only one for inspection  yes take him with you maurice said albinia he must see william  you must be the exhibitor then her brother replied  now maurice i know what you are come for but you ought to know better than to persuade me when you know there are six good reasons against my going  i know of one worth all the six  yes said mr kendal i have been telling her that she is convincing me that i did wrong in allowing her to burthen herself with this charge  thats nothing to the purpose said albinia having undertaken it when you all saw the necessity i cannot forsake it now  if mrs meadows were in the same condition as she was in two months ago there might be a doubt said mr kendal but she is less dependent on your attention and lucy and gilbert are most anxious to devote themselves to her in your absence  i know they all wish to be kind but if anything went wrong i should never forgive myself  not if you went out for pleasure alone said her brother but relationship has demands  of course she said petulantly if edmund is resolved i must go but that does not convince me that it is right to leave everything to run riot here  mr kendal looked serious and mr ferrars feared that the winter cares had so far told on her temper that perplexity made her wilful in selfsacrifice  there was a pause but just as she began to perceive she had said something wrong the lesser maurice burst out in exultation  there it is not indestructible  what mischief have you been about  the question was needless for the table was strewn with snips of calico  this nasty spellingbook  lucy said it was called indestructible because nobody could destroy it but ive taken my new knife to it and see there  and now can you make another said his uncle  i dont want to  nor one either sir said mr kendal  what shall we have to tell uncle william about you  im afraid you are one of the chief causes of mamma not knowing how to go to london  maurice did not appear on the way to penitence but his mother said bring me your knife  he hung down his head and obeyed without a word  she closed it and laid it on the mantelshelf which served as a sort of pound for properties in sequestration  now then go she said you are too naughty for me to attend to you  but when will you mamma laying a hand on her dress  i dont know  go away now  he slowly obeyed and as the door shut she said there in a tone as if her view was established  you must send him to fairmead said the uncle  to terrify winifred  no no i know better than that gilbert can look after him  i dont so much care about that  the admission was eagerly hailed and objection after objection removed and having recovered her good humour she was candid and owned how much she wished to go  i really want to make acquaintance with william  ive never seen him since i came to my senses and have only taken him on trust from you  i wish equally that he should see you said her brother  it would be good for him and i doubt whether he has any conception what you are like  id better stay at home to leave you and edmund to depict for his benefit a model impossible idolthe normal woman  maurice looked at her and shook his head  noit would be ratherit and its young one eh  maurice took both her hands  i should not like to tell william what i shall believe if you do not come  well what  that edmund is right and you have been overtasked till you are careful and troubled about many things  only too much bent on generous selfdevotion said mr kendal eagerly too unselfish to cast the balance of duties  hush edmund said albinia  i dont deserve fine words  i honestly believe i want to do what is right but i cant be sure what it is and i have made quite fuss enough so you two shall decide and then i shall be made right anyway  only do it from your consciences  they looked at each other taken aback by the sudden surrender  mr ferrars waited and her husband said she ought to see her brother she needs the change and there is no sufficient cause to detain her  she must be content sometimes to trust said mr ferrars  aye and all that will go wrong when my back is turned  let it said her brother  the right which depends on a single human eye is not good for much  let the weeds grow or you cant pull them up  let the mice play that the cat may catch them said albinia striving to hide her care  one good effect is that edmund has not begun to groan  indeed in his anxiety that she should consent to enjoy herself he had not had time to shrink from the introduction  outside the door they found maurice waiting his spelling learnt from a fragment of the indestructible spellingbook and the question followed now mamma you wont say im too naughty for you to go to london and see uncle william  no my little boy i mean to trust you and tell uncle william that my young soldier is learning the soldiers first dutyobedience  and may i have my knife mamma  papa had settled that question by himself taking it off the chimneypiece and restoring it  if mamma wished the penance to have been longer she neither looked it nor said it  the young people received the decision with acclamation and the two elder ones vied with one another in attempts to set her mind at rest by undertaking everything and promising for themselves and the children perfect regularity and harmony  sophy with a bluntness that king lear would have highly disapproved said she was glad mamma was going but she knew they should be all at sixes and sevens she would do her best and very bad it would be  not if you dont make up your mind beforehand that it must be bad said her uncle  sophy smiled she was much less impervious to cheerful auguries and spoke with gladness of the pleasure it would give her friend genevieve to see mrs kendal  mr ferrars had a short interview with ulick and was amused by observing that little maurice had learnt as much irish as ulick had dropped  after the passing fever about his o had subsided he was parting with some of his ultranationality  the whirr of his rs and his irish idioms were far less perceptible and though a word of attack on his country would put him on his mettle and bring out the kelt in full force yet in his reasonable state his good sense and love of order showed an evident development and instead of contending that galway was the most perfect county in the world he only said it might yet be so  isnt he a noble fellow cried albinia warmly  yes said her brother i doubt whether all the omores put together have ever made such a conquest as he has  it was fun to see how the aunts were dismayed to find one of the horde in full force here  i believe it was as a measure of precaution that they took lucy away  i was very glad for lucy to go but hers was not exactly the danger  ha said maurice and albinia blushed  whereupon he said interrogatively hem which made her laugh so consciously that he added dont you go and be romantic about either of your young ladies or there will be a general burning of fingers  if you knew all our secrets maurice you would think me a model of prudence and forbearance  ho was his next interjection so much the worse  for my own part i dont expect prudence will come to you naturally till the little awk has a lover  wont it come any other way  yes in one way he said gravely  and that way is not easily found by those who have neither humility nor patience she said sadly who rush on their own will  nay albinia it is being sought i do believe and remember the lines     thine own mild energy bestow    and deepen while thou bidst it flow    more calm our stream of love   forced to resign herself to her holiday albinia did so with a good grace in imitation of her brother who assured her that he had brought a bottle of lethe and had therein drowned wife children and parish  mr kendals spirits as usual rose higher every mile from bayford and they were a very lively party when they arrived in mayfair  the good aunts were delighted to have round them all those whom they called their children all except fred whom the new arrangements had sent to rejoin his regiment in ireland  sinewy spare and wiry with keen gray eyes under straight brows narrow temples a sunburnt face and alert upright bearing and quick step william ferrars was every inch a soldier but nothing so much struck mr and mrs kendal as the likeness to their little maurice though it consisted more in air and gesture than in feature  his speech was brief and to the point softened into delicatelypolished courtesy towards womankind in the condescension of strength to weaknessthe quality he evidently thought their chief characteristic  albinia was amused as she watched him with grownup eyes and compared present with past impressions  she could now imagine that she had been an inconvenient charge to a young soldier brother and that he had been glad to make her over to the aunts only petting and indulging her as a child looking down on her fancies and smiling at her sauciness when she was an enthusiastic maidentreatment which she had so much resented that she had direfully offended maurice by pronouncing william a mere martinet when she was hurt at his neither reading the curse of kehama nor entering into her plans for fairmead school  having herself become a worker she could better appreciate a man who had seen and acted instead of reading recollected herself as an emanation of conceit and felt shy and anxious even more for her husband than for herself  how would the scholar and the soldier fare together and could she and maurice keep them from wearying of each other  she had little trust in her own fascinations though she saw the generals eye approvingly fixed on her and believing herself to be a more pleasing object in her womanly bloom than in her unformed girlhood  how does the montreal affair go on she asked  what affair  fred and miss kinnaird  i am sorry to say he has not put it out of his head  surely she is a very nice person  pshaw  he has no right to think of a wife these dozen years  not even think  when he is not to have one at any rate till he is a field officer  and he is a fool to have one then  a mere encumbrance to himself and the entire corps  yes i know said albinia she always gets the best cabin  and that is no place for her  no man as i have told fred over and over again ought to drag a woman into hardships for which she is not fitted and where she interferes with his effectiveness and the comfort of every one else  the identical lecture of twelve years since when he had feared albinias becoming this inconvenient appendage  if he had repeated it on all like occasions she did not wonder that it had wearied his aidedecamp  perhaps she said the backwoods may have fitted miss emily for the life and i cant but be glad of freds having been steady to anything  considering this speech like the kehama days the general went on to dilate on the damage that marriage was to the service removing the best officers first from the mess and then from the army  what a pity william was born too late to be a knight of st john said albinia  all laughed but she doubted whether he were pleased for he addressed himself to one of the aunts while maurice spoke to her in an under tonei believe he is quite right  homes are better for the individual man but not for the service  how remarkably the analogy holds with this other service  you mean what st paul says of the married and unmarried  i always think he and his sayings are the most living lessons i know on the requirements of the other army  albinia mused on the insensible change in maurice  he had not embraced his profession entirely by choice  it had always been understood that one of the younger branches must take the family living and as fred had spurned study he had been bred up to consider it as his fate and if he had ever had other wishes he had entirely accepted his destiny and sincerely turned to his vocation the knowledge that he must be a clergyman had ruled him and formed him from his youth and acting through him on his sister had rendered her more than the accomplished prosperous young lady her aunts meant to have made her  yet even up to a year or two after his ordination there had been a sense of sacrifice he loved sporting and even balls and it had been an effort to renounce them he had avoided coming to london because his keen enjoyment of society tended to make him discontented with his narrow sphere she had even known him to hesitate to ride with the staff at a review lest he should make himself liable to repinings  and now how entirely had all this passed away not merely by outgrowing the enterprising temper and boyish habits nor by contentment in a happy home but by the sufficiency and rest of his service the engrossment in the charge from his great captain  without being himself aware of it he had ceased to distrust a holiday because it was no longer a temptation and his animation and mirth were the more free because selfregulation was so thoroughly established that restraint was no longer felt  mrs annesley was talking of the little kendals who she had ruled should be at fairmead  no said maurice albinia thought her son too mighty for winifred our laudable efforts at cousinly friendship usually produce warwhoops that bring the two mammas each to snatch her own offspring from the fray with a scolding for the sake of appearances though believing the other the only guilty party  now maurice cried albinia you confess how fond mary is of setting people to rights  wellwhen maurice bullies alby  aye you talk of the mammas and you only want to make out poor maurice the aggressor  never mind they will work in better than if they were fabulous children  ah you are going to contend that yours is a fabulous child  take care i dont come on you with the indestructible  take care i dont come on you with marys lessons to colonel bury on the gamelaw  does it not do one good to see those two quarrelling just like old times exclaimed one aunt to the other  and william looking on as contemptuous as ever said albinia  not at all  i rejoice to have this week with you  i should like to see your boy  maurice says he is a thorough young soldier  mr kendal looked pleased  the man of study had a penchant for the man of action and the brothersinlaw were drawing together  mars the great geographical master was but opening his gloomy school on the turkish soil and the world was discovering its ignorance beyond the pinnocks catechisms of its youth  maurice treated mr kendal as a dictionary and his stores of byzantine othman and austrian lore chimed in with the perceptions of the general who going by military maps described plans of operations which mr kendal could hardly believe he had not found in history while he could as little credit that mr kendal had neither studied tactics nor seen the spots of which he could tell such serviceable minutiae  they had their heads together over the map the whole evening and the next morning when the general began to ask questions about turkish his sister was proud to hear her husband answering with the directness and precision dear to a military man  thats an uncommonly learned man albinias husband began the general as soon as he had started with his brother on a round of errands  i never met a man of more profound and universal knowledge  i dont see that he is so grave and unlike other people  fred reported that he was silence itself and she might as well have married hamlets ghost  fred saw him at a party said maurice then remembering that this might not be explanatory he added he shines most when at ease and every year since his marriage has improved and enlivened him  i am satisfied  i hardly knew how to judge though i did not think myself called upon to remonstrate against the marriage as the aunts wished  i knew i might depend on you and i thought it high time that she should be settled  i have been constantly admiring her discernment for i own that at first his reserve stood very much in my way but since she has raised his spirits and taught him to exert himself he has been a most valuable brother to me  then you think her happy  i was surprised to see her such a finelooking woman my aunts had croaked so much about his children and his mother that i thought she would be worn to a shadow  very happy  she has casual troubles and a great deal of work but that is what she is made for  how does she get on with his children  hearty love for them has carried her through the first difficulties which appalled me for they had been greatly mismanaged  i am afraid that she has not been able to undo some of the past evil and with all her good intentions i am sometimes afraid whether she is old enough to deal with grownup young people  you dont mean that kendals children are grown up  i should think him younger than i am  he is so but civil servants marry early and not always wisely and the son is about twenty  poor albinia dotes on him and has done more for him than ever his father did but the lad is weak and tender every way with no stamina moral or physical and with just enough property to do him harm  he has been at oxford and has failed and now he is in the militia but what can be expected of a boy in a country town with nothing to do  i did not like his looks last week and i dont think his being there always idle is good for that little manly scamp of albinias own  why dont they put him into the service  he is too old  not too old for the cavalry  he can ride certainly and is a tall goodlooking fellow but i should not have thought him the stuff to make a dragoon  he has always been puling and delicate unfit for school wanting force  wanting discipline said the general  i have seen a year in a good regiment make an excellent officer of that very stamp of youngster just wanting a mould to give him substance  the regiment should be a very good one said mr ferrars he would be only too easily drawn in by the bad style of subaltern  put him into the 25th lancers said the general and set fred to look after him  rattlepate as he is he can take excellent care of a lad to whom he takes a fancy and if albinia asked him he would do it with all his heart  i wish you would propose it though i am afraid his father will never consent  i would do a great deal to get him away before he has led little maurice into harm  this consideration moved the rector of fairmead himself to broach the subject but neither mr kendal nor albinia could think of venturing their fragile son in the army though assured that there was little chance that the 25th lancers would be summoned to the east and they would only hold out hopes of little maurice by and by  albinias martial ardour was revived as she listened with greater grasp of comprehension to subjects familiar in her girlhood  she again met old friends of her father the lingering glories of the peninsula and waterloo who liked her for her own sake as well as for her fathers while maurice looked on amused by her husbands silent pride in her and her hourly progress in the regard of the general who began to talk of making a long visit to fairmead after what he expected would be a slight demonstration on the danube  he even began to regret the briefness of the time that he could spend in their society  much was crowded into that week but albinia contrived to find an hour for a call on her little french friend to whom she had already forwarded the parcels she had brought from homea great barmbrack from biddy and a store of delicate convent confections from hadminster  she was set down at a sober old house in the lawyers quarter of the world and conducted to a pretty though rather littered drawingroom where she found a delicatelooking young mamma and various small children  im so glad said little mrs rainsforth that you have been able to come it will be such a pleasure to dear miss durant and while one of the children was sent to summon the governess the lady continued nervously but warmly i hope you will think miss durant looking well i am afraid she shuts herself up too much  im sure she is the greatest comfort the greatest blessing to us  albinias reply was prevented by a rush of children followed by the dear little trim slight figure  there was no fear that genevieve did not look well or happy  her olive complexion was healthy her dark eyes lustrous with gladness her smile frank and unquelled her movements full of elastic life  she led the way to the back parlour dingy by nature but bearing living evidence to the charm which she infused into any room scratched table desks copybooks and worn grammars had more the air of a comfortable occupation than of the shabby haunt of irksome taskwork  there were flowers in the window and the childrens treasures were arranged with taste  genevieve loved her schoolroom and showed off its little advantages with pretty exultation  if mrs kendal could only see how well it looked with the curtains down after tea  and then came the long long talk over home affairs and the history of half the population of bayford genevieve making inquiries and drinking in the answers as if she could not make enough of her enjoyment  not till all the rest had been discussed did she say with dropped eyelids and a little blush is mr gilbert kendal quite strong  thank you he has been much better this winter and so useful and kind in nursing grandmamma  yes he was always kind  he was going to beg me to remember him to you but he broke off and said you would not care  i care for all goodness towards me answered genevieve lifting her eyes with a flash of inquiry  i am afraid he is as bad as ever poor fellow said albinia with a little smile and sigh but he has behaved very well  i must tell you that you were in the same train with him on his journey from oxford and he was ashamed to meet your eye  ah i remember well  i thought i saw him  i was bringing george and fanny from a visit to their aunts and i was sure it must be mr gilbert  as prudent as ever genevieve  it would not have been right she said blushing but it was such a treat to see a bayford face that i had nearly sprung out of the waitingroom to speak to him at the first impulse  my poor little exile said albinia  no that is not my name  call me my aunts breadwinner  thats my pride  i mean my cause of thankfulness  i could not have earned half so much at home  i hope indeed you have a home here  that i have she fervently answered  oh without being a homeless orphan one does not learn what kind hearts there are  mr and mrs rainsforth seemed only to fear that they should not be good enough to me  do you mean that you found it a little oppressive  fi donc madame  yet i must own that with her timid uneasy way and his so perfect courtesy they did alarm me a little at first  i pitied them for i saw them so resolved not to let me feel myself de trop that i knew i was in their way  did not that vex you  why i suppose they set their inconvenience against the needs of their children and my concern was to do my duty and be as little troublesome as possible  they pressed me to spend my evenings with them but i thought that would be too hard on them so i told them i preferred the last hours alone and i do not come in unless there are others to prevent their being teteatete  very wise  and do you not find it lonely  it is my time for readingmy time for lettersmy time for being at home cried genevieve  now however that i hope i am no longer a weight on them mrs rainsforth will sometimes ask me to come and sing to him or read aloud when he comes home so tired that he cannot speak and her voice is weak  alas they are both so fragile so delicate  her soul was evidently with them and with her charges of whom there was so much to say that the carriage came all too soon to hurry albinia away from the sight of that buoyant sweetness and capacity of happiness  she was rather startled by miss ferrars saying bytheby albinia how was it that you never told us of the development of the infant prodigy  i dont know what you mean aunt gertrude  dont you remember that boy that mrs dusautoy cavendishs son whom that poor little companion of hers used to call lenfant prodigue  i did not know he was a neighbour of yours as i find from lucy  what did lucy tell you about him  she did not meet him cried albinia endeavouring not to betray her alarm  i mean did she meet him  indeed said miss ferrars you should have warned us if you had any objection my dear  well but what did happen  oh nothing alarming i assure you  they met at a ball at brighton lucy introduced him and said he was your vicars nephew they danced together  i think only once  i wish you had mentioned it  when did it happen  i can hardly tell  i think she had been about a fortnight with us but she seemed so indifferent that i should never have thought it worth mentioning  i remember my sister thought of asking him to a little evening party of ours and lucy dissuading her  now really albinia dont look as if we had been betraying our trust  you never gave us any reason to think  no no  i beg your pardon dear aunt  i hope theres no harm done if i could have thought of his turning up i wouldbut i hope it is all right  such good accounts came from both homes and the general was so unwilling to part with his brother and sister that he persuaded them to accompany him to southampton for embarkation  they all felt that these last days precious now might be doubly precious byandby and alone with them and free from the kindly scrutiny of the good aunts william expanded and evinced more warm fraternal feeling than he had ever manifested  he surprised his sister by thanking her warmly for having come to meet him  i am glad to have been with you albinia i am glad to have seen your husband  i have told maurice that i am heartily rejoiced to see you in such excellent hands  you must come and see the children and know him better  i hope so when this affair is over and i expect it will be soon settled  anyway i am glad we have been together  if we meet again we will try to see more of one another  he had said much more to his brother expressing regret that he had been so much separated from his sister  thorough soldier as he was and ardent for active service the sight of her and her husband had renewed gentler thoughts and he was so far growing old that the idea of home and rest came invitingly before him  he was softened at the parting and when he wrung their hands for the last time on the deck of the steamer they were glad that his last words were god bless you  there had been some uncertainty as to the time of his sailing and fairmead and bayford had been told that unless their travellers arrived by the last reasonable train on friday they were not to be expected till the same time on saturday maurice having concocted a scheme for crossing by several junction lines so as to save waiting but they had not reckoned on the discourtesies of two rival companies whose lines met at the same station and the southern train was only in time to hear the parting snort of the engine that it professed to catch  the ferrars nature above all when sore with farewells was not made to submit to having time wasted by treacherous trains on a cold wintry day and at a small new station with an apology for a waitingroom no bookstall and nothing to eat but greasy gingerbread and hard apples  maurice relieved his feelings by heartily rowing all the officials but he could obtain no redress as he knew full well the whole time nor would any train pick them up for full three hours  so indignant was he that amusement rendered albinia patient especially when he took to striding up and down the platform devising cases in which the delay might be actionable and vituperating the placability of mr kendal who having wrapt up his wife in plaids and seated her on the top of the luggage had set his back to the wall and was lost to the present world in a book  never mind maurice said albinia in any other circumstances we should think three hours of each other a great boon  if anything could be an aggravation it would be to see albinia philosophical  you make me so on the principle of the helots and spartans  it was possible to get to hadminster by halfpast seven and on to bayford by nine oclock but fairmead lay further from the line and the next train did not stop at the nearest station so maurice agreed to sleep at bayford that night and this settled set out with his sister to explore the neighbourhood for eatables and church architecture  they made an ineffectual attempt to rouse mr kendal to go with them but he was far too deep in his book and only muttered something about looking after the luggage  they found a stale loaf of bread and a hideous church but it was a merry walk and brought them back in their liveliest mood which lasted even to pronouncing it great fun that the hadminster flies were all at a ball and that the omnibus must convey them home by the full moonlight     chapter xxiii    slowly the omnibus rumbled over the wooden bridge and then with a sudden impulse it thundered up to the front door  albinia jumped out and caught sophy in her arms exclaiming and how are you all my dear  we had quite given you up gilbert was saying  the fire is in the library he added as mr kendal was opening the drawingroom door and closing it in haste at the sight of a pale uninviting patch of moonlight and the rush of a blast of cold wind  and how is grandmamma and the children  my sophy you dont look well and wheres lucy  ere she could receive an answer down jumped two steps at a time a halfdressed figure all white stout legs and arms which were speedily hugging mamma  theres my man said mr kendal a good boy i know  no cried the bold voice  no incredulously what have you been doing  i broke the conservatory with the marble dog and he looked at gilbert  theres my brave boy said mr kendal who had suffered so much from his elder sons equivocation as to be ready to overlook anything for the sake of truth  here uncle maurice shake hands with your godson who always tells truth  the urchin folded his arms on his bosom and looked like a young bonaparte  wheres your hand said his uncle  wont you give it to me  no  he will be wiser tomorrow if you are so good as to try him again said albinia who knew nothing did him more harm than creating a commotion by his caprices he is up too late and fractious with sleepiness  go to bed now my dear  i shall not be wiser tomorrow quoth the child marching out of the room in defiance  monkey whats the matter now exclaimed albinia i suppose you have all been spoiling him  but whats become of lucy  gilbert said she was at the dusautoys replied sophy but if you would but come to grandmamma  she found out that you were expected and she is in such a state that we have not known what to do  ill come only sophy dear please order tea and something to eat your uncle looks ravenous  she broke off as there advanced into the room a being like lucy but covered with streams and spatters of flowing sable tears like a heraldic decoration over face neck and dress  all unconscious she came with outstretched hands and words of welcome but an astonished cry of lucy met her and casting her eyes on her dress she screamed oh goodness its ink  where can you have been what have you been doing  idont knowoh it was the great inkstand and not the scentoh it is all over me  its in my hair shuddering  oh dear oh dear i shall never get it out and off she rushed followed by gilbert and was soon heard calling the maids to bring hot water to her room  what is all this asked mr kendal  i do not know mournfully answered sophy  albinia left the library and taking a candle went into the empty drawingroom  the moonlight shone white upon the table and showed the large cutglass inkbottle in a pool of its own contents and the sofacover had black spots and stains as if it had partaken of the libation  sophy saw and stood like a statue  you know nothing i am sure said albinia  nothing repeated sophy with a blank look of wretchedness  if you please maam said the nurse at the door could you be kind enough to come to mrs meadows she will be quieter when she has seen you  sophy dear we must leave it now said albinia  you must see to their tea they have had nothing since breakfast  she hastened to the sick room where she found mrs meadows in a painful state of agitation and excitement  the nurse said that until this evening she had been as usual but finding that mrs kendal was expected she had been very restless miss kendal was out and neither miss sophy nor mr gilbert could soothe her  she eagerly grasped the hand of albinia who bent down to kiss her and asked how she had been  oh my dear very unwell very  they should not leave me to myself so long my dear  i thought you would never come back and she began to cry and say no one cared for an old woman  albinia assured her that she was not going away and restrained her own eager and bewildered feelings to tranquillize her by prosing on in the lengthy manner which always soothed the poor old lady  it was a great penance in her anxiety to investigate the mysteries that seemed to swarm in the house but at last she was able to leave the bedside though not till she had been twice summoned to tea  sophy lividly pale was presiding with trembling hands gilbert flushed and nervous waiting on every one and trying to be lively and at ease but secret distress was equally traceable in each  she durst only ask after the children and heard that her little namesake had been as usual as good and sweet as child could be  and maurice  hes a famous fellow went on capitally said gilbert  yes till yesterday hoarsely gasped sophy sincerity wrenching out the protest by force  ah what has he been doing to the conservatory  he let the little marble dog down from the morningroom window with my netting silk it fell and made a great hole said sophy  what as a form of dawdling at his lessons  yes but he has not been at all tiresome about them except today and yesterday  and he has told the exact truth said mr kendal his gallant confession has earned the little cannon i promised him  i believe said albinia that it would be greater merit in maurice to learn forbearance than to speak truth and be praised for it  i have never seen his truth really tried  i value truth above all other qualities said mr kendal  so do i said albinia and it is my greatest joy in that little fellow but some time or other it must cost him something or it will not be tested  mr kendal did not like this and repeated that he must have his cannon  albinia fancied that she heard something like a groan from gilbert  when they broke up for the night she threw her arm round sophy as they went upstairs saying my poor dear you look half dead  have things been going very wrong  only these two days said sophy and i dont know that they have either  i am glad you are come  what kind of things said albinia following her into her room  dont ask at first began sophy but then frowning as if she could hardly speak she added i mean i dont know whether it is my own horrid way or that there is really an atmosphere of something i dont make out  didnt you tell me lucy was at the vicarage said albinia suddenly  gilbert said yes when i asked if she could be with the dusautoys said sophy when grandmamma wanted her and she did not come  mamma please dont think of what i said for very likely it is only that i am cross because of being left alone with grandmamma so long this evening and then maurice being slow at his lessons  you are not cross sophy you are worn out and perplexed and unhappy  oh not now you are come home and sophy laid her head on her shoulder and cried with relief and exhaustion  albinia caressed her saying  my trust my mainstay my poor sophy  there go to bed and sleep and dont think of it now  only first tell me one thing is that algernon at home  no said sophy vehemently certainly not  albinia breathed more freely  everybody said sophy collecting herself has gone on well gilbert and lucy have been as kind as could be and maurice very good but yesterday morning he went on in his foolish way at lessons and gilbert took him out riding before he had finished them  they came in very late and i think maurice must have been overtired for he was so idle this morning that i threatened to tell and put him in mind of the cannon papa promised him but somehow i must have managed badly for he only grew more defiant and ended by letting the marble dog out of window so that it went through the roof of the conservatory  yes of course it was your fault or the marble dogs said albinia smiling and stroking her fondly  ah we ought to have come home at the fixed time and not left you to their mercy but one could not hurry away from william when he was so much more sorry to leave us than we ever expected  oh mamma dont talk so  we were so glad  if only we could help being such a nuisance  albinia contrived to laugh and withdrew intending to make a visit of inquiry to lucy but she could not refuse herself the refreshment of a kiss to the little darling who could have no guile to hide no wrong to confess  she had never so much realized the value of the certainty of innocence as when she hung over the crib and thought that when those dark fringed lids were lifted the eyes would flash with delight at meeting her without one drawback  suddenly a loud roar burst from the little room next to gilberts in which maurice had lately been installed  she hurried swiftly in that direction but a passage and some steps lay between and gilbert had been beforehand with her  she heard the words i dont care  i dont care if it is manly  i will tell i cant bear this then as his brother seemed to be hushing him he burst out again i wouldnt have minded if papa wouldnt give me the cannon but he will and thats as bad as telling a lie  i cant sleep if you wont let me off my promise  trembling from head to foot her voice low and quivering with concentrated incredulous wrath albinia advanced  are you teaching my child falsehood she said and gilbert felt as if her look were worse to him than a thousand deaths  o mamma mamma  gilbert let me tell her cried the child and albinia throwing herself on her knees clasped him in her arms as though snatching him from the demon of deceit  tell all maurice said gilbert folding his arms it is to your credit if you would believe so  i shall be glad to have this misery ended any way  it was all for the sake of others  mamma maurice said in the midst of these mutterings of his unhappy brother i cant have the cannon without papa knowing it all  i couldnt shake hands with uncle maurice for telling the truth for i had not told it  and what is it my boy tell me now no one can hinder you  i scratched and fought himmr cavendish dusautoyi kicked down the decanter of wine  they told me it was manly not to tell and i promised  he was crying with the exceeding pain and distress of a child whose tears were rare and albinia rocked him in her arms  gilbert cautiously shut the door and said sadly maurice behaved nobly if he would only believe so  you would be proud of your son if you had seen him  they wanted to make him drink wine and he was fighting them off  and where were you gilbert you to whom i trusted him  i could not help it said gilbert then as her lip curled with contempt and her eye spoke disappointment he cast himself on the ground exclaiming oh if you knew how i have been mixed up with others and what i have gone through you would pity me  oh maurice dont cry when i would give worlds to be like you  why do you let him cry why dont you tell him what a brave noble boy he is  i dont know what to think or believe said albinia coldly but returning vehemently to her child she continued maurice my dear no one is angry with you  you at least i can depend on  tell me where you have been and what they have been doing to you  even with gilberts explanations she could hardly understand maurices narrative but she gathered that on thursday the brothers had ridden out and were about to turn homewards when archie tritton of whom to her vexation maurice spoke familiarly had told gilbert that a friend was waiting for him at the inn connected with the training stables three miles farther on  gilbert had demurred but was told the matter would brook no delay and yielded on being pressed  he tried to suppress the friends name but maurice had called him mr cavendish dusautoy  while gilbert was engaged with him tritton had introduced maurice to the horses and stable boys whose trade had inspired him with such emulation that he broke off in the midst of his confession to ask whether he could be a jockey and also a gentleman  all this had detained them till so late that they had been drawn into staying to dinner  maurice had gone on very happily secure that he was right in gilberts hands and only laying up a few curious words for explanation but when he was asked to drink wine he stoutly answered that mamma did not allow it  idle mischief prompted dusautoy and tritton to set themselves to overpower his resistance  gilberts feeble remonstrances were treated as a jest and algernon who could brook no opposition swore that he would conquer the little prig  maurice found himself pinioned by strong arms but determined and spirited he made a vigorous struggle and so judiciously aimed a furious kick that mr cavendish dusautoy staggered back stumbling against the table and causing a general overthrow  the victory was with maurice but warned as he had often been against using his natural weapons he thought himself guilty of a great crime  the others including alas gilbert strove to persuade him it was a joke and above all to bind him to silence for tritton and dusautoy would never have ventured so far could they have imagined the possibility of such terms as those on which he lived with his parents  they attacked the poor child on the score of his manly aspirations telling him it was babyish to tell mamma and sisters everything a practice fit for girls not for boys or men these assurances extracted a pledge of secrecy which was kept as long as his mother was absent and only rendered him reckless by the sense that he had forfeited the prize of good conduct but the sight of her renewed the instinct of confidence and his fathers reliance on his truth so acted on his sense of honour that he could not hold his peace  may i tell papa and will he let me have the cannon he finished  you shall certainly tell him my dear dear little boy and we will see what he says about the cannon she said fervently kissing him it will be some comfort for him to hear how you have behaved my precious little man  i thank god with all my heart that he has saved you from putting anything before truth  i little thought i was leaving you to a tempter  the child did not fully understand her  his was a very simple nature and he was tired out by conflicting emotions  his breast was relieved and his mother caressed him he cared for nothing more and drawing her hand so as to rest his cheek on it he looked up in her face with soft weary happiness in his eyes then let the lids sink over them and fell peacefully asleep while the others talked on at least you will do me the poor justice of believing it was not willingly said gilbert  i wish you would not talk to me she answered averting her face and speaking low as if to cut the heart i dont want to reproach you and i cant speak to you properly  if you would only hear me my only friend and helper  but it was all that was wanting  i have forfeited even your toleration  i wonder why i was born  he was taking up his light to depart but albinias fear of her own temper made her suspect that she had spoken vindictively and she said what can i do gilbert  here is this poor child whom i trusted to you who can never again be ignorant of the sound of evil words and only owes it to gods mercy on his brave spirit that this has not been the beginning of destruction  i feel as if you had been trying to snatch away his soul  and will you can you not credit said gilbert nearly inaudibly that i did not act by my free will  i had no notion that any such thing could befall him and would never have let them try to silence him but to shield others  others  yes archie tritton and algernon dusautoy  i know what your freewill is in their hands and yet i thought you cared for your brother enough to guard him if not yourself  if you knew the coercion muttered gilbert  i protest as i would to my dying day that i had no intention of going near the stables when i set out and would never have consented could i have helped it  and why could not you help it  gilbert gasped  tritton brought me a message from dusautoy insisting on my meeting him there  it was too late to take maurice home and i could not send him with archie  i expected only to exchange a few words at the door  it was tritton who took maurice away to the stables  i hear but i do not see the compulsion only the extraordinary weakness that leads you everywhere after those men  i must tell you i suppose groaned gilbert i can bear anything but this  theres a miserable money entanglement that lays me under a certain obligation to dusautoy  your father believed you had told him of all your debts she said in a tone of increased scorn and disappointment  i didi meanoh  mrs kendal believe me i intended to have told him the utmost farthingi thought i had done sobut this was a thingdusautoy had persuaded me into half consenting to have some wine with him from a cheating portuguesethen ordered more than ever i knew of and the man went and became bankrupt and sent in a great abominable bill that i no more owned nor had reason to expect than my horse  so you preferred intriguing with this man to applying openly to your father  it was no doing of mine  it was forced upon me and in fact the account was mixed up with his  it was the most evil hour of my life when i consented  ive not had a moments peace or happiness since and it was the promise of the bill receipted that led me to this place  and why was this place chosen for the meeting  you and mr cavendish dusautoy live only too near one another  he is not at the vicarage faltered gilbert  albinia suddenly grew pale with apprehension  gilbert she said there is only one thing that could make this business worse and as she saw his change of countenance she continued then it is so and lucy is his object  he did not speak but his face was that of a convicted traitor and fresh perceptions crowded on her as she exclaimed horror struck the ink  yes when you said she was with the dusautoys  i understand  he has been in hiding he has been here  and this expedition was to arrange a clandestine meeting between them under your fathers own roof  you conniving you who said you would sooner see your sister sold to legree  it is all true said gilbert moodily his elbows on the table and his face in his hands  and if the utmost misery for weeks past could be any atonement it would be mine  but at least i have done nothing willingly to bring them together  i have only gone on in the hope and trust that i was some protection to poor lucy  fine protection sighed albinia  and how has it been how does it stand  why they met at brighton i believe  she used to walk on the chain pier before breakfast and he met her there  if he chooses he can make any one do what he likes because he does not understand no for an answer  then when she came home he used to meet her on the bridge when you sent her out for a turn in the evening and sometimes she would make me take her out walking to meet him  dont you see how utterly miserable it was for me when they had volunteered this help all out of kindness it was impossible for me to speak to you  albinia made a sound of contempt and said go on  that time when you and mr hope saw them lucy was frightened and they had a quarrel he went away and i hoped and trusted it had died out  i heard no more till yesterday when i was dragged into giving him this meeting  it seems that he had only just discovered your absence and wanted to take the opportunity of seeing her  i was in hopes you would have come back i assured him you would but he chose to watch till evening and then lucy was to meet him in the conservatory  poor lucy you must not be very angry with her for she was much averse to it and i enclosed a letter from her to forbid him to come  i thought all was safe till i actually heard their voices and grandmamma got into an agitation and sophy was running about wild to find lucy  when you came home papas opening the door frightened lucy and it seems that dusautoy thought that she was going to faint and scream and laid hold of the ink instead of the eaudecologne  there  i believe the ink would have betrayed it without me  now you have heard everything mrs kendal and can believe there is not a more wretched and miserable creature breathing than i am  albinia slowly rose and put her hand to her brow as though confused with the tissue of deceit and double dealing  oh  mrs kendal will you not speak to me  i solemnly declare that i have told you all  i am thinking of your father  with a gesture of acquiescent anguish and despair he let her pass held open the door and closed it softly so as not to awaken the happy sleeper  good night she said coldly and turned away but his mournful resigned good night was so utterly broken down that her heart was touched and turning she said good night gilbert i am sorry for you i believe it is weakness and not wickedness  she held out her hand but instead of being shaken it was pressed to his lips and the fingers were wet with his tears  feeling as though the bad dreams of a night had taken shape and life albinia stood by the fire in her sittingroom the next morning trying to rally her judgment and equally dreading the sight of those who had caused her grief and of those who would share the shock she had last night experienced  the first knock announced one whom she did not expectgilbert wretchedly pale from a sleepless night and his voice scarcely audible  i beg your pardon he said but i thought i might have led you to be hard on lucy i do believe it was against her will  before she could answer the door flew wide and in rushed maurice shouting good morning mamma and at his voice mr kendals dressingroom door was pushed back and he called here maurice  as the boy ran forward he was met and lifted to his fathers breast while with a fervency he little understood though he never forgot it the words were uttered  god bless you maurice and give you grace to go on to withstand temptation and speak the truth from your heart  maurice was impressed for a moment then he recurred to his leading thought  may i have the cannon papa  i did kicki broke the bottle but may i have the cannon  maurice you are too young to understand the value of your resistance  listen to me my boy for you must never forget this you have been taken among persons who i trust will never be your companions  oh interrupted maurice must i never be a jockey  no maurice  horses are perverted to bad purposes by thoughtless men and you must keep aloof from such  you were not to blame for you refused to do what you knew to be wrong and did not know it was an improper place for you  gilbert took me said maurice puzzled at the gravity which convinced him that some one was in fault and of course it must be himself  gilbert did very wrong said mr kendal and henceforth you must learn that you must trust to your own conscience and no longer believe that all your brother tells you is right  maurice gazed in inquiry and perceiving his brothers downcast air ran to his mother crying is papa angry  yes said gilbert willing to spare her the pain of a reply he is justly angry with me for having exposed you to temptation  oh maurice if i had been made such as you it would have been better for us all  it was the first perception that a grown person could do wrong and that person his dear gilbert  as if the grave countenances were insupportable he gave a longdrawn breath hid his face on his mothers knee and burst into an agony of weeping  he was lifted on her lap in a moment father and mother both comforting him with assurances that he was a very good boy and that papa was much pleased with him mr kendal even putting the cannon into his hand as a tangible evidence of favour but the child thrust aside the toy and sliding down took hold of his brothers languid dejected hand and cried with a sob and stamp of his foot  you shant say you are naughty i wont let you  alas it was a vain repulsion of the truth that this is a wicked world  gilbert only put him back saying  you had better go away from me maurice you cannot understand what i have done  pray heaven yon may never know what i feel  maurice did but cling the tighter and though mr kendal had not yet addressed the culprit he respected the force of that innocent love too much to interfere  the bell rang and they went down maurice still holding by his brother and when his uncle met them it was touching to see the generous little fellow hanging back and not giving his own hand till he had seen gilbert receive the ordinary greeting  though mr ferrars had been told nothing he could not but be aware of the symptoms of a family crisisthe gravity of some and the pale jaded looks of others  lucy was not one of these she came down with little albinia in her arms and began to talk rather airily excusing herself for not having come down in the evening because that horrid ink had got into her hair and tittering a little over the absurdity of her having picked up the inkstand in the dark  not a word of response did she meet and her gaiety died away in vague alarm  sophy the most innocent looked wretched and maurice absolutely began to cry again at the failure of some manoeuvre to make his father speak to gilbert  his tears broke up the breakfastparty  his mother led him away to reason with him that sad as it was it was better that people should be grieved when they had transgressed as the only hope of their forgiveness and improvement  maurice wanted her to reverse the declaration that gilbert had done wrong but alas this could not be and she was obliged to send him out with his little sister hoping that he would work off his grief by exercise  it was mournful to see the first shadow of the penalty of sin falling on the eden of his childhood  with an aching heart she went in search of lucy who had taken sanctuary in mrs meadowss room and was not easily withdrawn from thence to a teteatete  fearful of falsehood albinia began by telling her she knew all and how little she had expected such a requital of trust  lucy exclaimed that it had not been her fault she had always wanted to tell and gradually albinia drew from her the whole avowal half shamefaced half exultant  she had never dreamt of meeting algernon at brightonit was quite by chance that she came upon him at the officers ball when he was staying with captain greenaway  he asked her to dance and she had said yes all on a sudden without thinking and then she fancied he would go away she begged him not to come again but whenever she went out on the chainpier before breakfast there he was  why did she go thither  she hung her head  mrs annesley had desired her to walk she could not help it she was afraid to write and tell what was going onbesides he would come though she told him she would not see him and she could not bear to make him unhappy  then when she came home she had been in hopes it was all over but she had been very unhappy and had been on the point of telling all about it many times when mamma looked at her kindly but then he came to the vicarage and he would wait for her at the bridge and write notes to her and she could not stop it but she had always told him it was no use she never would be engaged to him without papas consent  she had only promised that she would not marry any one else only because he was so very desperate and she was afraid to break it off entirely lest he should go and marry the principessa bianca a foreigner and papist which would be so shocking for him and his uncle  gilbert could testify how grieved she was to have any secrets from mamma but mr cavendish dusautoy was so dreadful when she talked of telling that she did not know what would happen  when he went away and she thought it was all overmamma might recollect how hard it was for her to keep up and what a force she put upon herselfbut she would rather have pined to death than have said one word to bring him back and was quite shocked when gilbert gave her his note to beg her to let him see her that evening before the party returned she said with all her might that he must not come and when he did she was begging him all the time to go away and she was so dreadfully frightened when they actually came that she had all but gone into hysterics or fainted away and that was the way he came to throw the ink at hershe was so very much shocked and so would he beand really she felt the misfortune to the beautiful new sofacover as a most serious calamity and aggravation of her offence  it was not easy to know how to answer albinia was scornful of the sofacover and yet it was hard to lay hold of a tangible subject on which to show lucy her error except in the concealment which by her own showing she had lamented the whole time  she had always said no but unluckily her noes were of the kind that might easily be made to mean yes and she evidently had been led on partly by her own heart partly by the force of the stronger will though her better principles had filled her with scruples and misgivings at every stage  she had been often on the point of telling all and asking forgiveness and here it painfully crossed albinia that if she herself had been less hurried and less disposed to take everything for granted a little tenderness might have led to a voluntary confession  still lucy defended herself by the compulsion exercised on her and she would hear none of the conclusions albinia drew therefrom she would not see that the man who drove her to a course of disobedience and subterfuge could be no fit guide and fired up at a word of censure declaring that she knew that mamma had always hated him and that now he was absent she would not hear him blamed  the one drop of true love made her difficult to deal with for the heart was really made over to the tyrant and albinia did not feel herself sufficiently guiltless of negligence and imprudence to rebuke her with a comfortable conscience  mr kendal had been obliged to attend to some justice business better for him perhaps than acting as domestic magistrateand meanwhile the vicar of fairmead found himself forgotten  he wanted to be at home yet did not like to leave his sister in unexplained trouble though not sure whether he might not be better absent  time passed on he finished the newspaper and wrote letters and then seeing no one he had gone into the hall to send for a conveyance when gilbert coming in from the militia parade became the recipient of his farewells but apparently with so little comprehension that he broke off struck by the dejected countenance and wandering eye  i beg your pardon gilbert said passing his hand over his brow i did not hear  i was only asking you to tell my sister that i would not disturb her and leaving my goodbyes with you  you are not going  thank you i think my wife will grow anxious  i had hopedgilbert sighed and pausedi had thought that perhaps  the wretchedness of his tone drove away mr ferrarss purpose of immediate departure and returning to the drawingroom he said if there were any way in which i could be of use  then you do not know said gilbert veiling his face with his hand as he leant on the mantelshelf  i know nothing  i could only see that something was amiss  i was wishing to know whether my presence or absence would be best for you all  oh dont go cried gilbert  nobody must go who can be any comfort to mrs kendal  a few kind words drew forth the whole piteous history that lay so heavily on his heart  reserves were all over now and irregularly and incoherently he laid open his griefs and errors his gradual absorption into the society with which he had once broken and the inextricable complication of mischief in which he had been involved by his debt  yet he said all the time i longed from my heart to do well  it was the very thing that led me into this scrape  i thought if the man applied to my father as he threatened that i should be suspected of having concealed this on purpose and be sent to india and i was so happy and thought myself so safe here  i did believe that home and mrs kendal would have sheltered me but my destiny must needs hunt me out here and alienate even her  the way to find the devil behind the cross is to cower beneath it in weak idolatry instead of grasping it in courageous faith said mr ferrars  such faith would have made you trust yourself implicitly to your father  then you would either have gone forth in humble acceptance of the punishment or else have stayed at home free pardoned and guarded but as it was no wonder temptation followed you and you had no force to resist it  and so all is lost  even dear little maurice can never be trusted to me again  and his mother who would if she could be still merciful and pitying as an angel she cannot forget to what i exposed him  she will never be the same to me again  yet i could lay down my life for any of them  mr ferrars watched the drooping figure crouching on his chairs elbows on knees head bowed on the supporting hands and face hidden and listening to the meek affectionate hopelessness of the tone he understood the fond love and compassion that had often surprised him in his sister but he longed to read whether this were penitence towards god or remorse towards man  miserable indeed gilbert he said but if all were irretrievably offended there still is one who can abundantly pardon where repentance is true  i thoughtcried gilberti thought it had been true before  if pain and shame and abhorrence could so render it i know it was when i came home  and then it was comparative happiness i thought i was forgiven i found joy and peace where they are promisedthe burning tears dropped between his fingersbut it was all delusion not prayers nor sacraments can shield mei am doomed and all i ask is to be out of the way of ruining maurice  this is mere despair said mr ferrars  i cannot but believe your contrition was sincere but steadfast courage was what you needed and you failed in the one trial that may have been sent you to strengthen and prove you  the effects have been terrible but there is every hope that you may retrieve your error and win back the sense of forgiveness  if i could dare to hope sobut i cannot presume to take home to myself those assurances when i know that i only resolve that i may have resolutions to break  have you ever laid all this personally before mr dusautoy  no i have thought of it but mixed up as this is with his nephew and my sister it is impossible  but you are a clergyman mr ferrars he added eagerly  mr ferrars thought and then said  if you wish it gilbert i will gladly do what i can for you  i believe that i may rightly do so  his face gleamed for a moment with the light of grateful gladness as if at the first ray of comfort and then he said i am sure none was ever more grieved and wearied with the burden of sinif that be all  i think said mr ferrars that it might be better to give time to collect yourself examine the past separate the sorrow for the sin from the disgrace of the consequences and then look earnestly at the sole ground of hope  how would it be to come for a couple of nights to fairmead at the end of next week  gilbert gratefully caught at the invitation and mr ferrars gave him some advice as to his reading and selfdiscipline speaking to him as gently and tenderly as albinia herself  both lingered in case the other should have more to say but at last gilbert stood up saying  i would thankfully go to calcutta now but the situation is filled up and my father said john kendal had been enough trifled with  if i saw any fresh opening where i should be safe from hurting maurice  there is no reason you and your brother should not be a blessing to each other  yes there is  till i lived at home i did not know how impossible it is to keep clear of old acquaintance  they are goodnatured fellowsthat tritton and the likeand after all that has come and gone one would be a brute to cut them entirely and maurice is always after me and has been more about with them than his mother knows  even if i were very different i should be a link and though it might be no great harm if maurice were a tame mammas boyyou see being the fellow he is up to anything for a lark and frantic about horsesi could never keep him from them  theres no such great harm in themselveshearty goodnatured fellows they arebut theres a worse lot that they meet and maurice will go all lengths whenever he begins  now so little as he is now if i were once gone he would never run into their way and they would never get a hold of him  mr ferrars had unconsciously screwed up his face with dismay but he relaxed it and spoke kindly  you are right  it was a mistake to stay at home  perhaps your regiment may be stationed elsewhere  i dont know how long it may be called out  if it were but possible to make a fresh beginning  did you hear of my brothers suggestion  i wishbut it is useless to talk about that  i could not presume to ask my father for a commissionheaven knows when i shall dare to speak to him  you have not personally asked his pardon after full confession  nomrs kendal knows all  did you ever do such a thing in your life  you dont know what my father is  neither do you gilbert  let that be the first token of sincerity  without leaving space for another word mr ferrars went through the conservatory into the garden where meeting the children he took the little one in his arms and sent maurice to fetch his mamma albinia came down looking so much heated and harassed that he was grieved to leave her  oh maurice i am sorry  you always come in for some catastrophe she said trying to smile  you have had a most forlorn morning  gilbert has been with me he said  he has told me all my dear and i think it hopeful i like him better than i ever did before  poor feather the breath of your lips has blown him the other way said albinia too unhappy for consolation  well it seems to me that you have done more for him than i ever quite believed  i did not expect such sound genuine religious feeling  he always had plenty of religious sentiment said albinia sadly  i have asked him to come to us next week  will you tell edmund so  yes  he will be thankful to you for taking him in hand  poor boy i know how attractive his penitence is but i have quite left off building on it  mr ferrars defended him no longer  he could not help being much moved by the youths selfabasement but that might be only because it was new to him and he did not even try to recommend him to her mercy he knew her own heart might be trusted to relent and it would not hurt gilbert in the end to be made to feel the full weight of his offence  i must go he said though i am sorry to leave you in perplexity i am afraid i can do nothing for you  nothingbut feel kindly to gilbert said albinia  i cant do so yet  i dont feel as if i ever could again when i think what he was doing with maurice  yes and how easily he could have brought poor lucy to her senses if he had been good for anything  oh maurice this is sickening work  you should be grateful to me for not scolding you for having taken me from home  i do not repent said her brother  the explosion is better than the subterranean mining  it may be said albinia and i need not boast of the good i did at home  my poor poor lucy  a little discreet kindness and watchfulness on my part would have made all the difference  it was all my running my own way with my eyes shut but then i had always lived with trustworthy people  well i wont keep you listening to my maundering when winifred wants you  oh why did that polysyllable ever come near the place  mr ferrars said the kindest and most cheering things he could devise and drove away not much afraid of her being unforgiving  he was disposed to stake all his hopes of the young man on the issue of his advice to make a direct avowal to his father  and gilbert made the effort though rather in desperation than resolution knowing that his condition could not be worse and seeing no hope save in mr ferrars counsel  he was the first to seek mr kendal and dreadful to him as was the unaltering melancholy displeasure of the fixed look the steadily penetrating deep dark eyes and the subdued sternness of the voice he made his confession fully without reserve or palliation  it was more than mr kendal had expected and more perhaps than he absolutely trusted for gilbert had not hitherto inspired faith in his protestations that he spoke the whole truth and nothing but the truth nor had he always the power of doing so when overpowered by fright  the manner in which his father laid hold of any inadvertent discrepancy treating it as a wilful prevarication was terror and agony and well as he knew it to be the meed of past equivocation he felt it cruel to torture him by implied suspicion  yet how could it be otherwise when he had been introducing his little brother to his own corrupters and conniving at his sisters clandestine correspondence with a man whom he knew to be worthless  the grave words that he obtained at last scarcely amounted to pardon they implied that he had done irreparable mischief and acted disgracefully and such forgiveness as was granted was only made conditional on there being no farther reserves  alas even with all tender love and compassion no earthly parent can forgive as does the heavenly father  none but the omniscient can test the fulness of the confession nor the sincerity of father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son  this interview only sent the son away more crushed and overwhelmed and yearning towards the more deeply offended and yet more compassionate father  mr kendal after this interview so far relaxed his displeasure as to occasionally address gilbert when they met at luncheon after this deplorable morning while towards lucy he observed a complete silence  it was not at first that she perceived this and even then it struck more deeply on sophia than it did on her  mr kendal shrank from inflicting pain on the good vicar and it was decided that the wives should be the channel through which the information should be imparted  albinia took the children sending them to play in the garden while she talked to mrs dusautoy  she found that keen little lady had some shrewd suspicions but had discovered nothing defined enough to act upon and was relieved to have the matter opened at last  as to the ink no mortal could help laughing over it even albinia who had been feeling as if she could never laugh again was suddenly struck by the absurdity and gave way to a paroxysm of merriment  properly managed i do think it might put an end to the whole affair said mrs dusautoy  he could not stand being laughed at  im afraid he never will believe that he can be laughed at  yes that is unlucky said mrs dusautoy gravely but recollecting that she was not complimentary she added you must not think we undervalue lucy  john is very fond of her and the only objection is that it would require a person of more age and weight to deal with algernon  never mind speeches sighed albinia we know too well that nothing could be worse for either  cant you give him a tutor and send him to travel  ill talk to john but unluckily he is of age next month and theres an end of our power  and john would never keep him away from hence for he thinks it his only chance  i suppose we must do something with lucy  heighho  people used not to be always falling in love in my time except fred and that was in a rational way that could be got rid of  the effect of the intelligence on the vicar was to make him set out at once to the liverystables in quest of his nephew but he found that the young gentleman had that morning started for london whither he proposed to follow him on the monday  lucy cried incessantly in the fear that the gentlehearted vicar might have some truculent intentions towards his nephew and was so languid and unhappy that no one had the heart to scold her and comforting her was still more impossible  mr kendal used to stride away from the sight of her swollen eyes and ask albinia why she did not tell her that the only good thing that could happen to her would be that she should never see nor hear of the fellow again  why he did not tell her so himself was a different question     chapter xxiv    well albinia said mr kendal after seeing mr dusautoy on his return from london  there was such a look of deprecation about him that she exclaimed one would really think you had been accepting this charming soninlaw  suppose i had he said rather quaintly then as he saw her hands held up conditionally you understand entirely conditionally what could i do when dusautoy entreated me with tears in his eyes not to deprive him of the only chance of saving his nephew  umph was the most innocent sound albinia could persuade herself to make  besides continued mr kendal it will be better to have the affair open and avowed than to have all this secret plotting going on without being able to prevent it  i can always withhold my consent if he should not improve and dusautoy declares nothing would be such an incentive  may it prove so  you see he pursued as his uncle says nothing can be worse than driving him to these resorts and when he is once of age theres an end of all power over him to hinder his running straight to ruin now when he is living at the vicarage we shall have far more opportunity of knowing how he is going on and putting a check on their intercourse if he be unsatisfactory  if we can  after all the young man has done nothing that need blight his future life  he has had great disadvantages and his steady attachment is much in his favour  his uncle tells me he promises to become all that we could wish and in that case i do not see that i have the right to refuse the offer when things have gone so far conditionally of course  he dwelt on that saving clause like a salve for his misgivings  and what is to become of gilbert and maurice with him always about the house exclaimed albinia  we will take care he is not too much here  he will soon be at oxford  indeed my dear i am sorry you disapprove  i should have been as glad to avoid the connexion as you could be but i do not think i had any alternative when mr dusautoy pressed me so warmly and only asked that he should be taken on probation and besides when poor lucys affections are so decidedly involved  albinia perceived that there had been temper in her tone and could object no further since it was too late and as she could not believe that her husband had been weak she endeavoured to acquiesce in his reasoning and it was a strong argument that they should see lucy bright again  i suppose he said that you would prefer that i should announce my decision to her myself  it was a more welcome task than spreading gloom over her countenance but she entered in great trepidation prepared to sink under some stern mandate and there was nothing at first to undeceive her for her father was resolved to atone for his concession by sparing her no preliminary thunders and began by depicting her indiscretion and deceit as well as the folly of attaching herself to a man without other recommendations than figure and fortune  how much lucy heard was uncertain she leant on a chair with drooping head and averted face trembling and suppressing a sob apparently too much frightened to attend  just when the exordium was over and therefore i lay my commands on you might have been expected it turned into however upon mr dusautoys kind representation i have resolved to give the young man a trial and provided he convinces me by his conduct that i may safely entrust your happiness to him i have told his uncle that i will not withhold my sanction  with a shriek of irrepressible feeling lucy looked from father to mother and clasped her hands unable to trust her ears  yes lucy said albinia your father consents on condition that nothing further happens to excite his doubts of mr cavendish dusautoy  it rests with yourself now it is not too late  after all that has passed you would incur much deserved censure if you put an end to the affair but even that would be better far better than entering into an engagement with a man without sound principle  your mother is quite right lucy said mr kendal  this is the only time  gratified vanity has led you too far and you have acted as i hoped no child of mine would ever act but you have not forfeited our tenderest care  you are not engaged to this man and no word of yours would be broken  if you hesitate to commit yourself to him you have only to speak and we would gladly at once do everything that could conduce to make you happy  you dont want me to give him up cried lucy  oh mamma did not he say he had consented  i said it rested with yourself lucy  do not answer me now  come to me at six oclock and tell me after full reflection whether i am to consider you as ready to pledge yourself to this young man  it was all that could be done  albinia had a dim hope that the sense of responsibility and dread of that hard will and selfish temper might so rise upon lucy as to startle her but then as mr kendal observed if she should decide against him she would have used him so extremely ill that they should feel nothing but shame  yes said albinia but it would be better to be ashamed of a girls folly than to see her made miserable for life  poor lucy if she decide against him she will become a woman at once if not im afraid it will be the prediction about marie antoinette over again very gay and coming right through trial  they were obliged to tell sophy of the state of things  she stood up straight and said slowly and clearly i do not like the world at all  i dont quite see what you mean  every one does what cant be helped and it is not the thing  explain yourself sophy said her father amused  i dont think lucy ought to be making the decision at all said sophy  she did that long ago when first she attended to what he said to her  if she does not take him now it will be swearing to her neighbour and disappointing him because it is to her own hindrance  yes sophy but i believe it is better to incur the sin of breaking a promise than to go on when the fulfilment involves not only suffering but mischief  lucy has repeatedly declared there was no engagement  i know it could not be helped but mr dusautoy ought not to have asked papa  nor papa to have consented my suleiman ben daood said mr kendal ah sophy we all have very clear straightforward views at eighteen of what other people ought to do  papai never meanti did not think i was saying anything wrong i only said i did not like the world  and i heartily agree with you sophy and if i had lived in it as short a time as you have perhaps considerations would not affect my judgment  i am always telling sophy she will be more merciful as she grows older said albinia  if it were only being more merciful it would be very well said mr kendal but one also becomes less thoroughgoing because practice is more painful than theory and one remembers consequences that have made themselves felt  it is just as well that there should be young people to put us in mind what our flights once were  albinia and sophy left lucy to herself they both wished to avoid the useless what shall i do and they thought that driven back on her own resources even her own mind might give her better counsel than the seven watchmen aloft in a high tower  she came down looking exceedingly pale mr kendal regarded her anxiously and held his hand out to her kindly  papa she said simply i cant give it up  i do love him  very well my dear he answered there is no more to be said than that i trust he will merit your affection and make you happy  good mr dusautoy was as happy as a king he took lucy in his arms and kissed her as if she had been his child and with her hands folded in his own he told her how she was to teach his dear algernon to be everything that was good and to lead him right by her influence  she answered with caresses and promises and whoever had watched her eye would have seen it in a happy daydream of algernons perfection and his uncle thanking her for it  she had expected that grandmamma would have been very happy but marriage had with the poor old lady led to so much separation that her weakened faculties took the alarm and she received the tidings by crying bitterly and declaring that every one was going away and leaving her  lucy assured her over and over again that she was never going to desert her and as mr kendal had made it a condition that algernon should finish his oxford career respectably there was little chance that poor mrs meadows would survive until the marriage  all along gilbert made no remark  though he had been left out of the family conclaves and his opinion not asked he submitted with the utmost meekness as one who knew that he had forfeited all right to be treated as son and heir  the more he was concerned at the engagement the greater stigma he would place on his own connivance so he said nothing and only devoted himself to his grandmother as though the attendance upon her were a refuge and relief  more gentle and patient than ever he soothed her fretfulness invented pleasures for her and rendered her so placid and contented that her health began to improve  not for a moment did he seem to forget his error and albinias resolution to separate maurice from him could not hold when he himself silently assumed the mournful necessity and put the child from him when clamorous for rides till there was an appeal to papa and mamma  mr kendal gave one look of inquiry at albinia and she began some matterofcourse about gilbert being so kindwhereupon the brothers were together as before  when albinia visited her little boy at night she found that gilbert had been talking to him of his eldest brother and she heard more of edmunds habits and tastes from the little fellow who had never seen him than from either the twinbrother or the sister who had loved him so devotedly it was as if gilbert knew that he could be doing maurice no harm when leading him to think of edmund and perhaps he felt some intrinsic resemblance in the deep loving strength of the two natures  the invitation to fairmead spared him the pain and shame of algernon dusautoys first reception as lucys accepted lover  he went early on saturday morning and young dusautoy arriving in the evening was first ushered into the library while albinia did her best to soothe the excited nerves and fluttering spirits of lucy who was exceedingly ashamed to meet him again under the eyes of others after such a course of stolen interviews and what she had been told of her influence doing him good only alarmed her the more  well she might for if ever character resembled that of the iron pot borne down the stream in company with the earthen one it was the object of her choice  poor pipkin that gilbert was the contact had cost him a smashing blow and for all clay of the more fragile mould the best hope was to give the invulnerable material a wide berth talk of influence  mr dusautoy might as well hope that a wedgwood creamjug would guide a copper cauldron and keep verdigris aloof  his attraction for lucy had always been a mystery to her family who perhaps hardly did justice to the magnetism of mere force of purpose better training might have ennobled into resolution that which was now doggedness and obstinacy and even in that shape the real element of strength had a tendency to work upon softer natures  thus it had acted in different ways with the vicar with gilbert and with lucy each had fallen under the power of his determination with more or less of their own consent and with lucy the surrender was complete she no sooner sat beside algernon than she was completely his possession and his complacent selfsatisfaction was reflected on her face in a manner that told her parents that she was their own no longer but given up to a stronger master  albinia liked neither to see nor to think about it and kept aloof as much as she could dividing herself between grandmamma and the children  on tuesday morning during maurices lessons there was a knock at the sittingroom door  she expected gilbert but was delighted to see her brother  i thought you were much too busy to come near us  so i am i cant stay so if kendal be not forthcoming you must give this fellow a holiday  he is gone to hadminster so  wheres gilbert broke in little maurice  he went to his room to dress to go up to parade said mr ferrars and off rushed the boy without waiting for permission  albinia sighed and said it is a perfect passion  dont mourn over it  love is too good a thing to be lamented over and this may turn into a blessing  i used to be proud of it  so you shall be still  i am very much pleased with that poor lad  she would not raise her eyes she was weary of hoping for gilbert and his last offence had touched her where she had never been touched before  whatever faults he has mr ferrars said i am much mistaken if his humility love and contrition be not genuine and what more can the best have  sincerity said albinia hopelessly  theres no truth in him  you should discriminate between deliberate selfinterested deception and failure in truth for want of moral courage  both are bad enough but the latter is not loving a lie not such a ruinous taint and evidence of corruption as the former  it is curious to hear you repeating my old excuses for him said albinia now that he has cast his glamour over you  not wrongly said her brother  he is in earnest there is no acting about him  yes that i believe i know he loves us with all his heart poor boy especially maurice and me and i think he had rather go right than wrong if he could only be let alone  but oh it is all unstable as water  am i unkind maurice  i know how it would be if i let him talk to me for ten minutes or look at me with those pleading brown eyes of his  mr ferrars knew it well and why she was steeled against him but he put this aside saying that he was come to speak of the future not of the past and that he wanted edmund to reconsider williams advice  he told her what gilbert had said of the difficulty of breaking off old connexions and the danger to maurice from his acquaintance  an exchange into another corps of militia might be for the worse the occupation was uncertain and mr ferrars believed that a higher position companions of a better stamp and the protection of a man of lively manners quick sympathy and sound principle like their cousin fred might be the opening of a new life  he had found gilbert most desirous of such a step regarding it as his only hope but thinking it so offensively presumptuous to propose it to his father under present circumstances his oxford terms thrown away and himself disgraced both there and at home that the matter would hardly have been brought forward had not mr ferrars undertaken to press it under the strong conviction that remaining at home would be destruction above all with young dusautoy making part of the family  i declare said mr ferrars he looked so much at home in the drawingroom and welcomed gilbert with such an air of patronage that i could have found it in my heart to have knocked him down  it was a treat to hear maurice speak so unguardedly and albinia laughed and asked whether he thought it very wrong to hope that the polysyllable would yet do something flagrant enough to open lucys eyes  ill allow you to hope that if he should her eyes may be opened said maurice  albinia began a vehement vindication for their having tolerated the engagement in the midst of which her brother was obliged to depart amused at her betrayal of her own sentiments by warfare against what he had never said  she had treated his counsel as chimerical but when she repeated it to her husband she thought better of it since alas it had become her great object to part those two loving brothers  mr kendal first asked where the 25th lancers were then spoke of expense and inquired what she knew of the cost of commissions and of her cousins means  all she could answer for was that freds portion was much smaller than gilberts inheritance but at least she knew how to learn what was wanted and if her friends the old generals were to be trusted she ought to have no lack of interest at the horse guards  gilbert was taken into counsel and showed so much right spirit and good sense that the discussion was friendly and unreserved  it ended in the father and son resorting to pettiloves office to ascertain the amount of ready money in his hands and what income gilbert would receive on coming of age  the investigation somewhat disappointed the youth who had never thoroughly credited what his father told him of the necessity of his exerting himself for his own maintenance nor understood how heavy a drain on his property were the lifeinterests of his father and grandmother and the settlement on his aunt  byandby he might be comparatively a rich man but at first his present allowance would be little more than doubled and the receipts would be considerably diminished by an alteration of existing system of rents such as had so long been planned  it was plain that the almshouses were the unsubstantial fabric of a dream but no one now dared to refer to them and mr kendal desired albinia to write to consult her cousin  captain ferrars was so much flattered at her asking his protection for anything that he would have promised to patronize cousin slender himself for her sake  he praised the colonel and lauded the mess to the skies and economy being his present hobby he represented himself as living upon nothing and saving his pay  he further gave notice of impending retirements and advised that the application should be made without loss of time lamenting grievously himself that there was no chance for the 25th of a touch at the russians  something in his letter put every one into a hurry and a correspondence began which resulted in gilberts being summoned to sandhurst for an examination which he passed creditably  the purchasemoney was deposited and the household was daily thrown into a state of excitement by the arrival of officiallooking envelopes which turned out to contain solicitations from tailors and outfitters bordered with portraits of campbeds and portable baths until at last when the real document appeared gilbert tossed it aside as from another tailor but albinia knew the article too well to mistake it and when the long blue cover was opened it proved to convey more than they had reckoned upon  gilbert kendal held a commission in the 25th lancers and the corps was under immediate orders for the east  the number of officers being deficient he was to join the headquarters at cork without going to the depot and would thence sail with a stated minimum of baggage  albinia could not look up  she knew her husband had not intended thus to risk the last of his eldestborn sons and though her soldierspirit might have swelled with exultation had her own brave boy been concerned she dreaded the sight of quailing or dismay in gilbert  going really to fight the russians shouted maurice as the meaning reached him  oh gibbie if i was but a man to go with you  you will do your duty my boy said his father  by gods help was the reverent answer which emboldened albinia to look up at him as he stood with maurice clinging by both hands to him  she had done him injustice and her heart bounded at the sight of the flush on his cheek the light in his eyes and the expression on his lips making his face finer and more manly than she had ever seen it as if the grave necessity and the awe of the unseen glorious danger were fixing and elevating his wandering purpose  to have no choice was a blessing to an infirm will and to be inevitably out of his own power braced him and gave him rest  she held out her hand to him and there was a grasp of inexpressible feeling the first renewal of their old terms of sympathy and confidence  there was no time to be lost mr kendal would go to london with him by the last train that day to fit him out as speedily as possible before he started for cork  every one felt dizzy and there was no space for aught but action perhaps albinia was glad of the hurry she could not talk to gilbert till she had learnt to put faith in him and she would rather do him substantial kindnesses than be made the sharer of feelings that had too often proved like the growth of the seed which found no depth of earth  she ran about for him worked for him contrived for him and gave him directions she could not or would not perceive his yearning for an effusion of penitent tenderness  he looked wistfully at her when he was setting out to take leave at the vicarage but she had absorbed herself in flannel shirts and would not meet his eye nor did he venture to make the request that she would come with him  indeed confidences there could be but few for maurice and albinia hung on either side of him so that he could hardly move but he resisted all attempt to free him even from the little girl who was hardly out of his arms for ten minutes together  it was only from her broken words that her mother understood that from the vicarage he had gone to the church  poor little albinia did not like it at all why was brother edmund up in the church and why did gilbert cry  maurice angrily enunciated men never cry but not a word of the visit to the church came from him  algernon dusautoy had wisely absented himself and the two sisters devoted themselves to the tasks in hand  sophy worked as hard as did mrs kendal and spoke even less and lucy took care of mrs meadows whose nerves were painfully excited by the bustle in the house  it had been agreed that she should not hear of her grandsons intention till the last moment and then he went in putting on a cheerful manner to bid her goodbye only disclosing that he was going to london but little as she could understand there was an instinct about her that could not be deceived and she began to cry helplessly and violently  mrs kendal and lucy were summoned in haste gilbert lingered trying to help them to restore her to composure  but time ran short his father called him and they hardly knew that they had received his last hurried embrace nor that he was really gone till they heard maurice shouting like a red indian as he careered about in the garden his only resource against tears and sophy came in very still very pale and incapable of uttering a word or shedding a tear  albinia was much concerned for she could not bear to have sent him away without a more real adieu and word of blessing and good augury it made her feel herself truly unforgiving and perhaps turned her heart back to him more fully and fondly than any exchange of sentiment would have done  but she had not much time to dwell on this omission for poor mrs meadows missed him sorely and after two days constant fretting after him another paralytic stroke renewed the immediate danger so that by the time mr kendal returned from london she was again hovering between life and death  mr kendal to his great joy met frederick ferrars at the family office  the changes in the regiment had given him his majority and he had flashed over from ireland to make his preparations for the campaign  his counsel had been most valuable in gilberts equipment especially in the knotty question of horses and he had shown himself so amiable and rational that mr kendal was quite delighted and rejoiced in committing gilbert to his care  he had assumed the trust in a paternal manner and infected by his brilliant happiness and hopefulness gilbert had gone off to ireland in excellent spirits  another thing conduced to cheer him said mr kendal afterwards to his wife with a tone that caused her to exclaim you dont mean that he saw genevieve  you are right  we came upon her in rivingtons shop while we were looking for the smallest bible  i saw who it was chiefly by his change of colour and i confess i kept out of the way  the whole did not last five minutes she had her pupils with her and soon went away but he thanked me and took heart from that moment  poor boy who would have thought the impression would have been so lasting  well by the time he is a fieldofficer even william will let him please himself said albinia lightly because her heart was too full for her to speak seriously  she tried by a kind letter to atone for the omitted farewell and it seemed to cheer and delight gilbert  he wrote from cork as if he had imbibed fresh hope and enterprise from his new companions he liked them all and could not say enough of the kindness of major ferrars  everything went smoothly and in the happiest frame he sailed from cork and was heard of again at malta and gallipoli direfully seasick but reviving to write most amusing long descriptive letters and when he reached the camp at yarna he reported as gratefully of general ferrars as the general did kindly of him  those letters were the chief pleasures in a harassing spring and summer  it was well that practice had trained sophia in the qualities of a nurse for lucy was seldom available when algernon dusautoy was at home she was sure to be riding with him or sitting for her picture or the good vicar afraid of her overworking herself insisted on her spending the evening at the vicarage  she yielded but not with an easy conscience to judge by her numerous apologies and when mr cavendish dusautoy returned to oxford she devoted herself with great assiduity to the invalid her natural gifts were far more efficient than sophys laboriouslyearned gentleness and her wonderful talent for prattling about nothing had a revivifying influence sparing much of the plaintive weariness which accompanied that mournful descent of lifes hill  albinia had reckoned on a rational lucy until the oxford term should be over  she might have anticipated a failure in the responsions who in connexion with the polysyllable could mention being plucked for the littlego but it was more than she did expect that his rejection would send him home in sullen resentment resolved to punish oxford by the withdrawal of his august name  he had been quizzed by the young reprimanded by the old plucked by the middleaged and he returned with his mouth full of sentences against blind benighted bigotry and the futility of classical study and of declamations as an injured orphan against his uncles disregard of the intentions of his dear deceased parent in keeping him from bonn jena heidelberg or any other of the outlandish universities whose guttural names he showered on the meek vicars desponding head  he was twentyone and could not be sent whither he would not go his uncles resource was mr kendal who strongly hoped that the link was about to snap when summoning the gentleman to the library he gave him to understand that he should consider a refusal to resume his studies as tantamount to a dissolution of the engagement  a long speech ensued about dear mothers amiable daughters classics languages and foreign tours  that was all the account mr kendal could give his wife of the dialogue and she could only infer that algernons harangue had sent him into such a fit of abstraction that he really could not tell the drift of it  however he was clear that he had himself given no alternative between returning to oxford and resigning lucy  that same evening lucy all blushes and tears faltered out that she was very unwilling she could not bear to leave them all nor dear grandmamma but dear algernon had prevailed on her to say next august  when indignant astonishment permitted albinia to speak she reminded lucy that a respectable career at oxford had been the condition  i know said lucy but dear algernon convinced papa of the unreasonableness of such a stipulation under the circumstances  albinia felt the ground cut away under her feet and all she could attempt was a dry answer  we shall see what papa says but you lucy how can you think of marrying with your grandmamma in this state and gilbert in that camp of cholera  i told algernon it was not to be thought of said lucy her tears flowing fast  but i dont know what to do no one can tell how long it may go on and we have no right to trifle with his feelings  if he had any feelings for you he would not ask it  no mamma indeed cried lucy earnestly it was his feeling for me he said i was looking quite languid and emaciated and that he could not allow mygood looks and vivacity to be diminished by my attendance in a sick chamber  i told him never to mind for it did not hurt me but he said it was incumbent on him to take thought for me and that he could not present me to his friends if i were not in full bloom of beauty yes indeed he said so and then he said it would be the right season for italy  it is impossible you can think of going so far away  oh lucy you should not have consented  i could not help it said lucy sobbing  i could not bear to contradict him but please mamma let papa settle it for me  i dont want to go away i told him i never would i told him i had promised never to leave dear grandmamma but you see he is so resolute and he cannot bear to be without me  oh do get him to put it offonly if he is angry and goes to italy without me i know i shall die  we will take care of you my dear  i am sure we shall be able to show him how impossible a gay wedding would be at present and i do not think he can press it said albinia moved into soothing the present distress and relieved to find that there was no heartlessness on lucys side  what a grand power is sheer obstinacy  it has all the momentum of a stone or cannonball or any other object set in motion without inconvenient sensations to obstruct its course  algernon dusautoy had decided on being married in august and taking his obedient pupilwife through a course of lectures on the continental galleries of art and his determined singleness of aim prevailed against the united objections and opposition of four people each of double or quadruple his wisdom and weight  his first great advantage was that as albinia surmised mr kendal could not recal the finale of their interview and having lost the thread of the rigmarole did not know to what his silence had been supposed to assent  next algernon conquered his uncle by representing lucy as on the road to an atrophy and persuading him that he should be much safer on the continent with a wife than without one and though the two ladies were harder to deal with in themselves they were obliged to stand by the decision of their lords  above all he made way by his sincere habit of taking for granted whatever he wished and by his magnanimous oblivion of remonstrance and denial so that every day one party or the other found that assumed as fixed in his favour which had the day before been most strenuously refused  if you consented to this i thought i could not refuse that  i consent  i told him it was the last thing i could think of  well i own i was surprised but he told me you had readily come into his views  such was the usual tenor of consultations between the authorities until their marvel at themselves and each other came to a height when they found themselves preparing for the wedding on the very day originally chosen by algernon  mr kendals letter to gilbert was an absolute apology  gilbert in turkey was a very different person from gilbert at bayford and had assumed in his fathers mind the natural rights of son and heir he seemed happy and valued and the heat of the climate pestiferous to so many seemed but to give his indian constitution the vigour it needed  when his comrades were laid up or going away for better air much duty was falling on him and he was doing it with hearty goodwill and effectiveness  already the rapid changes had made him a lieutenant and he wrote in the highest spirits  moreover he had fallen in with bryan omore and had been able to do him sundry kindnesses the report of which brought ulick to willow lawn in an overflow of gratitude  it was a strange state of affairs there  albinia was ashamed of the plea of could not help it and yet that was the only one to rest on the adherence to promises alone gave a sense of duty and when or how the promises had been given was not clear  besides no one could be certain even about poor lucys present satisfaction she sometimes seemed like a little bird fluttering under the fascination of a snake  she was evidently half afraid of algernon and would breathe more freely when he was not at hand but then a restlessness would come on if he did not appear as soon as she expected as if she dreaded having offended him  she had violent bursts of remorseful tears and great outpourings of fondness towards every one at home and she positively did look ill enough to justify algernon in saying that the present condition of matters was hurtful to her  still she could not endure a word that remotely tended towards advising her to break off the engagement or even to retard the wedding and her admiration of her intended was unabated  indeed his affection could not be doubted he liked her adoration of all his performances and he regarded her with beneficent protection as a piece of property he made her magnificent presents and conceded to her that the wedding tour should not be beyond clifton whence they would return to willow lawn and judge ere deciding on going abroad  he said that it would be de bon ton to have the marriage strictly private  even he saw the incongruity of festivity alongside of that chamber of decay and death and besides he had conceived such a distaste to the drury family that he had signified to lucy that they must not make part of the spectacle  albinia and sophy thought this so impertinent that they manfully fought the battles of the drurys but without prevailing albinia took her revenge by observing that this being the case it was impossible to ask her brother and little mary whose wellsounding names she knew algernon ambitionated for the benefit of the county paper  always doing what was most contrary to the theories with which she started in life albinia found herself taking the middle course that she contemned  she was marrying her first daughter with an aching foreboding heart unable either to approve or to prevent and obliged to console and cheer just when she would have imagined herself insisting upon a rupture at all costs  sophy had said from the first that her sister could not go back  she expected her to be unhappy and believed it the penalty of the wrongdoings in consenting to the clandestine correspondence and treated her with melancholy kindness as a victim under sentence  she was very affectionate but not at all consoling when lucy was sad and she was impatient and gloomy when the trousseau or any of the privileges of a fiancee brought a renewal of gaiety and importance a broken heart and ruined fortunes were the least of the consequences she augured and she went about the house as if she had realized them both herself  the weddingday came and grandmamma was torpid and only half conscious so that all could venture to leave her  the bride was not allowed to see her lest the agitation should overwhelm both for the poor girl was indeed looking like the victim her sister thought her pale as death with red rings round her extinguished eyes and trembling from head to foot the more at the apprehension that algernon would think her a fright  after all that lavender and salvolatile could do for her she was such a spectacle that when her father came to fetch her he was shocked and said tenderly lucy my child this must not be  say one word and all shall be over and you shall never hear a word of reproach  but lucy only cast a frightened glance around and rising up with the accents of perfect sincerity said no papa i am quite ready i am quite happy  i was only silly  her mind was evidently made up and it was past albinias divination whether her agitation were composed of fear of the future and remorse for the past or whether it were mere love of home and hurry of spirits exaggerated by belief that a bride ought to weep  probably it was a compound of all and the whole of her reply perfect truth especially the final clause  so they married her poor child very much as if they had been attending her to the block  sophys view of the case had infected them all beyond being dispelled by the stately complacency of the bridegroom or the radiant joy and affection of his uncle  they put her into a carriage watched her away and turned back to the task which she had left them dreading the effects of her absence  she was missed but less than they feared the faculties had become too feeble for such strong emotion as had followed gilberts departure and the void was chiefly perceptible by the plaintive and exacting clinging to albinia who had less and less time to herself and her children and was somewhat uneasy as to the consequences as regarded maurice  while gilbert was at home the child had been under some supervision but now his independent and unruly spirit was left almost uncontrolled except by his own intermittent young conscience his father indulged him and endured from him what would have been borne from no one else and sophy was his willing slave unable to exact obedience and never complaining save under the most stringent necessity or sense of duty  he was too young for school and there was nothing to be done but to go on from day to day in the trust that no harm could eventually ensue in consequence of so absolute a duty as the care of the sufferer and that while the boys truth and generosity were sound though he might be a torment his character might be all the stronger afterwards for that very indocility  it was not satisfactory and many mothers would have been miserable but it was not in albinias nature to be miserable when her hands were full and she was doing her best  she had heard her brother say that when good people gave their children sound principles and spoilt them they gave the children the trouble of selfconquest instead of doing it for them  she had great faith in maurices undertaking this task in due time and while she felt that she still had her hand on the rein she must be content to leave it loose for a while  besides when his father and sisters and least of all herself did not find him a plague did it much matter if other people did     chapter xxv    exulting peals rang out from the bayford tower and as mr and mrs cavendish dusautoy alighted from their carriage at willow lawn the cry of the vicar and of the assembled household was have you heard that sebastopol is taken  any news of gilbert was lucys demand  no the cavalry were not landed so he had nothing to do with it  i say uncle said algernon shall i send up a sovereign to those ringers  eh poor fellows they will he very glad of it thank you only i must take care they dont drink it up  im sure they must be tired enough theyve been at it ever since the telegraph came in  there exclaimed algernon barton must have telegraphed from the station when we set out  you  did you think the bells were ringing for you exclaimed his uncle when theres a great battle won and sebastopol taken  telegraphs are always lies quoth mr cavendish dusautoy tersely i dont believe anything has happened at all and he repocketed the sovereign  meantime lucy was in a rapture of embracing  she was spread out with stiff silk flounces and velvet mantle so as to emulate her husbands importance and her chains and bracelets clattered so much that mr kendal could not help saying you should have taken lessons of your ayah to learn how to manage your bangles  oh papa said she with a newlylearnt little laugh i could not help it louise could not find room for them in my dressingcase  they were not however lost upon the whole of the family grandmammas dim eyes lighted when she recognised her favourite granddaughter in such gorgeous array and that any one should have come back again was so new and delightful that it constantly recurred as a fresh surprise and pleasure  all were glad to have her againtheir own lucy as she still was though somewhat of the grandiose style and selfconsequence of her husband had overlaid the original nature  she was as goodnatured and obliging as ever and though beginning by conferring her favours as condescensions she soon would forget that she was the great mrs cavendish dusautoy and quickly become the eager helpful lucy  she was in very good looks and bright and happy admiring algernon rejoicing to obey his behests and enhancing his dignity and her own by her discourses upon his talents and importance  how far she was at ease with him albinia sometimes doubted there now and then was an air of greater freedom when he left the room and some of her favourite old household avocations were tenderly resumed by stealth as though she feared he might think them unworthy of his wife  she gave her spare time to the invalid who was revived by her presence as by a sunbeam and albinia in her relief and gratitude did her utmost to keep algernon happy and contented  she resigned a room to him as an atelier and let the little awk be captured to have her likeness taken she promoted the guitar and keybugle and abstained from resenting his strictures on her dinners  such a guest reduced mr kendal to absolute silence but she did not think he suffered much therefrom and he was often relieved for all the neighbourhood asked the young couple to dinner  mrs cavendish dusautoys toilette was as good as a play to the oldest and youngest inhabitants of the house her little sister used to stand by the dressingtable with her small fingers straightened to sustain a column of rings threaded on them and her arm weighed down with bracelets and grandmammas happiest moments were when she was raised up to contemplate the costly robes jewelled neck and garlanded head of her darling  when it turned out that sebastopol was anything but taken mr cavendish dusautoys incredulity was a precious confirmation of his esteem for his own sagacity more especially as ulick omore and maurice had worn out the little brass piece of ordnance in firing feux de joie  but said maurice papa always said it was not true  now you only said so when you found the bells were ringing for that and not for you  maurices observations were not always convenient  algernon with much pomp had caused a horse to be led to the door for which he had lately paid eighty guineas and he was expatiating on its merits when maurice broke out thats macheath the horse that archie tritton bought of mr nugents coachman for twenty pounds  hush maurice said his father you know nothing of it and mr cavendish dusautoy pursued it was bred at lord lewthorps and sold because it was too tall for its companion  laing was on the point of sending it to tattersalls where he was secure of a hundred but he was willing to oblige me as we had had transactions before  papa cried maurice i know it is macheath for mr tritton showed him to gilbert and me when he had just got him and said he was a showy beast but incurably lame so he should get what he could for him from laing  now james isnt it he called to the servant who was sedulously turning away a grinning face but just muttered same sir  mr kendal charitably looked the other way and algernon muttered some species of imprecation  thenceforth maurice took every occasion of inquiring what had become of macheath whether laing had refunded the price and what had been done to him for telling stories  if the boy began in innocence he went on in mischief he was just old enough to be a most aggravating compound of simplicity and malice  he was fully aware that mr cavendish dusautoy was held cheap by his own favourites and had been partly the cause of his dear gilberts troubles and his sharp wits and daring nature were excited to the utmost by the solemn irritation that he produced  not only was it irresistibly droll to tease one so destitute of fun but he had the strongest desire to see how angry it was possible to make the big brotherinlaw of whom every one seemed in awe  first he had recourse to the old term polysyllable and when lucy remonstrated he answered ive a right to call my brother what i please  you know how angry mamma would be to hear you  mamma calls him the polysyllable herself said maurice looking full at his victim  lucy who would have given the world to hinder this epithet from coming to her husbands knowledge began explaining something about gilberts nonsense before he knew him and how it had been long disused  thats not true lucy quoth the tormentor  i heard mamma tell sophy herself this morning to write for some fishsauce because she said that polysyllable was so fanciful about his dinner  lucy was ready to cry and algernon endeavouring to recal his usual dignity exclaimed if mrs kendali mean mrs kendal has it in her power to take liberties but if i find you repeating such again you little imp it shall be at your risk  what will you do to me asked the sturdy varlet  dear maurice i hope youll never know  pray dont try cried lucy but if she had had any knowledge of character she would have seen that she had only provoked the little berserkars curiosity and had made him determined on proving the undefined threat  so the unfortunate algernon seldom descended the stairs without two childish faces being protruded from the balusters of the nurseryflight overhead pursuing him with hissing whispers of polysyllable and pollysilly and if he ventured on indignant gestures maurice returned them with nutcracker grimaces and provoking assurances to his little sister that he could not hurt her  algernon could not complain without making himself ridiculous and albinia was too much engaged to keep watch over her son so that the persecution daily became more intolerable and barren indications of wrath were so diverting to the little monkey that the presence of the heads of the family was the sole security from his tricks  poor lucy was the chief sufferer unable to restrain her brother and enduring the brunt of her husbands irritation with the great disappointment of being unable to make him happy at her home and fearing every day that he would fulfil his threat of not staying another week in the house with that intolerable child for the sake of any ones grandmother  tidings came however that completely sobered maurice and made them unable to think of moving  it was the first rumour of the charge of balaklava with the report that the 25th lancers were cut to pieces in spite of algernons reiteration that telegraphs were lies all the household would have been glad to lose the sense of existence during the time of suspense  albinias heart was wrung as she thought of the cold hurried manner of the last farewell and every look she cast at her husbands calm melancholy face seemed to be asking pardon that his son was not safe in india  late that evening the maid came hurriedly in with a packet of papers a telegraph maam come express from hadminster  it was to mrs kendal from one of her friends at the horse guards she did not know how she found courage to turn her eyes on it but her shriek was not of sorrow  major the honourable f ferrars severely woundedright arm amputated  lieutenant gilbert kendal slightly woundedcontusion rib broken  she saw the light of thankfulness break upon mr kendals face and the next moment flew up to her boys bedside  he started up half asleep but crying out mamma wheres gibbie  safe safe  maurice dearest safe only slightly wounded  oh maurice god has been very good to us  he flung his arms round her neck as she knelt beside his crib in the dark and thus mr kendal found the mother and son  as he bent to kiss them maurice exclaimed with a sort of anger oh mamma why have i got a bullet in my throat  albinia laughed a little hysterically as if she had the like bullet  it was very kind of lord h fervently exclaimed mr kendal you must write to thank him albinia  gilbert may be considered safe while he is laid up  perhaps he may be sent home  what should you say to that maurice  oh i wouldnt come home to lose the fun said maurice  oh mamma let me get up to tell awkey and run up to ulick  gilbert will be the colonel when im a cornet  oh  i must get up  his outspoken childish joy seemed to relieve albinias swelling heart too full for the expression of thankfulness and the excitement was too much even for the boy for he burst into passionate sobs when forbidden to get up and waken his little sister  the sobering came in mr kendals mention of fred  albinia was obliged to ask what had happened to him and was shocked at having overlooked so terrible a misfortune but maurice seemed to be quite satisfied  you know mamma it said they were cut to pieces  cant they make him a wooden arm evidently thinking he could be repaired as easily as the creatures in his sisters noahs ark  even algernon showed a heartiness and fellowfeeling that seemed to make him more like one of the family  moreover he was so much elevated at the receipt of a telegraph direct from the fountainhead that he rode about the next day over all the neighbourhood with the tidings and comported himself as though he had private access to all lord raglans secrets  the unwonted emotion tamed maurice for several days and his behaviour was the better for his daily rides with papa to hadminster to forestall the second post  at last on his return his voice rang through the house  mamma where are you  the letter is come and gilbert shot two russians and saved cousin fred  i opened your letter albinia said mr kendal and as she took it from him he said thank god i never dared hope for such a day as this  he shut himself into the library while albinia was sharing with sophy the precious letter but with a moments disappointment at finding it not from gilbert but from her brother william  before you receive this he wrote you will have heard of the affair of today and that our two lads have come out of it better than some others  there are but nine officers living and only four unhurt out of the 25th lancers and freds escape is entirely owing to your son  then followed a brief narrative of the events of balaklava that fatal charge so well described as magnifique mais pas la guerre a history that seemed like a dream in connexion with the timid gilbert his individual story was thushe safely rode the half a league forward but when more than half way back his horse was struck to the ground by a splinter of the same shell that overthrew major ferrars at a few paces distance from him  quickly disengaging himself from his horse gilbert ran to assist his friend and succeeded in extricating him from his horse and supporting him through the remainder of the terrible space commanded by the batteries  fred unable to move without aid and to whom each step was agony had entreated gilbert to relinquish his hold and not peril himself for a life already past rescue but gilbert had not seemed to hear and when several of the enemy came riding down on them he had used his revolver with such effect as to lay two of the number prostrate and deter the rest from repeating the attack  all this i heard from fred continued the general he is in his usual spirits and tells me that he feels quite jolly since his arm has been off and he has been in his own bed but i fear he has a good deal to suffer for his right side is terribly lacerated and i shall be glad when the next few days are over  he desires me to say with his love that the best turn you ever did him was putting young kendal into the 25th  tell your husband that i congratulate him on his sons conduct and am afraid that his promotion without purchase is only too certain  gilberts only message was his love  speaking seems to give him pain and he is altogether more prostrated than so slight a wound accounts for but when i saw him he had just been told of the death of his colonel and several of his brother officers among them young wynne who shared his tent and he was completely overcome  there is however no cause for uneasiness he had not even been aware that he was hurt until he fainted while fred was under the surgeons hands and was then found to have an ugly contusion of the chest and a fracture of the uppermost rib on the left side  a few days rest will set all that to rights and i expect to see him on horseback before we can ship poor fred for scutari  in the meantime they are both in freds tent which is fairly comfortable  albinia understood whence came gilberts heroism  he had charged at first as he had hunted with maurice because there was no doing otherwise and in the critical moment the warm heart had done the rest and equalled constitutional courage but then she saw the gentle tender spirit sinking under the slight injury and far more at the suffering of his friend the deadly havoc among his comrades and his own share in the carnage  the general coolly mentioned the two enemies who had fallen by his pistol and maurice shouted about them as if they had been two rabbits but she knew enough of gilbert to be sure that what he might do in the exigency of selfdefence would shock and sicken him in recollection  poor fred how little would she once have believed that his frightful wound could be a secondary matter with her only enhancing her gratitude on account of another  that was a happy evening maurice was sent to ask ulick to dinner and at dessert drank the healths of his soldier relatives among whom mr kendal with a smile at ulick included bryan omore  in the universal goodwill of her triumph albinia having read her precious letter to every one resolved to let the drurys hear it before forwarding it to fairmead  lucys neglect of that family was becoming flagrant and albinia was resolved to take her to make the call  therefore after promulgating her intentions too decidedly for algernon to oppose them she set out with lucy in the most virtuous state of mind  maurice was to ride out with his father and sophy was taking care of grandmamma so she made her expedition with an easy mind and absolutely enjoyed the change of scenery  the war had drawn every one nearer together and mrs drury was really anxious about gilbert and grateful for the intelligence  nor did lucy meet with anything unpleasant  mrs cavendish dusautoy in waistdeep flounces a paris bonnet and her husbands dignity impressed her cousins and whatever use they might make of their tongues it was not till after she was gone  as the carriage stopped at the door sophy came out with such a perturbed an expression as seemed to prelude fatal tidings and lucy was pausing to listen when she was hastily summoned by her husband  oh mamma he has struck maurice such a blow cried sophy  algernon wheres maurice is he hurt  he is in the library with papa  she was there in a moment  maurice sat on his fathers knee listening to popes homer leaning against him with eye cheek and nose exceedingly swelled and reddened but these were symptoms of which she had seen enough in past days not to be greatly terrified even while she exclaimed aghast  aye said mr kendal sternly  what do you think of young dusautoys handiwork  what could you have done to him maurice  i painted his image  the children got into the paintingroom said mr kendal and did some mischief maurice ought to have known better but that was no excuse for his violence  i do not know what would have been the consequence if poor little albinias screams had not alarmed me  i found algernon striking him with his doubled fist  but i gave him a dig in the nose cried maurice in exultation i pulled ever so much hair out of his whiskers  i had it just now  this sounds very sad said albinia interrupting the search for the trophy  what were you doing in the paintingroom  you know you had no business there  why mamma little awk wanted me to look at the pictures that lucy shows her  and then dont you know his image the little white bare boy pulling the thorn out of his foot  awkey said he was naughty not to have his clothes on and so i thought it would be such fun to make a militiaman of him and so the paints were all about and so i gave him a red coat and black trousers  oh maurice maurice how could you  i couldnt help it mamma  i did so want to see what algernon would do  well  so he came up and caught us  and wasnt he in a jolly good rage thats all  he stamped and called me names and got hold of me to shake me but i know i kicked him well and i had quite a handful out of his whisker but you see poor little awkey is only a girl and couldnt help squalling so papa came up  and in time said mr kendal he reeled against me almost stunned and was hardly himself for some moments  his nose bled violently  that fellows fist might knock down an ox  but he didnt knock me down said maurice  you told me he did not papa  thats all he thinks of said mr kendal in admiration  not a cry nor a tear from first to last  i told sophy to let me know when bowles came  for a black eye cried the hardhearted mother laughing  you should have seen what maurice and fred used to do to each other  oh tell me mamma cried maurice eagerly  not now master she said not thinking his pugnacity in need of such respectable examples  it would be more to the purpose to ask mr cavendish dusautoys pardon for such very bad behaviour  mr kendal looked at her in indignant surprise  ours is not the side for the apology he said  if dusautoy has a spark of proper feeling he must excuse himself for such a brutal assault  i am afraid maurice provoked it i hope my little boy is sorry for having been so mischievous and sees that he deserves  mr kendal silenced her by an impatient gesture and feeling that anything was better than the discussion before the boy she tried to speak indifferently and not succeeding left the room much annoyed that alarm and indignation had led the indulgent father to pet and coax the spirit that only wanted to be taken down and as if her discipline had received its first real shock  mr kendal followed her upstairs no less vexed  albinia this is absurd he said  i will not have the child punished or made to ask pardon for being shamefully struck  it was shameful enough said albinia but after all i cant wonder that algernon was in a passion maurice did behave very ill and it would be much better for him if you would not make him more impudent than he is already  i did not expect you to take part against your own child when he has been so severely maltreated said he with such unreasonable displeasure that almost thinking it play she laughed and said you are as bad as the mothers of the schoolchildren when they wont have them beaten  he gave a look as if loth to trust his ears walked into his room and shut the door  the thrill of horror came over her that this was the first quarrel  she had been saucy when he was serious and had offended him  she sprang to the door knocked and called and was in agony at the moments delay ere he returned with his face still stern and set  pleading and earnest she raised her eyes and surrendered unconditionally  dear edmund dont be vexed with me i should not have said it  never mind he said affectionately i do not wish to interfere with your authority but it would be impossible to punish a child who has suffered so severely and i neither choose that dusautoy should be made to think himself the injured party nor that maurice should be put to the pain of apologizing for an offence which the other party has taken on himself to cancel with interest  albinia was too much demolished to recollect her two arguments that pride on their side would only serve to make algernon prouder and that she did not believe that asking pardon would be so bitter a pill to maurice as his father supposed  she could only feel thankful to have been forgiven for her own offence  when they met at dinner all were formal algernon stiff and haughty ashamed but too grand to betray himself and lucy restless and uneasy her eyes looking as if she had been crying  when maurice came in at dessert the fourth part of his countenance emulating the unlucky cast in gorgeous hues of crimson and violet algernon was startled and turning to albinia muttered something about never having intended and having had no idea  he might have said more if mr kendal with maurice on his knee had not looked as if he expected it and that look sealed albinias lips against expressing regret for the provocation but maurice exclaimed never mind algernon it was all fair and it doesnt hurt now  i wouldnt have touched your image but that i wanted to know what you would do to me  shake hands people always do when theyve had a good mill  mr kendal looked across the table to his wife in a state of unbounded exultation in his generous boy and albinia felt infinitely relieved and grateful  mr cavendish dusautoy took the firm young paw and said with an attempt at condescension very well maurice the subject shall be mentioned no more since you have received a severer lesson than i intended and appear sensible of your error  it wasnt you that made me so began maurice with defiant eye but with a strong sense of let well alone his father cut him short with thats enough my man youve said all that can be wished lifted him again on his knee and stopped his mouth with almonds and raisins  the subject was mentioned no more lucy considered peace as proclaimed and herself relieved from the necessity of such an unprecedented deed as preferring an accusation against maurice and albinia unaware of the previous persecution did not trace that maurice considered himself as challenged to prove that experience of his brotherinlaws fist did not suffice to make him cease from his fun  two days after algernon was coming in from riding when a simple voice upon the stairs observed heres such a pretty picture  eh what said algernon and maurice held it near to him as he stood taking off his great coat  such a pretty picture but you mustnt have it  no it is ulicks  heavens and earth thundered algernon as he gathered up the meaning  who has dared  give it meor and as soon as he was freed from the sleeves he snatched at the paper but the boy had already sprung up to the first landing and waving his treasure shouted no its not for you ill not give you ulicks picture  ulick  cried algernon in redoubled fury  youre put up to this give it me this instant or it shall be the worse for you but ere he could stride up the first flight maurices last leg was disappearing round the corner above and the next moment the exhibition was repeated overhead in the gallery  thither did algernon rush headlong following the scampering pattering feet till the door of maurices little room was slammed in his face  bursting it open he found the chamber empty but there was a shout of elvish laughter outside and a cry of dismay coming up from the garden impelled him to mount the rickety dealtable below the deep sunk dormer window when thrusting out his head and shoulders he beheld his wife and her parents gazing up in terror from the lawn  no wonder for there was a narrow ledge of leading without upon which maurice had suddenly appeared running with unwavering steps till in a moment he stooped down and popped through the similar window of gilberts room  while still too dizzy with horror to feel secure that the child was indeed safe within those below were startled by a frantic shout from algernon let me out  i say the imp has locked me in  let me out  albinia flew into the house and upstairs   maurice was flourishing the key and executing a wardance before the captives door with a chant alternating of warwhoops promise not to hurt it and ill let you out and pity poor prisoners in a foreign land  she called to him to desist but he was too wild to be checked by her voice and as she advanced to capture him he shot like an arrow to the other end of the passage and down the backstairs  she promised speedy rescue and hurried down hoping to seize the culprit in the hall but he had whipped out at the backdoor and was making for the garden gate when his father hastened down the path to meet him and seeing his retreat cut off he plunged into the bushes and sprang like a cat up a cockspurthorn too slender for ascent by a heavier weight and thence grinned and waved his hand to his prisoner at the window  maurice called his father what does this mean  i only want to take home ulicks picture  then ill let him out  what picture  thats my secret  this is not play maurice said albinia  attend to papa  the boy swung the light shrub about with him in a manner fearful to behold and looked irresolute  lucy put in her cry you very naughty child give up the key this moment and above algernon bawled appeals to mr kendal and threats to maurice  silence said mr kendal sternly  maurice this must not be come down and give me the key of your room  i will papa said maurice in a reasonable voice  only please promise not to let algernon have ulicks picture for i got it without his knowing it  i promise said mr kendal  let us put an end to this  maurice came down and brought the key to his father and while lucy hastened to release her husband mr kendal seized the boy finding him already about again to take flight  papa let me take home ulicks picture before he gets out said maurice finding the grasp too strong for him but mr kendal had taken the picture out of his hand and looked at it with changed countenance  it depicted the famous drawingroom scene in its native element the moon squinting through inky clouds at lucy swooning on the sofa while the lofty presence of the polysyllable discharged the fluid from the inkstand  did mr omore give you this asked mr kendal  no it tumbled out of his papercase  you know he said i might go to his rooms and get the illustrated news with the picture of balaklava and so the newspaper knocked the papercase down and all the things tumbled out so i picked this up and thought i would see what algernon would say to it and then put it back again  let me have it papa if he catches me hell tear it to smithereens  dont talk irish sir said his father  i see where your impertinence comes from and i will put a stop to it  maurice gave back a step amazed at his fathers unwonted anger but far greater wrath was descending in the person of mr cavendish dusautoy who came striding across the lawn and planting himself before his fatherinlaw demanded i beg to know sir if it is your desire that i should be deliberately insulted in this house  no one can be more concerned than i am at what has occurred  very well sir then i require that this intolerable child be soundly flogged that beggarly irishman kicked out and that infamous libel destroyed  oh papa cried maurice you promised me the picture should be safe  i promise you you impudent brat cried algernon that you shall learn what it is to insult your elders  you shall be flogged till you repent it  you will allow me to judge of the discipline of my own family said mr kendal  ay i knew how it would be  you encourage that child in every sort of unbearable impudence but i have endured it long enough and i give you warning that i do not remain another night under this roof unless i see the impertinence flogged out of him  papa never whips me interposed maurice  you must ask mamma  mr kendal bit his lips and albinia could have smiled but their sense of the ludicrous inflamed algernon and like one beside himself he swung round and declaring he should ask his uncle if that were proper treatment he marched across the lawn while mr kendal exclaimed more childish than maurice  oh mamma what shall i do was lucys woful cry as she turned back finding herself unable to keep up with his huge step and her calls disregarded  my dear said albinia affectionately you had better compose yourself and follow him  his uncle will bring him to reason and then you can tell him how sorry we are  you may assure him said mr kendal that i am as much hurt as he can be that such an improper use should have been made of omores intimacy here and i mean to mark my sense of it  and said lucy i dont think anything would pacify him so much as maurice being only a little beaten not to hurt him you know  if maurice be punished it shall not be in revenge said mr kendal  im afraid nothing else will do said lucy wringing her hands he has really declared that he will not sleep another night here unless maurice is punished and whatever he says hell do and i know it would kill me to go away in this manner  her father confidently averred that he would do no such thing but she cried so much as to move maurice into exclaiming look here lucy ill come up with you and let him give me one good punch and then we shall all be comfortable again  i dont know about the punching said albinia but i think the least you can do maurice is to go and ask his forgiveness for having been so very naughty  you were not thinking what you were about when you locked him in  this measure was adopted mr kendal accompanying lucy and the boy while albinia went in search of sophy whom she found in grandmammas room looking very pale  well was the inquiry and she told what had passed  i hope maurice will be punished said sophy so unwonted a sentiment that albinia quite started though it was decidedly her own opinion  that meddling with papers was very bad she said with an extenuating smile  fun is a perfect demon when it becomes master said sophy  it was plain that it was not maurice that she was thinking of but the caricature  her sister should have been sacred from derision  we must remember she said that it was only through maurices meddling that we became aware of the existence of this precious work it is not as if ho had shown it to any one  how many of the omores have made game of it asked sophy bitterly  no i am glad i know of it i shall not be deceived any more  with these words she withdrew evidently resolved to put an end to the subject  her face was like iron and albinia grieved for the deep resentment that the man whom she had ventured to think of as devoted to herself had made game of her sister  poor sophy to her that tryste had been a subject of unmitigated affliction and shame and it was a cruel wound that ulick omore should of all men have turned it into ridicule  what would be the effect on her  in process of time mr kendal returned  albinia he said this is a most unfortunate affair  he is perfectly impracticable insists on starting for paris tomorrow and i verily believe he will  poor lucy  she is in such distress that i could not bear to look at her but he will not attend to her nor to his uncle and aunt  mrs dusautoy proposed that they should come to the vicarage where there would be no danger of collisions with maurice but his mind can admit no idea but that he has been insulted and that we encourage it and he thinks his dignity concerned in resenting it  not much dignity in being driven off the field by a child of six years old  so his aunt told him but he mixes it up with omore and insists on my complaining to mr goldsmith and getting the lad dismissed for a libellous caricaturist as he calls it  now little as i should have expected such conduct from omore it could not be made a ground of complaint to his uncle  i should think not  no one with more wit than algernon would have dreamt of it  but if ulick came and apologized  ah but i forgot mr goldsmith sent him to london this morning  well it may be better that he should be out of the way of algernon in his present mood  humph said mr kendal  it is the first time i ever allowed a stranger to be intimate in my family and it shall be the last  i never imagined him aware of the circumstance  nor i i am sure none of us mentioned it  maurice told him i suppose  it is well that we should be aware who has instigated the childs impertinence  i shall keep him as much as possible with me he must be cured of irish brogue and irish coolness before they are confirmed  mr kendals conscience was evidently relieved by transferring to the irishman the imputation of fostering maurices malpractices  they were interrupted by lucys arrival  she was come to take leave of home for her lord was not to be dissuaded from going to london by the evenings train  the greater the consternation the sweeter his revenge  never able to see more than one side of a question he could not perceive how impossible it was for the kendals to fulfil his condition with regard to ulick omore and he sullenly adhered to his obstinate determination  lucy was in an agony of grief and perhaps the most painful blow was the perception how little he was swayed by consideration for her  her maid packed while her parents tried to console her  it was easier when she bewailed the terrors of the voyage and the uncertainty of hearing of dear grandmamma and dear gilbert than when she sobbed about algernon having no feeling for her  it might be only too true but her wifely submission ought not to have acknowledged it and they would not hear when they could not comfort and so they were forced to launch her on the world with a tyrant instead of a guide and dreading the effect of dissipation on her levity of mind as much as they grieved for her feeble spirit it was a piteous partinga mournful departure for a bridea heavy penalty for vanity and weakness  unfortunately the result is to an action as the lens through which it is viewed and the turpitude of the deed seems to increase or diminish according to the effect it produces  had it been in algernon dusautoys nature to receive the joke goodhumouredly it might have been regarded as an audacious exercise of wit and have been quickly forgotten but when it had actually made a breach between him and his wifes family and driven him from bayford when everything conspired to make his departure unfeelingly cruel the caricature was regarded as a serious insult and an abuse of intimacy  even mr kendal was not superior to this view feeling the offence with all the sensitiveness of a hottempered man a proud reserved guardian of the sanctities of home and of a father who had seen his daughters weakest and most faulty action turned into ridicule and he seemed to feel himself bound to atone for not going to all the lengths to which algernon would have impelled him by showing the utmost displeasure within the bounds of common sense  albinia better appreciating the irresistibly ludicrous aspect of the adventure argued that the sketch harmlessly shut up in a papercase showed no great amount of insolence and that considering how the discovery had been made it ought not to be visited  she thought the drawing had better be restored without remarks by the same hand that had abstracted it but mr kendal sternly declared this was impossible and sophys countenance seconded him  well then said albinia put it into my hands  im a bad manager in general but i can promise that ulick will come down so shocked and concerned that you will not have the heart not to forgive him  the question is not of forgiveness said sophy in the most rigid of voices as she saw yielding in her fathers face if any one had to forgive it was poor lucy and algernon  all we have to do is to be on our guard for the future  sophy is right said mr kendal intimacy must be over with one who has so little discretion or good taste  then after his saving maurice he is to be given up because he quizzed the polysyllable cried albinia  i do not give him up said mr kendal  i highly esteem his good qualities and should be happy to do him a service but i cannot have my family at the mercy of his wit nor my child taught disrespect we have been unwisely familiar and must retreat  and what do you mean us to do exclaimed albinia  are we to cut him systematically  i do not know what course you may adopt said mr kendal in a tone whose grave precision rebuked her half petulant half facetious inquiry  i have told you that i do not mean to do anything extravagant nor to discontinue ordinary civilities but i think you will find that our former habits are not resumed  and maurice must not be always with him said sophy  certainly not i shall keep the boy with myself  it was with the greatest effort that albinia held her tongue  to have sophy not only making common cause against her but inciting her father to interfere about maurice was wellnigh intolerable and she only endured it by sealing her lips as with a bar of iron  byandby came the reflection that if poor sophy had a secret cause of bitterness it was she herself who had given those thoughts substance and consciousness and she quickly forgave every one save herself and algernon  as to her little traitor son she took him seriously in hand at bedtime and argued the whole transaction with him representing the dreadful consequences of meddling with peoples private papers under trust  here was poor lucy taken away from home and papa made very angry with ulick because maurice had been meddlesome and mischievous and though he had not been beaten for it he would find it a worse punishment not to be trusted another time nor allowed to be with ulick  maurice turned round with mouth open at hearing of papas anger with ulick and the accusation of having brought his friend into trouble  why maurice you remember how unhappy we were gilbert and all  it was because it was sadly wrong of gilbert and lucy to have let algernon in without papas knowing it and it was not right or friendly in ulick to laugh at what was so wrong and grieved us all so much  it was such fun said maurice  yes maurice but fun is no excuse for doing what is unkind and mischievous  ulick would not have been amused if he had cared as much for us as we thought he did but after all his drawing the picture would have done no harm but for a little boy whom he trusted never thinking that an unkind wish to tease would betray this foolish action and set his best friends against him  i did not know i should said maurice winking hard  no you did not know you were doing what if you were older would have been dishonourable  that word was too much  first he hid his face from his mother and cried out fiercely ive notive not been that and clenched his fist  dont say it mamma  if you had known what you were doing it would have been dishonourable she repeated gravely  it will be a long time before you earn trust and confidence again  there was a great struggle with his tears  she had punished him and almost more than she could bear to see but she knew the conquest must be secured and she tried while she caressed him to make him look at the real cause of his lapse he declared that it was such fun to provoke algernon and a little more brought out a confession of the whole course of persecution the childs voice becoming quite triumphant as he told of the success of his tricks and his mother though appalled at their audacity with great difficulty hindering herself from manifesting her amusement  she did not wonder at algernons having found it intolerable and though angry with him for having made himself such fair game she set to work to impress upon maurice his own errors and the hatefulness of practical jokes and she succeeded so far as to leave him crying himself to sleep completely subdued while she felt as if all the tears ought to have been shed by herself for her want of vigilance  conflicting duties how hard to strike the balance  she had readily given up her own pleasures for the care of mrs meadows but when it came to her sons training it was another question  she much wished to see the note with which mr kendal returned the unfortunate sketch but one of the points on which he was sensitive was the sacredness of his correspondence and all that she heard was that ulick had answered not at all as mr kendal had expected he was nothing but an irishman after all  but at last she obtained a sight of the note                                          bayford nov 20th 1854 dear sir  i was much astonished at the contents of your letter of this morning and greatly concerned that mr cavendish dusautoy should have done so much honour to any production of mine as to alter his arrangements on that account  as the scrawl in question was not meant to meet the eye of any living being i should for my own part have considered it proper to take no notice of what was betrayed by mere accident  i should have considered it more conducive to confidence between gentlemen  i fully acquiesce in what you say of the cessation of our former terms of acquaintance and with many thanks for past kindness believe me                                        your obedient servant                                             u omore   nothing was more evidently written in a passion at the invasion of these private papers and albinia though she had always feared he might consider himself the aggrieved party had hardly expected so much proud irritation and so little regret  mr kendal called him foolish boy and tried to put the matter aside but he was much hurt and ulick put himself decidedly in the wrong by passing in the street with a formal bow when mr kendal according to his purpose of ordinary civility without an open rupture would have shaken hands  sophy looked white stern and cold but said not a word she deepened her fathers displeasure quite sufficiently by her countenance  his was grave disappointment in a youth whom he found less grateful than he thought he had a right to expect hers was the rankling of what she deemed an insult to her sister and the festering of a wound of which she was ashamed  she meant to bear it well but it made her very hard and rigid and even the children could hardly extract a smile from her  she seemed to have made a determination to do all that lucy or herself had ever done and more too and listened to no entreaties to spare herself  commands were met with sullen resignation entreaties were unavailing and both in the sickroom and the parish she insisted on working beyond her powers  it was a nightly battle to send her to bed and albinia suspected that she did not sleep  meantime lucy had sailed and was presently heard of in a whirl of excitement that shortened her letters and made them joyous and selfimportant  ah said sophy she will soon forget that she ever had a home  poor dear  wait till trouble comes and she will remember it only too sadly sighed albinia  trouble is certain enough said sophy but i dont think what we deserve does us much good  sophy could see nothing but the most ungentle and gloomy aspects gilbert had not yet written and she was convinced that he was either very ill or had only recovered to be killed at inkermann and she would only sigh at the gazette that announced lieutenant gilbert kendals promotion to be captain and major the honourable frederick ferrars to be lieutenantcolonel  the day after however came the long expected letter from the captain himself  it was to mrs kendal and she detected a shade of disappointment on her husbands face so she would have handed it to him at once but he said no the person to whom the letter is addressed should always be the first to read it  the letter began with gilberts happiness in those from home which he called the greatest pleasure he had ever known  he feared he had caused uneasiness by not writing sooner but it had been out of his power while fred ferrars was in danger  then followed the account of the severe illness from which fred was scarcely beginning to rally though that morning on hearing that he was to be sent home as soon as he could move he had talked about canada and emily  gilbert said that not only time but strength had been wanting for writing for attendance on fred had been all that he could attempt since moving produced so much pain and loss of breath that he had been forced to be absolutely still whenever he was not wanted but he was now much better  though he continued i do not now mind telling you that i had thought myself gone  you who have known all my feelings and have borne with them so kindly will understand the effect upon me when on the night previous to the 25th i distinctly heard my own name in edmunds voice at the head of my bed just as he used to call me when he had finished his lessons and wanted me to come out with him  as i started up i heard it again outside the tent  i ran to the door but of course there was nothing nor did poor wynne hear anything  i lay awake for some time but slept at last and had forgotten all by morning  it did not even occur to me when i saw the pleasant race they had cut out for us nor through the whole affair do not ask me to describe it the scene haunts me enough  when i found that i had not come off unhurt and it seemed as if i could not ask for one of our fellows but to hear he was dead or dying poor wynne among them then the voice seemed a summons  i was thoroughly done up and could not even speak when general ferrars came to me i only wanted to be let alone to die in peace  i fancy i slept for the next thing i heard was the majors voice asking for some water too feebly to wake the fellow who had been left in charge  i got up and found him in a state of high fever and great pain and from that time to the present i have hardly thought of the circumstance and know not why i have now written it to you  did my danger actually bring edmund nearer or did its presence act on my imagination  be that as it may i think after the first impression of awe and terror the having heard the dear old voice braced me and gave me a sense of being near home and less lonely  not that my hurt has been for an instant dangerous and i am mending every day if it were warmer i should get on faster but i cannot stir into the air without bringing on cough  tell ulick omore that we entertained his brother at tea last evening we were obliged to desire him to bring his own cup and he produced the shell of a land tortoise it was very like the fox and the crane  poor fellow it was the first good meal he had for weeks and i was glad he came in for some famous bread that the general had sent us in  he made us much more merry than was convenient to either of us not being in condition for laughing  he is a fine lad and liked by all  then came a break and the letter closed with such tidings of inkermann as had reached the invalids tent  a few lines from general ferrars spoke of the improvement in both patients adding that fred had had a hard struggle for his life and had only been saved by gilberts unremitting care by day and night  heroism had not transformed gilbert and albinias old fondness glowed with double ardour as she mused over his history of the battleeve  his father attributed the impression to a mind full of presage and excitement acted upon by strong memory but womanlike albinia preferred the belief that the one twin might have been an actual messenger to cheer and strengthen the other for the coming trial  sophy only said gilberts fancies as usual  this was not like fancy said albinia  this is an unkind way of taking it  it is common sense she bluntly answered  i dont see why he should think that edmund has nothing better to do than to call him it would be childish  albinia did not reply disturbed by this display of jealousy and harshness as if every bud of tenderness had been dried up and withered and poor sophy only wanted to run counter to any obvious sentiment  albinia was grateful for the message which gave her an excuse for seeking ulick out and endeavouring to conciliate him  mr kendal made no objection and expressed a hope that he might have become reasonable  she therefore contrived to waylay him in the november darkness holding out her hand so that he took it at unawares as if not recollecting that he was offended but in the midst his grasp relaxed and his head went up  i have a message for you from gilbert about your brother bryan she said and he could not defend himself from manifesting eager interest as she told of the teaparty but that over it was in stiff formal english that he said i hope you had a good account  it struck a chill and she answered almost imploringly gilbert is much better thank you  i am glad to hear it and he was going to bow and pass on when she exclaimed  ulick why are we strangers  it was agreed on all hands that things past could not be undone he frigidly replied  too true she said but i do not think you know how sorry we are for my poor little boys foolish trick  i owe no displeasure to maurice  he knew no more what he was doing than if he had been a gust of wind but if the wind had borne a private paper to my feet i would never have acted on the contents  unhappily said albinia some revelations though received against our will cannot help being felt  we saw the drawing before we knew how he came by it and you cannot wonder that it gave pain to find that a scene so distressing to us should have furnished you with amusement  it was absurd in itself but we had hoped it was a secret and it wounded us because we thought you would have been tender of our feelings  you dont mean that it was fact cried ulick stopping suddenly and as her silence replied he continued i give you my word and honour that i never imagined there was a word of truth in the farrago old biddy told me and ill not deny that i did scrawl the scene down as the very picture of a bit of slander  i only wonder id not brought it to yourself  pray let me hear what she told you  oh she said they two had been colloguing together by moonlight and you came home in the midst and miss kendal fainted away so he catches up the ink and throws it over her instead of water and you and mr kendal came in and were mad entirely and mr kendal threatened to brain him with the poker if he did not quit it that instant and sent gilbert for a soldier for opening the door to him but you and lucy went down on your bare knees to get him to relent  well i own the poker does throw an air of improbability over the whole  minus that and the knees i am afraid it is only too true i suppose it got abroad through the servants  it was an unlucky goosequill that lay so handy exclaimed ulick but you may credit me no eye but my own ever saw the scrawl nor would have seen it  then ulick if we all own that something is to be regretted why do we stand aloof and persist in quarrelling  i want no quarrel said ulick stiffly  mr kendal intimated to me that he did not wish for my company and im not the man to force it  oh ulick this is not what i hoped from you  ill tell you what mrs kendal you could talk over the giants causeway if you had a mind said ulick with much agitation but you must not talk over me for your own judgment would be against it you know what i am and what i came of and what have i in the world except the honour of a gentleman  mr kendal and yourself have been my kindest friends and ill be grateful to my dying day but if mr kendal thinks i can submit tamely when he resents what he never ought to have noticed why then what have i to do but to show him the difference  if his kindness was to me as a gentleman and his equal i love and bless him for it but if it be a patronizing of the poor clerk why then i owe it to myself and my people to show that i can stand alone without cringing and being thankful for affronts  did it ever occur to you to think whether pride be a sin  tis not pride cried ulick  it is my duty to my family and my name  youd say yourself as you allowed before now that it would be mere meanness and servility to swallow insults for ones own profit and if i were to say youre welcome with many thanks to shuffle over my private papers and call myself to account id better have given up my name at once for id have left the gentleman behind me  i do believe it is solely for the omores that you are making a duty of implacability  it is a duty not to run from ones word and debase oneself for ones own advantage  one would think some wonderful advantage was held out to you  the pleasantest hours of my life murmured he sadly under his breath  well ulick she said holding out her hand im not quite dissatisfied i think some day even an omore will see that there is no exception from the law of forgiveness in their special favour and that you will not be able to go on resenting what we have suffered from the young of the spidermonkey  even this allusion produced no outward effect he only shook hands gravely saying i never did otherwise than forgive and regret the consequences i am very thankful for all your past kindness  worse than the giants causeway thought albinia as she parted from him  nothing is so hopeless as that sort of forgiveness because it satisfies the conscience  mr kendal predicted that the keltic dignity having been asserted good sense and principle would restore things to a rational footing what this meant might be uncertain but he certainly missed prometheus and found maurice a poor substitute  indulgence itself could hardly hold out in unmitigated intercourse with an obstreperous dunce not seven years old and maurice deprived of gilbert cut off from ulick with mamma busy and sophy out of spirits underwent more snubbing than had ever yet fallen to his lot  not that he was much concerned thereat and mr kendal would resume his book after a lecture upon good manners and then be roused to find his library a gigantic cobweb strings tied to every leg of table or chair and maurice and the little awk enacting spider and fly heedless of the unwilling flies who might suffer by their trap  such being the case his magnanimity was the less amazing when he said albinia there is no reason that omore should not eat his christmas dinner here  very well  i trust he will not think it needful still to be selfdenying  it is not our part to press advances which are repelled said sophy  indeed sophy said her father smiling i see nothing attractive in the attitude of rocks rent asunder  the undesigned allusion must have gone deep for she coloured to a purple crimson and said in a freezing tone i thought you considered that to take him up again would be a direct insult to lucy and her husband  they do not show much consideration for us said mr kendal  how long ago was the date of her last letter  nearly three weeks said albinia  poor child how could she write with the catalogue raisonnee of the louvre to learn by heart  the dusautoys yearly gave a christmas teaparty to the teachers in the sundayschool who had of late become more numerous as mr dusautoys influence had had more time to tell  mrs kendal was reckoned on as one of the chief supporters of the gaiety of the evening but on this occasion she was forced to send sophia alone  sophy regarded it as a duty and a penance and submitted the more readily because it was so distasteful  it was however more than she had reckoned on to find that the party had been extended to the male teachers an exceedingly good and lugubriouslooking youth lately apprenticed to mr bowles and ulick omore  it was the first time she had met the latter since his offence  she avoided seeing him as long as possible though all his movements seemed to thrill her and so confused the conversation which she was trying to keep up that she found herself saying that genevieve durant had lost an arm and that gilbert would spend christmas in london  she felt him coming nearer she knew he was passing the miss northover in the purple silk and red neckribbon she heard him exchanging a few civil words with the sister with the hair strained off her face she knew he was coming she grew more eager in her fears for mr rainsforths chest  tea was announced  sophy held back in the general move ulick made a step nearer their eyes met and if ever eyes spoke hers ordered him to keep his distance while he glanced affront for affront bowed and stepped back  sophy sat by miss jane northover and endeavoured to make her talk anything would have been better than the echoes of the sprightliness at the lower end of the table where ulick was talking what he would have called blarney to miss susan northover and miss mary anne higgins both at once till he excited them into a perpetual giggle mr dusautoy was delighted and evidently thought this brilliant success mrs dusautoy was less at her easethe mirth was less sober and more exclusive than she had intended and sophy finding nothing could be made of miss jane turned round to her other neighbour mr hope and asked his opinion of the whewell and brewster controversy on the plurality of worlds  mr hope had rather a good opinion of miss sophia and as she had never molested him could talk to her so he straightway became engrossed in the logical and theological aspects of the theory and mrs dusautoy could hardly suppress her smile at this unconscious ponderous attempt at a counter flirtation with saturn and jupiter as weapons for light skirmishing  ulick received the invitation to dinner and did not accept it  he said he had an engagementalbinia wondered what it could be and had reason afterwards to think that he had the silent young apothecary to a christmas dinner in his own roomsan act of charity at least if not of forgiveness  mr johns the senior clerk whose health had long been failing was about to retire and this announcement was followed by the appearance of a smart keenlooking young man of six or sevenandtwenty whom miss goldsmith paraded as her cousin mr andrew goldsmith and it was generally expected that he would be taken into partnership and undertake old johns work but in a fortnight he disappeared and young omore was promoted to the vacant post with an increase of salary  it was mortifying only to be informed through mr dusautoy instead of by the lad himself  the eastern letters were the chief comfort  first came tidings that gilbert not having yet recovered his contusion was to accompany colonel ferrars to scutari and then after a longer interval came a brief and joyous notegilbert was coming home  on his voyage from the crimea he had caught cold and this had brought on severe inflammation on the injured chest which had laid him by for many days at scutari  the colonel had become the stronger of the two in spite of a fragment of shell lodged so deeply in the side that the medical board advised his going to london for its removal  both were ordered home together with six months leave and gilberts note overflowed with glad messages to all including algernon of whose departure he was still in ignorance  mr kendal knew not whether he was most gratified or discomfited by the insinuating ringer who touched his hat hoping for due notice of the captains arrival in time to welcome him with a peal of bells indeed bayford was so excited about its hero that there were symptoms of plans for a grand reception with speeches cheers and triumphal arches which caused sophy to say she hoped that he would come suddenly without any notice so as to put a stop to all that nonsense while albinia could not help nourishing a strange vague expectation that his return would be the beginning of better days  at last sophia with a touch of the old penny club fever toiled over the school clothing wilfully and unnecessarily for two hours kept up till evening without owning to the pain in her back but finally returned so faint and dizzy that she was forced to be carried helpless to her room and the next day could barely drag herself to the couch in the morningroom where she lay quite prostrated and grieved at increasing instead of lessening her mothers cares  oh mamma dont stay with me  you are much too busy  no i am not  the children are out and grandmamma asleep and i am going to write to lucy but theres no hurry  let me cool your forehead a little longer  how i hate being another bother  i like you much better so than when you would not let me speak to you my poor child  i could not she said stifling her voice on the cushion and averting her head but in a few moments she made a great effort and said you think me unforgiving mamma  it was not entirely that it was hating myself for an old fancy a mere mistake  i have got over it and i will not be in error again  sophy dear if you find strength in pride it will only wound yourself  i do not think i am proud said sophy quietly  i may have been headstrong but i despise myself too much for pride  are you sure it was mere fancy  it was an idea that occurred to more than to you  hush cried sophy  had it been so could he have ridiculed lucy could he have flown out so against papa  no that caricature undeceived me and i am thankful  he treated us as cousinsno morehe would act in the same manner by any of the miss omores of ballymakilty nay by jane northover herself  we did not allow for irish manner  if so he had no right to do so  i shall never wish to see him here again  no mamma he did not know the folly he had to deal with  next time i meet him i shall know how to be really indifferent  now this is the last time we will mention the subject  albinia obeyed but still hoped  it was well that hope remained for her task was heavier than ever mrs meadows was feebler but more restless and wakeful asking twenty times in an hour for mrs kendal the doctors thought it impossible that she should hold out another fortnight but she lived on from day to day and at times albinia hardly could be absent from her for ten minutes together  sophy was so completely knocked up that she could barely creep about the house and was forbidden the sickroom but she was softened and gentle and was once more a companion to her father while eagerly looking forward to devoting herself to gilbert  a letter with the malta postmark was eagerly opened as the harbinger of his speedy arrival                                           royal hotel malta                                             february 10th 1855  dearest mrs kendal  i am afraid you will all be much disappointed though your grief cannot equal mine at the doctors cruel decree  we arrived here the day before yesterday but i had been so ill all the voyage with pain in the side and cough that there was no choice but to land and call in dr who tells me that my broken rib has damaged my lungs so much that i must keep perfectly quiet and not think of going home till warm weather  if i am well enough to join by that time i shall not see you at all unless you and my father could come out  am i nourishing too wild a hope in thinking it possible  since lucy has been so kind as to promise never to leave grandmamma i cannot help hoping you might be spared  i do not think my proposal is selfish since my poor grandmother is so little conscious of your cares and ferrars insists on remaining with me till he sees me in your hands though they say that the splinter must be extracted in london and every week he remains here is so much suffering besides delaying his expedition to canada  i have entreated him to hasten on but he will not hear of it  he is like a brother or a father to me and nurses me most tenderly when he ought to be nursed himself  we are famishing for letters  i suppose all ours have gone up to balaklava and thence will be sent to england  if we were but there  we are both much better for the quiet of these two days and are to move tomorrow to a lodging that a friend of freds has taken for us at bormola so as to be out of the babel of these streetswe stipulated that it should be large enough to take in you and my father  i wish sophy and the children would come tooit would do them all the good in the world and maurice would go crazy among the big guns i am only afraid we should have him enlisting as a drummer  the happy pair would be very glad to have the house to themselves and would persuade themselves that it was another honeymoon  goodbye  instead of looking for a letter i shall come down to meet you at the quarantine harbour  love to all                                        your most affectionate                                            gilbert kendal   how differently gilbert wrote when really ill from his desponding style when he only fancied himself so thought albinia as perplexed and grieved she handed the letter to her husband and opened the enclosure written in the laboured illformed characters of a lefthand not yet accustomed to doing the offices of both   dear albinia  come if possible  his heart is set upon it though he does not realize his condition and i cannot bear to tell him  only the utmost care can save him  i am doing my best for him but my nursing is as lefthanded as my writing                                             ever yours                                                ff   his wifes look of horror was mr kendals preparation for this emphatic summons perhaps a shock less sudden to him than to her for he had not been without misgivings ever since he had heard of the situation of the injury  he read and spoke not till the silence became intolerable and she burst out almost with a scream oh edmund i knew not what i did when i took grandmamma into this house  this is very perplexing he said his feelings so intense that he dared only speak of acting i must set out tonight  order me to come with you she said breathlessly  that will cancel everything else  would mrs drury take charge of her aunt said he with a moments hesitation and albinia felt it implied his impression that they were bound by her repeated promises never to quit the invalid but she only spoke the more vehemently  mrs drury  she mightshe would under the circumstances  she could not refuse  if you desire me to come i should not be doing wrong and grandmamma might never even miss me  surelyoh surely a young life full of hope and promise that may yet be saved is not to be set against what cannot be prolonged more than a few weeks  as to that said mr kendal in the deliberate tone which denoted dissatisfaction though of course it would be the greatest blessing to have you with us i think you may trust gilbert to my care  and we must consider poor sophia  she could not bear to be considered  no but it would be leaving her in a most distressing position when she is far from well and with most uncongenial assistants  you see poor gilbert reckons on lucy being here which would make it very different  but think of poor sophia in the event of mrs meadows not surviving till our return  you are right  it would half kill her  my promise was sacred i was a wretch to think of breaking it  but when i think of my boymy gilbert pining for me and i deserting him  for the sake of duty said her husband  let us do right and trust that all will be overruled for the best  i shall go with an easier mind if i leave you with the other children and i can be the sooner with him  i could travel as fast  i may soon bring him home to you  or you might bring the others to join us in the south of france  you will all need change  the decision was made and her judgment acquiesced though she could hardly have cast the balance for herself  she urged no more even when relentings came over her husband at the thought of the trials to which he was leaving her and of those which he should meet in solitude yet not without a certain secret desire to make himself sufficient for the care and contentment of his own son  he cast about for all possible helpers for her but could devise nothing except a note entreating her brother to be with her as much as possible and commending her to the dusautoys  it was a less decided kindness that he ordered maurices pony to be turned out to grass so as to prevent rides in solitude thinking the boy too young to be trusted and warned by the example of gilberts temptations  going up to the bank to obtain a supply of gold he found young omore there without his uncle  the tidings of gilberts danger had spread throughout the town and one heart at least was softened ulick wrung the hand that lately he would not touch and mr kendal forgot his wrath as he replied to the warmhearted inquiry for particulars  then mrs kendal cannot go with you  no it is impossible  there is no one able to take charge of mrs meadows  ah and mrs cavendish dusautoy is gone  i grieve for the hour when my pen got the better of me  mr kendal this is worse than i thought  your son will never forgive me when he knows im at the bottom of his disappointment  there is something to forgive on all hands said mr kendal  that meddlesome boy of mine has caused worse results than we could have contemplated  i believe it has been a lesson to him  i know it has to some one else said ulick  i wish i could do anything  it would be the greatest comfort you could give me to tell me of a thing i could do for gilbert or any of you  if youd send me to find mr cavendish dusautoy and tell him twas all my fault and bring them back  rather too wild a project thank you said mr kendal smiling no the only thing you could do would beif that boy of mine have not completely forfeited your kindness  maurice  ah how i have missed the rogue  poor little fellow i am afraid he may be a burthen to himself and every one else  it would be a great relief if you could be kind enough now and then to give him the pleasure of a walk  maurice did not attend greatly to papas permission to go out with mr omore  either it was clogged with too many conditions of discretion and too many reminiscences of the past or maurices mind was too much bent on the thought of his brother  both children haunted the packing up entreating to send out impossible presents maurice could hardly be persuaded out of contributing a perilouslooking boomerang which he argued had some sense in it while he scoffed at the little awk who stood kissing and almost crying over the china countenance of her favourite doll entreating that papa would take dear miss jenny because gibbie loved her the best of all and always put her to sleep on his knees  at last matters were compromised by sophy who roused herself to do one of the few things for which she had strength engrossing them by cutting out in paper an interminable hunt with horses and dogs adhering together by the noses and tails which when brilliantly painted according to their united taste they might safely imagine giving pleasure to gilbert while at any rate it would do no harm in papas pocketbook     chapter xxvi    the day after mr kendals departure mrs meadows had another attack but a fortnight still passed before the long long task was over and the weary spirit set free  there had been no real consciousness and no one could speak of regret of anything but relief and thankfulness that release had come at last when albinia had redeemed her pledge and knew she should no more hear of the dreary very bad night nor be greeted by the low restless moan the long goodnight was come and on the whole there was peace and absence of selfcondemnation in looking back on the past connexion forbearance and unselfishness were recompensed by the calm tenderness with which she could regard one who at the outset had appeared likely to cause nothing but frets and misunderstandings  had she and sophy been left to themselves there would have been nothing to break upon this frame of mind but early the next day arrived mr and mrs drury upsetting all her arrangements implying that it had been presumptuous to exert any authority without relationship  it did seem hard that the claims of kindred should be only recollected in order to unsettle her plans and offend her unostentatious tastes  averse both to the proposals and to the discussion she felt unprotected and forlorn but her spirit revived as she heard her brothers voice in the hall and she hastened to put herself in his hands  he declined doing battle he said it would be better to yield than to argue and leave a grudge for ever  it will not vex edmund he said and though you and sophy may be pained by incongruities they will hurt you less than disputing  she felt that he was right and by yielding the main points he contrived amicably to persuade mr drury out of the numerous invitations and grand luncheon as well as to adhere to the day that she had originally fixed for the funeral after which he hoped to take her and the young ones home with him and give her the thorough change and rest of which the overenergy of her manner betrayed the need  not that she consented  she could not bear not to meet her letters at once or suppose edmund and gilbert should return to an empty unaired house and she thought herself selfish when it might do so much good to sophy c c ctill mr ferrars going home for a night agreed with winifred that domineering would be the only way to deal with her  on his return he found albinia on the stairs and boxes and trunks carried down after her  running to him she exclaimed abruptly i am going to malta maurice tomorrow evening  has edmund sent for you  not exactlyhe did not knowbut gilbert is dying and wretched at my not coming  i never wished him goodbyhe thinks i did not forgive him  dont say a wordi shall go  he held her trembling hands and said this is not the way to be able to go  come in here sit down and tell me  it is no use to argue  it is my duty now said albinia but she let him lead her into the room where sophy was changing the bright border of a travellingcloak to crape and maurice stood watching as if stunned  it is settled continued she rapidly  sophy and the children go to the vicarage  yes i know you are very kind but maurice would be troublesome and winifred is not well enough and the dusautoys wish it  yes that may be the best plan as i shall be absent  she turned round startled  i cannot let you go alone  nonsensewinifredsundaylenti dont want any one  nothing could happen to me  mr ferrars caught sophys eye beaming with sudden relief and gratitude and repeated if you go i must take you  i cant wait for sunday she said  what have you heard  she produced the letter and read parts of it  the whole stood thus                                                  bormola                                        11 pm february 28th 1855 dearest albinia  i hope all has gone fairly well with you in my absence and that sophia is well again  could i have foreseen the condition of affairs here i doubt whether i could have resolved on leaving you at home though you may be spared much by not being with us  i landed at noon today and was met in the harbour by your cousin who had come off in a boat in hopes of finding you on board  he did his best to prepare me for gilberts appearance but i was more shocked than i can express  there can no longer be any doubt that it is a case of rapid decline brought on by exposure and aggravated by the injury at balaklava  colonel ferrars fancies that gilberts exertions on his behalf in the early part of his illness may have done harm by preventing the broken bone from uniting and causing it to press on the lungs but knowing the constitutional tendency we need not dwell on secondary causes and there is no one to whom we owe a deeper debt of gratitude than to your cousin for his most assiduous and affectionate attendance at a time when he is very little equal to exertion  they are like brothers together and i am sure nothing has been wanting to gilbert that he could devise for his comfort  they are in a tolerably commodious airy lodging where i found gilbert propped up with cushions on a large chair by the window flushed with eager watching  poor fellow to see how his countenance fell when he found i was alone was the most cutting reproach i ever received in my life  he was so completely overcome that he could not restrain his tears though he strove hard to command himself in this fear of wounding my feelings but there are moments when the truth will have its way and you have been more to him than his father has ever been may it be granted that he may yet know how i feel towards him  his first impression was that you had never forgiven him for his unfortunate adventure with maurice and could never feel towards him as before and though i trust i have removed this idea perhaps such a letter as you can write might set his heart at rest  ferrars says that hitherto his spirits have kept up wonderfully though latterly he had been evidently aware of his condition but he has been very much depressed this evening probably from the reaction of excited expectation  on learning the cause of lucys desertion he seemed to consider that his participation in the transactions of that night had recoiled upon himself and deprived him of your presence  it was very painful to see how he took it  he was eager to be told of the children and the only time i saw him brighten was when i gave him their messages  i am writing while i hope he sleeps  i am glad to be here to relieve the colonel who for several nights past has slept on the floor in his room not thinking the maltese servant trustworthy  he looks very ill and suffering but seems to have no thought but for gilbert and will not hear of leaving him and in truth they cling together so affectionately that i could not bear to urge their parting even were fred more fit to travel home alone i will close my letter tomorrow after the doctors visit   the conclusion was even more desponding the physician had spoken of the case as hopeless and likely to terminate rapidly and gilbert who was always at the worst in the morning had shown no symptom that could lead his father to retract his first impression  mr ferrars saw that it would be useless and cruel to endeavour to detain his sister and only doubted whether in her precipitation she might not cross and miss her husband in a still sadder journey homeward and this made him the more resolved to be her escort  when she dissuaded him vehemently as though she were bent on doing something desperate he replied that he was anxious about fred and if she and her husband were engrossed by their son he should be of service in bringing him home and this somewhat reconciled her to what was so much to her benefit  only she gave notice that he must not prevent her from travelling day and night to which he made no answer while sophy hoarsely said that but for knowing herself to be a mere impediment she should have insisted on going and her uncle must not keep mamma back  then maurice imitatively broke out mamma take me to gilbert i wont be a plague i promise you  he was scarcely silenced before mr dusautoy came striding in to urge on her that fanny and himself should be much happier if he were permitted to conduct mrs kendal to malta the fact being that fanny was persuaded that mr ferrars would obviate such necessity albinia almost laughed as she had declared that she had set all the parsons in the country in commotion and mr dusautoy was obliged to limit his good offices to the care of the children and the responsibility of the fairmead sunday services  the good hardworked brother had hardly time to eat his luncheon before he started to inform his wife and prepare for his journey winifred was a very good sister on an emergency she had not once growled since poor mrs meadows had been really ill and though she had been feeding on hopes of albinias visit and was far from strong she quashed her husbands misgivings and cheerily strove to convince him that he would be wanted by no one least of all by herself  a slight vituperation of the polysyllabic pair was all the relief she permitted herself and who could blame her for that when even mr dusautoy called the one that foolish fellow and the other poor dear lucy  albinia and sophy safe over the fire that evening after their sorrowful tasks unable to turn to anything else wondering how and when they should meet again and their words coming slowly and with long intervals of silence  dear child said albinia promise me to take care of yourself and to let mrs dusautoy judge what you can do  im not worth taking care of muttered sophy  we think you worth our anxiety said albinia tenderly  i will not make it worse for you meekly replied sophy  i dont think im cross now i could not be  no indeed you are not my dear  we have leant on each other and when we come home you will make our welcome  the children will  ah i think maurice will behave well  he is very much subdued  i told him he was to do no lessons and he fairly burst out crying  oh mamma exclaimed sophy hurt indignant and nearly ready to follow his example  i do not think he has mastery over himself so as to help being unruly and idle when he is chained to a spellingbook  i would not for the world set him and you to worry each other for an hour a day and i shall start afresh with him all the better when he knows what absence of lessons is and has forgotten all the old associations  how could you make him cry said sophy in reproach  i believe the tears only wanted an excuse  i did put it on his naughtiness which usually would have elated him but his heart was so full as to make even a long holiday a punishment  that boy often shows me what a thorough kendal he is things sink into him as they never did into us at the same age when my aunts used to think i had no feeling  oh sophy how will you comfort him  his will be an unstained sorrow said sophy from the depths of her heart  o mamma only tell gilbert what you know i feelno you dont no one can but what i would not give to change all i have felt towards him  if i had been like edmund and prized his gentleness and sweetness and the humility that was the best worth of all how different it would be  but i was proud of despising where truth was wanting  i should have thought i should have done the same said albinia but there was no keeping from loving gibbie  besides he was sincere except when he was afraid and he was miserable when he was deceiving  yes after you came said sophy but i believe i helped him to think truth disagreeable  i showed my scorn for his want of boldness instead of helping him  think of my having fancied he had no courage  kindness taught him courage said albinia  it might perhaps have earlier taught him moral courage  if you and he could have leant against each other and been fused together you would have made something like what edmund was i suppose  i drove him off cried sophy  i was no sister to him  will you bring me his forgiveness  indeed i will and you may feel sure of it already dearest  it will make you gentler all your life  no i shall grow harder and harsher the longer i live and the fewer i have to love me in spite of myself  i think not said albinia  humility will make your severity more gentle and you will soften and win love and esteem  she looked up but cried i shall never make up to gilbert nor to grandmamma  albinia felt it almost as hard to leave her as the two little ones  when once on her journey and feeling each moment an advance towards the goal albinia was less unhappy than she could have thought possible she trusted to her brother and enjoyed the absence of responsibility and while he let her go on could give her mind to what pleased and interested him and he who was an excellent courier so managed that there were few detentions to overthrow her equanimity on the way to marseilles  but when the vectis came in sight of the rocky isle with its white stony heights the heartsickness of apprehension grew over her and she saw as in a mist the noble crescentshaped harbour the stately ramparts mighty batteries the lofty terraces of flatroofed dwellings apparently rather hewn out of than built on the dazzling white stone between the intense blue of the sky above and of the sea below  her eye roamed as in a dream over the crowds of gay boats with white awnings and the motley crowds of english and natives the boatmen screaming and fighting for the luggage and beggars plaintively whining out their entreaties for small coins  her brother maurice had been at malta as a little boy and remembered the habits of the place enough as soon as they had set foot on shore to secure a brownskinned loiterer in phrygian cap loose trousers and crimson sash to act as guide and porter  along the strada san giovanni a street of stairs shut in by high stone walls with doors opening on either side they went not as fast as albinias quivering limbs would fain have moved yet too fast when her breath came thick with anxietydown again by the stone stairs called nix mangiare nothing to eat from the incessant cry of the beggars that haunt themthen again in a boat which carried them amid a strange world of shipping to the bottom of the dockyard creek where again landing she was told she had but to ascend and she would be at bormola  she could have paused in dread and she leant heavily on her brothers arm when they presently turned up a lane no broader than a passage with low stone steps at irregular intervals  they were come  the summons at the door was answered by a darkvisaged maltese and while maurice was putting the question whether colonel ferrars and captain kendal lived here a figure appeared on the stairs and beckoned ascending noiselessly with languid steps and slippered feet and leading the way into a slightly furnished room with green balcony and striped blind  there he turned and held out his hand but albinia hardly recognised him till he said i thought i heard your voice maurice and then the low subdued tone together with the gaunt wasted form haggard aged face the long beard and worn undress uniform with the armless sleeve made her so realize his sufferings that clasping his remaining hand in both her own she could utter nothing but oh fred fred  he looked at her brother with such inquiry perplexity and compassion that almost in despair maurice exclaimed we are not too late  no thank god said frederick  we did hope you might come  sit down albinia ill  edmund  is he there she said scarcely alive to what was passing and casting another expressively sorrowful look at maurice fred answered yes i will tell him i will see if you can come in  stay said mr ferrars she should compose herself or she will only hurt herself and gilbert  i dont know murmured fred hastily leaving them  maurice understood that gilbert was even then summoned by one who would brook no delays but albinia too much agitated to notice slight indications was about to follow when her brother took her hand and checked her like a child  wait a minute my dear he will soon come back  wheres edmund  why maynt i go to gilbert she said still bewildered  fred is gone to tell them  sit down my dear take off your bonnet you are heated you will be better able to go to him if you are quiet  she passively submitted to be placed on a chair and to remove her bonnet and seeing some dressing apparatus through an open door maurice brought her some cold water to refresh her burning face  she looked up with a smile herself again  there thank you maurice i wont be foolish now  god support you my dear said her brother for the longer the colonel tarried the worse were his forebodings  perhaps the doctor is there she proceeded  that will be well ask him everything maurice  but oh did you ever see any one so much altered as poor fred  he looks twenty years older  ah i am quite good now  i may go now she cried as the door opened  but as frederick returned there was that written on his brow which lifted her out of the childishness of her agitation  my dear albinia he said in a trembling voice mr kendal cannot leave him to come to you  he has been much worse since last night and as her face showed that she was gathering his meaning he pursued in a lower and more awestruck tone we think he is sensible but we cannot tell  it could not hurt him for you to come in and perhaps he may know you but are you able to bear it  is she maurice  yes i am she answered and the calm firmness of her tone proved that she was a woman again  her hand shook less than did that of her cousin as silently and reverently he took it and led her into another room on the same floor  there in the subdued light she saw her husband seated on the bed holding in his arms his son who lay lifted up and supported upon his breast with head resting on his shoulder and eyes closed  there was no greeting no sound save the long heavily drawn gasping breaths  mr kendal raised his eyes to her she silently knelt down and took the wasted hand that lay helplessly on the coverlet but it moved feebly from her as though harassed by the touch  gilbert dear boy said his father earnestly she is come  speak to him albinia  she hardly knew her own voice as she said gilbert gibbie dear here i am  those large brown eyes were shown for a few moments beneath the heavy lids and met hers  the mouth hitherto only gasping for air endeavoured to form a word the hand sought hers  she kissed him and his eyes opened wide and brightened while he said i think it is pardon now  pardon indeed said his father with a greater look of relief than albinia understood you are resting in his merits  gilberts look brightened and he said i know it now  thank god said mr kendal  his eyes closed and fred whispered to the father maurice is here too  again the light woke in the eye with almost a smile the look that always welcomed the little brother and albinia grieved to say not little maurice though he longed to come it is my brother  but the air of eagerness did not pass away and he seemed satisfied when mr ferrars came in  it was as a priest speaking words not his own and albinia and fred knelt with him  at the close of each prayer or psalm gilbert signed imploringly for more even like our mighty dying queen and at each short pause the distressed agonized expression would again contract the brow though in the sound of the holy words all was peace  the psalm of the good shepherd with the rod and staff in the valley of the shadow of death recurred so strongly to maurice that he repeated it like a cadence after each penitential supplication every time bringing a look of peace to the countenance of the sufferer  they must have remained long thus fred had grown exhausted with kneeling and had been forced to sit on the floor and maurices voice waxed low and hoarse yet he durst not pause though doubting whether gilbert could follow the meaning  at length the eyes were again raised  with a start as of haste gilbert looked full at albinia and said thank you  tell maurice he could not finish and there was an agony for breath then as his father raised him he contrived to say fathermotherkiss me it is forgiven  another look brought fred to press his hand and he smiled his thanks  there were a few more terrible minutes from which they would fain have led away albinia but suddenly his brow grew smooth his eyes were eagerly fixed as on something before him and as if replying to a call he said yes with a start and a quiver of all his limbs and then  the first words were mr kendals  edmund has come for him  it was to the rest as if the father had been in some manner conscious of the presence of the one twinbrother and were resigning the other to his charge for he calmly kissed the forehead closed the eyes laid down the form he had so long held in his arms and after a few moments on his knees with his face hidden in his hands he rose with composure and said to his wife i am glad you were in time  had he given way albinia would have been strong but there was no need to support to counteract the force of disappointment and grief acting upon overwrought spirits and a fatigued exhausted frame were these halfconscious looks and broken words all she had come for all she should ever have of gilbert  this was the moments predominant sensation she was past thinking and though she still controlled herself she cast a wild piteous eye on her husband and as he lifted her up she sank on his breast not fainting not sobbing but utterly prostrated and needing all his support as he led her out and laid her on a couch in the next room speaking softly as if hoping his voice would restore her  we had some faint hope of you we knew you would wish it so you see all is ready  but you have done too much my dear maurice should not have let you travel so fast  no no said albinia catching her breath  oh not to have come sooner and she gave way to a violent burst of tears during which he fondled and soothed her till she suddenly said i did not come here to behave in this way  i came to help you  edmund what shall i do and she would have started up  only lie still and let me take care of you said he  nothing could be to me like your coming and she was forced to believe his glistening eyes and voice of tenderness  can you keep quiet a little while said mr kendal wistfully while i go to speak to your brother  it was very good in him to come  dont speak i will come back directly  she did lie still for she was too much spent to move and the silence was good for her for if the overwhelming sensation of grief would sweep over her on the other hand there was the remembrance of the look of peace and the perception that her husband was not as yet so struck to the earth as she had feared  he was not long in returning bringing some coffee for her and for himself and speaking with the same dreamy serenity though looking excessively pale your brother told me to give you this he said  i am glad the colonel is under such care for he is terribly distressed and not at all fit to bear it  i could not make him go to bed all last night  you were up all last night and many nights before said albinia and all alone  oh why was i not here to help  fred was a great comfort said mr kendal  i cannot describe my gratitude to him  and dearest he paused and added with hesitation i do not now regret the having come out alone  after the first disappointment i think that my boy and i learnt to know each other better  if he had left me nothing but the recollection that i had been too severe and unsympathizing to win his confidence i hardly know how i could have borne it  he was able to talk to you then cried albinia  that was what i always wished  yes it was right so it came right  i had got between you as i ought not to have done and it was well you should have him to yourself  not as you ought not he fondly answered  you always were his better angel and you came at last as a messenger of peace  there was relief and hope from the moment that he knew you  he told her what could scarcely have passed his lips save in those earlier hours of affliction  it had been a time of grievous mental distress  neither natural temperament nor previous life had been such as to arm poor gilbert to meet the king of terrors and as day by day he felt the cold grasp tightening on him he had fluttered like a bird in the snare of the fowler physically affrighted at the deathpang shrinking from the lonely entrance into the unknown future and despairing of the acceptableness of his own repentance he believed that he had too often relapsed and he could not take heart to grasp the hope of mercy and rest in the great atonement the last communion had been melancholy the contrite spirit unable to lift itself up and apparently only sunk the lower by the weight of love and gratitude deepening the sense of how much had been disregarded  there had since been a few hopeful gleams but dimmed by bodily suffering and terror and doubly mournful had been the weary hours of the night and morning while he lay gasping away his life upon his fathers breast  having at first taken the absence of his stepmother as a sign that she had not forgiven him he had only laid aside this notion for a more morbid fancy that the deprivation was a token of wrath from above and there could be little doubt that her final appearance was hailed as a seal of pardon not merely from her  her brother who had raised him up after his last fall was likewise the person above all others to bring the message of mercy to speed him to the unseen where as his look and gesture had persuaded his father his brother or some yet more blessed one had received and welcomed the frail and trembling spirit  that last farewell that dawn of peace so long prayed for so ardently desired had given mr kendal such thankfulness and relief as sustained him and enabled him to support his wife who knew not how to meet her first home grief whereas to him sorrow had long been a household guest more familiar than joy and he was more at rest about his son than he had been for many a year  he could dwell on him together with edmund instead of connecting him with shame grief and pain though how little could he have borne to think that thus it would end when in the springtime of his manhood he had rejoiced over his beautiful twin boys  he knew his son better than heretofore  after the first days disappointment gilbert had found him allsufficient and had rested on his tenderness  all sternness had ceased on one side all concealment on the other and the sweetness of both characters had had full scope  gilberts ardent love of home had shown itself in every word and his last exertion had been to write a long letter to his little brother which had been completed and despatched by a private hand a few days previously  he had desired that maurice should have his sword and mentioned the books which he wished his sisters to share talking of sophy as one whom he honoured much and wished he had known better but much pained by hearing nothing from lucy and lamenting his share in her union with algernon  he had said something about his wish that the almshouses should be built but his father had turned away the subject knowing that in case of his dying intestate and unmarried the property was settled on the sisters and seeing little chance of any such work being carried out with the cooperation of mr cavendish dusautoy  latterly he had spoken of genevieve durant he knew better how unworthy of her he had been and how harassing his pursuit must have appeared but he could not help entreating that her pardon might be asked in his name that she might hear that he had loved her to the last and above all that his father would never lose sight of her and mr kendals promise to regard her as the next thing to his daughters had been requited with a look of the utmost gratitude and affection  this was the substance of what mr kendal told his wife as they sat together unwitting of the lapse of time and shrinking from any interruption that might mar their present peace and renew the sense of bereavement  mr ferrars was the first to knock at the door  he had been doing his utmost to spare both them and fred who needed all his care these four months of mutual dependence had been even more endearing than the rescue of freds life on the battlefield and he declared that gilbert had done him more good than any one else  they had been so thrown together as to make the religious sentiment of the younger tell upon the warm though thoughtless heart of the elder they had been most fondly attached and in his present state reduced by wounds and exhausted by watching fred was more overpowered than those more closely concerned  he could hardly speak collectedly when an officer of the garrison called to consult him with regard to a military funeral and it was for this that maurice was obliged to refer to the father  there were indeed none of his regiment in the island but there was a universal desire in the garrison to do honour to the distinguished young officer for whom great interest had been felt and the compliment brought a glow of exultation to mr kendals face as he expressed his warm thanks but desired that the decision might rest with fred himself as his sons lieutenantcolonel  maurice felt himself fully justified in his expedition when he found that all devolved on him even writing to sophy and making the most necessary arrangements for the colonel was incapable of exertion albinia was prostrated by the shock and mr kendal appeared to be lulled into a strange calm by the effects of the excessive bodily weariness consequent on the exhausting attendance of the last few days  they all depended upon mr ferrars and recognised his presence as an infinite comfort  in the morning albinia came forth like one who had been knocked down and shattered weary and gentle and with the tears ever welling into her eyes above all when she endeavoured to write to sophy and she showed her ordinary earnestness only when she entreated to see her boy once more  her husband took her to look on the countenance settled into the expression of unearthly peace but she was not satisfied it was not her own gilbert boyish sensitive dependent and shrinking  the pale brow the marked manly features the lower ones concealed by the brown moustache belonged to the hero who had dared the deadly ride and borne his friend through the storm of shot and shell the noble settled steadfast face was the face of a stranger and gave her a thrill of disappointment  she gloried in the later gilbert but the last she had seen of him whom she loved for his weakness had been when she had not heeded his farewell  it made the pang the less when evening came and he was carried to his restingplace  they would have persuaded frederick to spare himself but as the only officer of the same corps as well as for the sake of many closer ties he would not hear of being absent and made his cousin maurice do his best to restore the smart soldierly air which he for the first time thought of regretting  gilberts horse had perished at balaklava but his cap sword and spurs were laid on the coffin and from her shaded window albinia watched it borne between the files of soldiers with arms reversed and the procession of officers whose bright array contrasted with the colonels warworn dress ghastly cheek and empty sleeve tokens of the reality of war amid its pageantry as all moved slowly away to the deep tones of the solemn dead march music well befitting the calm grandeur of the face she had seen and leaving her heart throbbing with the deep exulting awe and pathos of a soldiers funeral  she knelt alone and followed the burial service in the stillness of the room overlooking the broad expanse of blue sea and sky and byandby through the window came the sound of the volley fired over the grave the farewell of the army to the soldier at rest his battles ended  there was peace and there was glory but she could not divest herself of a sense of unreality  she could not feel as if it were really and truly gilbert and she were mourning for him  all was like a dreamthat solemn military spectaclethe serene grave sunshine on the fortressharbour stretching its mailed arms into the seathe roofs of the knightly old monastic city rising in steps from the bay crowded with white sailsand even those around her were different her husband pale and still as in a region above common life and her cousin like another man without his characteristic joyousness and insouciance  she could hardly induce herself in her drowsy state to believe that all was indeed veritable and tangible  there was nothing to detain them at malta and mr ferrars who arranged everything thought the calm of a seavoyage would be better for them all than the bustle and fatigue of a land journey  kendal himself does not care about getting home he said to fred who was afraid this was determined on his account  i fear many annoyances are in store for him  his soninlaw will not be pleasant to deal with about the property  with an exclamation fred started from the chairs on which he had been resting and dived into his sabretasch which hung from the wall  i never liked to begin about it he said but i ought to have given them this  it was done when he was so bad at scutari  one night he worked himself into a fever lest he should not live till his birthday and said a great deal about this dusautoy making himself an annoyance perhaps insisting on a sale and turning his father out nothing pacified him till the very day he was of age we got the viceconsul to draw up what he wanted and witness it and so did i and the doctor and here it is  afterwards he warned me to say nothing of it when mr kendal came for he said if the other fellow made a row it would be better his father should be able to say he had known nothing of the matter  does he make his father his heir  thats the whole of it  he said his sisters would see it was the only way to get things even and i was to tell albinia something about building cottages or almshouses  ay his father was to do what ought to have been done  well theres the best deed of poor gilberts life  thank you mumbled fred hall drolly half gravely  ay kendal and albinia will do more good with that property than you have thought of in all your life sir  their future and my past laughed fred adding more gravely scamp as i am theres more responsibility coming on me now and i have gone through some preparation for it  if i can get out to canada  you will not lessen your responsibilities said maurice smiling nor your competency to meet them  i trust not said fred  mr ferrars read in his countenance far more than was implied by those words  the general by treating him as a boy had kept him one and perhaps his levity had been prolonged by the rejection of his first love but a really steady attachment had settled his character and he had been undergoing much training through his own sufferings gilberts illness and the sense of the new position that awaited him as commanding officer and for the first time maurice who had always been very fond of him felt that he was talking to a highprincipled and rightminded man instead of the family pet and laughingstock  i suppose he said that you cannot have heard often from montreal since you have been in the east  no  if my letters are anywhere it is at the family office  i desired them to be forwarded thither from headquarters not expecting to be detained here  but cried fred with animation what think you of the general actually writing to mr kinnaird from balaklava  it would have been too bad if he had not  i believe he did so solely to make me sleep but it is the first time he has deigned to treat the affair as anything but a delusion and he cant retract now  since that poor gilbert has made a scrap or two of mine presentable and theres all that i have been able to accomplish but i hope it may have set her mind at rest  shall i be secretary  thank you i think not  she would only worry herself about what is before me and if the doctors let me off easy i had rather report of myself in person  his eyes danced and maurice thought his unselfishness deserved a reward  my poor gilberts last secret said mr kendal as he laid before his wife the brief document by which his son had designated him as his sole heir and executor  a gift to you and a trust to me  albinia looked up for explanation  while he intrusts his sisters to my justice he tacitly commends to me the works which you wished to see accomplished  the almshouses  the improvements  do you mean to undertake them  it shall be my most sacred duty  oh that we could have planned it with him  perhaps i value this the more from the certainty that it is spontaneous said mr kendal  it showed great consideration and forethought that he said nothing of his intention to me  had he mentioned it i should have thought it right to suggest his leaving his sisters their share and yet as we are situated with young dusautoy it would have been awkward to have interfered  he did well and wisely to be silent  you dont expect algernon to be discontented  impossible at such a time and so well off as he is  i wish it may be impossible  what do you mean to do  as far as i can see at present i shall do this  i fear neither the mode of acquisition nor the management of that property was such as to bring a blessing and i believe my poor boy has made it over to me in order to free his sisters from the necessity of winking at oppression and iniquity  had it gone to them matters must have been let alone till sophia came of age and even then all improvements must have depended on algernons consent  the land and houses we will keep and sufficient ready money for the building and repairs and to this sophia at least will gladly agree  the rest something under twenty thousand if i remember correctlyis the girls right  i will settle lucys share on her so as to be out of her husbands power and sophia shall have hers when she comes of age  i am sure that will take from algernon all power of grumbling though i cannot believe that even he could complain  you approve then  how can yon ask  it is the first thing that has seemed like happiness if it did not make one long for him to talk it over  the wound was still very recent and her spirits very tender and the more she felt the blessing of the association with gilbert in the work of love the more she wept though not altogether in sorrow  mortified at having come so much overworked and weakened as to occasion only trouble and anxiety she yielded resignedly when forbidden to wear out strength and spirits by a visit to the burialground before her embarkation  she must content herself with maurices description of the locality and carry away in her eye only the general picture of the sapphire ocean and white rock fortress of the holy warriors vowed to tenderness and heroism as the last restingplace of her cherished gilbert when out of weakness he had been made strong in penitence and love     chapter xxvii    had sophias wishes been consulted she would have preferred nursing her sorrows at home but no choice had been left and at the vicarage the fatherly kindness of mr dusautoy and the considerate letalone system of his wife kept her at ease and not far from cheerful albeit neither the simplicity of the one nor the keenness of the other was calculated to draw her into unreserve comfort was in the children  the children clung to her as if she made their home little albinia preferring her even to uncle john as he had insisted on being called ever since lucy had become his niece and maurice invoking caresses the bestowal of which was his mothers rare privilege  the boy was dull and listless and though riot and mirth could be only too easily excited his wildest shouts and most frantic gesticulations were like efforts to throw off a load at his heart  time hung heavy on his hands and he would lie rolling and kicking drearily on the floor watching with some envy his little sister as she spelt her way prosperously through little charles or daintily and distinctly repeated her hymns  nothing to do was the burthen of his song and with masculine perverseness he disdained every occupation suggested to him  sophy might boast of his obedience and quiescence but mrs dusautoy pitied all parties and wondered when he would be disposed of at school  permission to open letters had been left with sophy who with silent resignation followed the details of poor gilberts rapid decay  at last came the parcel by the private hand containing a small packet for each of the family  sophy received a silver maltese cross and little albinia a perfumy roseleaf bracelet  there was a russian grapeshot for maurice and with it a letter  with childish secrecy he refused to let any one look at so much as the envelope and ran away with it shouting its mine  sophy was grieved that it should be treated like a toy and fearing that while playing at importance he would lose or destroy it without coming to a knowledge of the contents she durst not betray her solicitude lest she should give a stimulus to his wilfulness and precipitate its fate  however when he had galloped about enough he called imperatively sophy and she found him lying on his back on the grass the black cat an unwilling prisoner on his chest  you may read it to smut and me he said  it bore date the day after his fathers arrival but it had evidently been continued at many different times and as the handwriting became more feeble the style grew more earnest so that but for her hoarse indifferent voice sophy could hardly have accomplished the reading   my dear maurice  many many thanks to you and dear little awkey for your present  i have set it up like a picture and much do i like to look at it and guess who chose the colours and who are the hunters  i am sure the fat man in the red coat is the admiral  it makes the place seem like home to see what tells so plainly of you and baby  kiss my little awk for me and thank her for wanting to send me miss jenny dear little maid i like to think of it  you will not let her quite forget me  you must show her my name if it is put up in church like edmunds and all the little ones and you will sometimes tell her about dear old ned on a sunday evening when you are both very good  i think you know that you and she will never again run out into the hall to pull gibbie almost down between you  perhaps by the time you read this you will be the only son with all the comfort and hope of the house resting upon you  my poor maurice i know what it is to be told so and only to feel that one has no brother but at least it cannot be to you as it was with me when it was as if half myself were gone and all my stronger better braver self  my father has been reading to me the rich man and lazarus  maurice when you read of him and the five brethren think of me and how i pray that i may not have left seeds of temptation for you  in the time of my loneliness tritton was goodnatured but i ought to have avoided him and that to which he introduced me has been the bane of my life  nothing gives me such anguish as to think i have made you acquainted with that set  keep out of their way  never go near those pigeonshootings and donkeyraces they seem good fun but it is disobedience to go and the things that happen there are like the stings of venomous creatures the poison was left to fester even when your mother seemed to have cured me  neither now nor when you are older resort to such things or such people  next time you meet tritton and shaw tell them i desired to be remembered to them after that have nothing to do with them touch your hat and pass on  they meant it in good nature and thought no harm but they were my worst enemies they led me astray and taught me deception as a matter of course  oh maurice never think it manly to have the smallest reserve with your parents  i would give worlds to have sooner known that truth would have been freedom and rest  thank heaven your faults are not my faults if you go wrong it will be with a high hand but you would wring hearts that can ill bear further grief and disappointment  oh that i were more worthy to pray that you may use your strength and spirit the right way then you will be gladness to our father and mother and when you lie down to die you will be happier than i am  i want to tell you more but it hurts me to write long  if i could only see younot only in my dreams  i wake and my heart sickens with longing for a sight of my brave boys merry face till i almost feel as if it would make me well but it is a blessing past hope to have my father with me and know him as i have never done before give little albinia these beads with my love and be a better brother to her than i was to poor lucy  goodby maurice  no one can tell what you

your dear dear mother be happy in you it will be the only way to make her forgive me in her heart  goodby my own dear brave boy                                   your most affectionate brother                                                  g kendal   i say smut quoth maurice i think you and our tabby would make two famous horses for awkeys little cart  i shall take you home and harness you  sophy sat breathless at his indifference  you mustnt she said in hasty anger smut is not yours  well jack said that our tabby had two kittens up in the loft i think theyll make better ponies  i shall go and try them  dont plague the kittens  ill not plague them ill only make ponies of them  give me the letter  no not to play with the cats  i thought you would have cared about such a letter  you have no right to keep it  it is mine give it me cried maurice passionately  promise to take real care of it  he only tore it from her and was gone  im a fool to expect anything from such a child she thought  at two oclock the vicar hurried into the bank  good morning mr goldsmith i beg your pardon i wanted to ask if mr omore has seen little maurice kendal  not since yesterdaywhats the matter  the child is not come in to dinner  he is nowhere at home or at willow lawn  ha cried ulick  can he be gone to see his pony at hobbss  no it has been sent to fairmead  then you have no notion where the child can be  sophy is nearly distracted  she saw him last about ten oclock bent on harnessing some kittens but hes not in the hayloft  he may be gone to the toyshop after the harness  or has anyone looked in the churchtowerhe was longing to go up it and if the door were open  the very thing cried the vicar  ill go this moment  or theres old peter the sailor called ulick if he wanted any tackle fitted he might go to him  you had better go yourself more said mr goldsmith  one would not wish to keep poor miss kendal in suspense though i dare say the boy is safe enough  mr goldsmith was thanked and ulick hurried out hyder ali leaping up in amazement at his master being loose at that time of day  everybody had thought the child was with somebody else till dinnertime and the state of the vicarage was one of dire alarm and selfreproach sophy was seeking and calling in every possible place and had just brought herself to own the message of remembrance in gilberts letter thinking it possible maurice might have gone to deliver it at robbles leigh and mr hope had undertaken to go thither in quest of him  ulick and mr dusautoy equally disappointed by the tower and the sailor went again to willow lawn to interrogate the servants  the gardeners boy had heard maurice scolding and the cat squalling and the cook had heard his step in the house  they hurried into his little roomhe was not there but the drawers had been disturbed  he may be gone to fairmead cried the vicar  how said ulick  ha  hyder sir holding up a little shoe seek  thats my fine doggiethey only call you a mongrel because you have all the canine virtues united  see what you can do as sleuth hound  ha  well nose him out for you in no time mr dusautoy  after sniffing round the drawers the yellow tripod made an ungainly descent of the stairs his nose down all the way then across the hall and out at the gate but when after poking about the animal set off on the turnpikeroad the vicar demurred  stay the poor dog only wants to get you out for a walk  he is making for the hadminster road  and why wouldnt he if the child is nowhere in bayford  i cant answer it to his mother wasting time in this way  you may do as you like  i shall go to the trainingstables where he has once been if not on to fairmead  i cant see sophy till he is found  i shall abide by my little orangeman said ulick and they parted  hyder ali pursued his way in the march dust while ulick eagerly scanned for the traces of a childs foot  four miles did the dog go on evidently following a scent but ulicks mind misgave him as hadminster churchtower rose before him and the dog took the ascent to the station  ulick made his way in as a train stood panting before the platform he had a glimpse of a square face and curly hair at the window of a secondclass carriage  maurice come back he cried  here guard this little boy must come back  go on shouted maurice  ive got my ticket  no one can stop me im going to malta  and he tried to get to the other side of a stout traveller who defended his legs from him and said ha running away from school young master  heres your usher  no im not running away  im not at school  im maurice kendal im going to my brother at malta  he is the son of mr kendal of bayford said ulick to the stationmaster his parents are from home and there will be dreadful distress if he goes in this way  maurice your sister has troubles enough already  ive my ticket and cant be stopped  but even as he spoke the stout traveller picked him up by the collar and dropped him like a puppy dog into ulicks arms just as the train was getting into motion and a head protruded from every window to see the truant who was pommelling ulick in a violent fury and roaring let me go i will go to gilbert  behave like a man said ulick dont disgrace yourself in that way  the boy coloured and choking with passion and disappointment and straining against ulicks hold of his shoulder  indeed sir said the stationmaster if we had recognised the young gentleman we would have made more inquiries but he asked so readily for his ticket not seeming at a loss and we have so many young travellers that we thought of nothing amiss  will you have a fly sir  im not going home said the boy undaunted  you must submit maurice  you do not wish to make poor sophy miserable  i must go to malta the boy persisted  gilbert says it would make him well to see me  i know my way i saw it in the map and ive a roll and the end of a cold tongue and a clean shirt and my own sovereign and four shillings and a halfcrown and a halfpenny in my pocket and im going  but maurice this gentleman will tell you that your whole sovereign would not carry you a quarter of the way to malta  the stationmaster gave so formidable a description of the impossibilities of the route that the hardy little fellows look of decision relaxed into dejection his muscles lost their tension and he struggled hard with his tears  he followed ulick to the carriage and hid his face in a corner while orders were given to stop at the postoffice in case there were fresh letters  there was one for miss kendal in mr ferrars writing and with black borders  ulick felt too surely what it must be and hardly could bear to address maurice who had shrunk from him with some remains of passion but hearing suppressed sobs he put his hand on him and said my poor little man  get away said maurice shaking him off  why did you come and bother  i came because it would have almost killed your sister and mother for you to be lost  if you had seen sophys face maurice  i dont care  now i shall never see gilbert again and he did want me so maurice hid his face and his frame shook with sobs  yes said ulick every one knew he wanted you but if it had been possible for you to go your mamma would have taken you  if your uncle had to take care of her how could you go alone  id have got there somehow cried maurice  id have seen and heard gilbert  hes written me a letter to say he wants to see me and i cant even make that out  has not your sister read it to you  i hate sophys reading cried maurice  it makes it all grumpy like her  take it ulickyou read it  that rich sensitive modulated voice brought out the meaning of the letter though there were places where ulick had nearly broken down and maurice pressed against him with the large tears in his eyes and was some minutes without speaking  he does not think of your coming he does not expect you dear boy said ulick  it is a precious letter to have  i hope you will keep it and read it often and heed it too  i cant read it said maurice ruefully  if i could i shouldnt mind  you soon will  you see how he tells you you are to be a comfort and if you are a good boy youll quickly leave the dunce behind  i cant said maurice  mamma said i should not do a bit of a lesson with sophy or i should tease her heart out  would it come quite out  well i think youve gone hard to try today said ulick  mamma said my being able to read would be a comfort and papa says he never saw such an ignorant boy so whats the use of minding gilberts letter  it wont let me  what wont let you  fun said maurice with a sob  he is a rogue cried ulick vehemently but a stout heart and good will can get him under yet  think of what your brother says of making your father and mother happy  if i could do something to please them very very much  oh if i could but learn to read all at once  you can readanybody can read said ulick pulling a book out of his pocket  there try  there was some laughing over this and then maurice leant out of window and grew sleepy  they had descended into the wide basin of alluvial land through which the baye dawdled its meandering course and were just about to cross the first bridge about two miles from bayford when maurice shouted theres sophyhow funny  it was a tall figure in deep mourning slowly moving along the towingpath intently gazing into the river but so strange was it to see sophy so far from home that ulick paused a moment ere calling to the driver to stop  as he hastily wrenched open the door she raised up her face and he was shocked  she looked as if she had lived years of sorrow and even maurice was struck with consternation  sophy  sophy he cried hanging round her  i wouldnt have gone without telling you if i had thought you would mind it  speak to me sophy  she could say nothing save a hoarse where as with both arms she pressed him as if she could never let him go again  in the trainintending to go to malta said ulick  i didnt know i could not i didnt mean to vex you sophy continued the child  im come home now and i wont try again  oh maurice what would have become of you  she held out her hand to ulick the first time for months  and weve got a letter for you proceeded maurice  ulick would fain have withheld it but he had not the choice  she caught at it still holding maurice fast and ere he could propose her opening it in the carriage while he walked home she had torn it open and the same moment she had sunk down seated on the path with an arm round her brother  oh maurice it is well you are here you would not have found themit is over  she had found one brother to lose the other but the relief of maurices safety had so softened the blow that her tears gushed forth freely  the sense of ulicks presence restrained her but raising her head she missed him and felt lonely desolate deserted almost fainting and in a strange place  is he dead said maurice in a solemn low voice and she wept helplessly while the little fellow stood sustaining her weight like a small pillar perplexed and dismayed  are you poorly sophy  what shall i do said he as she almost fell back but a stronger arm held her up  lean on me dear sophy said ulick who had returned bringing some water from a small house near at hand and supported her and soothed her like a brother  the mists cleared away the sense of desertion was gone and she rose but could not stand without his arm and he almost lifted her into the carriage where her appealing eye and helpless gesture made him follow her and take maurice on his knee  no one spoke maurice nestled close to his friend awestruck but weighed down by weariness and excitement  the blow had in reality been given when he was forced to relinquish the hope of seeing his brother again and the actual certainty of his death fell with less comparative force perhaps he did not enter into the fact enough to ask for particulars after a short space sophy recovered herself enough to take out the letter and read it over with greater comprehension  they were come she said  in time  i am glad  in time to bring him peace my uncle says  he knew mamma  i could never have borne it if i had deprived him of her  nor i said ulick from his heart  did one but know the upshot of ones idle follies  sophy looked towards maurice  asleep said ulick  no wonder  he has walked four miles  he has a heart that might have been born in ireland and as he looked at the fair young face softened and sweetened by sleep what an infant it is to have even fancied such an undertaking  poor child sighed sophy  he will never be the same  nay grief at that age does not check the spirits for life  you have never known said sophy  no our number has never yet been broken but for this little man i trust that the sense of duty may be deepened and with it his love to you all and surely that is not what will quench the blithe temper  may it be so said sophy  he may have enough of his mother in him to be happy  i must think that the recollection of so loving a brother and his pride in him for a hero may make the stream flow more deeply but not more darkly  there never was a cloud between them said sophy  clouds are all past and gone now between those who can with him take part in that thanksgiving lay answered ulick kindly  yes said sophy  my uncle says it was peace at last  oh if humbleness and penitence could win it one might be sure it would be his  true said ulick  it was a beautiful thing to find the loving sweetness and kindness refined into selfdevotion and patience and growing into something brighter and purer as it came near the last it will be a precious recollection  to those who have no selfreproach sighed sophy and after a pause she abruptly resumed you once blamed me for being hard with him nothing was more true  impossiblewhen could i have presumed  when  you remember  after oxford  oh you should not have let what i said dwell with you  i was a very raw irishman then and thought it barbarity to look cold on a little indiscretion but i have learnt to think differently and he sighed  the severity that leads to repentance is truer affection than is shown by making light of foolishness  if it had been affection and not wounded pride  the dross has been refined away if there were any said ulick you will be able to love him better now than ever you did in life  his comprehension met her half way and gave her more relief and soothing than anything she had experienced for months  there was that response and intercommunion of spirit for which her nature had yearned the more because of the inability to express the craving the very turn of the dark blue eyes and the inflexions of the voice did not merely convey pity but an entering into the very core of her sorrow namely that she had never loved her brother enough nor forgiven him for not being his fellowtwin  whatever he said tended to reveal to her that there had been more justice rectitude sisterly feeling and wholesome training than she had given herself credit for and above all that gilbert had loved her all the time she was induced to dwell on the exalting and touching circumstances of his last redeeming year and her tears streamed calmly and softly not with the harshness that had hitherto marred her grief  neither could have believed that there had been so long and marked a separation in feeling or that ulick omore had not always been one with the kendal family  it was all too soon that the conversation ended and maurice wakened suddenly at the vicarage wicket  mrs dusautoy herself came to meet them as the little boy was lifted out she had never been seen on her own feet so far from the house before but no one ever knew the terror she had suffered when of all her three charges not one was safe but the little albinia whose poor maurice and all gone were as trying as her alternations of merriment  the vicar the curate the parish clerk the servants of the two establishments and four policemen were all gone different ways and poor mrs dusautoys day had been spent in hearing the results of their fruitless researches or in worse presages in which as it now appeared the river had played its part  she kissed maurice and he did not rebel  she kissed sophy and could have shaken off ulicks hand but he only waited to hold up hyder ali as the real finder before he ran off to desire the schoolbell to be rungthe signal for announcing a discovery  it was well that maurice was too much stunned and fatigued to be sensible what a commotion he had excited or he might have thought it good fun  the tidings from malta came in almost as something secondary  the case had been too hopeless for anything else to be looked for and when mrs dusautoy consigned her charge to a couch with entreaties to her not to move there was calm tenderness in sophys voice as she told what needed to be told and did not shrink from sympathy  she was grateful and gentle and lay all the rest of the day sad and physically worn out but quietly mournful and no longer dwelling on the painful side of past transactions her remorse had given way to resigned acquiescence and desolation to a sense that there was one who understood her  the sweet tones and above all those two words dear sophy would come chiming back from some involuntary echo and the turbid depths were at peace  when mr dusautoy came to her side and held out his hand his honest eyes brimming over there was no repulsion in her manner of saying affectionately you have had a great deal of trouble for my naughty little brother  so different was her whole tone that her kind friends thought how much better for some minds was any certainty than suspense  she bethought herself of sending to the drurys and showed rather gratification than her ordinary impatience at the manifold reports of the general sympathy and of bayfords grief for its hero the poison was gone from her mind     chapter xxviii    the family office had been asked to receive the whole party on their return  mr kendal had business in london and could not bear to part with the colonel till he had seen him safely lodged and heard the surgeons opinion  mr ferrars was laying himself out to guard his brotherinlaw from being oppressed by the sympathetic welcome of the good aunts but though the good ladies never failed in kindness all the excess was directed into a different channel albinia herself was but secondary to the wounded hero for whom alone they had eyes and ears  they would hardly let him stand erect for a moment easychairs and couches were offered soup and wine biscuits and coffee were suggested and questions were crowded on him while he poor fellow wistfully gazed at the oftdirected pile of foreign letters on the sidetable and in pure desperation became too fatigued to go down to luncheon  when the others returned he was standing on the rug curling his moustaches  there was a glow of colour on his hollow cheek and his eyes danced he put out his hand and catching albinias with boyish playfulness he squeezed it triumphantly with the words albinia shes a brick  they went their several ways fred to rest maurice to make an appointment for him with the doctor and albinia to genevieve whom mr kendal regarded like his sons widow forgetting that the attachment had been neither sanctioned nor returned  he could not rest without seeing her and delivering that last message but he was glad to have the way prepared by his wife and proposed to call for her when his law business should be over  albinia sent in her card and asked whether miss durant were at liberty  genevieve came hurrying to her with outstretched hands dear mrs kendal this is kind and led her to the back drawingroom where they were with one impulse enfolded in each others tearful embrace  oh madame how much you have suffered  you know all said albinia  o no very little  my aunt knows little of bayford now and her sight is too weak for much writing  genevieve pushed back her hair she looked ill and heavyeyed with the extinguished air that sorrow gave her  gilbert had distressed perplexed her and driven her from home but what could be remembered save the warm affection he had lavished on her and the pain she had inflicted  uneasiness and sorrow necessarily unavowed had preyed on the poor girl for weeks in secret and even now she hardly presumed to give way relief almost luxury as it was to be pressed in those kind arms and suffered to weep freely for the champion of her younger days  when she had heard how he had thought of her to the last her emotion grew less controllable and albinia was touched by the idea that there had all along been a stifled preference  embellished as gilbert now was she could not but wish to believe that his affection had not been wasted and his constancy might well be touching in one of the heroes of the six hundred  at least genevieve had a most earnest and loving appetite for every detail and though the afternoon was nearly gone neither felt as if half an hour had passed when admittance was asked for mr kendal  it was a trying moment but genevieve was too simple genuine and grateful to pause in selfish embarrassment  had she toyed with gilberts affection she could not have met his father with such maidenly modesty and sweet sympathy and respect in her blushing cheek and downcast tearful eyes  he took her hand speaking in the kindest tone of his mellow voice my dear mrs kendal has told you what brings us here and how much we feel for and with you  so kind in you said genevieve faltering  poor child she has suffered grievously for want of fuller tidings said albinia she has been keeping her sorrow pent up all this time  she has acted as she has done throughout most consistently said mr kendal  my dear though it was inexpedient to show my sentiments i always respected my son for having placed his affections so worthily and though circumstances were unfortunately adverse i cannot thank you enough for your course of action and the influence you exercised  i never did murmured genevieve  not perhaps consciously but unswerving rectitude of conduct is one of the strongest earthly influences  he was sensible of it  he bade me tell you that whenever higher and better thoughts came to him you were connected with them and when to his surprise poor boy he found that he was thought to have distinguished himself his first thought was that it might be a step to your esteem  he desired me to thank you for all that you have been to him to entreat you to pardon the annoyance of which he was the occasion and to beg you to wear this for his sake if you could think of his presumption with forgiveness and toleration  those were his words but i trust you do not retain displeasure for though perhaps foolishly and obtrusively expressed it was sincere and lasting affection  oh sir exclaimed genevieve do not speak thus  what can i feel save that it will be my tenderest and deepest pride to have been so regarded  oh that i could thank him but clasping her hands together i cannot even thank you  the best way to gratify us he said will be always to remember that you have a home at willow lawn and a daughters place in our hearts  think of me like a father genevieve and he kissed her drooping forehead  oh mr kendal this is goodness  he turned to albinia to suggest it must be intolerable to be here at present  speak to mrs rainsforth let us take her home if it be but for a week  leaving him to make the proposition to genevieve albinia gained admittance to the other drawingroom which she found all over little children and their mother looking unequal to dispensing with their deputy  she said she had feared miss durant was looking ill and had something weighing on her spirits though she was always so cheerful and helpful but baby had not been well and mr rainsforth was not at all strong and her views had evidently taken no wider range  albinia began to think her proposal cruel and prefaced it by a few words on the state of the case  the little bit of romance touched the kind heart  mrs rainsforth was shocked to think of the grief the governess must have suffered in secret while aiding to bear her burdens and was resolved on letting her have this respite going eagerly to assure her that she could well be spared baby was better and papa was better and the children would be good  but genevieve knew too well how necessary she was and had been telling mr kendal of the poor little mothers anxieties with her many delicate children and her husbands failing health  she could not leave them with a safe conscience and she would not show how she longed after quiet the country and her aunt  she stood firm and albinia could not say that she was not right  mrs rainsforth was distressed though much relieved and was only pacified by the engagement that miss durant should when it was practicable spend a long holiday with her friends  at home said mr kendal and the responsive look of mournful gratitude from beneath the black dewy eyelashes dispelled all marvel at his sons enduring attachment  he was wonderfully patient when mrs rainsforth could not be content without mrs kendals maternal and medical opinion of the baby on the road to and from the nursery consulting her on all the mediterranean climates and telling her what each doctor had said of mr rainsforths lungs in the course of which miss durant and her romance were put as entirely out of the little ladys mind as if she had never existed  the next day the kendals set their faces homewards leaving maurice till the surgeons work should be done and fred as the aunts fondly hoped to be their nursling  but behold  sunday and monday colonel fred spent in bed smiling incessantly tuesday and wednesday on the sofa thursday in going about london friday he was off to liverpool saturday had sailed for canada  albinia was coming nearer to the home that was pulling her by the heartstrings  hadminster was past and she had heard the welcome wards all well from the servant who brought the carriage but how much more there was to know than sophys detailed letters could conveysophy whose sincerity though one of the most trustworthy things in the world was never quite to be relied on as to her own health or maurices conduct  at the gate there was a little chestnut curled being in a short black frock struggling to pull the heavy gate open with her plump arms and standing for one moment with her back to it screaming mamma papa then jumping and clapping her hands in ecstasy and oblivion that the swing of the gate might demolish her small person between it and the horse  but there was no time for fright  sophy caught her and secured the gate together and the first glimpse assured albinia that the hard gloom was absent  and there was maurice leaning against the iron rail of the hall steps but he hardly moved and his face was so strangely white and set that albinia caught him in her arms crying are you well my boy  sophy is he well  quite well said sophy but the boy had wriggled himself loose stood but for an instant to receive his fathers kiss and had hold of the sword  the long cavalry sabre was almost as tall as himself and he stood with both arms clasped round it but no sooner did he feel their eyes upon him than he turned about and ran upstairs  it was not gracious but they excused it they had their little albinia comfortably and childishly happy as yet without those troublesome kendal feelings that always demonstrated themselves in some perverse manner  and sophy stood among themthat brighter better sophy who had so long been obscured happy to have them at home talking and asking questions eagerly about the journey and describing the kindness of the dusautoys and the goodness of the children  have you heard from lucy asked mr kendal as albinia went in pursuit of her little boy  yespoor lucy  is there no letter from him  not for you papa  what  did he write to his uncle  no papahe wrote to me and to mr pettilove  cannot he be stopped papa  can he do any harm  mr dusautoy and mr pettilove think he can  you mean that he wishes to question the will  you may be quite secure my dear  nothing can be more safe  oh papa  i am so very glad  not to be able to hinder him was so dreadful when he wanted to pit lucy and me against you  i could never have looked at you  i should always have felt that you had something to forgive me  i could not well have confounded you with algernon my dear said mr kendal  what did pettilove mean  do you know  not exactly something about grandpapas old settlement which frightened the vicar though mrs dusautoy said that it was only that he fancied nobody could do anything right without his help  mr dusautoy is more angry with algernon than i thought he could be with anybody  no one but algernon would have ever thought of it said mr kendal i am sorry he has molested you my dear  have you any objection to let me see his letter  i kept it for you papa and a copy of my answer  i thought though i am not of age perhaps my saying i would have nothing to do with it might do some good  algernon magniloquently condoled with his sisterinlaw on the injustice from which she and her sister had suffered in consequence of the adverse influence which surrounded her brother and generously informed her that she had a champion to defeat the machinations against their rights  he had little doubt of the futility of the document and had written to the legal adviser of the late mr meadows to inquire whether the will of that gentleman did not bar any power on the part of his grandson to dispose of the property  she might rely on him not to rest until she should be put in possession of the estate unless it should prove to have been her grandfathers intention in case of the present melancholy occurrence that the elder sister should be the sole inheritrix and he congratulated her on having such a protector since under the unfortunate circumstances the sisters would have had no one to uphold their cause against their natural guardian  sophys answer was   dear algernon  i prefer my natural guardian to any other whatever  i shall for my part owe you no thanks for attempting to frustrate my dear brothers wishes and to raise an unbecoming dissension  i desire that no use of my name may be made and you may rest assured that i should find nothing so difficult to forgive as any such interference in my behalf                                             yours truly                                               sophia kendal   certainly said mr kendal no family illwill is complete unless money matters be brought in to aggravate it  do you think i did right and spoke strongly enough papa  quite strongly enough said mr kendal suppressing a smile  i hope you wrote kindly to lucy at the same time  one could not help that papa but i did say a great deal about the outrageous impropriety of raising the question because i thought algernon might be ashamed  riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt said mr kendal your grandfathers acquisitions have brought us little but evil hitherto and now i fear that our dear gilberts endeavour to break the net which bound us into that system of iniquity and oppression may cause alienation from poor lucy  sophy you must allow no apparent coldness or neglect on her part to keep you from writing often and affectionately  maurice here came down with his mother and as soon as there was a moments pause laid hold of the first book he met with and began   i do not see the justness of the analogy to which onuphrio refers but there are many parts of that vision on which i should wish to hear the explanations of philalethes   all broke out in amazement why maurice has mrs dusautoy been making a scholar of you  oh maurice was this your secret cried sophy  he had hidden his face in his mothers lap and when she raised it struggled to keep it down and she felt him sobbing and panting for breath  mr kendal stroked his hair and they tried to soothe him but he started up abruptly  i dont mean ever to be a plague again  so i did it  but there when ulick said it would be a comfort you are all going to cry again papa and all and thats worse and stamping his foot passionately he would have rushed out of the room but was held fast in his fathers arms and indeed tears were flowing fast from eyes that his brothers death had left dry  my child my dear child said mr kendal it is comfort  no one can rule you as by gods grace you can rule yourself and your endeavours to do this are the greatest blessing i can ask  one more kiss from his mother and she let him go  he did not know how to deal with emotion in himself and hated the sight of it in others so that it was better to let him burst away from them while with one voice they admired rejoiced and interrogated sophy  i know now she said the rosy glow mantling in her cheek it must have been mr omore  ah has he been with you said her father  only once said sophy her colour deepening but maurice has been in a great hurry every day to go to him and i saw there was some secret  one day susan asked me to prevent master maurice from teaching baby such ugly words that she could not sleepnot bad words but she thought they were latin  so i watched and i heard maurice singing out some of the legend of hiawatha and insisting on poor little awkey telling him what mishenahma spelt  poor little awk stared as well she might and obediently made the utmost efforts to say after him mishenahma king of fishes but he was terribly discomposed at getting nothing but niffeyninny king of fithes  i went to her rescue and asked what they were about but maurice thundered down on me all the delawares and mohawks and the choctaws and cameches and baby squeaked after him as well as she could till i fairly stopped my ears  i thought ulick must be reading the legend to him  now i see he must have been teaching him to read it  can it be possible said mr kendal  he could not read words of five letters without spelling  he always could do much more when he pleased than when he did not please said albinia  i believe the impulse to use his understanding was all that was wanting and i am very glad the impulse came from such a motive  mr kendal ordained that maurices reward should be learning latin from himself a perilous trial but it proved that mr kendal was really a good teacher for a child of spirit and courage and maurice had early come to the age when boys do better with man than with woman  he liked the honour and the awe of papas tutorship and learnt so well that his father never believed in his past dunceship but over studies that he did not deem sufficiently masculine he could be as troublesome as ever his attention absent and his restlessness most wearisome  to an ordinary eye he was little changed but his mother felt that the great victory of the will had been gained and that his self was endeavouring to get the better of the spirit of insubordination and mischief  night after night she found him sleeping with the balaklava sword by his side and his hand clasped over it and he always crept out of the way of crimean news though that he gathered up the facts was plain when he committed his sovereign to ulick with a request that it might be devoted to the comforts preparing to be sent to the 25th lancers  ulick wished him to consult his mother but this he repelled  he could not endure the sight of a tear in her eye and she could not restrain them when that chord was touched  it was a propensity she much disliked the more because she thought it looked like affectation beside sophy whose feelings never took that course but the more illtimed the tears the more they would come at the most commonplace condolence or remote allusion  it was the effect of the long strain on her powers and the severe shock coming suddenly after so much pressure and fatigue moreover her habits had been so long disorganized that her time seemed blank and she could not rouse herself from a feeling of languor and depression  then gilbert had been always on her mind whether at home or absent and it did not seem at first as if she had enough to fill up time or thoughtsshe absolutely found herself doing nothing because there was nothing she cared to do  mr kendals first object was the fulfilment of gilberts wishes but albinia soon felt how much easier it is for women and boys to make schemes than for men to bring them to effect and how rash it is hastily to condemn those who tolerate abuses  the whole was carefully looked over with a surveyor and it was only then understood how complicated were the tenures and how varied the covenants of the numerous small tenements which old mr meadows had amassed  it was not possible to be free of the legal difficulties under at least a year and plans of drainage might be impeded for want of other peoples consent  even if all had been smooth the sacrifice of income by destroying tibbs alley and reducing the number of cottages would be considerable  meantime the inspection had brought to light worse iniquities and greater wretchedness than mr kendal had imagined and his eagerness to set to work was tenfold  his table was heaped with sanitary reports and his fits of abstraction were over the components of bad air or builders estimates  it only depended on ulick to have resumed his intimacy at willow lawn but the habit once broken was not resumed  he was often there but never without invitation and he was not always to be had  he had less leisure he was senior clerk and the junior was dull and untrained and he often had work to do far into the evening  he looked bright and well as though possessed of a sense of being valuable in his own place more conducive to happiness than even congeniality of employment and sophy though now and then disappointed at his nonappearance always had a good reason for it and continued to justify mr dusautoys boast that the air of the hill had made another woman of her  visiting cards had of course come in numbers to willow lawn but albinia seemed to have caught her husbands aversions and it would be dangerous to say how long it was before she lashed herself into setting off for a round of calls  nothing surprised her more than miss goldsmiths reception conscious of her neglect she expected the stiff manner to be more formal than ever but the welcome was almost warm and there was something caressing in her fears that miss kendal would be tired mr goldsmith was not quite well there were threatenings of gout and his sister had persuaded him to visit the relations at bristol next week everything might safely be trusted to young more and therewith came such praise of his steadiness and ability that albinia did not know which way to look when all was ascribed to mr kendals great kindness to him  it was too palpable to be altogether pleasant  sophia kendal was heiress enough to be a very desirable connexion for the bank albinia was afraid she should see through the ladys graciousness and took her leave in haste but sophy only said do you remember mamma when the goldsmiths thought we unsettled him  before albinia had disarmed her reply of the irony on the tip of her tongue the omnibus came lumbering round the corner and a voice proceeded from the rear the door flew open and there was a rapid exit  face and voice light step and gay bearing all were fredthe empty sleeve the sole resemblance to the shattered convalescent of a few weeks back  there albinia  i said you should see her first  you havent got any change have you the last being addressed either to albinia the omnibus conductor or a lady who made a tender of two shillings while albinia ordered the luggage on to willow lawn though something was faintly said about the inn  and there cried fred with an emphatic twist of his moustache isnt she all i ever told you  the last thing was a brick said albinia laughing as she looked at the smiling confiding animated face not the less pleasant for a french canadian grace that recalled genevieve  the right article for building a hut i hope she said merrily  but how and when could you have come  this morning from liverpool  we did not mean to storm you in this manner we meant to have settled ourselves at the inn and walked down emily was very particular about it  but you see when he saw you he forgot all my lectures said emily taking his welcome for granted  very proper of him  but fred i dont quite believe it yet  how long is it since we parted  six weeks just enough to go to canada and back with a fortnight in the middle to spare  and pray how long has mrs fred existed  three weeks and two days and turning half round to give her the benefit of his words it was on purely philanthropic principles because i could not tie my own necktie  now could i said emily pleadingly to sophynow could i let him go back again alone when he came so helpless and looking so dreadfully ill  and what are you going to do asked albinia  you cant join again  join why not  heres a hand for a horse and an arm for a wife and the rest will be done much better for me than ever it was before  but with her and at sebastopol  thats the very thing cried the colonel again turning about nothing will serve her but to show how a backwoodsmans daughter can live in a hut  and what will the general say  the general cried emily will endure me better as a fact than as a prospect and we will teach him that a lady is not all made of nerves and of fancies  see what he will say if we let him into our paradise  fred brightened though albinias inquiry had for a moment taken him a little aback  the one being whom he dreaded was general ferrars for whom he cared a thousand times more than for his own elder brother and he was soon speculating with his usual insouciance as to how his announcement might have been received by his lordship and whether the aunts would look at them as they went through london  mr kendal met them at the gate amazed at the avalanche of luggage but well pleased for he had grown very fond of fred and had been very anxious about him thinking him broken and enfeebled for life and hardly expecting him to return from his mad expedition  he was slow to believe his eyes and ears when he beheld a hale handsome vigorous man full of life and activity but his welcome and congratulations were of the warmest  he could far better stand a sudden inroad than if he had had to meditate for a week on entertaining the bride  not that the bride wanted entertainment except waiting upon her husband who let himself be many degrees less handy than at malta for the pleasure of her attentions  perhaps the person least gratified was maurice for the child shrank with shy reverence from him whom his brother had saved and would as soon have thought of making a plaything of gilberts sword as of having fun with the survivor  the sight of such a merry man was a shock and he abruptly repelled all attempts at playing with him and kept apart with a big book on a chair before him a kendalism for which he amply compensated when familiarity had diminished his awe  mr kendal though little disposed to exert himself to talk liked to watch his wife reviving into animation and sophy taking a full share in the glee with which emily enjoyed turning the laugh against the goodnatured soldier  in the midst of their flush of joy there was a tender consideration about the young couple such as to hinder their tone from jarring  indeed it was less consideration than fellowfeeling for gilbert kendal had become enshrined in the depths of freds heart while to emily the visit was wellnigh a pilgrimage  all her heroworship was directed to the youth who had guarded her soldiers life nursed him in his sickness and as he averred inspired him with serious thoughts  poor failing timid penitent gilbert was to her a very st george and every relic of him was viewed with reverence she composed a countenance for him from his fathers fine features and fitted the fragments of his history into an ideal till sophy after being surprised and gratified began to view gilbert through a like halo and to rank him with his twin brother  friendship was a new and agreeable phase of life to sophy who found a suitable companion in such an openhearted person simpler in nature and fresher than herself free from english commonplaces though older and of more standing she expanded and brightened wonderfully and emily imagining her a female gilbert was devoted to her and thought her a marvel of learning depth goodness and humility the more striking for her tinge of grave pensiveness  why albinia said the colonel didnt i hear that it was your handsome daughter who is married  yes poor lucy was always called our pretty one  more admired than her sister  why she never could have had a countenance  yes said albinia highly gratified by the opinion of such a connoisseur  i always told winifred that sophy was the beauty but she has only lately had health or animation to set her off  i declare when we overtook you in the street she looked a perfect spanish princess in her black robes and great shady hat  you ought always to keep her in black  ha  emily what are you smiling at  his wife looked up into his face with mischievous shyness in her eyes as if she wanted him to say what would be a liberty in her somebody else had overtaken the ladies nearly at the same moment and albinia exulted in perceiving that the embellishment had been observed by others besides herself  she did not look so severe but that fred was encouraged to repeat only lately had health or animation  when irish winds blow this way i fancybut what will the aunts say  they are not sophys aunts whatever they are to you  what will kendal say which is more to the purpose  oh he saw it first he will be delighted but you must not say a word to him for it cant come to anything just now  albinia was thus confirmed in her anticipations and the bridal pair only wishing everybody to be as happy as themselves took the matter up with such vivid interest and amusement that she was rather afraid of a manifestation such as to shock either her husband or the parties themselves but fred was too much of a gentleman and emily too considerate for anything perilously marked  only she thought emily need not have been so decided in making room for ulick next to sophy when they were all looking out at the young moon at the conservatorydoor that evening  and then emily took her husbands arm and insisted on going down the garden to be introduced to english nightingales and though she was told they never had come there in the memory of man she was bent on doing as she would be done by and drew him alone the silvered paths among the black shadows of the trees and ulick asked sophy if she wished to go too  she looked as if she should like it very much he fetched a couple of cloaks ont of the hall put her into one and ran after mrs ferrars with the other  well thought albinia as she stood at the conservatorydoor how much more boldness and tact some people have than others  if i had lived a hundred years i should not have managed it so well  whats become of them said mr kendal as she went back to the drawingroom  gone to listen for nightingales  nightingales  how could you let them go into the riverfog  emily was bent upon it she is too much of a bride not to have her way  umph  i wonder sophy was so foolish  they came back in a quarter of an hour  no nightingales and fred was indulging in reminiscences of bullfrogs the two ladies were rapturous on the effect of the moonbeams in the ripple of the waters and the soft furry white mist rising over the meadows  ulick shivered and leant over the fire to breathe a drier air bantering the ladies for their admiration and declaring that mrs ferrars had taken the moan of an imprisoned housedog for the nightingale which he disdainfully imitated with buzz zizz and guggle assuring her she had had no loss but he looked rather white and chilled  sophy whispered something to her papa who rang the bell and ordered in wine and hot water  there emily said albinia when he had taken his leave what shall we say to your nightingales if mr omore catches his ague again  oh there are moments when people dont catch agues said fred he would be a poor fellow to catch an ague after all that though bythebye it is not a place to go to at night without a cigar  albinia was on thorns lest sophy should be offended but though her cheeks lighted up and she was certainly aware of some part of their meaning either she did not believe in the possibility of any one bantering her or else the assumption was more agreeable than the presumption was disagreeable  she endured with droll puzzled dignity when fred teased her anxiety the next day to know whether mr omore had felt any ill effects and it really appeared as if she liked him better for what might have been expected to be a dire affront but then he was a man whose manner enabled to do and say whatever he pleased  emily never durst enter on the subject with her but had more than one confidential little gossip with albinia and repeatedly declared that she hoped to be in england when it took place  indeed that weeks visit made them all so intimate that it was not easy to believe how recent was the acquaintance  the aunts had been so much disappointed at freds desertion so much discomfited at his recovery contrary to all predictions and so much annoyed at his marriage that it took all their kindness and his crimean fame to make them invite him and his colonial wife to the family office to be present at the royal distribution of medals however the good ladies did their duty and emily and sophy parted with promises of letters  the beginning of the correspondence was as full a description of the presentation of the medals as could be given by a person who only saw one figure wherever she went and to whom the great incident of the day was that the gracious and kindhearted queen had herself fastened the lefthanded colonels medal as well as emily could have done it herself  there was another medal with two clasps that came to bayford and which was looked at in pensive but not unhappy silence you shall have it some day maurice but not now said mr kendal and all felt that now meant his own lifetime  it was placed where gilbert would well have liked to see it beside his brother edmunds watch  emily made mrs annesley and miss ferrars more fond of her in three days than eleven years had made them of winifred too fond indeed for they fell to preaching to fred upon the horrors of sebastopol till they persuaded him that he was a selfish wretch and brought him to decree that she should stay with them during his absence  but as emily observed that was not what she left home for she demolished his arguments with a small amount of playing at petulance and triumphantly departed for the east leaving aunt mary crying over her as a predestined victim  the last thing fred did before sailing was to send albinia a letter from his brother that she might see how very kind and cordial belraven was besides something that concerned her more nearly  lord belraven was civil when it cost him nothing and had lately regarded his inconvenient younger brother with favour as bringing him distinction and having gained two steps without purchase removed too by his present rank and the pension for his wound from being likely to become chargeable to him so he had written such brotherly congratulations that good honest fred was quite affected he was even discursive enough to mention some connexions of the young man who had been with fred in the crimea a mr cavendish dusautoy a very good sort of fellow who gave excellent dinners and was a pleasant yachting companion  his wife was said to be very pretty and pleasing but she had arrived at genoa very unwell had been since confined and was not yet able to see any one  it was said to be the effect of her distress for the death of her brother and the estrangement from her family who had behaved very ill about his property  had not albinia ferrars married into that family  albinia knew enough of her noble relative to be aware that good dinners and obsequiousness were the way to his esteem and algernons was the sort of arrogance that would stoop to adore a coronet  all this was nothing however to the idea of lucy ill in that strange place with no one to care for her but her hard master  albinia sometimes thought of going to find her out at genoa but this was too utterly wild and impossible and nothing could be done but to write letters of affectionate inquiry enclosing them to lord belraven  algernons answer was solemn and as brief as he could make anything he was astonished that the event bad escaped the notice of the circle at bayford since he believed it had appeared in all the principal european newspapers and his time had been so fully occupied that he had imagined that intimation sufficient since it was evident from the tone of the recent correspondence that the family of bayford were inclined to drop future intercourse  he was obliged for the inquiries for lucy and was happy to say she was recovering favourably though the late unfortunate events and the agitation caused by letters from home had affected her so seriously that they had been detained at genoa for nearly four months to his great inconvenience instead of pushing on to florence and rome  it had been some compensation that he had become extremely intimate with that most agreeable and superior person lord belraven who had consented to become sponsor to his son  lucy wrote to albinia  poor thing the letter was the most childishly expressed and the least childishly felt she had ever written its whole aspect was weak and wobegone yet there was less selfpity and more endeavour to make the best of it than before she had the dearest little baby in the world but he was very delicate and she wished mamma would send out an english nurse for she could not bear that italian womanher black eyes looked so fierce and she was sure it was not safe to have those immense pins in her hair  expense was nothing but she should never be happy till she had an englishwoman about him especially now that she was getting better and algernon would want her to come out again with him  dear algernon he had lost the easter at rome for her sake but perhaps it was a good thing for he was often out in lord belravens yacht and she could be quiet with baby  she did wish baby to have had her dear brothers names but algernon would not consent  next tuesday he was to be christened and then followed a string of mighty names long enough for a spanish princess beginning with belraven  lucy dusautoys dreary condition in the midst of all that wealth could give was a contrast to emily ferrars buoyant delight in the burrow which was her first married home and proved a paradise to many a stray officer aye maybe to lieutenantgeneral sir william ferrars himself  her letters were charming especially a detail of fred meeting bryan omore coming out of the trenches grim hungry and tired having recently kicked a newly alighted shell down from the parapet with the cool words be off with you you ugly baste you of his wolfish appetite after having been long reduced to simple rations though he kept a curly black lamb loose about his hut because he hadnt the heart to kill it and it served him for bed if not for board all his rugs and blankets having flown off in the hurricane or been given to the wounded he had been quite affronted at the suggestion that a galway pig was as well lodged as himselfit was an insult to any respectable irish animal  albinia sent maurice to summon ulick to enjoy the letter in store for him  he looked grave and embarrassed and did not light up as usual at bryans praises  he said that his aunt who had written to him on business had given a bad account of mr goldsmith but albinia hardly thought this accounted for his preoccupation and was considering how to probe it when her brother maurice opened the door  ulick omore thats right the very man i was in search of  hows winifred maurice  getting on wonderfully well  i really think she is going to make a start after all and she is in such spirits herself  and the boy  oh a thumping great fellow  i promise you hell be a match for your maurice  i do believe it is to reward winifred for sparing you in the spring when we wanted you so much  come sit down and wait for edmund  no ive not a moment to stay  im to meet bury again at woodside at six oclock he drove me there and i walked on looking in at your lodgings by the way ulick  im not there now  i am keeping guard at the bank  so they told me  well i hope your guard is not too strict for you to come over to fairmead on sunday we want you to do our boy the kindness to be his godfather  sophy blushed with approving gratitude  i dont consider that it will be a sinecurehe squalls in such a characteristic manner that i am convinced he will rival his cousin here in all amiable and amenable qualities so i consider it particularly desirable that he should be well provided with great disciplinarians  you certainly could not find any one more accomplished in teaching dunces to read said albinia  when their mammas have taught them already added ulick laughing thank you but you know i cant sleep out hyder ali and i are responsible for a big chest of sovereigns and all the rest of it  nor could i lodge you at present so we are agreed  my proposition is that you should drive my sister over on sunday morning  my wife is wearying for a sight of her and she has not been at fairmead on a sunday since she left it eh albinia  i suppose for such a purpose it is not wrong to use the horse she said her eyes sparkling  and you might put my friend maurice between you if you cant go out pleasuring without him  i scorn you sir maurice is as good as gold i shall leave him at home i think to prove that i can  thats the reward of merit exclaimed sophy  she expects my children to corrupt him quoth mr ferrars  for shame maurice thats on purpose to make me bring him  well well see what papa says and if he thinks the new black horse strong enough or to be trusted with mr omore  i only wish twas a jaunting car cried ulick  and whats the boys name to be  not belraven i conclude like my unfortunate grandsonmaurice i hope  no the precedent of his namesake would be too dangerous  i believe he is to be edmund ulick  dont take it as too personal ulick for it was the name of our mutual connexion  i take the personal part though maurice and thank you said albinia and mr ferrars looked more happy and joyous than any time since his wifes health had begun to fail  always cheerful and almost always taking matters up in the most lively point of view it was only by comparison that want of spirits in him could be detected and it was chiefly by the vanishing of a certain careworn anxious expression about his eyes and by the ring of his merry laugh that albinia knew that he thought better of his wifes state than for the last five or six years  albinia and ulick drove off at six oclock on a lovely summer sunday morning with maurice between them in a royal state of felicity that long fresh drive past summer hayfields sleeping in their silver bath of dew and villages tardily awakening to the wellearned sunday rest was not the least pleasant part of the day and yet it was completely happy not even clouded by one outbreak of master maurice  luckily for him mary had a small class who absorbed her superabundant love of rule and little alby was a fairhaired applecheeked maiden of five who awoke both admiration and chivalry and managed to coquet with him and ulick both at once so that willie had no disrespect to his sisters to resent  he was exemplary at church wellbehaved at dinner and so little on his mammas mind that she had a delightful renewal of her acquaintance with the sundayschool and a leisurable gossip with mrs reid and the two miss reids collectively and individually but the best of all was a long quiet teteatete with winifred  after the evening service mr ferrars himself carried his newlychristened boy back to the mother and paused that his sister might come with him and they might feel like the old times when the three had been alone together  yes said winifred when he had left them it is very pretty playing at it but one cannot be the same  nor would one exactly wish it said albinia though i think you are going to be more the same  perhaps said winifred the worst of being ill is that it does wear ones husband so  when he came in and tried to make me fancy we were gone back to willies time i could not help thinking how different you both looked  well so much the better and more respectable said albinia  you know i always wanted to grow old i dont want to stop short like your sister anne who looks as much the child of the house as ever  i wish you had as few cares as anne  look i declare thats a grey hair  i know  i like it now sophy is growing young and im growing old it is all correct  old indeed ejaculated winifred looking at her fair fresh complexion and bright features dont try for that when even edmund is not grey  yes he is said albinia gravely malta sowed many white threads in his black head and worry about those buildings has brought more  worry im very sorry to hear of it  yes the tenures are so troublesome and everybody is so cantankerous  if he wanted to set up some pernicious manufacture it could not be worse  the osbornes after having lived with tibbs alley close to them all their lives object to the almshouses  mr baron wont have the new drains carried through his little strip of land  the town council think we are going to poison the water and pettilove and everybody else who owns a wretched tenement that we shall increase the wants of their tenants and lower their rents  if it be carried through it will be by that sheer force in going his own way that edmund can exert when he chooses  and he will  o yes no fear of that he goes on avoiding seeing or hearing what he has not to act upon but worse than all are the people themselves tibbs alley all has notice to quit but none of them can be got rid of till martinmas and some not till ladyday and the beerhouse people are in such a rage  the turnout of the publichouses come and roar at our gate on saturday nights and they write up things on the wall against him and one day they threw over into the garden what little awkey called a poor dear dead pussy  i believe they tell them all sorts of absurd things about his tyranny poor creatures  cant you get it stopped  edmund wont summon any one because he thinks it would do more harm than good  he says it will pass off but it grieves him more than he shows he thinks he could once have made himself more popular but i dont know it is a horrid set  i thought you said he was in good spirits  and so he is he never gets depressed and unwilling to be spoken to he is ready to take interest in everything and always so busy  when i remember how he never seemed to be obliged to attend to anything i laugh at the contrast and yet he goes about it all so gravely and slowly that it never seems like a change  in this and other home talk nearly an hour had passed when mr ferrars returned  are you come to tell me to go said albinia  not particularly he said in a tone that made her laugh  no no said winifred  i want a great deal more of her  where have you been  i have been to see old wilks ulick walked down with me  bythebye albinia what nonsense has freds wife been talking to his brother  emily does not talk nonsense fired up albinia colouring nevertheless  the worse for her then  however it seems bryan has disturbed this poor fellow very much by congratulating him on his prospects at willow lawn  oh that is what made him so distant and cautious is it laughed albinia  i think mrs emily might as well not have betrayed it  betrayed  what could have passed  oh  emily and fred saw it as plain as i did  why it does not do credit to your discernment maurice papa found it out long ago and told me  kendal did  yes that he did and did not mind the notion at all rather liked it in fact  well said mr ferrars in a different tone it is a very queer business  i certainly did not think the lad showed any symptoms  he said he had heard gossip about it before and had tried to be careful his aunt talked to him once but as he said it would be nothing but the rankest treason to think of such a thing on the terms on which he is treated  ay thats it said albinia he acts most perfectly  perfectly indeed if that were acting said mr ferrars  and what made him speak to you asked winifred  he wanted to consult me  he said it was very hard on him for all the pleasure he had came from his intercourse with willow lawn and he could not bear to keep at a distance because it looked as if he bad not forgotten the old folly about the caricature but he was afraid of the report coming to your ears or mr kendals because you would think it so wrong and shameful an abuse of your kindness  and thats his whole concern  so he told me  and what advice did you give him  i told him bayford was bent on gossip and no one heeded it less than my respected brother and sister  that was famous of you maurice  i was afraid you would have put it upon his honour and the state of his own heart  sooth to say i did not think his heart appeared very ticklish  oh  maurice maurice  but youve not been there to see the hot fits and the cold fits  it is a very fine thermometer whether he says sophy or miss kendal  and you say edmund perceived this  much you would trust my unassisted cuteness  i tell you he did and that it will make him happier than anything  very well then my advice will have done no harm  i did not think there had been so much selfcontrol in an irishman  had he not better say so much blindness in the rector of fairmead laughed albinia  and pray what course is the affair to take  the present i suppose  some catastrophe will occur at last to prove to him that we honour him and dont view it as outrageous presumption and thenoh there can be no doubt that he will have a share in the bank and sophy may buy toleration for his round o after all he has the best of it as to ancestry and we kendals need not turn up our noses at banking  i think he will be too proud to address her except on equality as to money matters  pride is sometimes quelled and love free said albinia  no no content yourself with having given the best advice in the world with your eyes fast shut  and albinia went home in high spirits     chapter xxix    not long afterwards ulick omore was summoned to bristol where his uncle had become suddenly worse but he had only reached hadminster when a telegraph met him with the news of mr goldsmiths death and orders to remain at his post  he came to the kendals in the evening in great grief he had really come to love and esteem his uncle and he was very unhappy at having lost the chance of a reconciliation for his mother  as her chief friend and confidant he knew that she regarded the alienation of her own family as the punishment of her disobedient marriage and that his own appointment had been valued chiefly as an opening towards fraternal feeling and reproached himself for not having made more direct efforts to induce his uncle to enter into personal intercourse with her  if i had only ventured it before he went to bristol he said i was a fool not to have done so and there the goldsmiths detest the very name of us  why could they not have telegraphed for me  i might have heard what would have done my mothers heart good for the rest of her life  i am sure my poor uncle wanted to ease his mind  may he not have sent some communication direct to her  i trust he did  i have long thought he only kept her aloof from habit and felt kindly towards her all the time  and never could persuade himself to make a move towards her until too late said albinia  yes  nothing comes home to one more than the words agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him  if once one comes to think theres creditable pride in holding out theres no end to it or else too much end  mr goldsmith was persevering in the example his father had set him said mr kendal  ay my mother never blamed either and im afraid if the truth were told my father was hot enough too though it would all have been bygones with him long ago if they would have let it  but i was thinking just then of my own foolishness last winter when i would not grant you it was pride mrs kendal for fear i should have to repent of it  what has brought you to see that it was asked she  one comes to a better mind when the fit is off he said  i hope i will not be as bad next time  i hope we shall never give you a next time said albinia for neither party is comfortable perched on a high horse  and you see continued ulick it is hard for us to give up our pride because it is the only thing weve got of our own and has been meat drink and clothing to us for many a year  so no wonder you make the most of it  true i think a very high born and very rich man might be humble said ulick so meditatively that they laughed but sophy said  no that is not a paradox the real difficulty is not in willingly yielding but in taking what we cannot help  well said ulick i hope it is not pride not to intend working under andrew goldsmith  do you consider that as your fate asked albinia  never my fate said ulick quickly hardly even my alternative for he would like to put up a notice no irish need apply  we had enough of each other last winter  and do you suppose said mr kendal that mr goldsmith has left your position exactly the same  ive no reason to think otherwise  i refused all connexion with the bank if it was to interfere with my name  i dont think it unlikely that he may have left me a small compliment in the way of shares but if so i shall sell them and make them keep me at oxford  im not too old yet  then the work of these four years is wasted said mr kendal gravely  no indeed cried ulick not if it takes me where ive always longed to be  or if not i flatter myself im accountant enough to be an agent in my own country  anything to get away from here said albinia with a shade of asperity provoked by the spirit of enterprise in his voice  after all it is a bit of a place said ulick and the office parlour is not just a paradise  then tis all on such a narrow scale too little to absorb one and too much to let one do anything else i see how larger transactions might be engrossing but this is mere cramping and worrying i know i could do better for my family in the end than by what i can screw out of my salary now and if it is no longer to give my poor mother a sense of expiation as she calls it why then the cagedoor is open  his eyes glittered and sophy exclaimed yes and now the training is over it has made you fitter to fly  it has he said and im thankful for it  without being here i would never have learnt applicationnor some better things i hope  they scarcely saw him again till after the funeral when late in the day he came into the drawingroom and saying that his aunt was pretty well and composed he knelt down on the floor with the little awk and silently built up a tower with her wooden bricks  his hand trembled nervously at first but gradually steadied as the elevation became critical and a smile of interest lighted his face as he became absorbed in raising the structure to the last brick holding back the eager child with one hand lest she should overthrow it completion triumph a shock a downfall  well cried the elder albinia unable to submit to the suspense  telle est la vie answered ulick smiling sadly as he passed his hand over his brow  its too bad of him broke out mrs kendal  i thought you were prepared said sophy severely disappointed to see him so much discomposed  how should i be prepared said he petulantly for the whole concern house and bank and all the rest of it  left to you was the cry  every bit of it and an annuity apiece charged on it to my mother and aunt for their lives  my aunt told me how it came about  it was all that fellow andrews fault  or misfortune murmured albinia  my poor uncle had made a will in andrews favour long before my time and at bristol he wanted to make some arrangement for my mother and for me but it seems mr andrew took exception at mewould not promise to continue me on nor to give me a share in the business and at last my uncle was so much disgusted that be sent for a lawyer and cut andrew out of his will altogether  my aunt says he went on asking for me and it was andrews fault that they wrote instead of telegraphing  you cant think what kind messages he sent to me and ulicks eyes filled with tears  my poor uncle away from home and with that selfish fellow  did he send any message to your mother  yes he told my aunt to write to her that he was sorry they had been strangers so long and thatid been like a son to him  im sure i wish i had been  i dare say he would have let me if i had not flown out about my o  i could have saved changing it without making such an intolerable row and then he might have died more at peace with the world  at peace with you at least he did  i trust so  but if i could only have been by his side and felt myself a comfort and thanked him with all my heart  maybe he would have listened to me and not have sown illwill between andrew and me by giving neither what we would like  do you expect us to be sorry  nay i came to be helped out of my ingratitude and discontent at finding the cagedoor shut and myself chained to the oar for as things are left i could not get it off my hands without giving up my mothers interests and my aunts  besides my poor uncle left me an entreaty to keep things up creditably like himself and do justice by the bank  it is as if poor man it was an idol that he had been high priest to and wanted me to be the sameay and sacrifice too  nay there are two ways of working two kinds of sacrifice and besides you are still working for your mother  so i am but without the hope she had before  to be sure it would be affluence at home or would be if she could have it in her own hands  little redmond shall have the best of educations  and we must mind there is something in advance by the time bryan wants to purchase his company  albinia asked how his aunt liked the arrangement  it seemed that andrew had offended her nearly as much as her brother and that she was clinging to ulick as her great comfort and support he did not like to stay long away from her but he had rushed down to willow lawn to avoid the jealous congratulations of the cousinhood  you will hardly keep from glad people said albinia  you must shut yourself up if you cannot be congratulated  how rejoiced mr dusautoy will be  whatever is is best sighed ulick  i shall mind less when the first is past  i must go and entertain all these people at dinner and he groaned  good evening  heigh ho  i wonder if our banshee will think me worth keening for  i hope she will have no occasion yet said albinia as he shut the door but she will be a very foolish banshee if she does not for she will hardly find such another omore  well sophy my dear  we should have missed him said sophy as grave as a judge  albinias heart beat high with the hope that ulick would soon perceive sufficient consolation for remaining at bayford but of course he could make no demonstration while miss goldsmith continued with him  she made herself very dependent on him and he devoted his evenings to her solace  he had few leisure moments for the settlement of his affairs occupied him and full attention was most important to establish confidence at this critical juncture when it might be feared that his youth his nation and andrew goldsmiths murmurs might tell against him  mr kendal set the example of putting all his summer rents into his hands and used his influence to inspire trust and fortunately the world had become so much accustomed to transacting affairs with him that the country business seemed by no means inclined to fall away  still there was much hard work and some perplexity the bristol connexion made themselves troublesome and the ordinary business was the heavier from the clerks being both so young and inexperienced that he was obliged to exercise close supervision  it was guessed too that he was not happy about the effect of the influx of wealth at home and that he feared it would only add to the number of horses and debts  he soon looked terribly fagged and harassed and owned that he envied mr hope who had just received the promise of a district church in course of building under colonel burys auspices about four miles from fairmead  to work his way through the university and take holy orders had been ulicks ambition he would gladly have endured privation for such an object and it did seem hard that such aspirations should be so absolutely frustrated and himself forced into the stream of uncongenial unintellectual toil in so obscure and uninviting a sphere  the resignation of all lingering hope of escape and the effort to be contented cost him more than even his original breaking in and mr kendal one day found him sitting in his little office parlour unable to think or to speak under a terrible visitation of his autumnal tormentor browague  this made mr kendal take to serious expostulation  it was impossible to go on in this way why did he not send for a brother to help him  ulick could not restrain a smile at the fruitlessness of thinking of assistance of this kind from his elder brothers and as to little redmond the only younger one still to be disposed of he hoped to do better things for him  then send for a sister  he hoped he might bring rose over when his aunt was gone but he could not shut those two up together at any price  then said mr kendal rather angrily get an experienced trustworthy clerk so as to be able to go from home or give yourself some relaxation  yes i inquired about such a person but theres the salary and where would be the chance of getting redmond to school  i think your father might see to that  ulick had no answer to make to this  the legacy to mrs omore might nearly as well have been thrown into the sea  well said mr kendal walking about the room why dont you keep a horse  as a less costly animal than brother sister or clerk said ulick laughing  your health will prove more costly than all the rest if you do not take care  well my aunt told me it would be respectable and promote confidence if i lived like a gentleman and kept my horse  ill see about it said ulick in a more persuadable tone  the seeing about it resulted in the arrival of a genuine product of county galway a longlegged rawboned hunter with a wild frightened eye quivering suspiciouslooking ears and an illomened name compounded of kill and of kick which maurice alone endeavoured to pronounce also an outside car very nearly as good as new  this last exceeded ulicks commission but it had been such a bargain that connel had not been able to resist it indeed it cost more in coming over than the original price but ulick nearly danced round it promising mrs and miss kendal that when new cushioned and new painted they would find it beat everything  he was not quite so envious of mr hope when he devoted the early morning hours to killyekickye as the incorrect world called his steed and if the truth must be told he first began to realize the advantages of wealth when he set his name down among the subscribers to the hounds  nor was this the only subscription to which he was glad to set his name there were others where mr dusautoy wanted funds and mr kendals difficulties were lessened by having another lord of the soil on his side  some exchanges brought land enough within their power to make drainage feasible and ulick started the idea that it would be better to locate the almshouses at the top of the hill on the site of madame belmarches old house than to place them where tibbs alley at present was close to the river and far from church  mr kendals plans were unpopular and two or three untoward circumstances combined to lead to his being regarded as a tyrant  he could not do things gently and had not a conciliating manner  had he been more free spoken real oppression would have been better endured than benefits against peoples will  he interfered to prevent some sunday trading and some of the tibbs alley tenants who ought to have gone at midsummer chose to stay on and set him at defiance till they had to be forcibly ejected whereupon ulick omore showed that he was not thoroughly anglicised by demanding if under such circumstances it was safe to keep the window shutters unclosed at night mr kendals head was such a beautiful mark under the lamp  if not a mark for a pistol he was one for the disaffected blackguard papers which made up a pathetic case of a helpless widow with her bed taken away from under her ending with certain vague denunciations which were read with roars of applause at the last beer shop which could not be cleared till christmas while the closing of the rest sent herds thither and papers were nightly read representing the nabob expelling the industrious from the beloved cottages of their ancestors by turns to swell his own overgrown garden or to found a convent whence as a disguised jesuit he meant to convert all bayford to popery  as albinia wrote to genevieve they were in a state of siege for only in the middle of the day did mr kendal allow the womankind to venture out without an escort the evening was disturbed by howlings at the gate and all sorts of petty acts of spite were committed in the garden such as injuring trees stealing fruit and carrying off the childrens rabbits  let that be as it might genevieve owned herself glad to come to hospitable willow lawn though sorry for the cause  poor mr rainsforth after vainly striving to recruit his health at torquay during the vacation had been sentenced to give up his profession and ordered to madeira and genevieve was upon the world again  the kendals claimed her promise of a long visit or rather that she should come home and take time and choice in making any fresh engagement nay that she should not even inquire for a situation till after christmas  and after staying to the last moment when she could help the rainsforths she proposed to spend a day or two with her aunt at the convent and then come to her friends at bayford  mr kendal drove his ladies to fetch her  he had lately indulged the household with a large comfortable open carriage with two horses a rival to mr omores notable car where he used to drive in an easy lounging fashion on one side with hyder ali to balance him on the other  this was a grand shopping day an endless business and as the autumn day began to close in even mr kendals model patience was nearly exhausted before they called for their little friend  there was something very sweet and appropriate in her appearance her dress without presuming to share their mourning did not insult it by gay colouring it was a quiet dark violet and white checked silk a black mantle and black velvet bonnet with a few green leaves to the lilac flowers and the face when at rest was softly pensive but ready to respond with cheerful smiles and grateful looks  she had become more english and had dropped much foreign accent and idiom but without losing her characteristic grace and power of disembarrassing those to whom she spoke and in a few moments even sophy had lost all sense of meeting under awkward or melancholy circumstances and was talking eagerly to her dear old sympathizing friend  there was a great exchange of tidings genevieve had much to tell of her dear rainsforths the many vicissitudes of anxiety in which she had shared and of the childrens ways of taking the parting and of the dear little fanny who seemed to have carried away so large a piece of her susceptible heart that sophy could not help breaking out well i do think it is very hard to make yourself a bit of a mothers heart only to have it torn out again  albinia smiled and said after all sophy happiness in this world is in such loving only we dont find it out till the rent has been made  and some people can get fond of anything said sophy  im sure said genevieve every one is so kind to me i cant help it  i was not blaming you said sophy  people are the better for it but i cannot like except where i esteem and that does not often come  oh dont you think so cried genevieve  i dont mean moderate approval  that may extend far and with it goodwill but there is a deep concentrated feeling which i dont believe those who like every one can ever have and that is life  perhaps the deepening twilight favoured the utterance of her feelings for as they were descending a hill she said mamma that was the place where maurice was brought back to me  she had before passed it in silence but in the dark she was not afraid of betraying the expression that the thrill of exquisite recollection brought to her countenance and leaning back in her corner indulged in listening to the narration as albinia unaware of the special point of the episode related maurices desperate enterprise going on to dilate on the benefit of having mr omore at the bank rather than andrew goldsmith  ah said genevieve it is he who wants to pull down our dear old house  i shall quarrel with him  genevieve making common cause with the obstructives of bayford as if he had not enemies enough  whats that light in the sky exclaimed sophy starting up to speak to her father on the driving seat  a bonfire said mr kendal  if we had remembered that it was the 5th of november we would not have stayed out so late  the next moment he drew up the horses exclaiming mr hope will you have a lift  mr hope rather to the ladies surprise took the vacant place beside sophy instead of climbing up to the box  he had been to see his intended parish and was an enviable man for he was as proud of it as if it had been an intended wife and albinia who knew it for a slice of dreary heath was entertained with his raptures  church schools and parsonage each in their way were perfection or at least promised to be and he had never been so much elevated or so communicative  the speechless little curate seemed to have vanished  the road as may be remembered did not run parallel with the curve of the river but cutting straight across entered bayford over the hill passing a small open bit of waste land where stood a few cottages the outskirts of the town  suddenly coming from an overshadowed lane upon this common a glare of light flashed on them showing them each others faces and casting the shadow of the carriage into full relief  the horses shied violently and they beheld an enormous bonfire raised on a little knoll about twenty yards in front of them surrounded by a dense crowd making every species of hideous noise  mr kendal checked the horses start and mr hope sprang to their heads  they were young and scarcely trustworthy their restless movements showed alarm and it was impossible to turn them without both disturbing the crowd and giving them a fuller view of the object of their terror  mr kendal came down and reconnoitring for a moment said you had better get out while we try to lead them round we will go home by squash lane  just then a brilliant glow of white flame and a tremendous roar of applause put the horses in such an agony that they would have been too much for mr hope had not mr kendal started to his assistance and a man standing by likewise caught the rein  he was a respectable carpenter who lived on the heath and touching his hat as he recognised them said sir if the ladies would come into my house and you too sir  the people are going on in an odd sort of way and mrs kendal would be frightened  ill take care of the carriage  mr kendal went to the side of the carriage and asked the ladies if they were alarmed  o no answered albinia it is great fun and as the horses fidgeted again it feels like a review  you had better get out he said i must try to back the horses till i can turn them without running over any one  will you go into the house  you did not expect to find bayford so riotous he added with a smile as he assisted genevieve out  you are not going to get up again said albinia catching hold of him and in her dread of his committing himself to the mercy of the horses returning unmeaning thanks to the carpenters urgent requests that she would take refuge in his house  in fact the scene was new and entertaining and on the farther side of the road sheltered by the carriage the party were entirely apart from the throng which was too much absorbed to notice them only a few heads turning at the rattling of the harness and the ladies were amused at the bright flame and the dark figures glancing in and out of the light the shouts of delight and the merry faces  theres guy fawkes cried albinia as a procession of scarecrows were home on chairs amid thunders of acclamation but whom have they besides  here are some new characters  most lugubrious looking said genevieve  i cannot make out the shouts  it is the nabob said mr kendal  perhaps you do not know that is my alias  this is my execution  the carpenter implored them to come in and mr hope added his entreaties but mr kendal would not leave the horses and the ladies would not leave him and they all stood still while his effigy was paraded round the knoll the mark of every squib the object of every invective that the rabble could roar out at the top of their voices jesuits and papists englishmen treated like blackamoor slaves in the indies honest folk driven out of house and home such was the burthen of the cries that assailed the grim representative carried aloft while the real man stood unmoved as a statue his tall powerful figure unstirred his long drivingwhip resting against his shoulder without betraying the slightest motion neither firm lip nor steady eye changing  genevieve with tears in her eyes exclaimed oh this is madness  will no one tell them how wicked they are  never mind my dear said mr kendal pressing the hand that in her fervour she had laid on his arm they will come to their senses in time  no mr hope i beg you will not interfere they are in no state for it they have done no harm as yet  i wonder what the police are about cried albinia indignantly  they are too few to do any good said mr kendal  it may be better that they are not incensing the mob  it will all go off quietly when this explosion has relieved their feelings  they felt as if there were something grand in this perfectly dispassionate reception of the outrage and they stood awed and silenced sophy leaning on him  it will soon be over now he said they are poking up the name to receive me  hark whats that  the mob came swaying back and a rich voice swelled above all the din boys boys is it burning your friends you are  then for the first time mr kendal started and muttered foolish lad is he here  confused cries rose again but the other voice gained the mastery  so you call that undertakerlooking figure there mr kendal  small credit to your taste  you want to burn him  what for  for being a nabob and a tyrant was the shout  much you know of nabobs  no ill tell you what its for  it is because his son got his death fighting for his queen and his country a year ago and on his deathbed bade him do his best to drive the fever from your doors and shelter you and save you from the union in your old age  is that a thing to burn him for  we want no irish papists here shouted a blackguard voice  serve him with the same sauce  i never was a papist was the indignant reply  no more was he but ive said that the place shant disgrace itself and  im with you shouted another above all the howls of the mob gilbert kendal was as kindhearted a chap as ever lived and ill see no wrong done to his father  tremendous uproar ensued then the wellknown tones pealed out again ive given my word to save his likeness  come on boys  hurrah for kendal  the warcry was echoed by a body of voices there was a furious melee and a charge towards the nabob who rocked and toppled down while stragglers came pressed backwards on all sides  here hope take care of them  stay with them said mr kendal putting the whip into the curates hand and striding towards the nucleus of the fray through the throng who were driven backwards  omore he called whats all this  give over  are you mad and then catching up and setting on his legs a little fallen boy go home get out of all this mischief  what are you doing  take home that child to a gaping girl with a baby  omore i say ill commit every man of you if you dont give over  he was recognised and those who had little appetite for the skirmish gave back from him but the more reckless and daring small fry began shrieking the nabob and letting off crackers and squibs through which he advanced upon the knot of positive combatants who were exchanging blows over his prostrate image in front of the fire  one he caught by the collar in the act of aiming a blow  the fist was instantly levelled at him with the cry you rascal what do you mean by it  but the fierce struggle failed to shake off the powerful grasp and at the command dont be such a fool ulick burst out murder tis himself and in the surprise was dragged some paces before recovering his perceptions  the cry of police had at the same instant produced a universal scattering and five policemen coming on the ground found scarcely any one to separate or capture  mr kendal relaxed his hold saying you are my prisoner  i didnt think youd been so strong said ulick shaking himself and looking bewildered  wheres the effigy  whats that to you  come away like a rational being  ha whats that as a frightful agonizing shriek rent the air and a pillar of flame came rushing across the now open space  it was a child one mass of fire and flying in its anguish from all who would have seized it  one moment of horror and it had vanished the next genevieves voice was heard crying bring me something more to press on it  she had contrived to cross its path with her large carriage rug and was kneeling over it forcing down the rug to smother the flames  mr hope brought her a shawl and they all stood round in silent awe  the poor child will be stifled said albinia kneeling down to help to unfold its face  poor little face distorted with terror and agony  one of the policemen recognised it as the child of the publichouse in tibbs alley  there were moans but no one dared to uncover the limbs and the policeman and mr hope proposed carrying it at once to mr bowles and then home  mr kendal desired that it should be laid on the seat of the carriage which he would drive gently to the doctors  genevieve got in to watch over the poor little boy and the others walked on by the side passed the battlefield now entirely deserted too much shocked for aught but conjectures on his injuries and the cause of the misfortune  either he must have been pushed in on the fire by the runaway rabble or have trod upon some of the scattered combustibles  mr bowles desired that the child should be taken home at once promising to follow instantly so at the entrance of tibbs alley the carriage stopped and mr hope lifted out the poor little wailing bundle  albinia was following but a decided prohibition from her husband checked her  i would not have either of you go to that house on any account  tell them to send to us for whatever they want but that is enough  there was no gainsaying such a command but as they reached the door of willow lawn mr kendal exclaimed where is miss durant  she is gone with the little boy said sophy  she told me she hoped you would not be displeased  mr hope will take care of her and she will soon come in  every one is mad tonight cried mr kendal  in such a place as that  i will go for her directly  pray dont said albinia no one could speak a rude word to her on such an errand  she and mr hope will be much more secure from incivility without you  i believe it may be so but i wish  his wish was broken off for his little albinia screaming papa papa clung to him in a transport of caresses which maurice explained by saying little awkey has been crying mamma she thought they were burning papa in the bonnie  papa not burnt cried little awkey patting his cheeks and laying her head on his shoulders alternately as he held her to his breast naughty people wanted to make a fire but they shant burn papa or poor guy fawkes or any of the good men  and where were you ulick cried maurice in an imperious injured way  you said once perhaps you would take me to see the fire and i went up to the bank and they said you were gone and it was glaring so in the sky and i did so want to go  i am glad you stayed away my man said albinia  i did want to go said maurice and i ran up to the top of the street and there was mr tritton and he said if i liked a lark he would take care of me but and there he stopped short and the colour came into his face  albinia threw her arm round him and kissed him saying my trusty boy and so you came home  yes and there was awkey crying about their burning papa and she would not go up to the garretwindow to see the fire nor do anything  why what is the sword here for exclaimed sophy finding it on the stairs  because then awkey was not so afraid  for once maurice had been exemplary keeping from the tempting uproar and devoting himself to soothing his little sister  it was worth all the vexations of the evening but he went on to ask if ulick could not take him now if the fire was not out yet  not exactly said mr kendal drily  i beg your pardon mr kendal said ulick who had apparently only just resumed the use of speech dont know what i may have done when you collared me but id no more notion of its being you than the lord lieutenant  and pray what took you there asked mr kendal  the surprise was quite as great to me  why said ulick one of the little lads of my sunday class gave me a hint the other day that those brutes meant to have a pretty go tonight and that jackson was getting up a figure of the nabob to break their spite upon  so i told my little fellow to give a hint to a few more of the right sort and wed go up together and not let the rascals have their own way  upon my word i wonder what the vicar will say to the use you make of his sundayschool  pretty work for his model teacher  what better could the boys be taught than to fight for the good cause  why no one is a scratch the worse for it  and do you think we could sit by and see our best friend used worse than a dog  why not give notice to the police  and would you have me hinder a fight cried ulick in the most irish of all his voices  oh very well if you likeonly there will be a run on the bank tomorrow  what has ulick been doing sophy asked maurice  only what you would have done had you been older maurice she said in a hurt voice defending papas effigy for which he does not seem to meet with much gratitude  well said mr kendal who all the time had had more gratitude in his eyes than on his tongue if the burning had had the same consequence as melting ones waxen effigy was thought to have it might have been worth while to interfere but i should have thought it more dignified in a respectable substantial householder to let those foolish fellows have their swing  more dignified maybe smiled albinia but less like an omore  no you are not going said mr kendal i shall not release my prisoner just yet  you carried off all the honour of the day said ulick  i had no notion you had such an arm  why you swung me round like a tomcat or and he exemplified the exploit upon maurice and was well buffeted  thats a little irish blarney to propitiate me laughed mr kendal who certainly was in unusual spirits after his execution and rescue by proxy but you wont escape prison fare  theres no doubt who was the heroine of the day added sophy  how one envies her  what your little governess friend said ulick  yes she did show superior wit when the rest of the world stood gaping round  it was admirablejust like genevieves tenderness and dexterity said albinia  i dare say she is doing everything for the poor little fellow  yes admirable said mr kendal but you all behaved very creditably ladies  ay said albinia not to scream is what a man thinks the climax of excellence in a woman  it is generally all that is required said mr kendal  i dont know what i should have done if poor lucy had been there  thereupon the ladies went upstairs maurice following sophy to extract a full account of the skirmish  the imp probably had an instinct that she would think more of what redounded to ulick omores glory than of what would be edifying to his own infant mind it was doubtful how long it would be before guy fawkes would arrive at his proper standing in the little awks opinion after the honour of an autodafe in company with papa  mr hope escorted genevieve home and was kept to dinner  they narrated that they had found the publichouse open and the bar full of noisy runaways  the burns were dreadful but the surgeon did not think they would be fatal and the child had held genevieves hand throughout the dressing and seemed so unwilling to part with her that she had promised to come again the next day and had been thanked gratefully there seemed no positive want of comforts and there was every hope that all would do well  genevieve looked pale after the scene she had gone through and could not readily persuade herself to eat still less rally her spirits to talk but she managed to avoid observation at dinnertime and afterwards a rest on the sofa restored her  she evidently felt as she said that this was coming home and her exquisite gift of tact making her perceive that she was to be at ease and on an equality she assumed her position without giving her friends the embarrassment of installing her and mr hope was in such a state of transparent admiration that albinia could not help two or three times noiselessly clapping her hands under the table and secretly thanking the rioters and their tagrag and bobtail for having provided a home for little genevieve durant  there was indeed a pang as she thought of gilbert but she believed that genevieves heart had never been really touched and was still fresh and open  she thought she might make mr kendal and sophy equally magnanimous  perhaps by that time sophy would be too happy to have leisure to be hurt and she had little fear but that mr kendals good sense would conquer his jealousy for his son though it might cost him something  two lovers to befriend at once  two desirable attachments to foster there was glory  not that albinia fulfilled her mission to a great extent shamefacedness always restrained her and she had not emilys gift for making opportunities  indeed when she did her best so perversely bashful were the parties that the wrong pairs resorted together the two who could talk being driven into conversation by the silence of the others  of mr hopes sentiments there could be no doubt  he was fairly carried off his feet by the absorption of the passion which was doubly engrossing because all ladies had hitherto appeared to him as beings with whom conversation was an impossible duty but after all he had heard of miss durant he might as a judicious man select her for an excellent parsoness and as a young man fall vehemently in love  nothing could be more evident to the lookerson but albinia could not satisfy herself whether genevieve had any suspicion  she was not very young knew something of the world and was acute and observing but on the other hand she had made it a principle never to admit the thought of courtship and she might not be sufficiently acquainted with the habits of the individual to be sensible of the symptomatic alteration  she had begged the dusautoys to make her leisure profitable and spent much of her time upon the schools on her little patient in tibbs alley and in going about among the poor she visited her old shopkeeper friends and drank tea with them much oftener than gratified mr kendal talking so openly of the pleasure of seeing them again that albinia sometimes thought the blood of the omores was a little chafed  there said genevieve completing a housewife filled with needles ready threaded i wonder whether the omnibus is too protestant to leave a parcel at the convent  i dont think its scruples of conscience would withstand sixpence said albinia  you might post it for less than that said sophy  dont you know said ulick omore who was playing with the little awk in the window that the feminine mind loves expedients  it would be less commonplace to confide the parcel to the conductor than merely let him receive it as guard of the mail bag and servant of the public  exactly laughed genevieve  think of the moral influence of being selected as bearer of a token of tenderness to my aunt on her fete instead of being treated as a mere machine devoid of human sympathies  sophy where were we reading of a nation which gives the simplest transaction the air of a little romance said ulick  and i have heard of a nation which denudes every action of sentiment and leaves you the tree without the leaves was genevieves retort  that misses fire miss durant my nation does everything by the soul nothing by mechanism  when they do do it  thats a defiance  you must deprive the conductor of the moral influence whether as man or machine and entrust the parcel to me  that would be like chartering a steamer to send home a chinese puzzle  no indeed i must go to hadminster  bear me witness sophy miss goldsmith wants me to talk to the house agent  mind if you miss st leocadias day you will miss my aunts fete  mr omore succeeded in carrying off the little parcel  the next morning as the ladies were descending the hill a hurried step came after them and the curate said in an abrupt rapid manner i beg your pardon i was going to hadminster could i do anything for you  nothing thank you said albinia at whom he looked  did i not hearmiss durant had some work to send her aunt today  how did you know that mr hope exclaimed genevieve  i heard something pass when some one was admiring your work he said not looking at her  and thisi thinkis st leocadias day  i am very much obliged to you for remembering it but i have sent my little parcel otherwise so i need not trouble you  ah how stupid in me  i am very sorry  i beg your pardon and he hurried off looking as if very sorry were not a mere matter of course  poor man thought albinia i dare say he has reckoned on it all this time and hunted out st leocadia in alban butler and then tried to screw up his courage all yesterday  ulick has managed to traverse a romance but perhaps it is just as well for what would be the effect on the public of mr hope in that coat being seen ringing at the convent door  well miss durant said ulick entering the drawingroom in the winter twilight here is evidence for you  you have actually penetrated the convent and seen my aunt impossible and yet this pencilled note is her own dear writing  you dont mean that you really were let in cried sophy  i entered quite legitimately i assure you  it was all luck  id just been putting up at the crown when what should i see in a sort of a trance staring right into the innyard but as jollylooking a priest as ever held a station  an its long since ive seen the like of you says he aloud to himself  is it the car says i sure it is says he  ive not laid my eyes on so iligant a vehicle since i left county tyrone  mr ohara exclaimed genevieve  and im mistaken if youre not the master of it he goes on taking the measure of me all over continued ulick putting on his drollest brogue  you see he had too much manners to say that such a personable young gentleman speaking such correct english could be no other than an irishman so i made my bow and said the car and i were both from county galway and we were straight as good friends as if wed hunted together at ballymakilty  to be sure he was a little taken aback when he found i was one of the protestant branch of the omores but a countryman is a countryman in a barbarous land and he asked me to call upon him and offered to do me any service in his power  i am sure he would  he is the kindest old gentleman i know exclaimed genevieve  he always used to bring me barleysugardrops when i was a little girl and it was he who found out our poor old biddy in distress at hadminster and sent her to live with us  indeed  then i owe him another debt of gratitudein fact he told me that one of his flock meaning biddy had spoken to him honourably of me  well said i the greatest service you could do me sir would be to introduce me to mademoiselle belmarche i have a young ladys commission for her  from my little genevieve he said the darling that she is  did you leave the child well  and so when i said it was a present for her saints day and that your heart was set on it  but mr omore i never did set my heart on your seeing her  well well you would have done it if youd known there had been any chance of it besides your heart was set on her getting the work and how could i make sure of that unless i gave it into her own hand i wouldnt have put it into mr oharas snuffy pocket to hinder myself from being bankrupt  then he took you in  so he did like an honest irishman as he was  he rang at the bell and spoke to the portress and had me into the parlour and sent up for the lady and i have seldom spent a pleasanter hallhour mademoiselle belmarche bade me tell you that she would write fuller thanks to you another day and that her eyes would thank you every night  was her cold gone  did she seem well the dear aunt  genevieve was really grateful and had many questions to ask about her aunt which met with detailed answers  bytheby said ulick i met mr hope in the street as i was coming away i offered him a lift but he said he was not coming home till late  i wonder what he is doing  albinia and sophy exchanged glances and had almost said poor mr hope  it was very hard that the good fortune and mere good nature of an indifferent person should push him where the quiet curate so much wished to be  albinia would have liked to have had either a little impudence or a little tact to enable her to give a hint to ulick to be less officious  st leocadias feast was the 9th of december  three days after genevieve received a letter which made her change countenance and hurry to her own room whence she did not emerge till luncheontime  in the late afternoon there was a knock at the drawingroom door and mr dusautoy said can i speak with you a minute mrs kendal  dreading ill news of lucy she hurried to the morningroom with him  fanny said i had better speak to you  this poor fellow is in a dreadful state  algernon  no indeed  poor hope  what has possessed the girl  genevieve has not refused him  did you not know it  i found him in his rooms as white as a sheet i asked what was the matter he begged me to let him go away for one sunday and find him a substitute  i saw how it was and at the first word he broke down and told me  was this today  yes  what can the silly little puss be thinking of to put an excellent fellow like that to so much pain  going about it in such an admirable way too writing to old mamselle first and getting a letter from her which he sends with his own and promising to guarantee her fifty pounds a year out of his own pocket  i should like to know what that little jenny means by it  i gave her credit for more sense  perhaps she thinks under the circumstances of her coming here within the year  ah very proper very pretty of her i never thought of that i suppose i have your permission to tell hope  i believe all the town knew it said albinia  yes he need not be downhearted he has only to be patient and he will like her the better for it  after all though he is as good a man as breathes he cannot be gilbert and it will be a great relief to him  ill tell him to put all his fancies about omore out of his head  most decidedly said albinia nothing can be greater nonsense tell him by no means to go away for when she finds that our feelings are not hurt and has become used to the idea i have every hope that she will be able to form a new  ay ay poor gilbert would have wished it himself  it is very good of you mrs kendal ill put the poor fellow in spirits again  did you hear whether she gave any reasons  oh i dont knowsomething about her birth and station but thats stuffshes a perfect lady and much more  and he is only a booksellers son  true and though it might be awkward to have the parsons fatherinlaw cutting capers if he lived in the same town yet being dead these fifteen or eighteen years wheres the damage  was that all  i fancy that she said she never meant to marry but thats all nonsense she is the very girl that ought and i hope you will talk to her and bring her to reason  theres not a couple in the whole place that i should be so glad to marry as those two  albinia endeavoured to discuss the matter with genevieve that night when they went upstairs  it was not easy to do for genevieve seemed resolved to wish her goodnight outside her door but she made her entrance and putting her arm round her little friends waist said am i very much in your way my dear  i thought you might want a little help or at least a little talk  oh mrs kendal i hoped you did not know and her eyes filled with tears  mr dusautoy told me my dear poor mr hopes distress betrayed him and mr dusautoy was anxious i should  genevieve did not let her finish but exclaiming i did not expect this from you madame gave way to a shower of tears  my dear child do we not all feel you the more one with ourselves for this reluctance said albinia caressing her fondly  it shall not be forced upon you any more till you can bear it  till exclaimed genevieve alarmed  oh do not say that  do not hold out false hopes i never shall  i do not think you are a fair judge as yet my dear  i think i am said genevieve slowly i must not let you love me on false pretences dearest mrs kendal  i do not think it is all forfor his sakebut indeed though i must esteem mr hope i do not believe i could ever feel for him as then breaking off  i pray you with all my heart dearest friend never to speak to me of marriage  i am the little governess and while heaven gives me strength to work for my aunt and you let me call this my home i am content i am blessed  oh do not disturb and unsettle me  so imploringly did she speak that she obliterated all thought of the prudent arguments with which albinia had come stored  it was no time for them there was no possibility of endeavouring to dethrone the memory of her own gilbert and her impulse was far more to agree that no one else could ever be loved than to argue in favour of a new attachment  she was proud of gilbert for being thus recollected and doubly pleased with the widowed heart nor was it till the first effect of genevieves tears had passed off that she began to reflect that the idea might become familiar and that romance having been abundantly satisfied by the constancy of the lancer sober esteem might be the basis of very happy married affection  mr hope did not go away but he shrank into himself and grew more timid than ever and it was through the dusautoys that albinia learnt that he was much consoled and intended to wait patiently  he had written to mdlle belmarche who had been extremely disappointed and continued to believe that so excellent and well brought up a young girl as her niece would not resist her wishes with regard to a young pastor so respectable  sophy when made aware of what was going on did not smile or shed a tear only a strange whiteness came across her face  she made a commonplace remark with visible effort nor was she quite herself for some time  it was as if the reference to her brother had stirred up the old wound  genevieve seemed to have been impelled to manifest her determination of resuming her occupation she wrote letters vigorously answered advertisements and in spite of the united protest of her friends advertised herself as a young person of french extraction but a member of the church of england accustomed to tuition and competent to instruct in french italian music and all the ordinary branches of education  address g c d mr richardsons bookseller bayford     chapter xxx    miss goldsmith went to spend christmas with an old friend leaving ulick more liberty than he had enjoyed for a long time  he used it a good deal at willow lawn and was there of course on christmasday after dinner the decoration of the church was under discussion  the bayford neighbourhood was unpropitious to holly and sophy and genevieve had hardly ever seen any except that genevieve remembered the sooty bits sold in london  something passed about sending for a specimen from fairmead but albinia said that would not answer for her brothers children were in despair at the absence of berries and had ransacked colonel burys plantations in vain  the next day about twilight albinia and sophy were arranging some christmas gifts for the old women in the morningroom genevieve was to come and help them on her return from the child in tibbs alley  oh here she comes up the garden said sophy who was by the window  presently albinia heard a strange sound as of tightened breath and looking up saw sophy deathly pale with her eyes fixed on the window in terror she flew to her side but sophy spoke not she only clutched her hand with fingers cold and tight as iron and gazed with dilated eyes  albinia looked  ulick had come from the housethere was a scarletberried spray in genevieves hand which she was trying to make him take againhis face was all pleading and imploringshe turned hastily from him and they saw her cheek glowing with crimsonshe tried to force back the holly spraybut her hand was caughthe was kissing it  no she had rent it awayshe had fled in through the conservatorythey heard the doorsshe had rushed up to her own room  sophys grasp grew more rigidshe panted for breath  my child my child said albinia throwing her arms round her expecting her to faint  oh could i have imagined such treason her eyes flashed and her frame quivered with indignation  he shall never come into this house again  mamma hush said sophy releasing herself from her embrace and keeping her body upright though obliged to seat herself on the nearest chair  it is not treason she said slowly as though her mouth were parched  contemptible fickleness burst out albinia but sophy implored silence by a gesture  no she said it was a dream a degrading humiliating dream but it is over  there is no degradation except to the base trifler i once thought better things of  he has not trifled said sophy  wait hush  there was a composure about her that awed albinia who stood watching in suspense while she went to the bedroom drank some water cooled her brow pushed back her hair and sitting down again in the same collected manner which gave her almost a look of majesty she said promise me mamma that all shall go on as if this folly had never crossed our minds  i cant  i cant sophy said albinia in the greatest agitation i cant unknow that you have been shamefully used  then you will lead papa to break his promise to genevieve and lower me not only in my own eyes but in those of every one  he little knew that he was bringing her here to destroy his daughters happiness  so that was why she held off from mr hope cried albinia burning with such indignation that on some one she must expend it but a tirade against the artfulness of the little french witch was cut off short by an authoritative  dont mamma  you are unjust  how can she help being loveable  he had no business to know whether she was or not  you are wrong mamma  the absurdity was in thinking i ever was so  very little absurd said albinia twining her arms round sophy  dont make me silly hastily said sophy her voice trembling for a moment i want to tell you all about it and you will see that no one is to blame  the perception has been growing on me for a long time but i was weak enough to indulge in the dream  it was very sweet  there again she struggled not to break down gained the victory and went on i dont think i should have dared to imagine it myself but i saw others thought it who knew more i knew the incredible was sometimes true and every little kindness he didoh how foolish as if he could help doing kindnesses  my better sense told me he did not really distinguish me but there was something that would feed upon every word and look  then last year i was wakened by the caricature business  that opened my eyes for no one who had that in him would have turned my sister into derision  i was sullen then and proud and whenwhen humanity and compassion brought him to me in my distressoh whywhy could not i have been reasonable and not have selfishly fed on what i thought was revived  he had no right began albinia fiercely  he could neither help saving maurice nor speaking comfort and support when he found me exhausted and sinking  it was i who was the foolish creaturei hate myself  well you know how it has beeni liked to believe it was the thingi knew he cared less for me thanbut i thought it was always so between men and women and that i would not have petty distrusts  but when she came i saw what the truetrue feeling isi saw that he felt when she came into the roomi saw how he heard her words and missed minei saw sophy collected herself and spoke quietly and distinctly i saw his love and that it had never been for me  there was a pause albinia could not bear to look speak or move sophys words carried conviction that swept away her sand castle  now mamma said sophy earnestly you own that he has not been false or fickle  if he has not he has disregarded the choicest jewel that lay in his way said albinia with some sharpness  but he has not been that persisted sophy  wellno i suppose not  and no one can be less to blame than genevieve  little flirt ive no patience with her  she cant help her manners repeated sophy i feel them so much more charming than mine every moment  she will make him so happy  what are you talking of sophy  he must be mad if he is in earnest a man of his family pride  his father will never listen to it for a moment  i dont know what his father may do said sophy but i know what i pray and entreat we may do and that is do our utmost to make this come to good  sophy dont ask it  i could not i know you could not  there is no loss of esteem  i honour him as i always did said sophy  yes the more since i see it was all for papa and the right all unselfish on that 5th of november  some day i shall have worn out the selfishness  she kept her hand tightly pressed on her heart as she spoke and albinia exclaimed you shall not see it you overrate your strength it is my business to prevent you  think mamma said sophy rising in her earnestness  here is a homeless orphan whom you have taught to love you whom papa has brought here as to a home and for gilberts sake  is it fair innocent exemplary as she isto turn against her because she is engaging and i am not to cut her off from us drive her away to the first situation that offers be it what it may and with that thought aching and throbbing in her heart  oh mamma would that be mercy or justice  you are not asking to have it encouraged in the very house with you  i do not see how else it is to be said sophy  let him go after her if theres anything in it but irish folly and french coquetry  how mamma  where  when she is a governess in some strange place how could he leave his business  how could she attend to him  oh mamma you used to be kind how can you wish to put two people you love so much to such misery  because i cant put one whom i love better than both and who deserves it to greater misery said albinia embracing her  then do not put me to the misery of being ungenerous and the shame of having my folly suspected  albinia would have argued still but the children came in sophy went away and there was no possibility of a teteatete  how strange it was to have such a tumult of feeling within and know that the same must be tenfold multiplied in the hearts of those two girls and yet go through all the domestic conventionalities each wearing a mask of commonplace ease as though nothing had happened  genevieve had albinia suspected been crying excessively for there was that effaced annihilated appearance that tears produced on her but otherwise she did her part in answering her host who was very fond of her and always made her an object of attention  albinia found herself betraying more abstraction she was so anxiously watching sophy who acquitted herself best of all had kept tears from her eyes talked more than usual and looked brilliant with a bright colour dyeing her cheeks  she was evidently sustained by eagerness to obtain her generous purpose and did not yet realize the price  the spray of holly was lying as if it had been tossed in vexation upon the marble slab in the hall  albinia from the stairs saw sophy take it up and waited to see what she would do with it  the sophy she had once known would have dashed it into the flames and then have repented  no sophy held it tenderly and looked at the glossy leaves and coral fruit with no angry eye she even raised it to her lips but it was to pierce with one of the long prickles till her brow drew together at the smart and the blood started  then she began to mount the stairs and meeting albinia said quietly i was going to take this to genevieves room it is empty now but perhaps you had better take care of it for her out of sight  it will be her greatest treasure tomorrow  mr kendal read aloud as usual but who of his audience attended certainly not albinia  she sat with her head bent over her work revolving the history of these last two years and trying to collect herself after the sudden shock and the angry feelings of disappointment that surged within in much need of an object of wrath  alas who could that object be but that blind warmhearted impulsive mistress albinia kendal  she saw plain enough now it was too late that there had not been a shadow of sentiment in that lively confiding irishman used to intimacy with a herd of cousins and viewing all connexions as cousins  she remembered his conversation with her brother and her brothers impression she thought of the unloverlike dread of ague in emilys moonlight walk she recalled the many occasions when she had thought him remiss and she could not but acquit him of any designed flirtation any dangerous tenderness or what mdlle belmarche would call legerete  he could not be reservedhe was naturally free and openand how could she have put such a construction on his frankness when sophy herself had long been gradually arriving at a conviction of the truth  it was a comfort at least to remember that it had not been the fabrication of her own brain she had respectable authority for the idea and she trusted to its prompter to participate in her indignation argue ulick out of so poor a match and at least put a decided veto upon sophys spartan magnanimity sophys health and feelings being the subject she sometimes thought which concerned him above all  ah but the evil had not been his doing  he had but gossiped out a pleasant conjecture to his wife as a trustworthy helpmeet  what business had she to go and telegraph that conjecture with her significant eyes to the very last person who ought to have shared it and then to have kept up the mischief by believing it herself and acting looking and arranging as on a certainty implied though not expressed  mrs osborne or mrs drury might have spoken more broadly they could not have acted worse thought she to herself  the notion might never have been suggested sophy might have simply enjoyed these years of intimacy and even if her heart had been touched it would have been unconsciously and the pain and shame of unrequited affection have merely been a slight sense of neglect a small dreariness lost in eagerness for the happiness of both friends  now two years of love that she had been allowed to imagine returned and sanctioned and love with the depth and force of sophys whole naturethe shame of having loved unasked the misery of having lived in a delusionhow would they act upon a being of her morbid tendency frail constitution and proud spirit  as albinia thought of the passive endurance of last years estrangement her heart sank within her  illnessbrainfeverpermanent illhealth and crushed spiritsnay death itself she auguredand allall her own fault the last and best of edmunds children so cruelly and deeply wounded and by her folly  she longed to throw herself at his feet and ask his pardon but it was sophys secret as well as hers and how could womanhood betray that unrequited love  at least she thought for noble sophys sake she would not raise a finger to hinder the marriage but as to forwarding it or promoting the courtship under sophys very eyesthat would be like murdering her outright and she would join mr kendal with all her might in removing their daughter from the trying spectacle  talk of aunt maria  this trouble was ten thousand times worse  albinia began to watch the timepiece longing to have the evening over that she might prepare mr kendal  it ended at last and genevieve took up her candle bade goodnight and disappeared sophy lingered till coming forward to her father as he stood by the fire she said papa did you not promise gilbert that genevieve should be as another daughter  i wish she would be my dear said mr kendal but she is too independent and your mamma thinks she would consider it as a mere farce to call her little albinias governess but if you can persuade her  what i want you to do papa is to promise that she shall be married from this house as her home and that you will fit her out as you did lucy  ha  is she beginning to relent  no papa  it will be ulick omore  you dont mean it exclaimed mr kendal more taken by surprise than perhaps he had ever been and looking at his wife who was standing dismayed yet admiring the gallant girl who had forestalled her precautions  obliged to speak she said i am afraid so sophy and i witnessed a scene today  afraid said mr kendal i see no reason to be afraid if ulick likes it  they are two of the most agreeable and best people that ever fell in my way and i shall be delighted if they can arrange it for they are perfectly suited to each other  but such a match exclaimed albinia  as to that a sensible economical wife will be worth more to him than an expensive one with however large a fortune  and for the family pride i am glad the lad has more sense than i feared he has a full right to please himself having won the place he has and he may make his father consent  he wants a wifenothing else will keep him from running headlong into speculation for want of something to do  yes i see what you are thinking of my dear but you know we could not wish her as you said yourself never to form another attachment  but here sighed albinia the ground knocked away from under her yet still clinging to the last possible form of murmur  it will cost us something said mr kendal but no more than we will cheerfully bear for the sake of one who has such claims upon us and it will be amply repaid by having such a pair of friends settled close to us  then you will papa said sophy  will do what my dear  treat her asas you did lucy papa  and with much more pleasure and far more hope than when we fitted out poor lucy said mr kendal  sophy thanked him and said goodnight and the look which accompanied her kiss to her stepmother was a binding over to secrecy and noninterference  is she gone said mr kendal who had been musing after his last words  gone to tell her friend i suppose  i wanted to ask what this scene was  oh said albinia it was in the gardenwe saw it from the windowonly he brought her a bit of holly and was trying to kiss her hand  strong premises certainly  how did she receive the advance  she would not listen but made her escape  then matters are not in such a state of progress as for me to congratulate her  i suppose that you ladies are the best judges whether he may not meet with the same fate as poor hope  sophy seems to take it for granted that he will not  irishman as he is he must be pretty secure of his ground before coming to such strong measures  well i hope we may hear no more of browague  but with sudden recollectioni thought albinia you fancied he had some inclination for sophy  was it not a good wife to suppress the you did  if she could merrily have said you told me so it would have been all very well but her mood would admit of nothing but a grave and guarded answerwe did fancy so but i am convinced it was entirely without reason  that superior smile at her lively imagination was more than human nature could bear without the poor relief of an entreaty that he would not sit meditating and go to sleep in his chair  albinia thought she had recovered equanimity during her nights rest but in the midst of her morning toilette sophy hurried in exclaiming shell go away  she is writing letters and packing and she answered well what do you want me to do  you dont imagine that i can rush into her room and lay hands on her  she will not go upon a wishingcarpet  it will be time to interfere when we know more of the matter  sophy looked blank and vanished and albinia felt excessively vexed at having visited on the chief sufferer her universal crossness with all mankind  she knew she had only spoken common sense but that made it doubly hateful and yet she could not but wish miss durant anywhere out of sight and mr omore on the top of the hill of howth  at breakfast sophys looks betrayed nothing to the uninitiated though albinia detected a feverish restlessness and covert impatience and judged that her sleep had been little  genevieves had perhaps been less for she was very sallow with sunken eyes and her face looked half its usual size but albinia could not easily have compassion on the poor little unwitting traitress even when she began dear mrs kendal will you excuse me if i take a sudden leave  i find it will answer best for me to accept mrs elwoods invitation i can then present myself to any lady who may wish to see me and as i promised my aunt another visit i had better go to hadminster by the three oclock omnibus  albinia was thankful for the loud opposition which drowned the faint reluctance of her own mr kendal insisting that she should not leave them little awk coaxing her and maurice exclaiming if the ladies want her let them come after her  one always goes to see a horse  im not so well worth the trouble maurice  i know ulick omore would come in to see you when all the piebalds for the show were going by  some day you will come to the same good taste said his father to lessen the general confusion  see a lady instead of a piebald  never cried maurice with indignation that made the most preoccupied laugh under cover of which genevieve effected a retreat  sophy looked imploringly at albiniaalbinia was moving but not with alacrity and mr kendal was saying i do not understand all this when scarcely pausing to knock ulick opened the door cheeks and eyes betraying scarcely repressed eagerness  whatwhere he stammered as if even his words were startled away is not miss durant well  she was here just this moment said mr kendal  i will go and see for her said sophy  come children  whether sophys powers over herself or over genevieve would avail was an anxious marvel but it did not last a moment for maurice came clattering down to say that genevieve was gone out into the town  in such a moment  she must have snatched up her bonnet and fled one way while ulick entered by the other  he made one step forward exclaiming where is she gone then pausing broke out mrs kendal you must make her give me a hearing or i shall go mad  a hearing repeated mrs kendal with slight malice  yes why dont you know  so your time has come ulick has it said mr kendal  well and i were worse than an old ledger if it had not when she was before me  make her listen to me mrs kendal if she do not i shall never do any more good in this world  i should have thought said albinia that an irishman would be at no loss for making opportunities  you dont know mrs kendal she is so fenced in with scruples humilityi know not whatthat she will not so much as hear me out im not such a blockhead as to think myself worthy of her but i do think if she would only listen to me i might stand a chance and she runs off as if she thought it a sin to hear a word from my mouth  it is very honourable to her said mr kendal  very honourable to her replied ulick but cruelly hard upon me  i think too continued mr kendal stimulated thereto by his ladys severely prudent looks that you oughtgranting miss durant to be as i well know her to be one of the most excellent persons who ever livedstill to count the cost of opening such an affair it is not fair upon a woman to bring her into a situation where disappointments may arise which neither may be able to bear  do you mean my family mr kendal  trust me for getting consent from home  you will write my father a letter saying what you said just now mrs kendal will write another to my mother and ill just let them see my heart is set on it and theyll not hold out  could you bear to see herlooked down on said albinia  ha he cried with flashing eyes  no believe me mrs kendal the omores have too much gentle blood to do like that even if she were one whom any one could scorn  why what is my mother herself but a goldsmith by birth and id like to see who would cast it up to any of the family that she was not as noble as an omore  and genevieve herselfisnt every look and every movement full of the purest gentility her fathers land can show  i dare say once accepted the omores would heartily receive her but here in this place there are some might think it told against you and might make her uncomfortable  what care i  ive lived and thriven under bayford scorn many a day and for heroh i defy anything so base to wound a heart so high as hers and with me to protect her  and you can afford it said mr kendal  remember she has her aunt to maintain  i can said ulick  i have gone over it all again and again and recalling his manofbusiness nature he demonstrated that even at present he was well able to support mdlle belmarche as well as to begin housekeeping and that there was every reason to believe that his wider and more intelligent system of management would continue to increase his income  well ulick said mr kendal at last i wish you success with all my heart and esteem you for a choice so entirely founded upon the qualities most certain to ensure happiness  you dont mean to say that she has not the most glorious eyes the most enchanting figure exclaimed ulick affronted at the compliment that seemed to aver that genevieves external charms were not equal to her sterling merit  mr kendal and albinia laughed and the former excused himself not quite to the lovers satisfaction by declaring the lady much more attractive than many regularly handsome people but he added that what he meant was that he was sure the attachment was built upon a sound foundation  then he entreated that mrs kendal would persuade her to listen to him for she had fled from him ever since his betrayal of his sentiments till he was half crazed and had been walking up and down his room all night  he should do something distracted if not relieved from suspense before night  and mr kendal got rid of him in the midst of his transports and turning to albinia said we must settle this as fast as possible or he will lose his head and get into a scrape  i do not like such wild behaviour  it is not dignified  it is only temperament said mr kendal  will you speak to her  yes whenever she comes in  i suspect she has gone out on purpose  could you not go to find her at the school or wherever she is likely to be  i dont know where to find her  i cannot give up the childrens lessons  nothing hurts maurice so much as irregularity  he made no answer but his look of disappointment excited her to observe to herself that she supposed he expected her to run all over the town without ordering dinner first and she wondered how he would like that  presently she heard him go out at the front door and felt some contrition  she had not the heart to seek sophy to report progress and did not see her till about eleven oclock when she came in hastily with her bonnet on asking well mamma  where have you been sophy  to school she said  has anything happened  we have had it out and i am to speak to her when she comes in said albinia glad as perhaps was sophy of the enigmatical form to which maurices presence restrained the communication  sophy went away but presently returning and taking up her work but with eyes that betrayed how she was listening but there was so entire an apparent absence of personal suffering that albinia began to discharge the weight from her mind and believe that the sentiment had been altogether imaginary even on sophys side and the whole a marvellous figment of her own  at last mr kendals foot was heard sophy started up and sat down again  he came upstairs and his face was all smiles  well he said i dont think she will go by the three oclock omnibus  you have spoken to her cried albinia in compunction  has maurice finished  then go out my boy for the present  well said albinia interrogatively and sophy laid down her work and crossed one hand over the other on her knees and leant back as though to hinder visible tremor  yes he said going on with what had been deferred till maurice was gone  i thought it hard on himand as i was going to speak to edwards i asked if she were at the union where i found her taking leave of the old women and giving them little packets of snuff and small presents chiefly her own work i am sure  i took her with me into the fields and persuaded her at last to talk it over with me poor little thing  i never saw a more highminded conscientious spirit she was very unhappy about it and said she knew it was all her unfortunate manner she wished to be guarded but a little excitement and conversation always turned her head and she entreated me not to hinder her going back to a schoolroom out of the way of every one  i told her that she must not blame herself for being more than usually agreeable but she would not listen and i could hardly bring her to attend to what i said of young omore  poor girl  i believe she was running away from her own heart  you have prevented her cried sophy  at least i have induced her to hear his arguments  i told her my opinion of him which was hardly needed and what i thought might have more weightthat he has earned the right to please himself and that i believed she would be better for him than riches  she repeated several times not now and not here and i found that she was shocked at the idea of the subject being brought before us i was obliged to tell her that nothing would gratify any of us so much and that this was the time to fulfil her promise of considering me as a father  oh thank you murmured sophy  so finally i convinced her that she owed ulick a hearing and i think she felt that to hear was to yield  she had certainly been feeling that flight was the only measure and between her dread of entrapping him and of hurting our feelings had persuaded herself it was her duty  the last thing she did was to catch hold of me as i was going and ask if he knew what her father was  i dare say it has been the first thing she has said to him said albinia  she is a noble little creature  but what have you done with them now  i brought him to her in the parsonage garden  i believe they are walking in the lanes said mr kendal much gratified with his mornings work  she deserves him said sophy and then her eyes became set as if looking into far distance  the walk in the lanes had not ended by luncheontime and an afternoon loaded with callers was oppressive but sophy kept up well at last in the twilight the door was heard to open and genevieve came in alone  they listened and knew she must have run up to her own room  what did it portend  albinia must be the one to go and see so after a due interval she went up and knocked  genevieve opened the door and threw herself into her arms  dear mrs kendal oh have i done wrong  i am so very happy and i cannot help it  albinia kissed her and assured her she had done nothing to repent of  i am so glad you think so  i never dreamt such happiness could be meant for me and i am afraid lest i should have been selfish and wrong and bring trouble on him  we have been all saying you deserve him  oh nonoso good so noble so heroic as he is  how could he think of the poor little french teacher  and he will pay my aunts fifty pounds  i told him all and he knew it before and yet he loves me  oh why are people so very good to me  i could easily find an answer to that question said albinia where is he my dear  he is gone home  i would not come into the town with him  it is nothing you know no one must hear of it for he must be free unless his parents consentand i know they never can she said shaking her head sadly but even then i shall have one secret of happiness i shall know what has been  but oh mrs kendal let me go away  go away now exclaimed albinia  yesit cannot behere in this house  oh it is outraging your kindness  no said albinia it is but letting us fulfil a very precious charge  genevieves tears flowed as she said such goodness  mr kendal spoke to me in this way in the morning when he was more kind and patient than i can express  but tell me dearest madame tell me candidly is my remaining here the cause of any secret pain to him  with regard to him albinia could answer sincerely that it was a gratification and genevieve owned that she should be glad to await the letters from ireland which she tried to persuade herself she believed would put an end to everything except the precious remembrance  sophy here came in with some tea  she had recollected that genevieve had wandered all day without any bodily sustenance  there was great sweetness in the quiet grave manner in which she bent over her friend and kissed her brow  all she said was papa had goes to fetch him to dinner  genevieve you must let me do your hair  it was in genevieves eyes an astonishing fancy and albinia said come away now my dear she must have a thorough rest after such a day  genevieve looked too much excited for rest but that was the more reason for leaving her to herself and besides it was so uncomfortable not to be able to be kind enough  however when people are happy a little kindness goes a great way and there was a subdued lustre like a glory in her eyes when she came downstairs with the holly leaves and berries glistening in her hair the first ornament she had ever worn there  it was sophys doing she said  naughty girl she tried to take me by surprise  she would not let me look in the glass but i guessedand oh she was wounding her poor hands so sadly  i must thank her said ulick looking ecstatic  why does she not come down  as she did not appear albinia went up doubtful if it were wise yet too uneasy not to go in quest of her  it was startling to have so faint an answer on knocking and on entering the room she saw sophy lying on her bed upon her back with her arms by her sides and with a ghastly whiteness on her features  scarcely a pulse could be felt and her hands were icy cold her voice sank to nothing her eyelids scarcely raised as if the strain of the day had exhausted all vital warmth or energy and her purpose accomplished annihilation was succeeding  much terrified albinia would have hurried in search of remedies but she raised her hand imploringly and murmured please dont  im not faintim not ill  if you would only let me be still  albinia teased her so far as to cover her with warmed shawls and force on her a stimulant  she shut her eyes but presently opened them to say please go  she was so often unable to appear at dinner that no observation was made and it was to be feared that her absence was chiefly regretted by the lovers because it prevented them from sitting on the same side of the table  always frank and unrestrained ulick made his felicity so apparent that albinia had no toleration for him and not much for the amusement it afforded mr kendal  she would have approved of her husband much more if he had put her into a great quandary by anxious inquiries what was the matter with his daughter instead of that careless o you are going up to sophy i hope she will be able to come down to tea when she left him on guard over the children and the lovers  so it is with womans martyrdoms said she to herself as she walked upstairs chewing the cud of all the commonplaces by which women have of late years flattered themselves and been flattered but at any rate ill have her out of sight of all their absurdity  it is enough to kill her  sophy hardly stirred at her entrance but there was less ghastliness about her and as albinia sat down she did not remove her hand and turned slightly round so as to lose that strange corpselike attitude of repose  you are not so cold dearest said albinia  have you slept  i think not  are you better  have you been comfortable  oh yes  then with a pause yesit was like being nothing  you were not faint i hope  noonly lying still  dont you know the comfort of not thinking or feeling  yes this has been far too much for you  you have done enough now my generous sophy  not generous one cant give away what one never had  i think it more gracious to yield without jealousy or bitterness  only not quite base said sophy  then presently turning on her pillow as though more willing to converse she said i am glad it was not last year  we had troubles enough then  not for thatbecause i should have been base then and hated myself for it all the time  that you never could have been cried albinia  but my dear you must let me contrive for you i would not betray you for all the world but the sight of these two is more than you ought to undergo i will not send genevieve away but you must go from home  i dont think i shall be cross said poor sophy simply i should be ashamed  cross  it is i who am cross because i am to blame but dearest think if you are keeping up out of pride that will never never do  i do not believe it is pride said sophy meekly at least i hope not  i feel humiliated enough and i think it may be a sort of shame as well as consideration for them that would make me wish that no difference should be made  do you not think we may let things go on she said in so humble a manner that it brought albinias tears and a kiss was the only answer  please tell me said sophy for i dont want to deceive myself  i am sure i am no judge cried albinia after the dreadful mischief i have done  the mischief was in me said sophy or you could not have done it i saw it all when i was lying awake last night and how it began or rather it was before i can remember exactly  i always had craving after somethinga yearning for something to fix myself onand after i grew to read and look out into the world i thought it must be that  and when i knew i was ugly and disagreeable i brooded and brooded and only in my better moments tried to be satisfied with you and papa and the children  and the allsatisfying sophy dear  i triedi didbut it was dutynot heart  i used to fancy what might be if i shot out into beauty and gracenot admiration but to have that one thing to lean on  you see it was all worldly and only submissive by fitsgenerally it was cross repining yielding because i could not help itand so when the fancy came the throne was ready made empty swept and garnished for the idol  i wont talk of all that time but i dont believe even genevieve though she knows she may can dwell upon the thought as i did in just the way to bring punishment  and so i thought byandby at the caricature time that i was punished  i looked into the fallacy when i had got over the temper and the pride and i saw it all clear and owned i was rightly served for it had been an earthly aim and an idol worship well the foolish hope came back again but indeed indeed i think i was the better for all the chastening i had seen grandmamma die i was fresh from hearing of gilbert and i did feel as i never had done before that god was first  i dont believe that feeling had passed though the folly came back and made me feel glad to love all the world  there weregleams of religions thoughtshe spoke with difficulty but her face had a strange beautythat taught me how if i was more goodthere could be a fulness of joy that all the rest flowed out from  and so when misgivings came and i saw at times how little he could care for meoh it was pain enough but not the worst sort  and yet i dont know she turned away and hid her face on the pillow  it was agony though still as she had said not the worst untempered by faith or resignation  what a history of that apparently cold sullen impassive spirit what an unlocking of pentup mysteries  it has been blessed to you said albinia affectionately  my dear we always thought your character one that wanted the softening of suchan attachment  perhaps that made me wrongly eager for it and ready to imagine where i ought not i think it did soften you but if you had not conquered what was earthly and exaggerated in it how it would be hardening and poisoning you now  i hope i may have sighed sophy as if she were doubtful  then will you not listen to me  you have done nobly so far and i know your feelings will be right in the main but do you think you can bear the perpetual irritation of being neglected and seeingwhat i must call rather a parade of his preference  i think it would be the best cure said sophy it would make me feel it real and i could be glad to see himthemso happy  i dont know how to judge  i dont know whether it be right for you to have him always before your mind  he would be so all the more while i was away with nothing to do said sophy fancy might be worse than fact  you dont know how i used to forget the nonsense when he had been ten minutes in the room because it was just starved out  now when it will be a sin i believe that strength will be given me to root it out her look grew determined but she gasped for breath  and your bodily strength my dear  if i should be ill then it would be natural to go away said sophy smiling but i dont think i shall be  this is only the end of my fever to see it settled  now i am thankful and my heart has left off throbbing when i am still  i shall be all right tomorrow  i hope so but you must spare yourself  besides she added one of the worst parts has been that in the fancy that a change was to come i have gone about everything in an unsettled way and now i want to begin again at my duties my readings and parish matters as my lifes work steadily and in earnest  not violently not to drive care away  i have tried that once and will not again  you shall arrange for me and i will do just as you tell me and she raised her eyes with the most deep and earnest gaze of confiding love that had ever greeted albinia from any of the three  ill try not to grieve you for you are too sorry for me and she threw her arms round her neck oh mamma nothing is so bad when you help me to bear it  tears fell fast at this precious effusion from the deep sincere heart at the moment when albinia herself was most guilty in her own eyes  embraces were her only answer and how fervent  and mamma whispered sophy if you could only let me have some small part of teaching little albinia  a trotting of small feet and a call of mamma was heard  the little maiden was come with her goodnights and in one moment albinia had lifted her into her sisters arms where she was devoured with kisses returning them with interest and with many a fondling poor sophy and dear sophy  when the last fond goodnight had passed and the little one had gone away to her nest sophy said in a soft natural unconstrained voice i am very sleepy  if you will be so kind as to send up my tea i will go to bed  thank you goodnight  that was the redrawing of the curtain of reserve the resignation of sentiment the resumption of common life  the romance of sophia kendals early life had ended when she wounded her fingers in wreathing genevieves hair  her next romance might be on behalf of her beautiful little sister  albinia was cured of her fretfulness towards the new order of events and her admiration of sophy carried her through all that was yet to come  it was the easier since sophy did not insist on unreasonable selfmartyrdoms and in her gratitude for being allowed her purpose in the main was submissive in detail and had mercy on her own powers of endurance not inflicting the sight of the lovers on herself more than was needful and not struggling with the languor that was a good reason for remaining much upstairs  she worked and read but without overdoing anything and wisely undertook a french translation as likely to occupy her attention without forcing her to overexert her powers  not that she said so she carefully avoided all reference to her feelings and albinia could almost have deemed the whole a dream excepting for the occasional detection of a mournful fixed gaze which was instantaneously winked away as soon as sophy herself became aware of it  her trouble though of a kind proverbially the most hardening and exacerbating had an entirely contrary tendency on her  the rigidity and harsh judgment which had betokened her states of morbid depression since she had outgrown the sulky form had passed away and she had been right in predicting that she should not be cross for she had become sweet and gentle towards all  her voice was pitched more softly and though she looked ill and had lost the bloom which had once given her a sort of beauty her eyes had a meek softness that made them finer than when they wore the stern steady glance that used to make poor gilbert quail  her strength came not from pride but from grace and to her disappointment was more softening than even the prosperous affection that albinia had imagined  it was love not earthly but heavenly  if her father had been less busy her pale cheek might have alarmed him but he was very much taken up with builders and estimates with persuading some of the superfluous population to emigrate and arranging where they should go and while she kept the family hours and habits he did not notice lesser indications of flagging spirits or if he did he was wise and thought the cause had better not be put into words  albinia had brought herself to give fair sympathy to the lovers and when once she had begun it was easy to go on not as ardently as if she had never indulged in her folly but enough to gratify two such happy and grateful people who wanted no one but each other and agreed in nothing better than in thinking her a sort of guardian angel to them both  genevieve had assuredly never given her heart to gilbert and it was ready in all the freshness of maidenly bliss to meet the manly ardour of ulick omore  he was almost overpoweringly demonstrative and eager now and then making game of himself but yet not able to help rushing down to willow lawn ten or twelve times a day just to satisfy himself that his treasure was there and if he could not meet with her catching hold of mr or mrs kendal to rave till they drove him back to his business  such glee danced in his eyes there was such suppressed joyousness in his countenance and his step was so much nearer a dance than a walk that his very air wellnigh betrayed what was to be an absolute secret till there had been an answer from ballymakilty until which time genevieve would not rest in the hope of a happy future nor give up her fears that she had not brought pain upon him  in he came at last so exulting and so grateful that it was a shock to discover that the kindest letter and fullest consent in the world meant his fathers supposing he would do as he pleased as long as he asked for nothing it was no concern of his  it was discovered by ulicks delight that he had expected to have a battle and albinia was scandalized but mr kendal told her it somewhat depended on what manner of father it was whether an independent son could defer implicitly to his judgment and though principle might withhold ulick from flat disobedience he might not scruple at extorting reluctant consent  besides his mother whom he honoured far more really had written not without disappointment but with full confidence in his ability to judge for himself  mr kendal and mr ferrars both wrote warmly in genevieves praise and certainly her footing at willow lawn was the one point dappui in bringing round the omore family so that as ulick truly said it was mrs kendal whom he had to thank for the blessing of his life had poor miss goldsmiths description of miss durants birth parentage and education been the only one that had reached ballymakilty a prohibition would assuredly have been issued but he was left sufficiently free to satisfy his own conscience and before genevieve had surmounted half her scruples the whole town was ringing with the news though no one could guess how it had got wind to be sure the dusautoys had been put into a state of rapture and poor mr hope had had the fatal stroke administered to him  he looked so like a ghost that mr dusautoy contrived to release him at once whereupon he went to try the most unwholesome curacy he could find with serious intentions of exchanging his living for it but he fortunately became so severely and helplessly ill there that he was pretty well cured of his mental fever and quite content to go to his heath and do his work there like the humble and earnest man that he was perhaps all the better for having been personally taught something more than could be gained from books and colleges  miss goldsmith was the most to be pitied  she would not hear a word from her nephew refused to go near willow lawn packed up her goods and went to bath where ulick promised the much distressed genevieve that she would yet relent  genevieve was somewhat consoled by the increasing cordiality of the irish letters and was carried along by the extreme delight and triumph of her good old aunt  by some wonderful exertion of irish faculties ulick succeeded in bringing mademoiselle to bayford in his jaunting car when she laughed wept sobbed and embraced in a bewilderment of transport pronounced the trousseau worthy of an angel of the ancien regime warned genevieve against expecting amour to continue instead of amitie and carried home conversation for the nuns for the rest of their lives  that trousseau was sophys special charge and most jealous was she that it should in no respect fall short of that outfit of lucys for which she had cared so little  a hard task it was to make genevieve accept what lucy had exacted but sophy held the pursestrings wrote the orders and had her own way  she and her little sister were the only available bridesmaids since rose omore was not allowed to come  having made up her mind to this from the first when the subject came forward her open cheerful look and manner were meant to show that she was not afraid and that her wish was real  freely resigning him why should she not be glad to join in calling down the blessing  the wedding was fixed for easter week which fell early and albinia cast about for some excuse for taking her away afterwards  an opportune occasion offered  sir william ferrars wrote from the east to propose the kendals meeting him in italy and travelling home together he was longing he said to see something of his sister and he should enjoy sightseeing ten times as much with a clever man like her husband to tell him all about it  mr ferrars strongly seconded the project  clever fellow not a word did he say but did not he know the secrets of that household as well or better than the inmates themselves  now that tibbs alley was deserted and plans fixed architect and clerk of the works chosen march winds ready for building and underground work to begin at once what could be more prudent than for the inhabitants of willow lawn to remove far from the disturbance of ancient drains and no drains and betake themselves to a purer atmosphere  mr kendal was of no use as a superintendent and needed no persuasion to flee from the chance of typhus  as to the children the time had come early when maurices whole nature cried out for school  he was much improved and there was that real principle within him which made it not unsafe to launch him in a world where he might meet with more useful trials than those of home  child as he was his propensities were too much limited by the bounds of the townhouse and garden and the society of his sisters one too old and one too young to serve as tomboys  he needed to meet his match and work his way albinia felt that school had become his element and mr kendal only wanted to make his education the reverse of gilberts so he ran nearly frantic between the real jacket and the promise of going to school with willie  he knew not though his mother mourned over the coming heartsickness and mothersickness of the first night the first sunday the first trouble  it was sure to be very severe in one of such strong and affectionate feeling but it must come sooner or later and the better that it should be conquered while home was still a paradise  fairmead was not so far from his destination but that his uncle would keep an eye on him and winifred held out a hope that if the tour lasted long enough he should bring out both boys to spend their holidays with them  a very good winifred  albinia the less was to become a traveller for the good reason that nobody could or would go without her  they were to go direct to lucy who was at naples with a second boy and pining for home faces and home comfortsthe inducement which perhaps worked most strongly to make sophy like the journey for since her delusion had been swept away a doubly deep and intense feeling had sprung up towards her own only sister whose foibles had been forgotten in long separation     chapter xxxi    the lake of lucerne lay blue and dark in the shade of the mountains on whose summits the evening sunshine was fast mounting peak after peak falling into purple shadow  there was a small inlet where a stream rushed down between the hills and on the green slope stood a chalet the rich red of the roof contrasting with the green pasture  a little boat was moored to a stump near the land and in it sat sophia kendal her hat by her side listening to and answering merrily the chatter of maurice who tumbled about in the boat often causing it severe shocks while he inspected the cut of the small sail which she was making for the miniature specimen which he often tried in the clear cold water  farther off a little up the hillside willie ferrars was holding the hand of the chestnutcurled blackeyed fairy little awk who was impressing him by her fluency in two languages at once according as she chattered to him in english or in french to a picturesque peasant her great ally who was mowing his flowery crop of hay glancing like an illumination with an undercurrent of brilliant blossoms among the grass  wandering with slow conversational pace up and down the beach of the lake were mr kendal and sir william ferrars conversing as usual the soldier with quick alert comprehension wide observation and clearness of mind which jumped to the very points to which the scholars deeplyread and longdigested arguments were bringing him more slowly  on a projecting point sat albinia her fair hair shaded under her dark hat beneath which her english complexion glowed fresh and youthful as with flat tin box by her side and block sketchbook on her knee she mixed and she painted and tried to catch those purples and those blues with unabated ardour  suddenly a great trailing frond of mountain fern came over the brim of her hat from behind oh maurice dont  then looking up and laughing oh it is you is it  i knew maurice would do whichever it might be but see the other is quite out of mischief  unless he should upset sophy into the lake  he cant do that the rope is too short  but is not he very much improved  he has quite lost his imperious manner towards her  nothing like school for making a boy behave himself to his sisters  exactly as i learnt by experience long ago  i am glad william did not see him till he had learnt to be agreeable  how he does admire him  youll never make anything of that sketch the mountain is humpbacked and the face of that precipice is exactly like colonel bury and he caught up a pencil to help out the resemblance with nostril and eyebrow  for shame to be so mischievieous such a great boy as you  well we all came out here to be great boys didnt we  i am sure you look a dozen years younger than when i last saw you mrs grandmother  bytheby it was a bold stroke to encumber yourself with that brat whats become of him  susan has taken him in asleep  you see maurice i really could not help it the poor little thing was so sickly and had never thriven but when they were a little while in bracing air lucy was longing to have him in england and his father who never believes in anything but what he likes would not see it and what with those italian servants and algernon hunting lucy about as he does it would have been the death of him  susan good creature had taken to him of her own accord the moment we came to naples and could not have borne to leave him and you know the awk is almost off her hands now and sophy who first proposed it or i am sure i should never have ventured is delighted to do anything for either of them and always has her little sister in her room  as to papa he was very good and the child is very little in his way and has been quite well ever since we have been in this delicious air  how did you get lucy to consent  poor dear it was a melancholy business but she had so often been in alarm about him and had suffered so much from having to leave him with people she did not trust that she caught at the proposal before she fairly contemplated what the parting would be and when she did algernon was too glad to be relieved from him not to keep her up to it but it wont do to think of it she has her baby who is healthier and if they remain abroad i suspect we shall keep little ralph altogether he is a dear little fellow and sophy has so taken possession of albinia that i should be quite lost if i did not set up a private child  what do you call him  i thought his name was belraven  i could not possibly call him so and his aunts by way of adding to the aviary made him ralph the raven so i mean it to stick by him i believe papa has forgotten the other dreadful fact for i caught him giving his name as ralph cavendish dusautoy  how the dear vicar of bayford will devour him and what work i shall have to keep him from being spoilt  then you think they will remain abroad  algernon hates england and all his habits are foreign  did he make himself tolerably agreeable  he really did  one could bear to be patronized by ones host better than by ones guest and he was in wholesome awe of william besides he is really at home in italy and knows his way about so well that he was not a bad cicerone  i am sure sophy could never have done either vesuvius or pompeii without his arrangements and as long as he had a victim for his catalogue raisonnee he was very placable and obliging  that was all extracts so it really was not so bad  so you were satisfied  he has a bad lot about him thats the worstpolish counts disreputable artists and poets any one who has a spurious sort of fame and knows how to flatter him  edmund was terribly disgusted  very bad for his wife  you see she is a thoroughgoing mother and no linguist  she really is improved and i like her more really than ever i could poor dear  i believe her head was once quite turned and that he influenced her entirely and made her forget everything else but she has a heart though not much of a head and sorrow and illness and children have brought it out and she is what a very woman becomes i suppose if there be any good in her an abstract wife and mother  was it not dangerous to take away her child  there was another you know and it was to save his life  the duties clashed and were destroying all comfort  how does he behave to her  i believe she has all the love he has to spare he is proud of her and dresses her up and has endless portraits of her  luckily she keeps her beauty  she is more refined and has more expression one could sometimes cry to watch her and he likes to have her with him and to discourse to her but without the slightest perception or consideration of what she would prefer and with no notion of sacrificing anything for her or the children  i know she is afraid of him i have seen her tremble if there were any chance of his being annoyed and she would not object to any plan of his if it were to cost her life  i believe it would be misery to her but i think she would resistay she did resist and in vain for the sake of her child  does her affection hold out do you think  oh yes the spaniel and walnuttree love which is in us all and doubly in the very woman  it is very beautiful  she is so proud of him and of her gilded slavery and so unconsciously submissive and patient but it is a harder life i guess than we can see  i am sure it must be for every bit of personal vanity and levity is worn out of her she only goes out to satisfy him dresses to please his eye and talks with her eye seeking round for him in dread of being rebuked for mistakes or bad french  and for the rest her joy is to be left in peace with little algernon upon her lap  yes i hope living in all womanly virtues may be training and compensation but the saddest part of the affair is that he does not think it fashionable to be religious and she has not moral courage to make open resistance  may it come fervently  it is strange how much more real and good a creature she is now than when at home in the midst of all external observances  yet it cannot be right she surely ought to make more stand but it is too too literally being afraid to say her soul is her own for she is unhappy  she does the utmost she can without offending him and feels it as she never did before  there is no judging said maurice as his sister looked at him with eyes full of sorrowful yearning  no one can tell where are the boundaries of the two duties  poor girl she has put herself into a state of temptation and trial but she may be shielded by her exercise of so much that is simply good and her womanly qualities may become not idolatry but a training in reaching higher  may it be so indeed said albinia  oh maurice how i once disdained being told i was too young and how true it was  what visions i had about those three and what failures have resulted  your visions may have vanished but you did your work faithfully and it has not been fruitless  ay in shipwrecked lives  mischiefs wherever i meant to do best why i let even my own maurice grow unmanageable while i was nursing poor grandmamma  the voluntary duty choked the natural one and yet  and yet interrupted her brother that was no error  oh no  i would not have done it for anything  nor do i think the boy the worse for it  i may venture now on saying he was intolerable and it hastened school but though your rein was loose you never let it fall and maybe the selfconquest was the best thing for him  if you had neglected him wilfully for your own pleasure nothing but harm could have been expected  as you were absorbed by a sacred act of duty i believe it will all be made up to you in your son  oh maurice if i might trust so  i believe i am doubly set on that boy doing well because his father must not must not have another pang  i think he knows that  i do not imagine that he will never be carried astray by high spirits but i am sure that he has the strength honour and sweetness that are the elements of greatness  nothing we did so changed him as the loss of his brother  oh maurice there was my most earnest wish to do right and my most fatal mistake  and greatest success  gilbert owed everything to you  had i but silenced my foolish pride he might have been safe in india now  we do not know how safe he might be  i did indeed think it a pity your influence led the other way but things might have been far worse if you made some blunders your love and your earnestness were working on that susceptible nature and what better hope can we wish to have than what rested with us at malta what better influence than has remained with maurice or with fred  albinia had not yet learnt to talk calmly of gilberts last hours so she put this aside and smiling through her tears said ah when emily writes to sophy that their boy is to have his name since they can wish nothing better for him than to be like him  the past vision always a little above what is visible  hardly emily and fred are as proud of each other as two peacocks and well they may be forstoop down tis an intense secret but do you know the effect of their sebastopol den  eh  lieutenantgeneral sir william ferrars is going out in quest of emilys younger sister  you ridiculous child  thats a trick of yours  no indeed  william was surprised into a moment of confidence walking home in the moonlight from the coliseum  en vrai militaire he has begun at the right end and written to mr kinnaird to ask leave to come and try his luck and cool as he looks i believe he would rather prepare for inkermann  well if he be not making a fool of himself at his time of life i am sure i am very glad  time of life  hes but three years older than edmund  if you are not more respectful we shall have to go out to canada to countenance him  i shall be rejoiced to see him with a home and finding life beyond his profession but i had rather he had known more of her  thats what he never would do  he cannot talk to a young lady  why he admires lucy a great deal more than sophy  well judging by the recent brides i think if it had been me i should have gone in search of mrs ulick omores younger sister  ah i wanted particularly to hear of your visit at the bank  you had luncheon there i think how do they get on  it is the most charming menage in the world  she looks very graceful and elegant and keeps him in great order and is just the wife he wanteda little sauciness and piquancy to spur him up at one time and restrain him at another with the real ballast that both have makes such a perfect compound that it is only too delightful to see anything so happy and so good in this world  they both seem to have such vivid enjoyment of life  pray has any one called on genevieve though she could dispense with it  oh yes bryan omore spent a fortnight there  and see what a moustache will do  the osbornes drurys wolfes and co all dubbed themselves dear mrs omores dearest friends  i found a circle of them round her and when i observed that bryan was not half such a handsome fellow as his brother you should see how i was scorned  i hope bryan may not play his fathers game again  do you know how she was received in ireland  the whole clan adore her  ulick with his anglosaxon truthfulness got into serious scrapes for endeavouring to disabuse them of the notion that she was sole heiress of the ancient marquisate of durant  i believe connel was ready to call ulick out for disrespect to his own wife  and was she happy there  very much amused and treated like a queen charmed with his mother and great friends with rose  they have brought redmond home to lick him into shape and i believe rose is to come and be tamed  always ulicks wish said albinia as her eye fixed upon sophy  and her brother with perhaps too obvious a connexion of ideas said is she quite strong  very well said albinia  i am glad we brought her  the sight of beauty has been like a new existence  i saw it on her brow in calmness and rest the first evening of the bay of naples  it has seemed to soothe and elevate her though all in her own silent way but watch her as she sits with her face to those mountains hear her voice and you will feel that the presence of grandeur and beauty is repose and happiness to her and i think the remembrance will always be so even in workaday bayford  yes because remembrance of such glory connects with hope of future glory  and it is a rest from human frets and passions  she has taken to botany too and i am glad for i think those studies that draw one off from mens works and thoughts do most good to the weary selfoccupied brain  and the children are a delight to her  sophy is your greatest work  not mine cried albinia  the noblest by nature the dearest the most generous  great qualities but they would have been only wretched selfpreying torments but for the softening of your affection said maurice  dear dear friend and sister and child in one cried albinia  and then meeting her brothers eyes she said yes you know to the full how noble she is and how  i can guess how imprudent a young stepmother can be said maurice smiling  it is very strange  i dont know how to be thankful enough for it but really her spirits have

blunders but i do verily believe that while an earnest will saves us by gods grace from wilful sins the effects of the inadvertences that teach us our secret faults will not be fatal and while we are indeed honestly and faithfully doing our best though we are truly unprofitable servants that our lapses through infirmity will be compensated both in the training of our own character and the results upon others  if we are indeed faithfully doing our best repeated albinia    the end
