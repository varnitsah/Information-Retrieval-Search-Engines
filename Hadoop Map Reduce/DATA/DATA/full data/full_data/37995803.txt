last trail     money magic     chapter i  the clerk of the golden eagle   sibley junction is in the subtropic zone of colorado it lies in a hot dry but immensely productive valley at an altitude of some four thousand feet above the sea a village laced with irrigating ditches shaded by big cottonwoodtrees and beat upon by a genial generousminded sun the boarders at the golden eagle hotel can sit on the front stoop and see the snowfilled ravines of the mountains to the south and almost hear the thunder crashing round old uncompahgre even when the broad leaves above their heads are pulseless and the heat of the midday light is a cataract of molten metal  it is as i have said a productive land for upon this ashen cactusspotted repellent flat men have directed the cool sweet water of the upper world and wherever this lifegiving fluid touches the soil grass and grain spring up like magic  for all its wild and beautiful setting sibley is now a town of farmers and traders rather than of miners the wagons entering the gates are laden with wheat and melons and peaches rather than with ore and giantpowder and the hotels are frequented by ranchers of prosaic aspect by passing drummers for shoes and sugars and by the barbers and clerks of nearby shops it is in fact a bit of slowgoing village life dropped between the diabolism of cripple creek and the decay of creede  nevertheless now and then a genuine trailer from the heights or cowman from the mesas does drop into town on some transient business and with his peculiar speech and stride remind the lazy townloafers of the vigorous life going on far above them such types nearly always put up at the eagle hotel which was a boardinghouse advanced to the sidewalk of the main street and possessing a register  at the time of this story trade was good at the eagle for two reasons mrs gilman was both landlady and cook and an excellent cook and what was still more alluring bertha her pretty daughter was dayclerk and general manager customers of the drummer type are very loyal to their hotels and amazingly sensitive to female charmtherefore bertha who would have been called an attractive girl anywhere was widely known and tenderly recalled by every brakeman on the line she was tall and straight with brown hair and big candid serious eyeswistful when in repose boyishly frank and direct as she stood behind her desk attending to business or smiling as she sped her parting guests at the door  i know bertie ought to be in school mrs gilman said one day to a sympathetic guest but what can i do we got to live i didnt come out here for my health but goodness knows i never expected to slave away in a hot kitchen in this way if mr gilman had lived  it was her habit to leave her demonstrationseven her sentencesunfinished a peculiarity arising partly from her need of hastening to prevent some pot from boiling over and partly from her failing powers she had been handsome oncebut the heat of the stove the steam of the washtub and the vexation and prolonged effort of her daily life had warped and faded and battered her into a pathetic wreck of womanhood  im going to quit this thing as soon as i get my sons ranch paid for you see  she did not finish this but her friend understood berthas time for schooling was past she had already entered upon the maidens land of dreamsof romance the men who had hitherto courted her halflaughingly halfguiltily knowing that she was a child had at last dropped all subterfuge to them she was a girl with all that this word means to males not too scrupulous of the rights of women  i oughtnt to quit now when business is so good mrs gilman returned to the diningroom to add im full all the time and crowded on saturday more and more of the boys come down the line on purpose to stay over sunday if i can stick it out a little while  the reason why the boys came down the line to stay over sunday was put into words one day by winchell the barber who took his meals at the eagle  he was a cleanly shaven young man of twentyfour or five with a carefully tended brown mustache which drooped below the corners of his mouth  he began by saying to bertha  i wish i could get out of my business judas but i get tired of it when i left the farm i never sposed id find myself nailed down to the floor of a barbershop but here i am and making good money howd you like to go on a ranch he asked meaningly  i dont believe id like it too lonesome she replied without any attempt to coquette with the hidden meaning of his question i kind o like this hotel business i enjoy having new people sifting along every day seems like i couldnt bear to step out into private life again ive got so used to this public thing i only wish mother didnt have to work so hardthats all that troubles me at the present time  her speech was quite unlike the birdlike chatter with which girls of her age entertain a lover she spoke rather slowly and with the gravity of a man of business and her blunt phrases made her smile the more bewitching and her big brown eyes the more girlish she did not giggle or flushshe only looked past his smirking face out into the street where the suns rays lay like flame and yet she was profoundly moved by the man for he was a handsome fellow in a sleek way  just the same you oughtnt to be clerk said the barber its no place for a girl anyway housekeeping is all right but this clerking is too public  oh i dont know we have a mighty nice run of custom and i dont see anything bad about it ive met a lot of good fellows by being here  the barber was silent for a moment then pulled out his watch well ive got to get back he dropped his voice dont let em get gay with you remember ive got a mortgage on you if any of em gets fresh you let me knowthey wont repeat it  dont you worry she replied with a confident smile i can take care of myself i grew up in colorado im no tenderfoot  this boast so childish so full of pathetic selfassertion was still on her lips when a couple of men came out of the diningroom and paused to buy some cigars at the counter one of them was at first sight a very handsome man of pronounced western sort he wore a long gray frockcoat without vest and a darkblue stiffly starched shirt over which a red necktie fluttered his carriage was erect his hands large of motion and his profile very fine in its bold lines his eyes were gray and in expression cold and penetrating his nose was broad and the corners of his mouth bitter he could not be called young and yet he was not even middleaged his voice was deep and harsh in accent but as he spoke to the girl a certain sweetness came into it  well babe here i am again couldnt get along without coming down to spend sundayseems like williams must go to church on sunday or lose his chance o grace  his companion a short man with a black mustache that almost made a circle about his mouth grinned in silence  bertha replied i think ill take a forenoon off tomorrow captain haney and see that you both go to mass for once in your life  the big man looked at her with sudden intensity if youll take meill go there was something in his voice and eyes that startled the girl she drew back a little but smiled bravely carrying out the jest  ill call you on that unless you take water you go to church tomorrow  the big man shoved his companion away and leaning across the counter said in a low and deeply significant tone  there aint a thing in this world that you cant do with mart haneynot a thing thats what i came down here to tell youyou can boss my ranch any day  the girl was visibly alarmed but as she still stood fascinated by his eyes and voice struggling to recover her serenity another group of diners came noisily past and the big man with a parting look went out and took a seat on one of the chairs which stood in a row upon the walk the hand which held the cigar visibly trembled and his companion said  be careful mart  haney silenced him with a look youre on the outside here partner  i didnt mean to butt in  i understand but this is a matter between that little girl and me replied the big man in a tone that while friendly ended all further remark on the part of his companion who rose after a little pause and walked away  haney remained seated buried in thought amazed at the fever which his encounter with the girl had put into his blood  it was true that he had been coming down every saturday for weeksleaving his big saloon on the best evening in the week for a chance to see this childthis boyish schoolgirl in a savage selfish and unrestrained way he loved her and had determined to possess herto buy her if necessary he knew something of the toil through which the weary mother plodded and he watched her bend and fade with a certainty that she would one day be on his side  when at home and afar from her he felt capable of seizing the girlof carrying her back with him as the oldtime savage won his bride but when he looked into her clear calm eyes his villiany his resolution fell away from him he found himself not merely a man of the nearer time but a catholicin training at leastand the words he had planned to utter fell dead on his lips libertine though he was there were lines over which even his lawlessness could not break  he was a desperate charactera man of violenceand none too delicate in his life among women but away back in his boyhood his good irish mother had taught him to fight fair and to protect the younger and weaker children and this training led to the most curious and unexpected acts in his business as a gambler  i will not have boys at my layout he once angrily said to williams his partner and i will not have women there ive sins enough to answer for without these cut em out he was oddly generous now and then and often returned to a greenhorn money enough to get home on stay on the farm me ladtis better to milk a cow with a mosquito on the back of your neck than to fill a cell at cañon city  in other ways he was inexorable taking the hazards of the game with his visitors and raking in their money with cold eyes and a steady hand he collected all notes remorselesslyand it was in this way that he had acquired his interests in the bottom dollar and the flora minesprospects at the time but immensely valuable at the present it was indeed this new and measurably respectable wealth which had determined him upon pressing his suit with bertha as he sat there he came to a most momentous conclusion why not marry the girl and live honest he asked himself and being moved by the memory of her sweetness and humor he said i will and the resolution filled his heart with a strange delight  he presented the matter first to the mother not with any intention of doing the right thing but merely because she happened into the room before the girl returned and because he was overflowing with his newfound grace  mrs gilman came in wiping her face on her apronas his mother used to doand this touched him almost like a caress he rose and offered her a chair which she accepted highly flattered  it must seem warm to you down here captain she remarked as she took a seat beside him  it does i wouldnt need to suffer it if you were doing business in cripple i cant leave go your johnnycake and pie tis the kind that mother didnt makefor she was irish  ive thought of going up there she replied matteroffactly but i cant stand the altitude im afraidand then down here we have my sons little ranch to furnish us eggs and vegetables  thats an advantage he admitted but on the peak no one expects vegetablesits still a matter of ham and eggs  is that so she asked concernedly  tis indeed i live at the palace hotel and i know however tis not of that i intended to speak mrs gilman im distressed to see you working so hard this warm weather you need a resta vacation im thinkin  youre mighty neighborly captain to say so but i dont see any way of taking it  furthermore your daughter is too fine to be clerkin here day by day she should be in a home of her own  she ought to be in school sighed the mother but i dont see my way to hiring anybody to fill her placeit would take a man to do her work  it would so shes a rare little business woman let me see how old is she  eighteen next november  she seems like a woman of twenty  i couldnt run for a week without her answered the mother rolling down her sleeves in acknowledgment that they had entered upon a real conversation  shes a little queen declared haney  it was very hot and the flies were buzzing about but the big gambler had no mind to these discomforts so intent was he upon bringing his proposal before the mother straightened in his chair and fixing a keen glance upon her face he began his attack tis folly to allow anything to trouble you my dear womanif anny debt presses let me know and ill lift it for ye  the weary mother felt the sincerity of his offer and replied with much feeling youre mighty good captain haney but were more than holding our own and another year will see the ranch clear im just as much obliged to you though youre a true friend  but i dont like to think of you here for another yearand bertie should not stand here another day with every tom dick and harry passin their blarney with her shes fitter to be mistress of a big house of her own an tis that ive the mind to give her and i can for im no longer on the ragged edge i own two of the best mines on the hill and i want her to share me goodfortune with me  mrs gilman worn out as she was was still quick where her daughters welfare was concerned and she looked at the big man with wonder and inquiry and a certain accusation in her glance  what do you mean captain  the big gambler was at last face to face with his decision and with but a moments hesitation replied as my wife i mean of course  she sank back in her chair and looked at him with eyes of consternation why captain haney do you really mean that  i do he had a feeling at the moment that he had always been honorable in his intentions  butbutyoure so oldi mean so much older  i know i am and im rough i dont deny that im forty but then im what they call well preserved he smiled winningly and ill soon have an income of wan hundred thousand dollars a year  this turned the current of her emotionshe gasped one hundred thousand dollars  he held up a warning hand sh now thats between us there are those younger than i tis true but there is a kind of saving grace in money i can take you all out of this daily tile like winkinall you need to do is to say the wan word and well have a house in colorado springs or denveror even in new york for what did you think i left me business on the busiest day of every week it was to see your sweet daughter and i came this time to ask her to go back with me  what did she say  she has not said we had no time to talk what i propose now is that we take a drive out to the ranch and talk it over williams will fill her place here in fact the house is mine i bought it this morning  the poor woman sat like one in a stupor comprehending little of what he said the room seemed to be revolving the earth had given way beneath her feet and the heavens were opening her first sensation was one of terror she feared a man of such powera man who could in a single moment by a wave of his hand upset her entire world his enormous wealth dazzled her even while she doubted it how could it be true while he sat there talking to herand she in her apron and her hair in disorder she rose hurriedly with instinct to make herself presentable enough to carry on this conversation as she stood weakly she apologized incoherently  captain i appreciate your kindnessyouve always been a good customerone i liked to do forbut im all upseti cant get my wits  no hurry madam he said with a generous intent tomorrow is coming dont hurry at allat all  she hurried out leaving him alonewith the clock the cat and the hostler who was spraying the sidewalk under the cottonwoodtrees quivering with fear of the girls refusal the gambler rose and went out into the sunsmit streets to commune with this newfound self  life was no longer simple for mrs gilman it was indeed filled with a wind of terror haneys promise of relief from want was very sweet yet disturbingly empty like the joy of dreams and yet his words took her breathclouded her judgment befogged her insight  she went back to the diningroom where her daughter sat eating dinner with a numbness in her limbs and a sense of dizziness in her brain and dropping into a chair at the table gasped out  do you knowwhat captain haney just said to me  not being a mindreader i dont replied the girl calmly though she was moved by her mothers white awed face  he wants you  bertha flushed and braced both hands against the table as she replied well he cant have me  with the opposition in her daughters tone mrs gilman was suddenly moved to argue  think what it means bertie hes rich did you know that he owns two mines  i know he is a gambler and runs two saloons you see the boys keep me posted and im not marrying a gamblernot this summer she ended decisively  but hes going to give that up he says he hadnt said this but she was sure he would his income is a hundred thousand dollars a year think of that  i dont want to think of it the girl answered frowning slightly it makes my head ache nobody has a right to so much money how did he get it  out of his mineand oh bertie he says if youll speak the word we neednt do another days work in this hot greasy old place the house is his anyway did you know that  bertha eyed her mother closelywith cool bright accusing eyesfor a moment then she softened poor old mammy its pretty tough lines on youno two ways about that youve got the heavy end of the job id marry most anybody to give you a restbut mother captain haney is forty if hes a day and hes a hard citizen he has been a gambler all his life you cant expect me to marry a sport like him and then theres ed  the mothers face changed a barber she exclaimed scornfully  yes hes a barber now but hes going to make a break soon and get into something else  dont bank on ed bertie hell never be anything more than he is now no man ever got anywhere who started in as a barber  would you rather i married a gambler and a sureshot they tell me haney has killed his man  that may be all talk well anyhow he wants to see you and talk it over and oh bertie it does seem a wonderful chanceand my hearts so bad today it seems as though i couldnt see to another meal i dont want you to marry him if you dont want toim not asking you to you know im not but he is a noblelooking manand i get awfully discouraged sometimes it scares me to think of dying and leaving you without any security  one of the waiters halfdead with curiosity was edging near under pretense of brushing the table and so the mistress rose and took up the burdens of her stewardship  but well talk it over tonight dont be hasty  i wont replied the girl  she was by no means as unmoved as she gave out she had always admired and liked captain haney though he never moved her in the same way that the young barber did for ed winchell had youth as well as comeliness and there is a divine suppleness in youth yet he had been a welcome guest a hundred thousand dollars a year and yet hes been coming to our little hotel for a yearto see me  this consideration was the one that moved her most all the bland words the jocular phrases of his singular wooing came back to her now weighted with deep significance she had called it joshing and had put it all aside just as she had parried the rude jests of the brakemen of her acquaintance now she saw that he had been in earnest  she was wise beyond her years this calmfaced keeneyed girl trained by adversity to take care of herself she knew instinctively that she lived surrounded by wolves and much as she admired the big frame and bold profile of captain haney she had placed him among her enemies his coming always pleased her but at the same time put her upon the defensive  strange to say she enjoyed her position there in her battered little hotel if it werent for poor old mother she arrested herself and went back to the counter with a certain timidity a selfconsciousness new to her fearing to face the gambler now that she knew his intent was honorable  the room was empty all the men having gone out upon the walk to escape the heat and she took her seat behind her desk and gave herself up to a consideration of the life to which the possession of so much wealth would introduce her she could have unlimited new gowns she could travel and she could rescue her mother from drudgery and worry these things she could discernbut of the larger life which money could open to her she could only vaguely dream  the first effect of marrying marshall haney would be to cut short her life in sibley the second the establishment of a home in the great camps about them  as she looked around the dingy room buzzing with flies she experienced a premonitory pang of the pain she would suffer in going out of its doors forever  when haney came back an hour later he read in the cold serious look she gave him a warning therefore he spoke but a few words on commonplace subjects and returned to his seat on the walk to await a change in her mood  this meekness on the part of a powerful man moved the girl and a little later she went to the doorway and said to the crowd generally its a wonder some fellow wouldnt open a cantaloupe or something  haney put his finger to his mouth and whistled to the grocer opposite he came on the run alert for trade  roll up a couple of big melons called haney largely were all drying to cinders over here  the loafers cheered but the girl said in a lower voice i was only joking  what you say goes he replied with significance  she did not stay to see the melons cut but went back to her desk and he brought a choice slice in to her  she took it but she said you mustnt think you own menot yet her tone was resentful i dont want you to say things like thatbefore people  like what he asked  she did not answer  he went on i dont mean to assume anything god knows im only waitin and hopin ill go away if you want me to and let you think it over alone  i wish you would she said realizing that this committed her to at least a consideration of his proposal  he held out his hand goodbyetill next saturday  she put her small brown hand in his he crushed it hard and his bold face softened i need you my girl sure i do and in his eyes was something very winning     chapter ii  marshall haney changes heart   it was well for haney that bertie did not see him as he sat above his gambling boards watchful keeneyed grim of visage for she would have trembled in fear of him haneys was both saloon and gambling hall in the front on the right ran the long bar with its shining brass and polished mahogany he prided himself on having the best bar west of denver and in the rear occupying both sides of the room stood two long rows of faro and roulette outfits together with cardtables and diceboards it was the largest and most prosperous gambling hall in the camps and always of an evening was crowded with gamesters and those who came as lookerson  on the right side in a raised seat about midway of the hall haney usually sat a handsome figure in broad white hat immaculate linen and wellcut frockcoat his face as pale as that of a priest in the glare of the big electric light on the other side and directly opposite williams kept corresponding lookout over the dealers and the crowd he was a bold man who attempted any shenanigan with mart haney and the games of his halls were reported honest  to think of a young and innocent girl married to this remorseless gambler scarred with the gun and the knife was a profanation of maidenhoodand yet as he fell now and then into a dream he took on a kind of savage beauty which might allure and destroy a woman whatever else he was he was neither commonplace nor mean the visitors to whom he was pointed out as a type of our modern western desperado invariably acknowledged that he looked the part his smile was of singular sweetnessall the more alluring because of its rarityand the warm clasp of his big soft hand had made him sheriff in san juan county and his bravery and his love of fair play were well known and admired among the miners  the sombre look in his face which resembled that of a dreaming leopard was due to the new and secret plans with which his mind was now engaged if she takes me i quit this business he had promised himself she despises me in it and so does the mother and so i reckon tis up to me to clean house  then he thought of his own mother who had the same prejudice and who would not have taken a cent of his earnings i see no harm in the business he said men will drink and they will gamble and i might as well serve their wish as any otherbetter indeed for no man can accuse me of dark ways nor complain of the order of me house i am a business man the same as him that runs a grocery store but tis no matter she dislikes it and that ends it shes a clearheaded wan he thought with a glow of admiration for her shes the captain  he no longer thought of her as his victimas something to be ruthlessly enjoyedhe trembled before her big and brave and relentless as he was in the world of men what has come over me he asked himself sure she has me on me kneesthe witch me mind is filled with her  all through the week his agents were at work attempting to sell his saloons im ready to close out at a moments notice he declared  at times as he sat in his place he lost consciousness of the crowding roughhatted intent men and the monotonous calls of the dealers the click of balls the buzz of lowtoned comment died out of his earshe was back in troy looking for his father whom he had not seen or written to in twenty years he saw himself with a dainty little woman on his arm taking the boat to new york i will go to the biggest hotel in the city the girl shall have the best the old town has nothing will be too good for her  he roused himself to a touch on his elbow one of his agents had a new offer for the two saloons it was still less than he considered the business worth but in his softened mood he said it goes  make out your papers replied the other man with almost equal brevity  during the rest of the evening the gambler sat above his layout with mingled feelings of relief and regret after all he was in command here he knew this business and he loved the companionship and the admiration of the men who dropped round by his side to discuss the camp or the weather or to invite him to join a hunting trip he felt himself to be one of the chief men of the town and that he could at any time become their representative if he chose for some years he couldnt have told why he had taken on a thrift unknown to him before and had been attending strictly to business he now saw that it must have been from a foreknowledge of bertha in him the superstitions of both miner and gambler mingled the cards had run against him for three years now they were falling in his favor i will take advantage of them he declared  slowly the crowd thinned out and at one oclock only a few inveterate pokerplayers and one or two young fellows who were still bucking the roulette wheel remained and calling one of his men to take charge haney nodded to williams and they went out on the street  as he reached the cold crisp deliciously rarefied air outside he took off his hat and involuntarily looked up at the stars blazing thick in the deepblue midnight sky with solemn voice he said to his partner well spot right here mart haneys saloon business ends were all in  williams felt that his partner was acting rashly oh i wouldnt say that you may get into it again  nothe little girl and her mother wont stand for it and besides whats the use i dont need to do it and if im ever going to see the world now is my chance im goin back east to discover how many brothers and sisters i have livin the old father is dodderin round somewheres back there ill surprise him too now have those papers all made out ready to sign by eleven oclock tomorrow im goin down the valley on the noon train  all right mart but youre makin a mistake  never you mind me bucko tis me own game and the mines will take all the gray matter you can spare  as the big man was walking away towards his hotel a woman met him hello mart  hello mag whats doing  she was humped and bedraggled and her face looked white in the moonlight nothing stake a fellow to a hot soup wont you  sure thing mag he handed her a fivedollar gold piece is it as bad as that whats t old man doin these days  servin time she answered bitterly  oh so he is replied haney hastily id forgotten well take care o yourself he added genially walking on in instant forgetfulness of the womans misery for his mind was turned upon the talk which his younger brother charley had given him not long before in denver  it was not a cheerful conversation for charley flippantly confessed that he didnt hold any family reunions and that all he knew of his brothers he gained by chance theyre all great boozers he said in summing them up tim is a ward heeler in buffalocame to see me at the stagedoor loaded to the gunnels tom is a greasy threefingered brakeman on the central fannie married a carpenter and has about seventeen young ones mary died you know  no i didnt know  yes died about four years ago she was like mothera nice girl dad sent me a paper with a notice of her death he never writes but now and then when tim has a fight or tom gets drunk and slips into the criminal column i hear of them  charles did not say so but mart knew that he was lumped among the other povertystricken worthless members of the family he did not at the time undeceive his brother but now that he was no longer a gambler and saloonkeeper now that he was rich he resolved not only to let his father know of his goodfortune and his change of life but also and this was due to berties influence he earnestly desired to help his family out of their mire  we had good stuff in us he said but we went wrong after the mother left us  as he walked on down the street a strange radiance came into the world the distant peaks of the sangre de cristo range rose in dim and shadowy majesty to the south and wondering astonished at the emotion stirring in his heart the regenerated desperado turned to see the moon lifting above the crown of the great peak to the east for the first time in many years his heart was filled with a sense of the beauty of the world     chapter iii  bertha yields to temptation   bertie looked older and graver when haney entered the eagle hotel and his heart expanded with a tenderness that was partly paternal she seemed so young and looked so pale and troubled  she greeted him unsmilingly and calmly handed him the pen with which to register  how are you all he asked with genuine concern  pretty bum mother gave out this week its the heat i guess hottest weather weve had since i came to town  why didnt you let me know  she avoided his question were too low here at junction mother ought to go a couple of thousand feet higher she needs rest and a change ive sent her out to the ranch  youre not running the house alone  why certthat is except my brothers wife is taking mothers place in the kitchen im runnin the rest of it just as ive been doin for three years  he looked his admiration before he uttered it youre a wonder  dont you think it how does it happen youre down today you said saturday  ive sold outsigned the deeds today im out of the liquor trade forever  she nodded gravely im glad of that i dont like the businessnot a little bit  he took this as an encouragement i knew you didnt well im neither saloonkeeper nor gambler from this day im a miner and a capitalistand all i have is yours he added in a lovers voice bending a keen glance upon her  the girl was standing very straight behind her desk and her face did not change but her eyes shifted before his gaze youd better go in to supper while the biscuit are hot she advised coolly  he had tact enough to take his dismissal without another word or glance and after he had gone she still stood there in the same rigid pose but her face was softer and clouded with serious meditation it was wonderful to think of this rich and powerful man changing his whole life for her  winchell the young barber came in hurriedly his face full of accusation and alarm was that haney who just came in he asked truculently  yes hes at supperwant to see him  see him no and i dont want you to see him hes too free with you bert i dont like it  she smiled a little curious smile dont mix it up with him edid hate to see your remains afterwards  bert see here youve been funny with me lately by funny he meant unaccountable and your mother has been hinting things at meand now here is haney leaving his business to come down the middle of the week whats the meaning of it  it isnt the middle of the week its friday she corrected him  he went on i know what he keeps coming to see you for but for gods sake dont you think of marrying an old tout and gambler like him  he isnt old and he isnt a gambler any more she significantly retorted  what do you mean  hes sold outclean as a whistle  dont you believe it its a trick to get you to think better of him bert dont you dare to go back on me he cried out warninglydont you dare  the girl suddenly ceased smiling and asserted herself see here ed youd better not try to boss me i wont stand for it what license have you got to pop in here every few minutes and tell me whats what you tend to your business and youll get ahead faster  he stammered with rage and pain if you throw me downfer thatold tout ill kill you both  the girl looked at him in silence for a long time and into her brain came a new swift and revealing concept of his essential littleness and weakness his beauty lost its charm and a kind of disgust rose in her throat as she slowly said with cutting scorn  if you really meant thatbut you dont youre only talking to hear yourself talk now you shut up and run away this is no place for chewing the rag anywaythis is my busy day  for a moment the mans face expressed the rage of a wildcat and his hands clinched dont you do itthats all he finally snarled youll wish you hadnt  run away little boy she said irritably you make me tired i dont feel like being badgered by anybody and besides im not mortgaged to anybody just yet  his mood changed bertie im sorry i didnt mean to be fresh but dont talk to me that way it uses me all up  well then stop puffing and blowing ive troubles of my own with mother sick and a new cook in the kitchen  excuse me bert ill never do it again  thats all right  but it riled me like the devil to think he began again  dont think she curtly interrupted cut hair  perceiving that she was in evil mood for his plea he turned away so sadly that the girl relented a little and called out  say ed he turned and came back see here i didnt intend to hurt your feelings but this is one of my touchy days and you got on the wrong side of me im sorry heres my handnow shake and run  his face lightened and he smiled displaying his fine white teeth youre a worldbeater sure thing and im going to get you yet  cut it out she slangily retorted sharply withdrawing her hand  youll see he shouted laughing back at her full of hope again  she was equally curt with two or three others who brazenly tried to buy a smile with their cigars do business boys this is my day to sell goods she said and they took the hint  when haney came out from his supper he stepped quietly in behind the counter and said ill take your place get your grub then put on your hat and well drive out to see how the mother is the girl acknowledged a sense of relief as she left him in charge and went to her seat in the far corner of the diningrooma relief and a dangerous relaxation it was after all a pleasure to feel that a strong sure hand was outstretched in sympathyand she was tired even as she sat waiting for her tea the collapse came and bowing her head to her hands she shook with silent sobs  the waitresses stared and young mrs gilman came hurrying whats the matter bertie are you sick  oh nobut im worriedabout mother  you havent heard anything  no but she looked so old and so worn when she went away she ought to have quit here a month ago  well i wouldnt worry its cooler out to the ranch and the air is so pure shell pick up right awayyoull see  i hope so but she ought to take it easy the rest of her days shes done work enoughand im kind o discouraged myself  slowly she recovered her selfpossession she drank her tea in abstracted silence and at last she said im going out there cassie youll have to look after things ill get some of the boys to tend the office  youre not going alone  no mart haney is going to drive me  oh there was a look of surprise and consternation in the face of the young wife but she only asked youll be back tonight  yes if mother is no worse  haney had the smartest rig in town waiting for her as she came out but as he looked at her white dress and pretty hat of flowers and tulle he apologized for its shortcomingstis lined with creamcolored satin it should be  she colored a little at this but quickly replied blarney anybodyd know you were an irishman  i am and proud of it  i want to take the doctor out to see mother  not in this rig he protested  she smiled why not no but i want to go round to his office and leave a call  ill go round the world fer you he replied  the air was deliciously cool and fragrant now that the sun was sinking and the town was astir with people it was the social hour when the heat and toil of the day were over and all had leisure to turn wondering eyes upon haney and his companion the girl felt her position keenly she was aware that a single appearance of this kind was equivalent to an engagement in the minds of her acquaintances but as she shyly glanced at her lovers handsome face and watched his powerful and skilled hands upon the reins her pride in him grew she acknowledged his kindness and was tired and ready to lean upon his strength  when did your mother quit he asked after they had left the town behind  sunday night you see we had a big rush all day and on top of that about twelve oclock an alarm of fire next door so she got no sleep monday morning she didnt get up tuesday she dressed but was too miserable to work so finally i just packed her off to the ranch  that was rightonly you should have sent for me  she was silent and her heart began to beat with a knowledge of the demand he was about to make she felt weak and unprotected herein the office they were on more equal termsbut she enjoyed in a subconscious way the swift rush of the horses the splendor of the sunset and the quiet authority in his voiceeven as she lifted eyes to the mesa towards which they were driving he began to speak  you know my mind little girl i dont mean to ask you till tomorrowthats the day setbut i want to say that ive been cleaning house all the week thinkin of you im to be a leading citizen from this day on you wont need to apologize for me ive never been a drinking man but i have been a reckless devil i dont deny that ive planted a wide field of wild oats however all that i put away from this hour tis true im forty but thats not oldim no older than i was at twentyone sureand besides youre young enough to make up he smiled and again she acknowledged the charm of his face when he smiled youll see me grow younger whilst you grow older and so wan day well be of an age  her customary readiness of reply had left her and she still sat in silence a sob in her throat a curious numbness in her limbs  he seemed to feel that she did not wish to talk if you come into partnership with me you need never worry about the question of bread or rent or clothes and thats worth considerinwhich road now  she silently pointed to the left and they drew near the foot of the great mesa whose level top was cutting the sun in half  the miner was filled with grateful homage tis a great world he exclaimed softly sure tis only yesterday that i found it out and lifting me head took a look at the hills and the stars for the first time in twenty years tis a new road im enterinwhether you come to me or not  all this was wonderful to the girl could it be that she was capable of changing the life of a powerful man like this it filled her with a sense of duty as well as exaltation an emotion that made a woman of her she seemed suddenly to have put the hotel and all its worriments far far behind her  seized by an impulse to acquaint her with his family haney began to tell about his father and his attempts to govern his five sons we were devils he admittedbroncos if ever such walked on two legs we wouldnt go to schoolnot wan of us except charley he did pretty welland we fished and played ball and went to the circus he chuckled i left home the first time with a circus i wanted to be a liontamer but had to content meself with driving the cook wagon then i struck west and ive never been back and ive never seen the old man since but now ive made me pile i think ill go home and hunt him up and buy him new spectacles its ace to the threespot hes using the same hornrimmed ones he wore when i left  bertha was interested how long did you stay with the circus  not very long i got homesick and went back but the next time i left i left for fair ive been everywhere but east since ive been in colorado mostly tis a good state  i like itbut id like to see the rest of the country  you can if you join hands with me well go round the ball together  she did not follow this lead ive been to denver oncewent on one of these excursion tickets  how did you like it there  pretty good but i got awful tired and the grub at the hotel was the worst everit was a cheap place of course didnt dare to look in the door of the big places  you can have a whole soot of rooms at the royal flushif you will  again she turned away i cant imagine anybody rich enough to live at such hotelstheres our ranch  shy as a coyote aint it he commented as he looked where she pointed id prefer the eagle house to that  i love it out here she said i helped plant the trees  did you then i want the place i want everything your pretty hands planted  oh rats was her reproving comment and it made him laugh at his own sentimental speech  the ranch house stood at the foot of the mesa near a creek that came out of a narrow gorge and struck out upon the flat valley it was a little housea shack merely surrounded by a few outbuildings all looking as temporary as an indian encampment but there were treesthriftily greenand some stacks of grain to testify to the energy and good husbandry of the owner  mrs gilman was lying in a corner room close to the stream which rippled through the little orchard and its gentle murmur had been a comfort to herit carried her back to her home in oxford county state of maine where her early girlhood had been spent at times it seemed that she was in the little old gray house in the valley and that her fathers sharp voice might come at any moment to break her delicious drowse  her breakdown had been caused as much by her mental turmoil as by her overtaxing duties she was confronted by a mighty temptation through her daughter at a time when she was too weak and too ill to carry forward her ordinary duties to urge this marriage upon bertha would be to bring it about that she knew for the girl had said ill do it if you say so mother  i dont want you to do it if youd rather not had been her weak answer  bertie entered quietly in a singularly mature almost manly way and bending to her mother asked cordially well how are you today  the sick woman took her daughters hand and drew it to her tearwet cheek oh my baby i cant bear to leave you now  dont talk that way mother youre not going to leave me the doctor is coming out to see you and everything is going all right at the house so dont you worry you set to work to get well thats your little stunt ill look after the rest of it  bertie had never been one to bestow caresses even on her parents and her only sign of deep feeling now lay in the tremble of her voice she drew her hand away and putting her arm about her mothers neck patted her cheek cassies doing well she said abruptly and the girls are fine they brace right up to the situation andand everybodys nice to us i reckon a dozen of the church ladies called yesterday to ask how you wereand captain haney came down today on purpose to find out how things were going  the sufferers eyes opened wide bert hes with you  yes he drove me out here answered the girl quietly hes come for an answer to his proposition its up to us to decide right now  the mother broke into a whimper oh darling i dont know what to think im afraid to leave this to youits an awful temptation to a girl i guess ive decided against it he aint the kind of man you ought to marry  she hushed her mothers wail sh hell hear you she said solemnly there are lots o worse men than mart haney  but hes so oldfor you  hes no boy thats true but we went all over that the new fact in the case is this hes sold out up therecleared out his saloon businessand all for me think o thatand i hadnt given him a word of encouragement either now that speaks well for him dont you think  the mother nodded yes it surely does but then  the girl went on well now it aint as though i hated him for i donti like him ive always liked him hes the handsomest man i know and hes treated me right from the very start he didnt come down to hurry me or crowd me at all so he says well i told him i wouldnt answer yet awhiletime isnt really up till tomorrow i can take another week if i want to  the mother lay in silence for a few moments and then with closed eyes streaming with hot tears she again prayed silently to god to guide her girl in the right path when she opened her eyes the tall form of marshall haney towered over her so handsome so full of quiet power that he seemed capable of anything his face was strangely sweet as he said you must not fret about anything another minute youve but to lie quiet and get strong he put his broad soft warm and muscular hand down upon her two folded ones and added let me do fer ye as i would fer me own mother twill not commit ye to a thing he seemed to understand her moodperhaps he had overheard her plea im not asking a decision till you are well but i wish you would trust me nowi could do so much more fer you and the girl heres the doctor so put the whole thing by for the present i ask nothing till you are well  if this was policy on his part it was successful for the poor tortured mothers heart was touched and her nerves soothed by his voice as well as by the touch of his hand and when they left the house she was in peaceful sleep and the doctors report was reassuring but she must have rest he said positively and freedom from care  she shall have it said haney with equal decision  this bluff kindness joined to the allurement of his powerful form profoundly affected the girl her heart went out towards him in admiration and trust and as they were on the way home she turned suddenly to him and said  youre good to meand you were good to mother you neednt wait till tomorrow for my answer ill do as you want me tosome timenot nownext spring maybe  he put his arm about her and kissed her his eyes dim with a new and softening emotion  youve made mart haney over newso you have as sure as god lets me live ill make you happy you shall live like a queen     chapter iv  haney meets an avenger   haney took the train back to his mountain town in a mood which made him regard his action as that of a stranger whenever he recalled berthas trusting clasp of his hand he felt like removing his hatthe stir of his heart was close akin to religious reverence faith an shes taking a big risk he said but ill not see her lose out he added with a return of the gamblers phrase she has stacked her chips on the right spot this time  with all his brute force his clouded sense of justice this gambler this saloonman was not without qualifying characteristics he was a celt and in almost every celt there is hidden a poet quick to wrath quick to jest and fierce in his loves was he as is the typical irishman whom england has not yet succeeded in changing to her own type moreover he was an american as well as a celt and the american is the most sentimental of menit is said and now that he had been surprised into honorable matrimony he began to arrange his affairs for his wifes pleasure and glory the words in which she had accepted him lingered in his ears like phrases of a little hesitating song for her he had sold his gambling halls for her he was willing at the moment to abandon the associates of a lifetime  he was sitting in the car dreamily smoking his hat drawn low over his brows when an acquaintance passing through the car stopped with a word of greeting ordinarily haney would have been glad of his company but he made a place for him at this time with grudging slowness  how are ye slater set ye down  i hear youve sold your saloons slater began as he settled into place  haney nodded without smiling  his neighbor grinned you dont seem very sociable today mart  im not haney replied bluntly  i just dropped down beside you to say that young wilkinson went broke in your place last night and has it in for you hes plum fuzzy with drink and you better look sharp or hell do you hes been on the rampage for two dayscrazy as a loon  why does he go after me haney asked irritably im out of it tis like the fool tenderfoot dont he know i had nothing to do with his bustup  he dont seem toor else hes so locoed hes forgot it all i know is hes full of some pizen notion against you and i thought id put you on your guard  they talked on about this a few minutes and then slater rose leaving haney to himself but his tender mood was gone his brow was knit he began to understand that a man could not run a bad business for twenty years and then at a days notice clear himself of all its trailing evil consequences ill vamoose he said to himself with resolution ill put me mines in order and go down into the valley and take the girl with megod bless her well take a little turn as far as new york ill put long miles between the two of us and all this sporting record of mine she dont like it and ill quit it ill begin a new life entirely and a glow of newfound virtue filled his heart of wilkinson he had no fearonly disgust why should the fool pursue me he repeated he took his chances and lost out if he werent a farmer hed drop it  he ate his supper at the hotel in the same abstraction and then still grave with plans for his new career went out into the street to find williams his partner it was inevitable that he should bring up at the bar of his former saloon no other place in the town was so much like home after all habit drew him to its familiar walls he was glad to find a couple of old friends there and they having but just heard of the sale of his outfit hastened to greet and congratulate him of his greatest goodfortune of his highest conquest they of course knew nothing and he was not in a mood to tell them of it  the barroom was nearly empty for the reason that the miners had not yet finished their evening meal and haney and his two cronies had just taken their second round of drinks when the side door was burst violently open and a man white and wild with a doublebarrelled shotgun in his hand abruptly entered darting across the floor he thrust the muzzle of his weapon almost against haneys breast and fired uttering a wild curse at the moment of recoil  the tall gambler reeled under the shock swinging half way about his hands clutching at the railing a look of anguish and surprise upon his face the assassin intent alert would have fired again had not a bystander felled him to the floor the room filled instantly with excited men eager to strike vociferous with hate but haney with one palm pressed to his breast stood silentcuriously silenthis lips white with his effort at selfcontrol  at length two of his friends seized him tenderly asking how is it old man are you hurt bad  his lips movedthey listenedas he faintly whispered hes got me boys heres where i quit  dont say that mart youll pull through said his friend chokingly then with ferocious impatience he yelled somebody get the doctor damn it all get moving dont you see him bleed  haney moved his head feebly lay me down peteim torn to piecesim all in im afraid get me little girlthats all i ask  very gently they took him in their arms and laid him on one of the gamblingtables in the rear room while the resolute barkeeper pushed the crowd out  again haney called impatiently almost fiercely send for bertiequick  the men looked at each other in wonder and one of them tapped his brow significantly for no one knew of his latest loveaffair while still they stared williams came rushing wildly in all gave way to him and the young doctor who followed him was greeted with low words of satisfaction to his partner whom he recognized haney repeated his command send for bertie with a hurried scrawl williams put down the girls name and address on a piece of paper and shouted here somebody take this and rush it tell her to come quick as the lord will let her then with the tenderness of a brother he bent to haney how is it mart  mart did not reply his supreme desire attended to he sank into a patient immobility that approached stupor while the surgeon worked with intent haste to stop the flow of blood the wound was most barbarous and williams eyes filled with tears as he looked upon that magnificent torso mangled by buckshot he loved his big partnerhaney was indeed his highest enthusiasm his chief object of adoration and to see him riddled in this way was devils work he lost hope its all over with mart haney he said chokingly a few minutes later to the men crowding the barroomand then his rage against the assassin broke forth he became the tiger seeking the blood of him who had slain his mate his curses rose to primitive ferocity where is he he asked  to him stepped a manone whose voice was quiet but intense weve attended to his case williams hes toeing the moonlight from a lamppost want to see  for an instant his rage flared out against these officious friends who had cheated him of his share in the swift delight of the avenger then tears again misted his eyes and with a dignity and pathos which had never graced his speech before he pronounced a slow eulogy upon his friend no man had a right to accuse mart haney of any trick he took his chances fair and square he had no play with crooked cards or doctored wheels it was all above board with him he was dead game and a sport you all know that and now to be ripped to bits with buckshotjust when he was takin a wifeis hellish  his voice faltered and in the dead silence which followed this revelation of haneys secret he turned and reentered the inner room to watch beside his friend  the hush which lay over the men at the bar lasted till the barkeeper softly muttered boys thats news to me it does make it just too tough then those who had hitherto opposed the lynching of the murderer changed their minds and directed new malediction against him and those who had handled the rope took keener comfort and greater honor to themselves  who is the woman asked one of those who waited  this question remained unanswered till the messenger to the telegraph office returned even then little beyond her name was revealed but each of the watchers began to pray that she might reach the dying man before his eyes should close forever he cant live till sunrise said one and there is no train from the junction till morning she cant get here without a special did you order a special for her  no i didnt think of it the messenger replied with a sense of shortcoming  it must be done  ill attend to that said slater i know the superintendent ill wire him to see herand bring her  well be quick about it expense dont count now  it was beautiful to see how these citizens rough and sordid as many of them were rose to the poetic value of the situation as one of them who had seen and loved the girl told of her youth and beauty they all stood in rigidly silent attention shes hardly more than a child he explained but you never saw a more levelheaded little business woman in your life she runs the golden eagle hotel at junction and does it alone thats what caught mart you see shes as straight as a ute and her eyes are clear as agates shes a little captainjust the mate for mart shell save him if anybody can  will she come can she get away  of course shell come shell ride an engine or jump a flatcar to get here you can depend on a woman in such things she dont stop to calculate she aint that kind she comesyou can bet high on that im only worrying for fear mart wont hold out till she gets here  meanwhile every man in the room where haney lay sat in silence with an air of waitingwaiting for the inevitable end the bleeding had been checked but the sufferers breathing was painful and labored and the doctor sitting close beside him was studying means to prolong lifehe had given up hope of saving it with stiffened lips haney repeated now and again keep me alive till she comes doctor she must marry mehere i want her to have all ive goteverything  at another time he said get the judgehave everything ready  they understood he wished to dower his love with his wealth to place in her hands his will beyond the reach of any contestant and this resolution through the hours of his agony through the daze of his weakness persisted heroicallytill even the doctors throat filled with sympathetic emotion as he thought of the young maiden soon to be thrust into this tragic drama he answered soothingly ill do all i can mart theres a lot of vitality in you yet we wont give up youll pull through with her help  to this haney made no reply and the hours passed with ghostly step it was a most moving experience for the young doctor to look round that wide room littered with scattered cards the wheels of chance motionless at the hazard where the last gamblers bet had ended in the lookouts chair where haney himself used to sit an unseen arbiter now gloomed watching a game where life was the forfeit a spectral finger seemed to rest upon the bloodred spot of every board no sound came from the drinkingsaloon in front the miners had all withdrawn only the barkeeper and a few personal friends kept willing vigil  about nine oclock an answering telegram came to slater girl just leaving on special will make all speed possible  haney faintly smiled when williams read this message to him i knew it he whispered shell come then his lips set in a grim line and ill be here when she comes thereafter he had the look of a man who hangs with hooked fingers in iron resolution above an abyss husbanding every resourceforcing himself to think only of the blue sky above him  a little later the priest knocked at the door and asked to see the dying man but to this request haney shook his head and whispered no no ive no strength to wastetis good of him wait tell him to be hereto marry us and with this request the priest was forced to be content may the lord god be merciful to him he exclaimed fervently as he turned away  once again about midnight the wounded man roused up to say the ceremony must be legali want no lawsuits after the girl must be protected he was thinking of his brothers of his own kind rapacious and selfish every safeguard must be thrown around his sweethearts life  well attend to that answered williams who seemed able to read his partners thoughts well take every precaution he wants the judge to be present as well as the priest he explained to the doctor so that if the girl would rather she can be married by the court as well as by the church  every man in the secret realized fully that the girl was being endowed with an immense fortune and that she would inevitably be the quarry of every selfseeking relative whose interest would be served by attacking her rights in the premises the lawsuits must be cut out was williams order to the judge marts brothers are a wolfish lot we dont want any loose ends for them to catch on to  from time to time messages flashed between the oncoming train and the faithful watchers its all up grade but johnson is breaking all records at this rate shell reach here by daylight said slater but thats a long time for mart to wait on that rough bed he added to williams with deep sympathy in his voice  i know that but to move him would hasten his death the doctor is afraid to even turn him besides mart himself wont have it im better here he says so weve propped him into the easiest position possible theres nothing to do but wait for the girl     chapter v  berthas upward flight   bertha was eating her supper after a hard days work in her little hotel when a little yellow envelope was handed to her the words of the message were few but they were meaningfull come at once mart hurt not expected to live it was signed by williams while still she sat stunned and hesitant under the weight of this demand another and much more explicit telegram came johnson superintendent is ordered to fetch you with special train dont delay mart needs youis calling for you come at once  the phrase is calling for you reached her heartdecided her she rose and with a word of explanation to her housekeeper put on her hat and threw a cloak over her arm ive got to go to cripple captain haney is sick and ive got to go to him i dont know when ill be back she said get along the best you can her face was white but calm and her manner deliberate send word to mother that mart is hurt and ive gone up to see him tell her not to worry  to her night clerk who had come on duty she quietly remarked i reckon youll have to look after things tomorrow ill try to get back the day after if i dont lem markham will take my place while still she stood arranging the details of her business a short dark man stepped inside the door and very kindly and gravely explained his errand im johnson the division superintendent theyve telegraphed me for a special and im going to take you up myself mart is a friend of mine he added with some feeling  she thanked him with a look and a quick clasp of his hand and together they hurried into the street and down to the station where a locomotive coupled to a single coach stood panting like a fierce animal a cloud of sparklit smoke rolling from its low stack the coach was merely a short caboose but the girl stepped into it without a moments hesitation and the engine took the track like a spirited horse as the fireman got up speed the car began to rock and roll violently and johnson remarked to the girl i guess youd better take my chair its bolted to the floor and you can hang on when we go round the curves  she obeyed instantly and with her small hands gripping the armrests of the rude seat cowered in silence while the clambering monster rushed and roared over the level lands and labored up the grades shrieking now and again as if in mingled pain and warning johnson and the brakeman for the most part kept to the lookout in the turret and the girl rode alonerode far passing swiftly from girlhood to womanhood so full of enforced meditation were the hours of that ride it seemed that she was leaving something sweet and carefree behind her and it was certain that she was about to face death she had one perfectly clear conception and that was that the man who had been most kind to her and to whom she had given her promise of marriage was dying and needed herwas calling for her through the night  burdened with responsibility from her childhood accustomed to make her own decisions she had responded to this prayer knowing dimly that this journey denoted a new and portentous experiencea fundamental change in her life  she had admired and liked haney from the first but her feeling even yet was very like that of a boy for a man of heroic statueher regard had very little of womans passion in it she was appalled and benumbed by the thought that she was soon to look upon him lying prone that she might soon be called upon to meet those bold eyes closing in death she had been warned and yet she did not shrink from it the nurse latent in every woman rose in her and she ached with desire of haste longing to lay her hand upon the suffering man in some healing way his kindness his gentleness during the days of his final courtship had sunk deephis generosity had been so full so free so unhesitating  she thought of her mother and as a fuller conception of the alarm and anxiety she would feel came to her she decided to send her a telegram she will know it was my duty to go she decided as for the hotelwhat does it matter now nothing seemed to matter indeed save the speed of her chariot  the night was long interminably long once and again johnson came down out of his perch and spoke a few clumsy words of wellmeaning encouragement but found her unresponsive her brain was too busy with taking leave of old conceptions and in mastering new duties to be otherwise than vaguely grateful to her companions her mind was clear on one other pointthis journey committed her to marshall haney there could be no further hesitation some time soon if he lives i must marry him she thought and the conception troubled her with a new revelation of what that relationship might mean she felt suddenly very small very weak and very helpless he must be good to me she murmured and then as the words of his prayer to her came back she added and ill be good to him  far and farther below her shone the lights in the little hotel and the busy and jocund scenes of her girlish life receded swiftly at this moment her desk and the little sittingroom where the men lounged seemed a haven of peace and plenty and the car rocking and plunging through the night was like a ship rising and falling on wild seas under unknown stars                                       the clear light of the mountain dawn was burnishing brass into gold as the locomotive with its tolling bell slid up the level track at the end of its run and came to a stealthy halt beside the small station  here we are called johnson from his turret and bertha rose stiff and sore with the long nights ride her resolution cooled to a kind of passive endurance im ready she called back  williams met her at the step its all right sis marts still hereand waiting for you  instantly at sight of his ugly familiar friendly face she became alert clearbrained how is he  pretty bad  whats it all about how did it happen  ill clear that up as we go he replied and led the way to a carriage  once inside she turned her keen gaze upon him now go aheadstraight  he did so in the blunt terms of a man whose life had been always on the border and who has no nice shading in act or word  is he dying she asked at the first pause  im afraid he is sister he replied gently thats whats made the night seem long to us but youre here and its all right now  that she was to look on him dying had been persistently in her mind but that she was to see him mangled by an assassin added horror to her dread in spite of her intrepid manner she was still girl enough to shudder at the sight of blood  williams went on hes weak too weak to talk much and so im going to tell you what he wants he wants you to marry him before he dies  the girl drew away not this minutetonight  yes he wants to give you legal rights to all he has and youve got to do it quick no tellin what may happen his voice choked as he said this  berthas blood chilled with dismay her throat filled and her bosom swelled with the effort she made at selfcontrol and williams watching her with bright eyes of admiration hurried on to the end everything is ready there is a priest if you want him and judge brady with a civil ceremony if that will please you better or well get a protestant minister its for you to say only the knot must be tied good and tight i told the boys youd take a priest for marts sake he says make it waterproof he means so that no willbreaking brothers or cousins can stack the cards agin you and now its up to you little sister he has only a few hours anyway and i dont see that you can refuse specially as it makes his dying he stopped there  the street was silent as they drew up to the saloon door and only slater and one or two of his friends were present when bertha walked into the barroom erect as a boy her calm sweet face ashen white in the electric light for an instant she stood there in the middle of the floor alone her big dark eyes searching every face then judge brady a kindly grayhaired man advanced and took her hand were very glad to see you he gravely said introducing himself williams who had entered the inner room returned instantly to say come hes waiting  without a word the bride entered the presence of her groom and the doctor bending low to the gambler said be careful now mart dont try to rise be perfectly still bertie has come  haney turned with a smilea tender humorous smileand whispered bertie acushla mavourneen come to me  then the watchers withdrew leaving them alone and the girl bending above him kissed him oh captain cant i do something i must do something  yes darlin ye can you can marry me this minute and ye shall im dyin girlso the doctor says i dont feel it that way but anyhow we take no chances all i have is for you and so  she put her hand ever his lips you must be quiet i understand and i will do itbut only to make you well she turned to the door and her voice was clear as she said to those who waited i am ready  will you have father kearney asked williams  she turned towards haney just as he says  the stricken miner ghastly with the pain brought on by movement responded to the doctors question only by a whisper the priestfirst  the girl heard and her fine clear glance rested upon the face of the priest tears were on her cheeks but a kind of exultation was in her tone as she said i am willing father  with a look which denoted his appreciation of the girls courage the priest stepped forward and led her to her place beside her bridegroom she took haneys big nerveless hand in her firm grasp and together they listened to the solemn words which made them husband and wife it seemed that the gambler was passing into the shadow during the opening prayer but his whispered responses came at the proper pauses and only when the final benediction was given and the priest and the judge fell back before the rush of the young doctor did the wounded mans eyes close in final collapse he had indeed reached the end of his endurance  the young wife spoke then imperiously almost fiercely asking why is he lying here this is no place for him  the doctor explained we were afraid to move himtill you came in fact he wouldnt let me move him if you say so now we will take him up with these words the watchers shifted their responsibility to her shoulders uttering sighs of deep relief whatever happened now marts will had been secured at her command they lifted the table on which her husband lay and the wife walked beside it unheeding the throngs of silent men walling her path every one made way for her waited upon her eager to serve her partly because she was marshall haneys wife but more because of her youth and the brave heart which looked from her clear and candid eyes  she showed no hesitation now gave out no word of weakness on the contrary she commanded with certainty and precision calling to her aid all that the city afforded not till she had summoned the best surgeons and was sure that everything had been done that could be done did she permit herself to relaxor to think of rest or her mother  when she had sunk to sleep upon a couch beside her husbands bed williams with a note of deep admiration demanded of the surgeon aint she a little captain mart cant die now can he hes got too much to live for     chapter vi  the haney palace   one day early in the following summer a tall thin man with one helpless side entered the big luminous hall of the antlers hotel at the springs upheld by a stalwart attendant and accompanied by a sweetfaced calmlipped young woman this was marshall haney and his young wife bertha down from the mountain for the first time since his illness and those who knew their story and recognized them stood aside with a thrill of pity for the man and a look of admiration for the girl whose bravery and devotion had done so much to bring her husband back to life and to a growing measure of his former strength  marshall haney was indeed but a poor hulk of his stalwart self one lung had been deeply torn his left shoulder was almost wholly disabled and he walked with a stoop and shuffle but his physical weakening was not more marked than his mental mellowing he was softenedgentled as the horsemen say his eyes were larger and his face once so stern and masterful gave out an appealing expression by reason of the deep horizontal wrinkles which had developed in his brow he had grown a mustache and this being gray gave him an older lookolder and more military it was plain also that he leaned upon his keeneyed impassive little wife who never for one moment lost her hold upon herself or her surroundings her flashing glances took note of everything about her and her lips were closeset and firm  williams ugly and wordless as ever followed them with a proud smile till they entered the handsome suite of rooms which had been reserved for them theres nothing too good for marshall haney and his sidepartner he exulted to the bellboy  thereupon mart with a look of reverence at his young bride replied shes airned itand more  a sigh was in his voice and a singular appeal in his big eyes as he sank into an easychair i believe i do feel better down here my heart seems to work aisier im going to get well now darlin  of course you are she answered in the tone of a daughter then added with a smile i like it here why not settle  to her colorado springs was a dazzling social centre the beauty of the homes along its wide streets the splendor of its private carriages affected her almost as deeply as the magnitude and glory of denver itself but she was not of those who display their weaknesses and diffidence she ate her first dinner in the lofty antlers dininghall with quiet dignity and would not have been particularly noticed but for haney who was wellknown to the waiters of the hotel her association with him had made her a marked figure in their mountain towns and she was accustomed to comment  she met the men who addressed her with entire fearlessness and candor she was afraid only of women in good clothes speaking with the easy slanginess of a herder using naturally and unconsciously the most picturesque phrases of the west her speech was incisive and unhesitating yet not swift she never chattered but you bet and all right were authorized english so far as she was concerned they say you cant beat this town anywhere for society and i sure like the looks of what weve seen suppose we hang around this hotel for a whilenot too long for its mighty expensive here she smileda quick flashing smile you see i cant get used to spending moneyim afraid all the time ill wake up its just like a dream i used to have of finding chinki always came to before i had a chance to handle it and see if it was real  haney answered indulgently tis all real bertie ill show you that when im meself again  oh i believe itat least part of the time she retorted but ill have to flash a roll to do itchecks are no good i could sign a million checks and not have em seem like real money im from missouri when it comes to cash  mrs gilman who had always stood in bewilderment and wonder of her daughter was entirely subject now she and williams usually moved in silence like adoring subjects in the presence of their sovereigns they had no doubts whatsoever concerning the power and primacy of gold and as for haney himself his unquestioning confidence in his little wifes judgment had come to be like an article of religious faith  after breakfast on the second day of her stay bertha ordered a carriage and they drove about the town in the brilliant morning sunshine looking for a place to build she resembled a little homeseeking sparrow every cosey cottage was to her an almost irresistible allurement theres a dandy place captain she called several times wouldnt you like a house like that  he with larger notions shook his head each time too small bertie weve the right to a fine big placelike that now he nodded towards a stately graystone mansion with the sign for sale planted on its lawn  she was aghast gee what would we do with a statehouse like that  live in it sure  it would need four chambermaids and two hired men to take care of a place like that and think of the money it would spoil to stock it with furniture nevertheless she gazed at it longingly id sure like that big garden and that porch you could sit on that porch and see the mountains couldnt you but my ears and whiskers the expense of keeping it  they passed on to other and less palatial possibilities and returned to the hotel undecided the two women bewildered and weary diverged and discussed the matter of dress till the midday meal  i like being rich remarked the young wife as they took their seats in the lovely diningroom and looked about at the tables so shining so dainty it would be fun to run a house like this dont you think she addressed her mother  good gracious no think of the bill for help and the worry of looking after all this silver no its too splendid for us  haney still retained enough of his ancient humor to smile at them id rather see you manage that big stone house with the porch which im going to buy  you dont mean it said bertha while mrs gilman stared at him over her soup  he went on quietly sure me minds made up you want the garden and i like the porch so phone the agent after dinner and well go up and see to it this very afternoon  berthas bosom heaved with excitement and her eyes expanded id like just once to see the inside of a house like that it must be half as big as this hotelbut to own it youre crazy captain  the remote possibility of walking through that wonderful mansion took away the young wifes appetite and she became silent and reflective in the face of a delicious fried chicken the magic of her husbands wealth began to make itself most potently felt  haney insisted on smoking a cigar in the lobby bertha took her mother away to talk over the tremendous decision which was about to be thrust upon them we want a house said she decisively but not a palace like that what would we do with it it scares me up a tree to think of it  i guess he was only joking mrs gilman agreed  i can see the porch would be fine for him bertha went on but jiminy spelter wed all be lost in the place  haney called williams to his side and told him of the house its a big place but i want it go you and see the agent my little girl needs a roof and why not the best  sure replied williams with conviction shes entitled to a castle you round up the women and ill do the rest  the house proved to be even more splendid and spacious than its exterior indicated and bertha walked its wide halls with breathless delight after a hurried survey of the interior they came out upon the broad veranda and lingered long in awe and wonder of the outlook to the west lay a glorious garden of fruits and flowers a fountain was playing over the rich green grass high above the tops of the pear and peach trees which made a little copse rose the purple peaks of the rampart range  oh isnt it great exclaimed bertha  haney turned to the agent with a tense look on his pale facea look of exultant power  make out your papers said he quietly we take the placeas it stands  bertha was overwhelmed by this flourish of the enchanters wandbut only for a moment no sooner was the contract signed than she roused herself as to a new business venture well now the first thing is furniture lets see there is some carpets and curtains in the place isnt there and a steel range its up to me to rustle the balance of the outfit together right lively  and so she set to work quite as she would have done in outfitting a new hotelso many beds so many chairs in a room so many dressers and soon had a long list made out and the order placed  she spent every available moment of her time for the next two days getting the kitchen and diningroom in running order and when she had two beds ready insisted on moving in we can kind o camp out in the place till we get stocked up im crazy to be under our own roof  haney almost as eager as she consented and on the third day they drove up to the door dismissed their hired coachman and stepped inside the gatemaster and mistress of an american chateau  mart turned and with misty eyes and a voice choked with happiness said well darlin we have it nowthe palace of the fairy stories  its great she repeated musingly but i cant make it seem like a homemebbe itll change when i get it filled with furniture but the garden is sure all right  they took their first meal on the porch overlooking the mountains listening to the breeze in the vines it was heavenly sweet after the barren squalor of their cripple creek home and they did little but gaze and dream  we need a team bertha said at last  buy one replied haney  so bertha bought a carriage and a fine black span this expenditure involved a coachman and to fill that position an old friend of williamsa talkative and officious old minerwas employed she next secured a chinese cook the best to be had and a girl to do the chamberwork they were all busy as hornets and bertha lived in a glow of excitement every waking hour of the daythough she did not show it  haneys checkbook was quite as wonderful in its way as aladdins lamp and little by little the women permitted themselves to draw upon its magic the shining span of blacks with flowing manes and champing bits became a feature of the avenue as the women drove up and down on their neverending quest for household luxuriesthey had gone beyond mere necessities mart usually went with them sitting in the carriage while they visited with the grocery clerks and furniture dealers they were very popular with these people as was natural  little mrs haney became at once the subject of endless commentmostly unfavorable for marts saloonmade reputation was wellknown and the current notion of a woman who would marry him was not high she was reported in the alien circles of the town to be a vulgar little chambermaid who had taken a gambler for his money at a time when he was supposed to be on his deathbed and her elevation to the management of a palatial residence was pointed out as being peculiarly westernamerican  the men however were much more tolerant of judgment than their women they had become more or less hardened to seeing crude miners luxuriating in sudden accidental wealth therefore they nodded goodhumoredly at haney and tipped their hats to his pretty wife with smiles as bankers tradesmen and taxpayers generally they could not afford to neglect a citizen possessed of so much wealth and circumstance  mrs gilman presented a letter of introduction to the nearest church of her own persuasion and went to service quite as unassumingly as in sibley and was greeted by a few of the ladies there cordially and without hint of her soninlaws connections two or three including the pastors wife made special effort to cultivate her acquaintance by calling immediately but they were not of those who attracted bertha and though she showed them about the house and answered their questions she did not promise to call were too busy she explained i havent got more than half the rooms into shape and besides were to have my brothers folks down from the junctionwere on the hustle all day long  this was true she had been quite besieged by her former neighbors in sibley who found it convenient to put up with the haneys while visiting the town they were in fact very curious to study her in her new and splendid setting and though some of them peeked and peered amid the beds and thumped the mattresses in vulgar curiosity the young housewife merely laughed all her life had been spent among folk of this directly inquisitive sort she expected them to act as they did and being a hearty and generous soul as well as a very democratic one she sent them away happy  indeed she won praise from all who came to know her but that small part of the springsalien and exclusivewhich considered itself higher if not better than the rest of the western world looked askance at the gamblers wife and her freak friends and mrs crego who was inclined to be very censorious alluded to the haneys as beggars on horseback as she met them on the boulevard  of all this critical comment bertha remained happily unconscious and it is probable that she would soon have won her way to a decent circle of friends had not charles haney descended upon them like a plague mart had been receiving letters from this brother but had said nothing to bertha of his demands charles despised me when he met me in denver he explained to williams i was busted at the time ye mind he winked and now when he reads in the papers that mart haney is rich he comes down on me like a hawk on a june bug tis no matter he may comeill not cast him out but he does not play with me doubleeaglesnot he  charles haney was not fitted to raise his brothers wife in the social scale for he belonged to that marked insistent variety of actor to be distinguished on trains and in the lobbies of hotelsa fat sleek loudvoiced comedian who enacted scenes from his unwritten plays while ladling his soup and who staggered and fell across chairs in illustration of highly emotional lines and what was worse he was of those who regard every unescorted woman as fair game bold of glance and brassy of smile he began to make eyes at his sisterinlaw from their first meeting  she amazed him he had expected a woman of his own classan adventuress painted designing and to find this sweet little girlwhy shes too good for mart he concluded and shifted his hollow pretensions of sympathy from his brother to his sisterinlaw before the first evening of his visit closed he sought opportunity to tell her in hypocritic sadness that mart was a doomed man and that she would soon be free of him bertha was disturbed by his gaze and repelled by his touch but tried to like him on marts account his mouthing disgusted her and the goodwill with which haney greeted his brother turned into bitterness as the boaster and low wit began to display himself  we all grew up in the street or in the saloon haney sadly remarked and you finished your education in the variety theatre im thinking  the actor took this as a joke and with a grin retorted thats better than running a farolayout  i dunno a good quiet game has its power to educate a man replied the gambler  that night as she was preparing the captain for bed he remarked with a sigh life is a quare game i mind charley well as a cute little yellowhaired divil always laughing always in mischief and me chasin after hima big slob of a boy i used to carry him up an down the tenement stairs i learned him to skateand now here he is drinkin himself puffy whilst i am an old brokendown hack at fortyfive he looked up at her with a sheen of tears in his eyes darlin tis a shame to be leanin on you  she put her arm around his big grizzled head and drew it to her  you can lean hard mart im standin by  no ill not lean too hard he answered i dont want your fine straight back to stoop i make no demands ill not spoil your young life im not worth it youre free to go when you cant stand me any longer  now now no more of that she warned when i have cause to knock you wont need no eartrumpet put up your hoof he obeyed and stooping swiftly she began to unlace the shoe which he could no longer reach her manner was that of a daughter who tyrannizes over an indulgent father her admiration and gratitude so boyish once were now replaced by an affection in which the element of sex had small place and his love for her sprang also from a source far removed from the fierce instinct which first led him to seek her subduing     chapter vii  bertha repulses an enemy   charles haney had no scruples from the moment of his first meeting with his brothers young wife he determined to make himself solid with her convinced that mart was not long for this world he set to work to win berthas favor for this was the only way to harvest the golden fortune she controlled  mart is just fool enough and contrary enough to leave every cent of his money to her here he placed one finger against his brow carlos here is where you get busy its us to the haberdasher we shine  notwithstanding all his boasting he was not only an actor out of an engagement but flat broke badly dressed and in sorry disrepute with managers ive been playing in a stock company in san francisco he had explained and im now on my way to new york to produce a play of my own hence these tears i need an angel  he distinctly said the first of the month in this announcement but as the days went by he only settled deeper into the snug corners of the haney home making no further mention of his triumphal eastward progress on the contrary he had the air of a regular boarder and turned up promptly for meals rotund and glowing in the opulence of his brothers hospitality  on the strength of his name he found favor with the tailors and bourgeoned forth a few days later in the best cloth the shops afforded and strutted and plumed himself like a turkeycock before bertha keeping up meanwhile a pretension of sympathy and goodfellowship with mart  in this he miscalculated for bertha youthful as she seemed was accustomed as she would say to standing off mashers and her impassive face and keen steady eyes fairly disconcerted the libertine for marts sake well put up with him she said to her mother hes a loafer but i can see the captain kind o likes to have him aroundfor old times sake i reckon  this was true when alone with his brother charles dropped his egotistic brag and dramatic bluster and touched craftily upon the daredevil boyish life they had led together he was shrewd enough to see and understand that this was his most ingratiating rôle and he played it to the limit as bertha would have said  and yet no one in the house realized how his presence reacted against bertha  what are we to think of a girl so obtuse that she permits a man like this fat disgusting actor to dangle about her asked mrs crego of her husband who was haneys legal adviser  hes her husbands brother you know argued crego  all the same i cant understand her she looks nice and sweet and you say she is so and yet here she is married to a notorious gambler and associating with mountebanks and all sorts of malodorous people why ive seen her riding down the street with the upholsterer and mrs congdon told me that she saw her stop her carriage in front of a cigar store and talk with a barber in a white jacket for at least ten minutes  crego laughed what infamy however i cant believe even the upholsterer will finally corrupt her the fact is my dear were all getting to be what some of my clients call too aristocratic bertha haney is sprung from good average american stock and has associated with the kind of people you abhor all her life she hasnt begun to draw any of your artificial distinctions i hope she never will her barber friend is on the same level with the clerks and grocerymen of the town theyre all human you know shes the true democrat i confess i like the girl her ability is astonishing williams and haney both take her opinion quite as weightily as my own  mrs crego was impressed well ill call on her if you really think i ought to do so  i dont i withdraw my suggestion i deprecate your callingin that spirit i doubt if she expects you to call i hardly think she has awakened to any slights put upon her by your set indeed she seems quite happy in the society of thomas richard and harry  dont be brutal allen  im not the girl is now serenethats the main thing and you might raise up doubts and discontents in her mind  i certainly shall not go near her so long as that odious actor is hanging about his smirk at me the other day made me ill  this conversation was typical of many others in homes of equal culture for berthas position as well as her face and manner piqued curiosity after all the town was a small placejust large enough to give gossip room to play inand the sheen of mrs haneys wealth made her conspicuous from afar while her youth and boyish beauty had been the subject of admiring club talk from the very first haney was only an old and wounded animal whose mate was free to choose anew  it makes me ache to see the girl go wrong said mrs frank congdon wife of a resident portraitpainter also in delicate health she was speaking to mrs crego think of that great housefrank says she runs it admirablyfilled with tinkers and tailors and candlestickmakers not to mention touts and gamblerswhen she might be entertainingwell us for example she laughed at the unbending face of her friend then went on dr cronk says the mother is a sweet old lady and of good new england familya constitutional methodist he calls her i wish she kept better company  but what can you expect of a girl brought up in a pigsty her mother was mistress of a little miners hotel in junction city allen says and the girl boasts of it  mrs congdon smiled im dying to talk with her shes far and away the most interesting of our newly rich and i like her face frank has called you know  has he  on business of course she has decided to have him paint her husbands picture shes taken her first step upward you see  i should think shed be content to have her saloonkeeper husbands face fade out of her memory  frank is enthusiastic im not a bit sure that he didnt suggest the portrait he is shameless when he takes a fancy to a face hes wild to paint them both and call it the lion tamer and the lion he considers haney a great character it seems he saw him in cripple creek once and was vastly taken by his pose his being old and sad nowhis face is one of the saddest i ever sawmakes it all the more interesting to frank so im going to callin fact were going to lunch there soon  oh well yes you artists can do anything and its all right you must come over immediately afterwards and tell me all about it wont you  at this mrs congdon laughed but being of generous mind consented  crego was right bertha had not yet begun to take on trouble about her social position she had carried to her big house in the springs all the ideas and usages of sibley junctionthat was all she acknowledged her obligations as a householder carrying forward the new england democratic traditions to be next door made any one a neighbor with the right to run in to inspect your house and furniture and to give advice the fact that nearathand residents did not avail themselves of this privilege troubled her very little at first so busy was she with her own affairs but it was inevitable that the talk of her mothers church associates should sooner or later open her eyes to the truth that the distinctions which she had read about as existing in new york and chicago were present in her own little city mrs crego and her set are too stuck up to associate with common folks was the form in which the revelation came to her  from one loosetongued sister she learned also that she and the captain were subjects of earnest prayer in the sewingcircle and that her husbands catholicism was a source of deep anxiety not to say proselyting hostility on the part of the pastor and his wife while from another of these officious souls she learned that the springs beautiful as it was so sunlit so pure of air was a centre of marital infelicity wherein the devil reigned supreme  her mothers pastor called and was very outspoken as to mart and charlesboth of whom needed the lords grace badly he expressed great concern for berthas spiritual welfare and openly prayed for her husband whose nominal submission to the catholic church seemed not merely blindness to his own sin but a danger to the young wife  haney however though wounded and suffering was still a lion in resolution and his glance checked the exhortation which the minister one day nerved himself to utter i do not interfere with any mans faith said he and i do not intend to be put to school by you nor any other livin i was raised a catholic and for the sake of me mother i call meself wan to this day and as i am so i shall die and the finality of his voice won him freedom from further molestation  berthas concern for her creed was hardly more poignant than haneys and they never argued but she did begin to give puzzled thought to the social complications which opened out day by day before her charles embittered by his failures enlightened her still more profoundly he had a certain shrewdness of comment at times which bit wouldnt it jar you said he one day to see this little town sporting a smart set and quoting town topics like a bible why some of these dinky little twospot fourflushers draw the line on me because im an actor what dye think o that i dont mind your methodist sistern walking wide of me but its another punch when these dubs who are smoking my cigars at the club fail to invite me to their houses  bertha looked at him reflectively throughout this speech putting a different interpretation on the neglect he complained of she had gone beyond disliking him she despised him for he was growing bolder each day in his addresses and took every precaution that he should not be alone with her and she rose one morning with the determination to tell mart that she would not endure his brothers presence another day but his pleasure in charles company was too genuine to be disturbed and so she endured  the actors talk was largely concerned with the scandalmongery of the town and very soon the young wife knew that mrs may whose husband was in the last stages was in love with young mr june and that mr frost whose wife was weakly was going about shamelessly with miss bloom and all this comment came to her ears freighted with its worst significance vile suggestion dripped from charles haneys reckless tongue  this was deeplaid policy with him his purpose was to undermine her loyalty as a wife his approaches had no charm no finesse presuming on his relationship he caught at her hand as she passed or took a seat beside her if he found her alone on a sofa at such moments she was furious with him and once she struck his hand away with such violence that she suffered acute pain for several hours afterwards  his attentionswhich were almost assaultscame at last to destroy a large part of her joy in her new home her drives when he sat beside her were a torture and yet she could not bring herself to accuse him before the crippled man who really suffered from loneliness whenever she was out of the house or busy in her household work he had never been given to reading and was therefore pathetically dependent upon conversation for news and amusement he was much at home too for his maiming was still so fresh upon him that he shrank from exhibiting himself on the street or at the clubs there are no saloons in the springs crego whom he liked exceedingly was very busy and williams was away at the mines for the most part and so in spite of berthas care he often sat alone on the porch a pitiful shadow of the man who paid court to the clerk of the golden eagle  sometimes he followed the women around the house like a dog watching them at their dusting and polishing youll strain yourself captain bertha warningly cried out whenever he laid hold of a chair or brush and so each time he went back to his library to smoke and wait until his wifes duties were ended at such hours his brother was a comfort he was not a fastidious man even with the refinement which had come from his sickness and his marriage and the actor so long as he cast no imputations on any friend could talk as freely as he pleased  slowly day by day charles regained marts interest and a measure of his confidence having learned what to avoid and what to emphasize he now deplored the drink habits of his brothers and gently suggested that the old father needed help they played cards occasionally during such times as household cares drew bertha away and held much discussion of mines and miningthough here mart was singularly reticent and afforded little information about his own affairs his trust in charles did not go so far as that with crego however he freely discussed his condition for the lawyer had written his new will and was in possession of it  im like a battered old tin can he said once did ye ever try to put a tin can back into shape ye cannot if ye push it back here it bulges there the doctors are tryin hard to take the kinks out o me but tis impossiblei see thatbut i may live on for a long time already me mind misgives me about bertieshes too young to be tied up to a shouldershotten old plug like mesilf  to this crego soothingly responded i dont think you need to worry shes as happy as a blackbird in spring  once he said to bertha i niver intended to limp around like this i niver thought to be the skate i am this day and his despondency darkened his face as he spoke i could not blame you if you threw me out im only a big nuisance  you will be if you talk like that she briskly answered and that is all she seemed to make of his protest she had indeed been reared in an atmosphere of loyalty to marriage as well as of chastity and she never for a moment considered her vows weakened by her husbands broken frame  this fidelity charles discovered to his own confusion one night as he came home inflamed by liquor and reckless of hand to find her sitting alone in the library writing a letter it was not late but mart feeling tired had gone to bed and mrs gilman was in sibley  bertha looked up as he entered and without observing that he was drunk went on with her writing which was ever a painful ceremony with her dropping his coat where he stood and with his hat awry on the red globe of his head the dastard staggered towards her his eyes lit with a glare of reckless desire  say he began this is luck i want o talk with you bertie i want o find out why you run away from me whats the matter with me anyhow  she realized now the foul satyrlike mood of the man and sprang up tense and strong silently confronting him  he mumbled with a grin youre a peach whats the matter why dont you like me aint i all right im a gentleman  his words were babble but the look in his eyes the loose slaver of his lips both scared and angered her and as he pushed against her clumsily trying to hook his arm about her waist she struck him sharply with the full weight of her arm and shoulder and he tottered and fell sprawling with a curse in his teeth he caught at a chair recovered his balance and faced her with a look of fury that would have appalled one less experienced than she  you little fool he snarled dont you do that again  stop she did not lift her voice but the word arrested him do you want to die the word die pierced the mist of his madness what do you think mart will say to this  he shivered and grew pale under the force of his brothers name uttered in that tone he began to melt subsiding into a jellymass of fear  dont tell mart for christs sake i didnt mean nothing dont do it i begi beg  she looked at him and seemed to grow in years as she searched his wretched body for its soul if you dont pull out of this house tomorrow ill let him know just the kind of deadhead boarder you are you havent fooled me anynot for a minute ive put up with you for his sake but tonight settles it you go ive stood a lot from you but your mealticket is no good after tomorrow morningyou sabe its you to the outside tomorrow now get out or i call mart  he turned and shuffled from the room leaving his battered hat at her feet  she waited till she heard him close his door then with a look of disgust on her face picked up his hat and coat and hung them on the rack in the hall im sorry for mart she said to herself he was company for him but i cant stand the loafer a day longer i hope i never see him again                                       he did not get down to breakfast and for this she was glad but he sought opportunity a little later to plead for clemency give me another chance i was drunk i didnt mean it  she remained inexorable not for a second she succinctly replied i dont care how you fix it with mart smooth it up as best you can but fly this coop and her face expressed such contempt that he crept away flabby and faltering to his brother  ive been telegraphed for and must go he said and by the way i need a little ready mon to carry me to the little old town as soon as i get to work ill send you a check  mart handed him the money in silence and waited till he had folded and put away the bills then he said charles you was always the smart one of the family and yed be all right now if yed pass the booze and get down to hard work its time ye were off for yeve done nothin but loaf and drink here ive enjoyed your talkpart of the time but i can see yed grow onto me here like a wart and thats bad for you and bad for me and so im glad yere going  cant you he was going to ask for a positionsomething easy with big paywhen he saw that such a request would make his telegram a lie  as he hesitated mart continued no ill back no play for ye im a gambler but i take no chances of that kind if you see the old father write and tell me how he is  charles though filled with rising fury was sober enough to know in what danger he stood and forcing a smile to his face shook hands and went out to his carriagealone  as mart met bertha a few minutes later he remarked with calm directness there goes a cheap rounder and a sponge ive been a gambler and a saloonkeeper but i never got the notion that i could live without doin something charles was a smart lad but the divil has him by the neck and to give money is to give him drink  bertha remained silent her own indictment was so much more severe     chapter viii  bertha receives an invitation   colorado springs lies in a shallow valley under a genial sun at almost the exact level of the summit of mt washington from the railway train as it crawls over the hills to the east it looks like a toy village but is in fact a busy little city to ride along its wide and leafy streets in summer to breathe its crystalline airs in winter is to lose belief in the necessity of disease the grave seems afar off  and yet it was built and is now supported by those who fearing death fled the lower miasmatic levels of the world and who having abandoned all hope or desire of return are loyally developing and adorning their adopted home these fugitives are for the most part contented exilesmen as well as womenwho have come to enjoy their enforced stay here beside the peaks and their devotion to the town and its surroundings is unmistakably sincere for they believe that the climate and the water have prolonged their lives  not all even of these seekers for health are ill or even weakly at present on the contrary many of them are stalwart hands at golf and others are seasoned horsemen in addition to those who are resident in their own behalf are many husbands attendant upon ailing wives and blooming wives called to the care of weazened and querulous husbands and parents who came bringing a son or daughter on whom the pale shadow of the white death had fallen but after all these easterners color but they do not dominate the life of the town which is a marketplace for a wide region and a place of comfort for welltodo miners it is also a western town with all a western towns customary activities and the traveller would hardly know it for a health resort so cheerful and lively is the aspect of its streets where everything denotes comfort and content  in addition to the elements denoted above it is also taken to be a desirable social centre and a charming place of residence for men like marshall haney who having made their pile in the mountain camps have a reasonable desire to put their gold in evidenceto get some good of their dust as williams might say here and there along the principal avenues are luxurious homesabsurdly pretentious in some instanceswhich are pointed out to visitors as the residences of the big miners they are especially given to good horses also and ride or drive industriously mixing very little with the more cultured and sophisticated of their neighbors for whom they furnish a neverending comedy of manners a beautiful mixture for a novelist congdon often said  yes the town has its restricted smart set in imitation of new york city and its literary and artistic groups small of course and its staid circle of wealth and privilege and within defined limits and at certain formal civic functions these various elements meet and interfuse genially if not sincerely however the bitter fact remains that the microcosm is already divided into classes and masses in a way which would be humorous if it were not so deeply significant of a deplorable change in american life squire crego in discussing this very matter with frank congdon the portraitpainter put it thus this division of interest is inevitable what can you do the wife of the man who cobbles my shoes or the daughter of the grocer who supplies my sugar is in the eyes of god undoubtedly of the same value as my own wife but they dont interest me as a social democrat i may wish sincerely to do them good but confound it to wish to do them good is an impertinence and when ive tried to bring these elements together in my house i have always failed mrs crego while being most gracious and cordial has nevertheless managed to make the upholsterer chilly and to freeze the grocers wife entirely out of the picture  theres one comfort it isnt a matter of money if it were where would the congdons be  no it isnt really a matter of money and in a certain sense it isnt a matter of brains its a question of  savoir faire  precisely you havent a cent so you say frequently congdon stopped him gravely  i owe you fiftyi was just going down into my jeans to pay it when i suddenly recalled  dont interrupt the court you havent a cent well say but you go everywhere and are welcome why  thats just it why if you really want to know ill tell you its all on account of lee lee is a mighty smart girl she has a cinch on the gray matter of this family  you do yourself an injustice  thank you  crego pursued his argument there isnt any place that a man of your type cant go if you want to because you take something with you you mix and haney for exampleto return to the concrete againhaney would make a most interesting guest at ones dinnertable but the wife clever as she is is impossibleor at least mrs crego thinks she is  congdon fixed a finger pistolwise and impressively said that little mrs haney is a wonder dont make any mistake about her shell climb  im not making the mistake its mrs crego ive asked her to call on the girl but she evades the issue by asking whats the use her interests are not ours and i dont intend to cultivate her as a freak so there we stand  congdon looked thoughtful she may be right but i dont think so the girl interests me because i think i see in her great possibilities  her abilities certainly are remarkable she needs but one statement of a point in law she seems never to forget a word i say sometimes this realization is embarrassing when she fixes those big wistful eyes on me i feel bound to give her my choicest diction and my soundest judgments haney too for all his wild career attaches my sympathy youre painting his portraitwhy dont you and lee give them a dinner  good thought i told lee this morning that it was a shame to draw the line on that little girl just because that rotten bad brotherinlaw of hers was base enough to slur her at the club but as you say women cant be driv however i think lee can manage a dinner if anybody can as you say were only artists and artists can do anythingexcept borrow money however if you want to know lee says that this barber lover of mrs haneys has done more to queer her with our set than anything else they think her tastes are low  that incident is easily explained winchell knew her in sibley and though he has undoubtedly followed her over here for love of her he seems a decent fellow and i dont believe intends any harm i will admit her stopping outside his door to talk with him was unconventional but i cant believe that she was aware of any impropriety in the act nevertheless that did settle the matter with helen you can dine with them any day if you wish she says but and there the argument rests  of course you and i can put the matter on a basis of trade courtesy said congdon but i confess they interest me enormously and i would like to do them some little favor for their own sakes poor haney will never be more of a man than he is today and that little girl is going to earn all the money she gets before she is done with him  and so they parted and congdon went home to renew the discussion with his wife you must call its only the decent thing to do now that the portrait is nearly done he said  i dont mind the calling frank she briskly replied and i dont much mind giving a little dinner but i dont want to get the girl on my mind she has so much to learn and i havent the time nor energy to teach her  congdon waved his finger dont you grow pale over that said he that girls no foolshes capable of development she will amaze you yet  well consider it settled ill call this afternoon and ask her to dinner but dont expect me to advise her and follow her up now wholl we ask to meet herthe cregos  yes id thought of them  oh i know all about it you neednt stammer you and allen are getting a good deal out of the haneys and want to be decent in return well i think well of you for it and ill do my mite ill have young fordyce in and alice being quakers and plain people they wont mind ben is crazy to see the rough side of western life anyway now run away little boy and leave the whole business to me  as crego had said the congdons were privileged characters in the springs they were at once haughty with the pride of esthetic cleverness and humble with the sense of their unworthiness in the wide oldworld of art lee was contemptuous of wealth when they had a pot of beans in the house and frank was imperiously truculent when borrowing ten dollars from a friend or demanding an advance of cash from a prospective patron they both came of long lines of native american ancestry and not only felt themselves as good as anybody but a little better than most they gave wit for champagne art instruction for automobile rides and neverfailing good humor for houseroom and the blazing fires of roomy hearths  mrs congdon of direct virginian ancestry was named lee by a statesrights mother who sent her abroad to study art she ended by pretending to be a sculptorand she still did occasionally model a figurine of her friends or her friends babies mainly she was the aider and abettor of her husband a really clever portraitpainter whose ill health had driven him from new york to colorado and who was making a precarious living in the springsprecarious for the reason that on bright days he would rather play golf than handle a brush and on dark days he couldnt see to paint so he said in truth he was not well and his slender store of strength did not permit him to do as he would to cover the real seriousness of his case he loudly admitted his laziness and incompetency  lee was a devoted wife and when she realized that his interest in the haneys was deep and genuine her slight opposition gave way it meant a couple of thousand dollars to frank but money was the least of their troublescredit seemed to come along when they needed it most and each of them had become trustful to the point of idiocy mrs crego was accustomed to say mrs crego really took charge of their affairs and when they needed food helped them to it  starting for the haneys on the streetcar that very afternoon lee reached the gate just as bertie was helping mart into his carriage there was something so genuine and so touching in this picture of the slender young wife supporting her big and crippled husband that mrs congdons nerves thrilled and her face softened plainly this consideration on the part of mrs haney was habitual and ungrudging  bertie as she faced her caller saw only a pale little woman with flashing eyes and smiling mouth whose dress was as neat as a mans and almost as plain lee prided herself on not being artistic in dress and so waited for further information  how do you do mrs haney lee began im mrs congdon  bertha threw the rug over marts knees before turning to offer her hand im glad to meet you she responded with gravity ive seen you on the street  lee couldnt quite make out whether this remark was intended for reproach or not but she went on quickly i was just about to call indeed i came to ask you and mr haney to dine with us on thursday she nodded and smiled at mart who sat with impassive countenance listening with attentionhis piercing eyes making her rather uncomfortable we dine at seven i hope you can come  bertha looked up at her husband what do you say captain  i dont see any objection he answered without warmth  bertha turned with still passive countenance all right she said well be there wont you jump in and take a ride with us  lee burning with mingled flames of resentment and humor replied thank you i have another call to makethursday then at seven oclock  well connect much obliged replied bertha and sprang into the carriage go ahead dan goodday mrs congdon  lee stood for an instant in amazement at this easy not to say indifferent acceptance of her tremendous offering well if that isnt cool she gasped and walked on thoughtfully  humor dominated her at last and when she entered mrs cregos house she was flushed with laughter and recounted the words of the interview with so many subtle interpretations of her own that mrs crego was delighted  mrs congdon did not spare herself helen she made me feel like a billcollector all right said she ill be there and left me standing in the middle of the street youve got to come now helen to preserve my dignity  im wild to come really i want to see what shell do to us professional people maybe she will patronize us too  when lee told frank about it at night he failed to laugh as heartily as she had expected thats all very funny the way you tell it but as a matter of fact the girl did all she knew she accepted your invitation and civilly asked you to take a ride what more could mortal woman proffer  she might have invited me into the house  not at the moment it was marts hour for a drive and you were interfering with one of her duties i think she treated you very well  anyhow shes coming and so is helen it tickled helen nearly into fits of course and shes comingjust to see me put to it to manage these wet valley bronchos  the girl may look like a bronk but shes got good blood in her shell hold her own anywhere replied congdon with conviction     chapter ix  bertha meets ben fordyce   for all her impassivity bertha was really elated by this invitation for she liked congdon and had a very high opinion of his powers she experienced no special dread of the dinner for it appeared to her at the moment to be a simple sitting down to eat with some friendly people she was not in awe of mrs congdon however much she might admire her husbands skill and she knew their home it was a small house on a side street and did not compare for a moment with her own establishment in which she had begun to take a settled pride  as they rode away she was mentally casting up in her mind a choice of clothes when haney remarked bertie i dont believe ill go to that dinner  why not  well im not as handy with a cold deck as i used to be and i dont think i ought to put me lame foot into another mans lap  youre all right captain and besides ill be close by to help out in case you run up against a hard knock in the steak course youll goi want you to get out and see the people why you havent taken a meal out of the house since we moved except that one at the casino you need more doin  haney was in a dejected mood so do you im a heavy handicap to you bertie sure i am as i see ye settin there bloomin as a rose and feel me own age acreepin on me i know i should be takin me congé out of selfrespectjust to give you open road  stop that she warningly cried hello theres ed he seems in a rush wonder whats eating him  winchell dressed in a new suit of clothes darted from the sidewalk to the carriage his face shining say folks im called east old man died yesterday and ive got to go home he was breathing hard with excitement  get in and tell us about it commanded bertha  he climbed up beside the driver and turned on his seat to continue yes ive got to go and say the old man was well off i dont do no more barberin i tell you that im goin to study law im comin back here just as soon as things are settled up ive been talking with a fellow herelawyer hansall he says hell take me in and give me a chance no more barberin for me you hear me  tis a poor business but a necessary remarked haney  bertha was sympathetic im glad youre goin to get a raise of course im sorry about your father  i understandso am i but hes gone and its up to me to think of myself i know you always despised my trade  no i didnt men have to be shaved and clipped its like dishwashin somebody has to do it we cant all sit in the parlor  winchell acknowledged the force of this well i always felt sneakin about it ill admit but that was because i was raised a farmer and barbers were always cheap skates with us we didnt use em much in fact well its all up now and when i come back i want you to forget i ever cut hair a third of the old farm is mine and that will pay my board while i study  neither haney nor his young wife was surprised by this movement on his part any more than he was surprised at their rise to wealth and luxury both were in accordance with the american tradition but as they rode down the street certain scornful easterners schooled in european conventions smiled to see the wife of an irish millionaire gambler in earnest conversation with a barber  mrs crego driving downtown with mrs congdon stared in astonishment then turned to lee and you ask me to meet such a woman at dinner she exclaimed and her tone expressed a kind of bewilderment  lee laughed you cant fail me now dont be hasty trust in frank  id hate to have my dinner partners selected by frank congdon i draw the line at barbers  youre a snob helen if you were really as narrow as you sound id cut you dead furthermore the barber isnt invited  i cant understand such people  i can she dont know any better you impute a low motive where there is nothing worse than ignorance as frank says the girl is a perfectly natural outgrowth of a little town i hope our dinner wont spoil her  mrs congdon had put the dinnerhour early and when the haneys drove up in their glittering new carriage drawn by two splendid black horses she too had a moment of bewilderment but her sense of humor prevailed frank she said you cant patronize a turnout like thatnot in my presence  tonight arts name is mud he replied with conviction and hastened down the steps to help haney up  the gambler waved his proffered arm aside im not so bad as all that said he i let me little corporal help mesometimes for love of it not because i nade it  he was still gaunt and pale but his eyes were of unconquerable fire and the lift of his head from the shoulders was still leopardlike he was dressed in a black frockcoat with a creamcolored vest and gray trousers and looked very well indeedquite irreproachable  bertha was clad in black alsoa closefitting highnecked gown which made her fair skin shine like fireflushed ivory and her big serious eyes and vivid lips completed the charm of her singular beauty her bosom had lost some of its girlish flatness but the lines of her hips and thighs still resembled those of a boy and the pose of her head was like that of an athlete  wont you come in and take off your hat asked mrs congdon and she followed without reply leaving the two men on the porch  without appearing to do so she saw everything in the house which was hardly more than an artistic camp so far as the first floor was concerned navajo rugs were on the floor moqui plaques starred the walls and acoma ollas perched upon bookshelves of thick plank the chairs were rude rough and bolted at the joints the room made a pleasant impression on bertha though she could not have told why the ceiling was dark the walls green the woodwork stained pine and yet it had charm  mrs congdon explained meanwhile that frank had made the big centretable of plank and the bookshelves as well he likes to tinker at such things she said whenever he gets blue or cross i set him to shifting the dresser or making a bookshelf and he cheers up like mad hes a regular kid anywayalways doing the things he ought not to do  in this way she tried to put her guest at her ease while bertha sat looking at her in an absentminded way apparently neither frightened nor embarrassedon the contrary she seemed to be thinking of something else at last to force a reply mrs congdon asked how do you like my husbands portrait of mr haney  i dont know she slowly replied it looks like him and then again it dont i guess im not up to hand paintins enlarged photographs are about my size  youre disappointed then  well yes i dont know but i am i didnt think it was going to look just that way mr congdon says blue shadows are under anybodys ears in the light but i cant see em on the captain and i do see em in the picture thats what gets me twisted when i look at the picture i cant see nothin else  her hostess laughed i know just how you feel but thats the insolence of the painterhe puts on canvas what he sees not what his patron sees the more money you pay for a portrait the more insolent the artist  at this moment mrs crego came in and as she said afterwards was presented to the gamblers wife as though i were a nobody and she a visiting countess bertha rose offered her hand like a boy in silence she stood very straight with very cold and unmistakably suspicious face and alice heath who entered with mrs crego shared this chill reception  bertha in truth instantly and cordially hated mrs crego but she pitied the younger woman in whom she detected another fugitive fighting a losing battle with disease miss heath was very fair and very frail with burning deepblue eyes and a lovely mouth she greeted bertha with such sincere pleasure that the girl inclined to her instantly and they went out on the porch together alice put her hand on berthas arm saying ive wanted to meet you mr congdon has told us so much of you your life seems very romantic to me  the men all rose to meet mrs congdon and before bertha had time to recover from the effect of the girls words she found herself confronted by ben fordyce who looked like a college boy athletic and smiling he was tall and broadchested with a round blond face and yellow hair his manner was frank and his voice deep his hand broad and strong was hardened by the tennisracket and calloused by the golfstick and somehow its leathery clasp pleased the girl the roughness of his palm made him less alien than either congdon or crego  they went out to dinner immediately and as she walked beside mart she felt the young athletes eyes resting upon her face and the knowledge of this troubled her unaccountably mrs congdon seated him opposite her at the table and he continued to stare at her with the frankest curiosity she returned his gaze at last with a certain defiance but found no offence in his eyes which were round as his face and of a sincere steady gray he was smoothshaven and his blond hair was rather short all these peculiarities appeared one by one in the intervals between her attentions to mart and her study of the furnishings of the table which was decorated with candles and flowers in a way quite new to her  fordyce was as fine as he looked nothing equivocal was in that magnificent boy as his friends called him and his interest in little mrs haney was that of the easterner who having been told that strange things take place in the west is disappointed if they do not happen under his nose he had heard much of the haneys from congdon and had been especially impressed with the story of berthas midnight ride to the bedside of the dying gambler the wedding in the saloon her devotion to the wounded man their descent upon the springs and their domestication in a stone palaceall appealed to his imagination such things could not happen in chester they were of the mountain west and most satisfying to his taste  bertha on her part had to admit that the people at the table were most kindly even considerate they made her husband the centre of interest and passed politely over all his disastrous attempts to use his left hand there were no awkward pauses for excepting one or two slips of tongue haney rose to the occasion he was big enough and selfcontained enough not to apologize for what he had been or what he was and under congdons skilful guidance told of his experiences as amateur miner and gambler growing humorous as the wine mellowed and lightened his reminiscences he felt the sympathy of his audience all listened delightedly with no accusation in their eyesexcept in the case of mrs crego who still breathed so it seemed to bertha a certain contempt and inner repugnance  young fordyce glowed with delight in these tales reading beneath the terse lines of haneys slang something epic detecting a perfect willingness to take any chance the fact that his bravery led to nothing conventionally noble or moral did not detract from the inherent interest of the tale on the contrary the young fellow being of unusual imaginative reach and freedom took pleasure in the thought that a man would risk his life again and again merely for the excitement of it occasionally he glanced at judge crego to find him looking upon haney with thoughtful glance it was a little like listening to a prisoners confession of guilt as he afterwards said but to him as to congdon it was a most interesting monologue  it added enormously to the romance so far as ben fordyce was concerned to look across the table at the grave watchful face of the girl who unfolded her husbands napkin or cut up his roast with deft handalways careful not to interrupt his talk  as he thought of the quiet quaker neighborhood from which he came and contrasted these singular and powerfully defined personalities with the men of weight and the demure maidens of his acquaintance bens blood tingled with a sense of the bigness and strangeness of the greater america the west was no longer a nation it was a world to be in it at last was a delight as well as an education  bertha on her part felt no strangeness in her position her marriage was a logical outcome of her life and surroundings the incomprehensible lay in the shining women about her their ideas of life their comment puzzled her their clothes were of a kind which her own money could buy but their manners their grace of speech their gestures came of something besides money mrs crego was especially formidable and made her feel the inadequacy of the black gown which she had thought very fine when she selected it ready made in a denver store she did not know that mrs crego had dressed very simply at the suggestion of her hostess but she did feel a certain condescension of manner even in alice and was glad the captain absorbed so much of the tabletalk  her time of trial came when the ladies rose and at mrs congdons suggestion returned to the porch leaving the men to finish their cigars not one of bens little courtesies towards the women escaped her his acquiescence congdons tone of exaggerated respect cregos compliments were all new to her and in a certain sense she resented them she doubted their sincerity a little notwithstanding their grateful charm  alice took her to herself and this was a great relief for she feared mrs cregos sharp tongue and was not entirely sure of her hostess  laying a slim hand on her arm the eastern girl began i am fascinated by you mrs haney you have had such an interesting life and you have such an opportunity for doing good  bertha looked at her in blank surprise what do you mean  with your great wealth you can accomplish so much had you thought of that  no i hadnt the answer was blunt ive been so busy getting settled and looking after the captain i havent had time to think of anything else  oh of course but by and by youll begin to look about you for things to helpi mean hospitals and charities and all that the only time when i envy great wealth is when i see some wrong which money can right mr fordyce is a lawyer but not a very famous onehes only twentyeight and while we are likely to have all we really need we cant begin to do what wed like to do for others i suppose mrs congdon has told you of us  where do you live  we live in chester but mr fordyce has an office in philadelphia we have been engaged a long time but i couldnt think of marrying while i was so ill im afraid i stayed so long that not even this climate can help me  this was indeed berthas conviction and her untactful silence said as much therefore alice hastened on to other more general topics she was very sprightly but bertha maintained a determined silence through it all quite unable to understand the girls confidences  when the men came out alice took haney to herself and they seemed to enjoy each others society very keenly indeed their mutual absorption became so complete that ben remarked upon it to bertha miss heath has been crazy to meet your husband mrs haney his adventurous life appeals to her as to me very deeply we dont mean to be offensive but to us you seem typical of the west  what he said at this time made less impression on her than the way in which he spoke the light of an electric streetlamp fell upon his face revealing its charming lines on his fine hand a ring gleamed autumn insects were singing sleepily in the grass and from the trees the laughter of girls came from the dusk of neighboring lawns and over all descended the magical light of a harvest moon flecking the surface of the little garden with shadows almost as definite as those cast by the flaming white globes of the streetlamps it is on such nights that the heart of youth expands with longing and sadness  crego and congdon fell into hot argument their usual method of conversation leaving the young people to themselves and ben with intent to provoke the grave little wife to laughter told a funny story which reflected on congdons improvidence  bertha was really grateful for she felt herself at a great disadvantage among these fluent and interesting folk who talked like the characters in novels their jests their comment meant little to her but their gestures their graceful attitudes their courtesies to each other meant much they were something more than polite they were considerate in a way which showed their thoughtfulness to be deeply grounded in habitual action they used slang but they used it as a garnish not as a habit of speech expressions which she had read in books but had never before heard spoken flowed from their lips their sentences were built up for effect in cregos case this was more or less expected but the phrases of fordyce and congdon were still more disconcerting the art of their stories was a revelation of the neatness and precision of cultivated speech  when mrs congdon led the way back into the house ben stepped to alices side saying in a low tone i hope you havent taken a chill i beg your pardon dearest i should have watched you more closely  once withindoors mrs congdon insisted on bens singing which he did with smiling readiness expressing however a profound ignorance of music i never take my songs as seriously as my friends seem to do he explained to bertha music with me is a gift rather than an acquirement  his voice was indeed fresh and sweet and he sangas bertha had never heard any one singcertain love ballads whose despairing cadences were made the more profoundly piercing someway by his happy boyish face and handsomely clothed and powerful figure but i and my true love will never meet again seemed to be a fatalistic cry rather than a wail of sadness as it came from his lips but its melody sank deep into the girls heart she sat in rigid absorption her eyes fixed upon the splendid young singer as a child looks upon some new and complicated toy the grace with which he pronounced his words the spread of his splendid chest his easy pose his selfdepreciating shrugs enthralled her surely this was one of the young princes of the earth his voice came to her freighted with the passion of ideal manhood  he sang other songstunes not worthy of himbut ended with a ballad called fair springtide by macdowella song so stern so strange so inexorably sad that the singer himself grew grave at last and rose to his best bertha was thrilled to the heart saddened yet exalted by his voice her horizonher emotional horizonwas of a sudden extended and she caught glimpses of strange lands and dim peaks of fabled mountains and when the singer declared himself at an end she sat benumbed while the others cheeredher hands folded on her lap it seemed a profanation to applaud  haney gloomed in silence also but not for the same reason i might have sung like that once he thought for he had been choirboy in his ragamuffin youth and had regained a fine tenor voice at eighteen age and neglect had ruined it however for ten years he had not attempted to sing a note this youth made him dream of the pastas it caused bertha to forecast the future  while young fordyce was putting away his music the captain struggled to his feet and bertha seeing a sudden paleness overspread his face hastened to him  i reckon wed better be going she said to mrs congdon with blunt directness  its early yet replied her hostess  haney replied not for cripples time was when i could sit all night in the lookouts chair but not now ten oclock finds me wishful towards the bed he said this with a faint smile but the pathos of it the truth of it went to berthas heart as it did to mrs congdons not merely was his body maimed but his mind had correspondingly been weakened by that tearing charge of shot  something of his native celtic gallantry came back to him as he said sure mrs congdon weve had a fine evening you must come to see us soon  ben was addressing himself to bertha do you ever ride  i used toi dont now you see the captain cant stand the jolt of a horse so we mostly drive  i was about to say that alice and i would be glad to have you join us we ride every morninga very gentle pace i assure you for im no roughrider and besides she sets the pace  berthas face was pale and her eyes darkly luminous as she falteringly answered id like tobutperhaps i can some time im much obliged and then she gave him her hand in parting  mrs congdon was subtly moved by something in the girls face as she said goodnight and to her invitation to come and see her cordially responded i certainly shall do so                                       little mrs haney rode away from her first dinner party in the silence of one whose thoughts are too swift and too new to find speech her brain sensitive as that of a babe had caught and ineffaceably retained a million impressions which were to influence all her after life the most vivid and most powerful of these impressions rose from the glowing beauty of young fordyce whose like she had never seen but as background to him was the lovely room the shining table the grace and charm of the conversation and dominating all the musicquite the best she had ever heard the eveningso simple almost commonplace to her hostesswas of unspeakable significance to the uncultured girl  she did not wish to talk and when haney spoke she made no reply to his comment a fine bunch of people he repeated they sure treated us right cregos the fine manwe do well to make him our lawyer as bertha again failed to respond he resumed with a little chuckle but mrs crego is saying i dunnothem haneys is queer cattle and the little sick lady sure she was as interested in me talk as patsy mcgonnigle she drug out o me some of me wildest scrapes poor little girl twill soon be all up with her its a fine young fellow she has a quaker by training she says my my what a prizefighter hed make if his mind ran that way think of a quaker with a chest like thattis something ferocious he can sing too cant he a fine ladas fine as iver i see think of shoulders like his all wasted on a man of peace im afraid the little lady will never put on the ring if she waits till she gets well  to this bertha listened intently but gave out no sign of interest she was eager to be alone eager to review all that had happenedall that had been said  for the first time since her marriage she felt haneys presence to be just the least bit of a burden and when they entered the house she urged his immediate retirement though he was disposed to sit in the library and talk they were highclass he said again i never supposed i could make easy camp with such people they sure treated us noble they made us feel at home we must have some liquor like that ive always despised wine and those that took it but bedad i see there are two sides to that question tis not so thin as i thought it  bertha at last got him safely bestowed and was free to seek her own apartment which she did at once her chamber which adjoined her husbands to the west he liked the morning sun was a big room and the young wife looked like a doll as she dropped into a broad tufted chair which stood in a square baywindow and with folded hands looked out upon the ghostly shapes of the great peaks snowcovered and moonlit  a thousand revelations of character as well as of manners lay in that short evenings contact with cultivated and thoughtful people it argued much for her ancestry for her own latent powers that she responded with such bewildering readiness to the suggestions which rose like sparks of fire from that radiant hour  she had been made to feel dimly vaguely but multitudinously the fibres and reaches of another worldthe world of art and that indefinable thing which the books call culture and finally in that splendid young quaker she was brought to know a man who could be jocular without being coarse and whose glance was as sincere as it was flattering and alluring  she did not think of him as husband to alice heath who seemed so much older in spirit as in body more like an elder sister than a bride elect and his consideration of her was that of brother rather than the devotion of a lover how far he stood removed from ed winchell and the young fellows of sibley and yet i can understand him she thought he aint funny like mr congdon he dont say queer things and he dont make game of people and he dont orate like judge crego he isnt laughing at us now the way the others are i bet theyre havin a good time over our blunders  she saw marshall haney in a new light also for the first time he seemed like an old man sitting there supine garrulous in the midst of those selfcontained people gosh how he did talk he took too much wine i reckon but that didnt make all the difference in truth his imperiousness his contempt had been melted and charmed away by the genial smiles of his auditors even mrs crego had listened with a show of interest it was as if a lonely old man had at last found companionship  what did all this mean are they interested in him only because hes what they call a desperado did they ask us there to hear him tell stories of his wild life questions of this kind also troubled her  the moon slid behind the mountain range while still the girl sat with pale face and wide dark eyes thinking thinking the wings of her expanding soul fluttering with vague unrest only once in a lifetime can such an experience come to a human being her swift ride to marshall haneys side that summer nightnow so far awaywas momentous but its import was simple compared with the experiences through which she had just passed  she rose at last chilled and stiffened and went to her bed with a sense of foreboding rather than of newfound happiness                                       mart rose late next morning i had a bad night he explained the mixed liquors i tuck got into me wound i guess it woke me twice achin and burnin youre lookin tired yersilf little girl this high life seems to be wearin on the both of us     chapter x  ben fordyce calls on horseback   ben fordyce and his affianced bride rode home talking of the haneys arent they deliciously western she said  mrs haney certainly is a quaint little thing he replied quite soberly shes like a quailso brighteyed and so still i think her devotion to her old husband very beautiful shes more like a daughter than a wife dont you think so  theyre great fun if you dont feel sorry for him as i do alice thoughtfully responded they say he was magnificent as a gambler he admitted to me tonight that he longed to go back to the camp but that he had promised his wife and motherinlaw not to do so i never ran a gamblingsaloon but i can imagine it would be exciting as a play all the time cant you here as he said to me he can only sit in the sun like a lizard on a log it must seem wonderful to herhaving all this money and that big castle of a house dont you think so wasnt she reticent she hardly uttered a word the whole evening some way i feel sorry for them both they cant be happy dont you see that it is plain she doesnt love him as a wife should while he worships her when shes away he is helpless im no gairdner he said pathetically i was raised on the cobblestones i wouldnt know a growin cabbage from a squash so you see he cant pass his time in gardening  bens reply was a question i wonder if she would ride with us  perhaps we would do better not to follow up the acquaintance ben its all very interesting to meet them as we did tonight but they are impossible sociallythat you must admit if there is any possibility of our settling down here i suppose we must be careful to do the right thing from the start  ben was a little irritated by this if im to settle here as a lawyer i cant draw social distinctions of that sort  certainly notas a lawyer of course you ought to know haney but for me to ride or drive with mrs haney is quite a different matter however i dont really care she attracts me and so far as i know is just a nice little uncultivated woman we might call on her in the morning and see if she can go with us it will commit us but really ben i am not going to drag eastern conventions into this fresh big country im willing to risk the haneys  im glad you take that view of it said ben                                       bertha was in the yard when they rode up to the gate next morning dressed in a white sweater and a short skirt and holding biscuits for a handsome collie to snatch from her hand she made a charming picture of young and vigorous life her slim body was as strong and supple as the dogs and her face glowed like a childs haney sitting on the porch was watching her with a proud smile  alice glanced at her lover with admiration in her eyes what a glorious creature she really is  seeing visitors at her gate bertha came down without confusion to say goodmorning and to ask them to dismount  ben with doffed cap replied by saying weve come to ask you to ride with us  bertha looked up at him composedly havent a saddle and i dont know that any of our horses are broken but come again tomorrow and ill have an outfit  theres no time like the present let me ride down to the barn and bring one up volunteered ben  dont need to do that ill phone i didnt really expect you she explained get off and come in a few minutes and ill see what i can hustle together for an outfit i havent rode a lick since i left sibley  ben helped alice to dismount and bertha led her to the house while he tethered the horses  what a superb place you have here exclaimed alice it is one of the best in the city  we bought it for the porch calmly replied the girl the captain likes to sit where he can see the mountains im not entirely done with the outfitting yet but it beats a barn  haney rose as they drew near and smilingly greeted his visitors i should be out gatherin the peanuts and harvestin the eggplants but the dinner last night not mentionin congdons pink liquor kept me awake till two  moral stick to irish whiskeyor scotch laughed ben  i will these strange liquors are not for strong men like ourselves  ben took a seat at his invitation while bertha went in to phone for a horse and to dig up a ridingskirt alice was eager to see the interior of the house but held her curiosity in check by walking about the beautiful garden which ran to the very edge of a deep ravine the trees hid the base of the mountain peaks whose immitigable crags took on added majesty from the play of the delicate nearby branches against their distant rugged slopes  you have a magnificent outlook here captain haney  tis so and i try to be content with it but its hard for one who has roamed the air like a hawk all his life to be content with ridin a wooden horse i couldnt endure it if it werent for me wife  his big form rested in his chair with a ponderous inertness which was a telltale witness to his essential helplessness his left hand still failed to participate in the movements of his right and yet as he showed he could by special effort of will use it im gaining all the timebut slowly he went on i want to make a trip back up to the mines and i think ill be able to do it soon he put aside his own troubles and you miss i hope the climate is doing you good  oh indeed yes she brightly responded i feel stronger every day  ben at the moment experienced a sharp pang of uneasiness and pain for alice was looking particularly worn and thin and yellow and when bertha returned flushed with her haste the contrast between them was quite as distressing as that between the withered dying rose and the opening fragrant bud the young mans heart rose to his throat we have waited too long he thought and resolved to again urge upon her a new treatment which they had discussed  come in and see the house said bertha in brusque invitation it isnt shipshape yet i wanted to do it all myself but i find its a big proposition to go up against it sure is but i like it id like nothing better than running a big hotelnot too big but just big enough i tell the captain that when our mines pinch out ill go to denver and start a hotel  she was quite communicative but not at ease as she led them from room to room her manner was rather that of one seeking to conceal trepidation and her fluency seemed a little out of character  in fact she was trying to make the best possible impression on these people whose sincere interest she felt but with bens eyes fixed upon her so constantly and a knowledge of alices delicate wit to trouble she was more deeply embarrassed than ever before in her life it was not her habit to blush or stammer and she did not do so now but she was carried out of her wonted reticence  as i say we bought the place for the porch i didnt realize what i was being let intoif i had i might have shied were practically lost in the place except when some of the people come down from camp were alone my mother helps out some but shes up at the ranch a good deal she opened the library door and led the way before an easel on which stood a huge canvas heres the picture mr congdon is paintin of the captain i wanted him taken with his hat on but mr congdon said no and his word went i dont know whether i like this or not its got me twisted  congdon had been after psychology rather than costume that was evident at a glance for the clothing counted for little in the portrait out of the shadow the face peered sadly yet with a kind of ferocity tooa look which made alice heath recoil from the man in a certain way the artist had taken advantage of marts helplessness and loneliness he had caught the sadness sullenness and remorselessness of his sitter rather than his gay goodtempered smile the face of this man was concerned with the past not with the future and yet on its surface it was a good likeness as ben said and had both power and distinction i think it a crackerjack piece of work he ended  bertha replied i suppose it is and yet i cant see it id rather it looked the way the captain used to when he came down to the junction im sorry to have his sickness painted in that way  that cant be helped these artists are queer cattle you cant drive em ben remarked  bertha smiled he wants to paint me now not on your life says i youd be doing double stunts with my freckles and i wont stand for it she laughed no sirree i dont let any artist tip my freckles edgewise just to see how flip he is at it i like mr congdon but i dont trust himhes too much of a joker  thereupon she led the way to the second floor and showed them the furniture which was mostly very costly and very bad and at last said the third story is pretty empty yet i dont know just what im going to do with it she was looking at alice i wish youd come over and help me decide some day  what fun cried alice speaking on the impulse id like to very much  you see bertha went on my folks have always been purty poor and ive lived in jay towns all my life and when i came here i didnt know any more about life in a city than a duck does of mining i had it all to learn and theys a whole lot yet that i dont know she smiled quaintly then grew sober and whats worse i havent any one to tell meexcept mr congdon and hes such a josher i dont trust him he did give me a few points on the library which aint so bad we think but all the rest of it i had to dig out myself and its slow work but i guess we better go down my horse will be here in a few minutes then with lowered voice she added i cant stay out but a little while the captain dreads to have me leave him even to go downtown i hadnt ought to go at all  ben began to perceive a real slavery in her life and reassured her im glad youre coming it will do you good and it will be a pleasure to us too well only be away an hour  as they returned to the porch bertha put her hand on haneys shoulder in the manner of one man to another saying im going for a little ride with these people captain if you dont mind  not a whiff he answered ill be here when you come back again a subtle cadence in his voice so belied his smile that alices heart responded to it  berthas horse proved to be a spirited animal but she mounted him with the ease and celerity of a boyriding astride in the mountain fashion i havent a long skirt she carelessly remarked to alice that was all the explanation she offered and ben thought he had never seen anything more alert more graceful than her slim figure poised alertly in the saddle her face glowing her hair blown across her face  alice a timid rider admired them both from her position which was always behind though they tried to accommodate their pace to hers a pang of envy that was almost jealousy pierced her heart as she looked at themso young so vigorous and so blithe  i should be sitting with captain haney on the porch she thought with bitterness i am out of place here  the words which passed between bertha and her cavalier meant little but their glances meant much it was indeed a fateful ride the liking the deep interest born of their first meeting swept irresistibly into admiration their faces turned towards each other youth to youth as naturally as flowers swing towards the light  they fell into argument over saddles over the difference between his manner of riding and her own her speech so direct so full of quaint slang enchanted him and alice soon found herself the third party and when they were for pushing into a gallop she acknowledged herself a clog concealing her disgust of herself under a bright smile she called out why dont you people gallop ahead and let me jog along at my own gait  oh no replied ben we dont want to do that are you tired he became anxious at once  no no please go mrs haney wants to racei can see that and id really like to see her rideshe sits her horse so beautifully  very well ben acquiesced well take a run ahead and come back to you  thereupon they set off bertha leading in a rushing gallop up a fine road which wound along a ravine towards the top of a broad mesa alice with slack rein in her small hand rode slowly on in the vivid sunlight a chill shadow rolling in upon her soul as young as her lover in years she nevertheless seemed at the moment twice his age everything interested him nothing interested her he was never tired mentally or physically and his smooth unwrinkled face still reflected the morning sunlight of the world he is still the boy while i am old and wrinkled and nerveless she bitterly confessed  when they returned to her at the top of the mesa flushed and laughing her pain had deepened into despair up to that moment she had checked disease with a belief that some day she was to recover her health that some day her wrinkles would be smoothed out and her cheeks resume their youthful charm but now she knew herself as she wasa broken thing the divine glow and grace of youth would never again come to her while this vigorous and joyous girl would grow in womanly charm from month to month she is going to be very beautiful she admitted and even in the midst of her own discouragement she could not but admire berthas skill with the horse she rode in the manner of a cowboy holding her hands high and guiding her horse by pulling the reins across his neck ben was receiving lessons from herabsorbed and jocular  at the top of the mesa they all halted to look away over the landscapea graygreen tumbled land out of which fantastic red rocks rose and over which to the west the snowy peaks loomed ben drew a deep breath of joy it seemed that the world had never been so beautiful isnt it magnificent he cried i like this country alice lets make our home here  she smiled a little constrainedly just as you say dear  why shouldnt we when the climate is doing you so much good  the horse that bertha rode was prancing and foaming eager for a renewal of the race and ben seeing it cried out shall we go round by the hanging rock  im willing answered bertha her eyes shining with excitement  alice shook her head i think ill let you young things go your own gait and ill poke along back towards home  ben rode near her searching her face anxiously youre not tiredare you sweetness  no but i would be if i took that big circuit but never mind me i like to poke  very well he answered quite relieved well meet you at the bridge and off they dashed with furious clatter leaving her to slowly retrace her lonely way feeling very tired very old and very sad  bertha was perfectly perilously happy it was almost her first escape from the brooding care and weight of haneys presence she felt as she used to feel when speeding away on swift gallop to the ranch with some companion as carefree as herself since that fateful day when her mother fell ill and marshall haney asked her to marry him she had not been permitted an hours holiday even when absent from her husband her mind carried an inescapable picture of his loneliness and helplessness and no complete relaxation had come with her temporary freedom this day this hour she was suddenly free from care from pain from all uneasiness  she considered this feeling due to the saddle and to the clear air of the morning i will ride every day she declared to ben with shining face as they drew their horses to a walk i dont know when ive enjoyed a ride so much i cant see why i havent been out before i used to ride a good lot lately ive dropped it  well call for you every morning he replied as alice gets stronger we can go up into the cañons and take long rides  ill tell you what well do she said well let her ride in the cart with the captain and take our dinner and well all go up the north cañon some day and eat picnic dinner there  good idea he said accepting her disposition of alice without even mental dissent that will be jolly fun  they planned this and other excursions with no sense of leaving any one behind or of cutting across conventional boundaries their native honesty and innocence of any ill intention prevented even a suspicion of danger and by the time they joined alice at the bridge they were on terms of intimacy and goodfellowship which seemed to rise from years of long acquaintance ben had promised to help her select a horse and she had agreed to bring the captain to call on alice who was staying with some friends not far away  this change in berthas manner extended to alice who returned it in kind the guilelessness which shone from the young wifes clear eyes was unmistakable she was growing handsome too the flush of blood in her cheeks had submerged her freckles and alice began to realize how the poor childs devotion to marshall haney had reacted against her native good health she is but a child even now she thought  haney was sitting on the porch where they had left him the collie at his feet but at sight of them returning he rose and hobbled slowly down the walk his heart filled with tenderness and admiration for his wife he had never ridden with her but he had once seen her mounted and one of his expressed wishes had been that he might be able to sit a saddle once more and ride by her side  come in and stay to dinner he called hospitably and bertha eagerly seconded the invitation  but alice replied im pretty tired i think ill go home you can stay if you like ben  ben smitten with sudden contrition quickly said oh no i will go with you im afraid youve ridden too far  she protested against this for berthas relief not at all its a good tiredness its been great fun  and with promises of another expedition of the same sort they rode away while bertha and haney remained at the gate to examine the new horse  as little mrs haney reentered the house with her husband the day seemed to lose its magical brightness and to decline to a humdrum shadowless flare the house became cold and gloomy and the day empty for the first time since its purchase she mentally asked herself what will i do now it was as if some ruling motive had suddenly been withdrawn from her life  this empty aching spot remained with her all through the day even when she took haney for his drive downtown and only disappeared for a few moments as they met young fordyce on the street it troubled her as she returned to the house and she was glad that williams came in to take supper with them for his talk of the mine diverted her and deeply interested her husband  williams eyed his boss critically youre gainin captain youll soon be able to make camp again  i hope so but the doctor says my hearts affected and it wouldnt be safe for me to go any higherfor a while  williams smiled at bertha better send the missus then the men all have a great idea of her they say shes a kind of mascot mcgonnigle asks me every time what she thinks of our new shaft ive a kind of reverence for her judgment myself they say women kind o feel their way to a conclusion now id like her to pass judgment on our work in the diamond ace  id like to go up said bertha but in truth she was no longer thinking of the mine she was considering how she might make her table look as pretty as mrs congdons her first dissatisfaction with her own way of life filled her mind i must have some of those candles she said to herself while the men were still intent upon the mine her first step towards social conformity was at this moment taken  she felt herself akin to these people and this assertion subconscious and unuttered brought something between marshall haney and herself it was not merely that she was younger and clearer of record but she was perfectly certain that with education she could hold her own with the congdons or any one else if my father had lived i wouldnt be the ignoramus i am today but she had no plan for acquiring the knowledge she needed other than by reading books she resolved to read every day though each hour so spent must be taken from her husband now piteously dependent upon her  he managed his morning paper very well but when she read aloud to him he almost always went to sleep     chapter xi  ben becomes adviser to mrs haney   bertha was astir early the next morning and quite ready to join the fordyces as soon as breakfast was over but they did not come she waited and watched the whole forenoon and when at twelve oclock they had neither called nor sent word her day suddenly sank into nothingness like a collapsed balloon and she faced her tasks with a weakness of will not native to her  haney and williams were both down street discussing some business matter with crego and this left her hours the more empty and unsatisfactory as the dinnerhour drew near she drove to fetch her husband hoping for a glimpse of the fordyces on the way but even this comfort was denied her and she ached with dull pain which she could not analyze  as haney settled himself in the carriage he said well little woman did ye have a good ride  i didnt go she responded with curt emphasis  ye did notwhy not  i had too much to do this was a prevarication which she instantly repented besides they didnt turn up  im sorry i was hoping youd had a good try at the new horse ye must mount him for me to see this afternoon later he said im feeling better each day now soon ill be able to take that trip east do you get ready at your ease  the thought of this trip hitherto so wonderful in its possibilities afforded her no pleasure it scarcely interested her and when another day went by with no further call or word from ben fordyce she began to lose faith in her newfound friends and in herself  they had enough of me she said bitterly im not their style and in this lay her first acknowledgment of moneys inefficiency it cannot buy the friends you really care for  on the third day fordyce called her up on the phone to say that alice had been ill our ride that day was a little too much for her he explained but she will be all right again soon i think we can go again tomorrow  this explanation brought sunshine back into the haney castle and its mistress went about the halls singing softly in the afternoon as she and mart were starting on their constitutional she proposed that they call to see how alice was this haney was glad to do i liked the little woman said he shes sharp as a tack and besides she listened to me gabble he added  miss heath was stopping in the home of a frienda rather handsome house in the midst of thick shrubbery and they found her wrapped in a blanket and sitting on the porch in a steamerchair with ben reading to her they were both instant and cordial in their demands that the captain alight and come in and ben went down the walk to get him while alice with envious wistful eyes answered the glowing girl oh no i dont think the ride did me any harm i have these little backsets now and then im glad you came  how thin her hands are thought bertha and she saw too that the delicate face was wrinkled and withered  reading compassion in the girls glance alice continued brightly ill be up tomorrow im like a corknothing permanently depresses me im suffering just now from an error of thought  bertha only smiled and the gleam of her teeth white and even as rows of corn produced in her face the effect of innocent humor like that of a child then she said ive bought a new horse  have you indeed  yes and ive been expecting you to ride up to the line fence and call me outi wanted to show him to you hes a crackerjack all right  well come over in a day or two i never stay down more than three days  haney lumbering round the corner of the house called out mellowly here you are now dont move a hair he bent and offered a broad white hand how are ye the day  better thank you ben put a chair beside me i want to talk to captain haney he was interrupted the other night in the very middle of one of his best stories and im going to insist on his finishing it  haney faced bertha with a look of humorous amazement on his face think o that now she remembers one of my best  indeed i do captain and i can tell you just where you left off you had just sighted the camp of the robbers  haney clicked with his tongue as if listening to a child there now i must have been taking more grapejuice than was good for me to start on that story for its all about meself and the great man i thought i was in those days  i love to hear about people who can ride a hundred miles in a night and live on roots and berries and capture men who bristle with revolvers please go on ben you neednt listen if you dont want to you can show mrs haney the automobile or the garden  ben laughed i like to hear captain haney talk quite as well as anybody but ill be glad to show mrs haney any of your neighbors things she cares to see  alice turned to bertha i suppose the captains tales are all old songs in your ears  no theyre mostly all new to me the captain never tells stories to me  haney winked she knows me too well she wouldnt believe them  go on please said alice and so haney took up the thread though he protested tis a tale for candlelight he explained  ben was studying bertha with renewed admiration where did she get that exquisite profile he thought  the story was again interrupted by a group of callers among them mrs crego and though alice loyally stood by the haneys and introduced them boldly mrs cregos cold nod and something that went out from the eyes of her companions made bertha suffer and she went away with a feeling of antagonism in her heart did these people consider her beneath their respect  haney remarked as they rode away if black eyes could freeze sure wed be shiverin this minute did ye see mrs crego pucker up when she sighted us  i did and it settled her for me replied bertha  the intimacy thus established between the haneys and the congdon circle furnished the gossip of the upper ten with vital material for discussion mrs crego most decidedly disapproved of their calling and advised alice heath against any further connection with the gamblers wife  what good can it possibly lead to its only curiosity on your part and it isnt right to disturb the girls idealsif she has any  to this alice made no reply but ben stoutly defended the young wife she would have been as good as any of us with the same education the poor little thing has had to work since her childhood and that has cut off all training as for haney he isnt a bad man i suppose he argues that as some one must keep a gamblinghouse it is best to have a good man do it  the sense of being to a degree freed from the ordinary restraints of social life made alice very tolerant but as it chanced they did not go out the next day indeed it was several days before they again rode up to the haney gate they found bertha dressed and ready for them as she had been each morning and when she came out to them her heart was glowing and her face alight  weve come to see the new horse called ben  haney was at the gate with a smile of satisfaction on his face when the horse was brought round there is a steed worth the riding he boasted i told bertie to get the best i would not have her riding a skate like that one the other morning shell keep ye company this day  ben exclaimed with admiration i see you know horsekind captain  i do responded haney and now be off and remember you take dinner with us today  as they moved away he took his customary seat on the porch to wait for their returnpatient in outward seeming but lonely and a little resentful within  bertha suggested a ride up the bear cañon but ben was quick to say that is too far i fear for alice  berthas glance at alice revealed again but in clearer lines the sickness and weariness and the hopelessness of the elder womans face and bens consideration and watchful care of her took something out of the ride the rapture the careless gayety of their first gallop was gone  an impatience rose in the girls soul with the cruelty of youth she unconsciously accused the other resenting the interference with her own plans and pleasures she felt cheated because ben permitted himself no racing no circuits with herand yet outwardly and in reality she was deeply sympathetic she pitied while she accused and resented  their ride was short and unsatisfying but as her guests remained for luncheonbertha was learning to call it thatthe outing ended in a rare delight for while the two invalids sat on the piazza bertha showed ben her garden and stables and the greenhouses she was building and this hour was one of almost perfect peace  ben once outside alices depressing presence grew gay and singleminded in his enjoyment of his hostess and her surroundings  it must seem like aladdin and his wonderful lamp to you he said as they stood watching the workmen putting in the glass to the greenhouses all you have to do is rub it and miracles happen  thats just what it does she answered with gravity i give myself a knock in the head every time i write out a check just to see if i am awake but i can see ill get used to it in time thats the funny thing a feller can get used to anything the trouble with me is i dont know what to do nor how to do it i ought to be learning things i ought to go to school but i cant you see i had to buckle down to work before i finished the highschool and i dont know a thing except running a hotel i wish youd give me a few pointers  ill do what i can but i am afraid my advice wouldnt be very pertinent what can i help you on  well i dont know aliceshe spoke the word with a little hesitationsaid something to me the other day about charity and all that well now im helping mothers churcha littleand im helping up at sibley but i dont know what else to do i suppose i ought to do some good with the money thats rolling in on us ive got my house pretty well stocked and fitted up and im about stumped i cant sit down and just eat and sleep ride and drive can i  there are women who do that and nothing else  well i cant ive always had something to do i like to play as well as the next one but i dont believe i could spend my time here just sitting around  its no small matter to run such a house as this  well theres something in that but the point is whats it all for were alone in it most of the time and it dont seem right another thing most of our old friends fight shy of us now i invite em in and they come but they dont staythey dont seem comfortable they are all walleyed to see the place once but they dont say hello as they used to and the people next door herewell they dont neighbor at all you and the congdons are the only people except a few of mothers church folks who even call now whats the matter  he was now quite as serious as she i suppose your own folks feel that your wealth is a barrier  why should they i treat em just the same as ever im not the kind to go back on my friends because im marshall haneys wife if id earned this money i might put on airs but i haventive just married into it  how did you come to do it he asked quicklyalmost accusingly  her tone again faltered and her eyes fell well it was like this mother was sick and getting old and i was kind o tired and discouraged and the captain was mighty nice and kind to us and then iand so when the word came that he was hurtand wanted mei went here she looked up at him and i did right dont you think so  he was twisting a twig in his fingers oh yes certainly youve been a great comfort to him you saved his life probably and he really is a fine man in spite of he broke off  she took up his phrase in spite of his business i know that was mothers main objection to him but you see he cleaned all out of that before i married him he hasnt touched a card since  he was almost apologetic ive been brought up to despise gamblersim a quaker you know by family but i like captain haney and i can see that from his point of view a straight game as he calls it is not a crime  yes thats one good thing in his favorhe never let a crooked deal pass in his place but after all i cant forget that he was a gambler and other people cant and his record is dead against us here her face was dark as she resumed im a gamblers wife aint that so didnt you hear of me in that way werent you warned against us  his honest eyes quailed a little it is true your husband is called a gambler rather than a miner  well he was thats right but he isnt now im not complaining about the part that cant be helped but i want to do something to show we are in line today and so does the captain we want to make our money count and if you can tell us what to do well be mightily obliged  the young quaker was more profoundly enthralled by this unexpected confession of the girl than by any other word she could have uttered his own knowledge of life was neither wide nor deep and his sense of responsibility not especially keen and yet he experienced a thrill of pleasure and a certain lift of spirit as he stood looking down at herthe attitude of confidential spiritual adviser began at the moment to yield a sweet satisfaction as well as an agreeable realization of power how much haneys mines were pouring forth he did not know but their wealth was said to be enormous every day added to the potentiality of this grayeyed girl who stood so trustfully so like a pupil before him  he spoke with emotion ill do what i can to advise you and help you and so will alice allen crego is a good manhe has your legal business i believe  yes i think hes square and i like him but i cant go to mrs crego she despises usthats one good reason she smiled faintly but it aint legal advice i wantits something else i dont know what it is our minister isnt the man either i guess i want somebody that knows life and that aint either a lawyer or a minister i want some one to take our affairs in hand i need all kinds of advice wont you give it to me  he smiled id like to help but i am only a lawyerand a very young one at that  i dont think of you as a lawyer youre more than that to us  what am i then  the color danced along her cheek as she uttered a phrase so current in the west that it has a certain humorous sound youre a gentleman and a scholar  thank you but i fear you mean by that that i take life very easily  she grew serious again no i dont anybody can see youre honest i trust you more than i do judge crego and so does the captain you can tell us things we want to know we both know a little about business but we dont know much about other things thats where we both fall down  this frank expression of regard brought about a moment of emotional tension and ben hesitated before replying at last he said i hope i shall always deserve your confidence i wish i had the wisdom you credit me with i wonder what i can tell you  tell me what you would do if you were in my place  quick as a sunbeam his smile flashed out be your own good joyous self whatever you do dont lose what you are nowthe quality which attracted alice and me to you dont try to be like other rich people  the sight of the captain and alice walking slowly towards them cut short the further admission of his own careless inexperience and they all took seats beneath a big peartree which shaded a semicircular wire settee  haney had been confessing a little of his loneliness i will not believe that me work in the world is done tis true i took very little care of me good days but i was happy in me business such as it was me little wife there saves me from the blue divils when shes about but when im alone sure its deep in the dumps i go sometimes me mind misgives me to think of her tied to an old stump of a tree like me but maybe shes rightmaybe im to recover me powers and be of use  to this alice could only reply as comfortingly as she could youve given her a good deal captain  so i have but i mean to give more as soon as im able to travel were going down the hill to see the world sometimes when we sit on our porch and talk of it it seems as if i could see the whole of the states spread out before uschicago washington new york and all to choose from i cant get over the surprise of having the stream of money keep comin i used to work hardyou may not believe that but twas so i used to have long days and nights of watching twas work of a kind though you may not admire the kind and now i have nothing to do but sit and twist me two thumbsand one of them bogspavined at that  to this alice had made no reply for they were within earshot of ben and bertha haney called out sure it must be near dinnertime bertiei mean luncheon maamim lately instructed  they all laughed in tune to his humor and bertha replied no more twelveoclock dinners for us captain  haney groaned this fashionable life will be the death of me sure i eat and talk by rule aready where it will end i dunno  happily the bell soon relieved the strain but the talk at the table continued to be very personalit could not be prevented for each of these four people was at a turningpoint in his or her life haney feeling the slow tide of returning vigor in his limbs was in trouble thinking of what he was to do bertha just beginning to tremble beneath the mysterious stir of an alldemanding love was uneasy feverish and selfconscious alice sensing the approach of weakness and decay yet struggling against it was inwardly in despair while ben hitherto careless facing life with unwrinkled brow was appreciating for the first time the positive responsibilities of manhood berthas expressed wish to employ his best judgment exalted him while it troubled him  for a time the burden of the conversation was his haney was in a reflective mood and bertha busied with the table service which she was trying to raise to the level of her honored guests was distracted alice tired and a little dispirited added nothing to the youthful spirit of the meal  at last just when the conversation seemed about to flag out haney lifting his head began in a new tone mr fordyce my little girl and i have decided we want you to take cregos place as our lawyer i hope youll be able to do it  alice looked up in surprise but you dont mean to take it from mr crego  haneys face grew hard i am under no obligation to crego and i prefer to have as me lawyer a man who can neighbor with me and whose wife is not above nodding when me own wife passes by  alice hastened to defend the cregos you mustnt be unjust to mrs crego  im not said haney nor to crego either ive paid for his time and paid wellas im willing to pay for yours he turned to ben i need advice and i want to feel free to go for it  ben replied id like to accept your business captain but you see it would not be professional for me to profit at the expense of my friend and besides i havent really settled here yet  haney looked disappointed i thought ye had well i am going to cut loose from crego anyhow and i shall tell him why  bertha cried out no dont do that  he acquiesced very well then i wont tell him why but im going to quit him so if you dont care to take on me business ill give it to jim beringer it pays a good bit of money and will pay more ill make it profitable to ye  alice looked at ben of course if he is going to leave mr crego anyway  but that would mean making our permanent home here and setting up an office  well why not i cant live in the east any more that we have tested i am willing to decide now it would give you a start here and besides i think you can be of use to the captain  ben still hesitated it seems rather treacherous to crego some way but if you have definitely decided against him  we have said bertha we talked it all over yesterday we want you  haneys face was very grave now there is one thing more mr fordyce mart haneys reputation must be taken into account it wont do you anny good to be associated with him i dont know that it will do you anny harm but im dom sure it will do you no good to be associated with me  alice interposed quickly a lawyer cant choose his clientsat least a young lawyer cant  haney ignored the implications of her speech im not tryin to cover up me tracks said he i was a gambler for thirty years me whole life has been a game of chance there are many who think gambling one of the high crimes an misdemeanors but i think a square game between men is defensible i am a gambler by nature why shouldnt i be i grew up a fat squab of a boy rollin about on the pavinstones of troy twas all luck bedad whether i lived or died i lived it fell out and when i had learned to read i read wildwest stories of course that led me to go west and jine the indians and by stealin rides and beggin me bread i reached dodge city twas all chance that i didnt die on the way me mother poor soul was worried and i knew it and finally i put me fist to it and wrote her a letter to say i was all right she wrote beggin me to return which i did a couple of years later but troy was too slow for me then and again i pulled out i was always takin risks danger was me delight i had no trade but i had faith in me luck i woni almost always won and so i came to be a gambler along with bein sheriff and city marshal and the like o that in one mountain town or another but i always played fair a man who plays a square game is a gambler the man who deals underhand is a crook im no crook i love the game to know that the cards are stacked against the other player takes all the fun out of the deck for me i want the other felly to have an equal chance with meelse tis no game but a holdup no man ever rightfully accused me of dealing against him yes tis true me world is a world of risk he looked at alice sure the lookout up aboveif there is suchis there to see that we all have a show for our ace if anything interferes with that the game is a crooked one  alice began to perceive something big and admirable in this mans spirit she was not of his faithquite the contrary she was a fatalist nothing happened in her world but she was imaginative enough to understand his point of view  haney went on i know all the tricks i lairned them not to use in the game but to keep them out of the game i had too much faith in me luck to ever weaken  did you never lose asked ben  many the time indeed but only for a short streak take this mine for instance a man comes into me house full of confidence in himself plays and goes broke the fury of the game bein in him he says ill put me prospect hole against five hundred dollars roll the wheel says i and i won his hole in the ground twas me luck that prospect turned out a mine twas his luck to lose he was a fullgrown man he knew the game and went into it with his eyes open truth was he considered the mine a dead horse and was hopin to take a fall out o me me little girl here is disturbed about the way the mine came to us but she neednt be twas all in the game im sayin twas in the game that another crazy fool should blow me to piecesi dont complain i take me chances nowhere he faced ben and his grave tone lightenedas i understand it youre not a rich man  ben flushed a little no i havent earned much so far but its up to me to get busy  and ye expect to marry soon  this question sent a thrill to the heart of each of the three young people listeninga thrill of fear of doubt and ben said slowly perceiving haneys fatherly goodwill yes we expect to set up housekeeping as the oldfashioned people say as soon as alice is a little stronger  very well then haney went on like one who has made his point heres your chance your fee with me will pay your coal bills anyway were likely to take a good dale of your time but youll lose nothing by that  bertha with big yearning eyes fixed upon bens face waited in a quiver of hope as he replied of course captain haney i cant subscribe to your defense of gambling and if you were still a gambler in the strict sense of the word i couldnt accept this position for it is something more than legal but as you have given up all connection with cards and liquor selling i see no reason why i should not accept your offerprovided i can be of service in the manner you expect he looked across the table at bertha and reading there the same entreaty which she had expressed in the garden he added firmly and definitely yes i will accept and be very much obliged to you  haney extended his hand and they silently clasped palms in the compact  they parted in a glow of mutual confidence and liking and alices voice quivered as she thanked their host i think it very fine of you captain haney this may be the means of establishing mr fordyce in business here  his eyes twinkled in reply i will do all i can to help him for he takes me eye  bens last glance and the pressure of his hand left in berthas brain a glow which remained with her all the rest of the day and she carolled like a robin as she trod her swift way about the house  the next morning as they sat at breakfast mart briskly said well little woman ive decided now that i have a man i can trust with me business to make the trip east as soon as he has the mines in hand well start can you be ready to go monday week  sure thing she answered quickly but even as she spoke a nameless pang that was neither joy nor exultation shot through her heart for the first time she realized that she had lost her keen desire to explore the glittering plain which lay below her feet a fairer world a perfectly satisfying world was opening before her in the high country which was her home     chapter xii  alice heath has a vision   this change of legal adviser while very important to ben fordyce and the haneys did not seem to trouble allen crego very much as a matter of fact he was about to run for congress and had all the business he could attend to anyway he liked the young quaker and responded all right in the frank western fashion sending the haneys away quite as solidly friendly as before to ben he was most cordial im glad youre going to settle here and im specially glad youve got a retainer for the field is overcrowded and it may take a long time for you to get a place we old fellows who came down along with the pioneers have an immense advantage i wish you every success and he meant it  only when he got home to mrs crego did he come to realize what a horrible injury he had permitted a young and inexperienced eastern boy to do himself this connection will ostracize them both his wife said  he answered a little wearily oh now my dear i think you take your social medes and persians too seriously we lawyers cant afford to inquire into the private affairs of our clients too closelyespecially if they are derived from the pioneer west ben fordyce doesnt become responsible for haneys past it is a business and not a social arrangement  thats like a man she responded they never see anything till it bumps their noses theyve both called on the haneys and gone riding with themor with the girl theyve even eaten luncheon there  how dreadful mrs crego you shock me  if any evil comes of thisand there will be sorrow in ityoull be morally responsible in the old days it didnt matter but now nobody who is anybody in this town can associate with people like the haneys and not be hurt by it  the judge ceased to smile now let this end the discussion fordyce has sense enough to take care of himself hes just the man for haneyhe has time good nature and splendid connections i am glad to be rid of the business and i am delighted to think this young fellow has pleased haney  it isnt haney dont you see its that girl she has urged itim perfectly sure  stop right there he commanded sharply i dont want to hear a word of your insinuations im tired of them im ashamed of you and he took up his paper and walked away from her  she was defeated at the moment but hurried to the congdons with her news lee looked quite serious enough i dont believe i like that either what do you think frank  all depends on ben if he makes it a business deal and keeps it so all right if he dont it may go against him in the town as helen says  dont you think youd better go see him and have a talk  nixie he answered in swift negation little willie dont want to tackle that delicate job im subtle but not so subtle as that alice heath knows all we know and more and you can bet theyve talked the whole thing over  but they may not realize the position of the haneys  they may not but i suspect they think they can carry any connection they choose to make and i mostly think they canten generations of quaker ancestry  but the people there dont know their ancestry  well go talk to them i abdicate besides i like the haneys  mrs crego now laid her joker on the table heres the point that girl is taken with benits all her plan  congdon started sh dont say that out loud nell that little wife is true as steel  i dont care my prophetic soul  lee put in prophetic pollywogs why helen the girl is as simple and straightforward as a boy of twelve  she seems that way but i could see she was wonderfully attracted by ben and his singing that night here  that may be so was i anyhow i agree with frank it would be cruel to say such a thingeven if it were so which i dont for an instant believe at the same time i admit the connection will make talk and may create a prejudice maybe wed better see ben she looked at her husband  he waved a protesting finger before his face not on your life ben and i are friends i like him immenselytoo much to think of running such a frightful risk of offending him if you interfere you do so at your own peril  lee finally acquiesced in his judgment and mrs crego went home more deeply troubled than her acquaintance with alice heath would seem to warrant helens an estimable person said frank congdon and on the whole i like her but i wish she didnt take quite so much evil for granted  so as no one warned ben fordyce he went gayly forward and hired a couple of nice rooms in a sightly block and hung out a gilded sign i am a citizen of colorado now he said to the captain and bertha the first time they called at his office  alice was there and they were deep in discussion of the merits of a pile of new rugs which were to match the wallpaper ben stoutly stood for the oxblood and she for the old gold ben explained the entire extravagance of this office is due to her he pointed an accusing finger at alice who nodded shamelessly i was all for secondhand stuff both for economys sake and to show id been in practice a long time  youd need a battered secondhand set of whiskers to match she replied and they all laughed at the notion no captain being sure ben couldnt deceive anybody as to his age and experience i argued for signs of prosperity newborn success has its weight you know  sure it has  people like silken rugs and mahogany furniture even in the west  they do haney agreed  bertha standing silently by was vaguely resenting alices presence this feeling was not defined but it was strong enough to darken her face and take the sparkle out of her eyes she would have liked to do this work of fitting up his rooms and he on his part saw that she was in sombre mood and sought opportunity to come to where she stood im being congratulated on all sides for becoming a citizen of colorado its quite like being initiated into some new club in an eastern town theyd let me jolly well alone im going to like it immensely i know and its really due to you  she found words difficult at the moment his face and voice dazzled her like an open door towards sunshine and after a moments pause she looked round the room saying its going to be fine  i want it comfy so that you and the captain will feel like coming down often we have a great deal to talk over before i shall really have a full understanding of your affairs im going to bone into my books hard he added boyishly to tell the truth ive taken life pretty easy you see my father left me a regular income big enough to support me while i was studying law but not enough to marry on she couldnt have told why but this subject troubled her and confused her she turned away again as he continued alice has a little not much in her own right and so it is really up to me to settle down and get to work please dont think you are taking the time of a rich and busy man like crego i am very grateful to you it will enable us to plan a home here in the west  again that keen pang went through her heart and he looking towards alice so worn and drooping was touched with dismay almost fear  she was talking to the captain but was furtively watching bertie and ben how erect and radiant and happy they are she thought and a doubt of the girl came into her mind she is so untrained and so young and in this mental exclamation she put her first fear that ben might find his position as legal adviser complicated by the admiration of the captains wife  something weirdly intuitive had come to alice heath in these later years as her health declined and her flesh purified she had come to possess uncanny powers of vision and at times seemed to read the very innermost thoughts of those about her the loss of her beauty which had been exquisite as that of a rose had made her morbidwhich she knew and struggled against she forecast the future and this is disquieting to any one here at this moment she often said to herself my world is flooded with sunshinea static world in appearance but how will it be ten years from now the clock ticks the sun passes the universal sway of death extends with the same acuteness with which she read other minds she read her own but knowing that such imaginings were unnatural and distressing she fought against them yet they came in spite of herself and the picture of bertha standing there beside ben filled her with a prophetic vision of what the girlwife was to become she will grow in grace and in dignity in understanding shes of good stock shes like a man in her power to raise herself above lowly conditions why are there not female lincolns there are and she is one of them nearly all our great men were born and reared under conditions ruder than those which surrounded this girl why cant she rise she will riseand then  she did not pursue the clew further for the captain was speaking and you miss can be of just as great service to me wife shes alone with me here in this town and im a heavy load for her to carry i am so now that her house is in order the days are long the people shed like to know dont drop in and i suspect its because shes mart haneys wife  she resumed her sprightly manner oh no im afraid if she were a poor girl shed find these same people still more indifferent  true miss but would they act the same if she were mart haneys widow  she flashed a deeppiercing wondering glance at him ah that would be different and yet she hastened to say that would not make her acceptable to the really best people  what would miss he asked simply im a rough man and ive led a rough life i begin to see things now that i never saw before what would give bertha standing among the people you speak of  education character by character i mean she must be a personality  that she is he was emphatic in this  she certainly is a fascinating girl and she promises to be a still more interesting woman  im not a woodenhead miss as a gambler it was me business to read mens faces i see more than my little girl gives me credit for i think i know why mrs crego cant see us as we pass by and i was wise to them friends of yours the other day when they curled their tails and showed their teeth at sight of us its because bertie is the wife of a gambler isnt that so now  she rose with a start for bertha was coming towards them hush dont talk about it any moreat present and at this moment there passed before her eyes a vision of this big man crushed and writhing on a mountainside among deep green ferns it lasted but an instant like the memory of an event in childhood a spot transient as a shadowdisconnected without precursor or sequence like a cloud over the wheat it gloomed a moment and was gone and she gave herself up to the influence of the sunny room and bens joyous plans  this vision came back to her when she was alone in her own room an hour later and stayed with her persistently what did it mean did it presage an accident to him or had it arisen from a vague knowledge of the cause of his wounding  this singular and distressing rule governed her dreams of the future they were all of sorrow death physical calamities never or very rarely of health and happiness therefore she seldom spoke of them sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof her father was wont to say and she had come to the same conclusion besides her faith in her predictive dreams was by no means fixed she had reached but one comforting conclusion and that was negative if no vision came to reveal the future of any friend she rested secure in the belief that he or she at least was to be free of disaster it was a sweet and comforting fact to remember that no vision of bens future had ever entered her consciousness she did not even dream of him and this was still more wonderful for she had always understood that those we love are ever in our thoughts in slumber  for some reason the day had been most wearing and to dress for dinner was an effort but she made herself as lovely as she could for bens sakeand for the sake of the congdons with whom they were to dine we are to be alone lee had phoned for i want to talk with you like a dutch aunt  alice knew as well as if lee had spoken it what was coming they were going to protest against bens intimacy with the haneys and as soon as they were in their carriage she warned ben you want to be on your guard tonight the congdons are going to advise you against accepting this retainer from captain haney  he was too happy to do more than jokingly reply too late bribe is in hand and money mostly spent what i want to ask you is more important when are we to start our love in a cottage idyl it really looks possible now isnt it beautiful to think we can really keep house out here and pay our way  oh benthere was a wail in her voicei dont seem to gain as i should im completely tired out tonight  he was all concern instantly and putting his arm about her tenderly exclaimed dear heart it was my fault you shouldnt have gone down at all  but dont you see how revealing it is if i cant go down to your office to superintend the arrangement of a few rugs and chairs how can i keep a houseyour housein order no dear boy we mustnt think of itnot now perhaps by spring but certainly not now  he was both saddened and perplexed and yet his disappointment was not so keen as it had been when she had put off their weddingday the first time and when she turned a white despairing face up to him saying wildly oh benny why dont you give me up and marry some nice young girl he only took her in his arms and shut her lips with a kiss  no more such talk he said youre tired and a little morbid lees lecture will do you good i hope she gets after you for letting yourself down into these detestable moods  signs of their troubled ride were on their faces as they entered the congdon sittingroom which also served as hall and lee put her arm about her guest with compassion uppermost in her heart you dont look a bit well tonight what have you been doing  nothing thats the worst of it if id been scrubbing floors or cleaning silver id feel that i had a right to be tired but ive only been down to bens new office overseeing the laying of three rugs i didnt lift a hand and now look at me  when they were in the privacy of lees dressingroom the hostess studied her guest critically youve something on your mind she announced  i always have something on my mind  i know you do and if youre ever going to get well you must get it off your mind do i know what it is  if you dont you ought to since this retainer from captain haney ben is urging an immediate marriage  lee congdon was an unconquerable realist and truthteller and she could not at the moment utter any other than a divergent word we got you here tonight to talk over that haney business we dont entirely like it at least i dont frank has no responsibility never had haney is not a bad man and she isnt a bit low or common but folks think she is and its going to hurt you both im afraid to have anything to do socially with them  oh socially alice cried in disgust i thought we were coming to the big and boundless west where such things dont count  you have and you havent the springs is a little of the west a little of england and a good deal of the east its a foolish town in some ways and i warn you lots of nice people will find it inconvenient to call on you for fear of meeting mrs haney  oh rats  absurd isnt it im glad you put on that dress you dont look tired now your cheeks are blazing  with wrathnot health  at me  oh no at these people who assume to dictate whom we shall know  they dont do that dear they only think youre paying too much for bens new office but come down to dinner well fight this out later  congdon was outspoken in his admiration by the lord the climate is getting in its work why alice youre radiant youre ten years younger tonight  thats because im angry  what about  your townspeople lee has made me feel as if i were the clubbar topic tonight  congdon became solemngrim as a brazen image mrs congdon youve been making some of your tactful remarks  i have not ive been talking straight from the shoulder as i advise you to do  he capitulated after the turkey come on ben were in for a lecture by the professordoctor lee congdon  under the influence of his humor they took seats about the pretty candlelit table as gay a group as the city heldapparently for alice was of that temperament which responds quickly and buoyantly to humor and frank congdon never took anything quite seriouslyexcept his portraitpainting he could do a cakewalk with any one but he would not discuss art with the unsympathetic he always had a new story to tell of his amazing experience something was always happening to him other men come and go up and down the whole earth without an adventure but no sooner does frank congdon slip out of the door than the fatesgenerally the humorous onespounce upon him drunken women claim him for a son sheriffs arrest him in the mountains and transport him long distances only to find him the wrong man confused swedish mothers give him babies to hold in the cars and rush out just in time to get left and these tales lose nothing in his recount of them  in the present instance he took up half the dinnerhour with a description of his latest mishap a neighbors cook had suddenly gone mad and had charged him with putting a spell over her somebody calls me up on the phone this morning is this frank congdon yes  hello frank this is henry what you been doing to my cook  what does she say i have  says youve hypnotized herput a spell over her  i pass  fact shes crazy as a bedbug and we cant do a thing with herand she was such a good girl how could you frank  i never saw the creature in my life  well youll see her now youre to come right over and remove this spell or we wont have any breakfast here congdon looked solemnly round at his guests now wouldnt that convulse a body i didnt know her name on my word i couldnt remember how she looked but my curiosity was roused and over i toddled it was all true karen was in the kitchen armed with the jigsaw breadknife and calling for me henry was all for my appearing suddenly at the door à la svengali and with a majestic wave of the hand lift the cloud from her brain not on your tintype says i i guess this is a case for the police if i put this spell on that hellcat it must have been by absent treatment during sleep and its me to my studio again  no you dont said henry you stay till this incubus is cleared away it aint reasonable to suppose that an ignorant maid like this is going to charge a complete stranger with a crime of this kind unless  thats what i say it isnt reasonable i refuse to believe it just then something seemed to break loose in the back part of the house washboilers seemed to be falling on the kitchen range and wild yells made mrs henry turn pale  thats your work monster shrieked henry  is it i said my opinion is shes broke into your winecellar its you to the police  go calm her come its a fine chance to experiment  so it iswith a cannon do you mean to tell me seriously that she thinks ive hypnotized her  then he got down to business and assured me that he was telling the truth this interested me and i thought id chance opening the doorparticularly as everything was quiet inside  his company was very tense now so vividly had he set the whole scene before them i opened the door and found her standing at the far side of the room her hair in ropes and her eyes wild she was bughouse all right karen i said in my most hypnotic voice i lift the spell you are free go back to work  what happened asked alice breathless with excitement  his face was grave and his voice sad not a thing my svengali pass didnt work i was as the idle wind to her therefore i withdrew and phoned the police  what an extraordinary thing said ben  mrs congdon brightly answered it would be for any one else but im so used to that now i dont mind whenever the telephone bell rings i expect to hear that frank is sued for breach of promise or arrested for burglary or some little thing like that if he were only a novelist hed make our everlasting fortune but i know why he started this storyhe wants to head off my talk with you about the haneys and i dont intend to let him do it have you taken on haneys legal business  yes  for good and all  yes hes advanced me part of my fee and ive spent it for desks rugs and office rent i think i may say the offer is accepted  im sorry she said simply  her husband objected i dont see why haney is a man of large means his mines are paying hugely and he needs some one to look after the investment side of his income and to keep tab on the output of the mines and to be ready to settle any legal points that may come up bens just the boy to do this  lee was firm thats one side of it but these young people should not start in wrong haneys past is said to be criminal and mrs haney is called low  congdon hotly interrupted who says so its a lie  thats the talk over town it was all right for crego to transact their business for he is an old and wellknown lawyer here but its different with ben who is just starting  ben laughed yes it is different crego didnt need the job and i do  how bad do you need it she asked  well it makes it possible for us to marry at once and settle here he looked at alice with a renewal of the admiration he had felt for her in the days of their dancing feet she shrank from his gaze and mrs congdon perceived it  youre not so poor as all that she stated rather than asked  i dont suppose were likely to need bread of a sort but i dont feel able to buy or rent and keep houseor i didnt till haney made this offer  how did he come to make it  his fair skin flushed at her question for he couldnt quite bring himself to tell the whole truth he knew the decision came from bertha and at the moment and for the first time he saw how it might be misconstrued he evaded her modesty forbids but i suppose it must come out it is all due to my openfaced waterbury countenance he thinks i am at once able and honest  there you have it lee haney knows a good thing when he sees it  mrs congdon putting the rest of her lecture aside for future use said well if its all settled then ive no more to say probably im too fussy about what the town thinks anyway  precisely my contention mrs congdon replied her husband  she was audaciously frank and truthseeking but she could not say to any one but her husband that little mrs haney expanding into a dangerously attractive woman was already in love with ben fordyce there are limits to advice after all she said to frank when they were alone  im glad you recognize the limit in this case he replied but i dont intend to worry ben is all right and the girl has got to have her tragedy sooner or later if it isnt ben it will be somebody else a wonder it wasnt with me  oh i dont know she laughed i feel very secure about you  am i such a bad shape he asked with comical inflection     chapter xiii  berthas yellow cart   ben found his office a most cheerful and pleasant resortjust what he needed and each morning as soon as his breakfast was eaten he went to his desk to write to read his morning paper and to glance at the law journals he called this studying about eleven oclock the haneys regularly drove down and they went over some paper or some proposal for investment or williams came in with a report of the mines this filled in the time till lunch not infrequently he got into the carriage and they rode up to get alice to fill out the table in the afternoon they sometimes went out to the mesas and it was this almost daily habit of driving and lunching with the haneys which infuriated mrs crego who really loved alice and troubled lee congdon who was as she said frankly in love with ben gossips were already discussing the outcome of it all  just such a situation as that has produced a murderess said mrs crego to the judge one night but he only shook his paper and scowled under its cover refusing to say one word further concerning the haneys  alice studying ben with those uncanny eyes of hers saw him slowly yielding to the charm of berthas personality which was maturing rapidly under the influence of her love she was as silent as ever but her manner was less boyish the swell of her bosom the glow that came into her face had their counterparts in the unconsciously acquired feminine grace of her bearing she was giving up many of the phrases which jarred on polite ears and she did this naturally by reason of her association with alice she saw and took on many of the little niceties of the older womans way of eating and drinking  at lee congdons suggestion she abandoned the crosssaddle it required a great deal of character to give up the free and natural way of riding the way in which all women rode until these latter days and to assume the helpless cramped and twisted position the sidesaddle demands but she did it in the feeling that ben liked her better for the change and he did she could see approval in his eyes when she rode out for the first time in conventional ridingskirt looking very slim and strong and graceful i cant stand for the hard hat she confessed ill wear a cap or a sombrero but no skillet for me  these were perfect days for the girlwife under these genial suns with such companionship such daily food she rushed towards maturity like some halfwild colt brought suddenly from the sere range into abundant and peaceful pasture the physical side of her being rounded out glowing with the fires of youth at the same time that the poor old captain sank slowly but surely into inactivity and feebleness she did not perceive his decline for he talked bravely of his future and called her attention to his increasing weight which was indeed a sign of his growing inertness  and so the months passed with no one of the little group but alice suffering for mart had attained a kind of resignation to his condition he still talked of going up to the camp but the doctor and bertha persuaded him to wait and so he endured as patiently as he could and if he suffered gave little direct sign of it  alice fully alive now to the gossip of the town thanks to mrs crego found herself helpless in the matter she believed the young people to beas they wereinnocent of all disloyalty and she could not assume the rôle of the jealous woman she was frightened at thought of the suffering before them all and it was in this fear that she said to ben one day boy youre giving up a deal of time to the haneys  he answered promptly they pay me for it  i know they do but dearest you ought to take more time to studyto prepare yourself for other clientswhen they come  he laughed theyre not likely to come right away and besides i do get in an hour or two every day  but you ought to study six hours every day arent the traditions of lincoln and daniel webster all to that effect work all day with the ax and study in the light of pine knots all night  he took her words as lightly as they were spoken something like that but im no daniel webster im not sure i want to go in for criminal law at all  she spoke sharply you mustnt think of getting your fees too easy ben i dont think any good lawyer wins without work do you  i didnt mean that he hastened to say you do me an injustice i really read more than you think and my memory is tenacious you know besides i cant refuse to give the haneys the most of my time for they are my only clients and the captain is most generous  the mornings ought to be enough she hazarded  i know what you mean i do go out with them afternoons a good deal but i consider that a part of my duty they are so helpless socially youve always felt that yourself  i feel it now bennie boy but we mustnt neglect all friends for them other people dont know that you do this as a matter of business and of course you cant tell any one for if the haneys heard of it they would be cut to the heart do they put it on a business basis  they never mention it bertha isnt given to talking subtleties as you know and the captain takes it all as it comes these days  it hurt her to hear him speak of mrs haney in that offhand habitual way and she foretold further misconception on the part of mrs crego in case he should forgetas he was likely to doand allude to bertha in her presence but how could she tell him not to do that she merely said i like mrs haney and i feel sorry for heri mean im sorry she cant have a place in the town to which she is really entitled she is improving very rapidly  isnt she he cried out that little thing is reading right through the town librarya book every other day she tells me  novels i fear  no thats the remarkable thing shes reading history and biography isnt it too bad she couldnt have had bryn mawr or vassar ive advised her to have in some one of the university people to coach her ive suggested miss franklin i wish youd uphold me in it  he had never told alice of the talk in the garden that day nor of the look in berthas eyes which decided him to assume the position of mentor as well as legal adviser and he did not now intimate more than a casual supervision of her reading as a matter of fact he was directing her daily life as absolutely as a husbandmore absolutely in fact for she obeyed his slightest wish or most minute suggestion he withheld these facts from alice not from any perceived disloyalty to her but from his feeling that his advice to bertha was paid for and professional and therefore not to be spread wide before any one he did not conceal anything he merely outlined without filling in the bare suggestion  he not merely gave his fair client lists of books he talked with her upon them and so far as he was able spoke seriously and conscientiously about them she seized upon his suggestion and got miss franklin one of the teachers of the schools to come in now and again of an evening to help her and being fond of music she bought a piano and began to take lessons all of which lee congdon would have said threatened to render her commonplace and uninteresting but alice heath felt quite differently about that  no the more that girl gets the more shell have lee as ben says shes the kind that if she were a boy would turn out a big selfmade man thats a little twisted as to grammar but you see what i mean sex is one of the ultimate mysteries isnt it now why didnt i inherit my fathers ability  you did only you never use it but this girl hasnt your father to draw from  no but her father was an educated mana civil engineer she tells me who came out here for one of the big railroads he was something of an inventor too thats the reason he died poorthey nearly all do  but the mother  well shes weak and tiresome now but shes by no means common shes broken by hard work but shes naturally refined no the girl isnt so bad its the frightful girlhood she endured in that little hotel i think its wonderful that she could associate with the people she didbarbers and railway hands and all thatand be what she is today if she had married a man like young bennett for example she would have gone far  she cant go far with haney chained to her wrist said the blunt mrs congdon  but think what will happen when she is his widow  and his legatee  precisely  shell cut a wide swath shes going to be handsome  they had reached a dangerpoint for lee was on the verge of saying something about bens infatuation but she didnt and alice knew why she didnt for she asked rather abruptly wont you come over thursday night im going to take the haneys to dinner at the hotel she flushed under lees gaze its really bennies party and im going to make it as pretty as i can  alice i dont understand you why do you do this  because i must she and the captain are going east on a visit and ben wants to give them a jolly sendoff as he calls it besides i like the girl  lee mused in silence for a few moments i guess youre right of course ill come who else will  several of bens new friends and the cregos  not the missus  yes she comes because shes consumed with curiosity oh it really promises to be smart  congdon came in just in time to hear these words who promises to be smartmrs haney  the women laughed another person going about with a mind full of mrs haney  well why not i just passed her on the street in her new dogcart and she was ripping good to look at say that girl is too swift for this town you people better keep close to her if you want to know whats doing in gowns and cloaks did you ever see such development in your life say girls i always believed in clothes but my eyes i didnt think cotton and wool and leather could make such a change who is putting her on  the cart is a new development said alice i hope it wasnt yellow  well it was  the captain was in it  not on your life the captain was at home in the easychair by the fire  the women looked at each other then lee said the beginning of the end poor old captain  congdon was loyalty itself now dont you jump at conclusions yes she pulled up and i went out to see her she gave me her hand in the old way and said isnt this a joke the captain ordered it from chicago he saw a picture in one of my magazines of a girl driving one of these things and here i am you dont think theyll charge me a special license do you oh shes all right dont you worry about her then she said what i dont like about it is the captain cant ride in it im not going to keep it she said  that was for effect remarked lee  dont be nasty mrs congdon you cant look into her big serious eyes and say such things  lee looked at alice oh well if it comes down to big serious eyes then all criticism is valueless arent men curious character is nothing intellect is nothingits all a question of whether were goodlookin or not sometimes im discouraged an artist husband is so hard to please  i didnt use to be dovey he replied with a mischievous gleam  he means when he took me im used to his slurs just think alice i accepted this man fresh from paris with all his sins of omission and commission upon him and now he reviles me to my teeth she patted the hand he slipped round her neck tell us more about mrs haney how was she dressed  in perfect good tastealmost too good she looked like one of joe meyers early posters gee but she was snappy in drawing she carries that sort of thing wellshes so clean and nifty in line if she could have a year in pariswowwell us to fifth avenue sure thing  all depends on what is at the bottom of that girls soul retorted lee sententiously a light woman with money is a flighty combination i dont pretend to say what your little mrs haney is at bottom thus far i like her i talk about her freely but i defend her in public but at the same time fifty thousand dollars a year is a corrupting power  congdon gravely assented to this youre perfectly right thats the reason i keep our income down to fifteen hundred id hate to see you look like a readymade cloak advertisement  alice rose rather wearily thursday night you said  yes and i guess following the latest bulletin concerning mr haney we better put on our swellest ginghams  alice on her way home continued to think of mrs haney indeed she was seldom out of her mind and she had a feeling of having known her for a long timesince girlhood and yet less than a year had passed since that dinner at lee congdons spring was coming the hint of it was in the sweet air and in the clear piping of a prairie lark in a vacant lot spring and how long it had been since ben had referred to their marriage perhaps he took it for granted perhaps he sees in me only failing health and dares not speak  she was not gaining that she knew and so did lee she had stayed too long in the raw climate of her native city he must not marry me she despairingly cried i must not let him ruin his life in that way and she sank back in the corner of her carriage with wrinkled pallid face and quivering lips for bertha was passing up the avenue driving a smartstepping cob in her cart and in the seat beside her as radiant as herself sat ben fordyce     chapter xiv  the jolly sendoff   the mrs haney who came to alice heaths dinner at the antlers was in outward seeming an entirely different person from the constrained young wife who stepped into lee congdons home that night of her first dinner she was gowned now in that severe good taste which betokens a highpriced ladies tailor combined with very judicious criticism her critic she had found in miss franklin a young lady from the university who had passed easily and naturally from teaching history and etiquette up to the higher function of advising as to the cut and color of gowns berthas black velvet was this time a closeclasping sheath which revealed her slender figure and delicately and modestly disclosed the growing grace of her bosom she wore too some jewels of diamond and turquoisenot showy her mentor had taken great pains to warn her of all that and she was not merely irreproachable she was radiant as she slowly entered with the captain who having submitted like a martyr to evening dress was uneasy as a colt in harness and more than usually uncertain of step  bens eyes expanded with surprise and his heart warmed with pride as he greeted her you are beautiful he exclaimed to her and the tone of his exclamation as well as the words exalted her her brain filled with a mist of gold she hardly felt the floor beneath her feet to be called beautifuland by himhad been outside the circle of her most daring hope and the repetition of this word in her mind was like the clash of musical bellsentrancing her mechanically she took her place at his right hand silently and with a faraway look listening to the merry clamor of the table she hardly knew what she ate or what any one saidexcept when ben spoke to her but she was aware of the captain down at alices right and wondered vaguely how he was getting on with his napkin and his fork  the first words that really roused her and stopped the musing smile on her lips were spoken by ben in a lower voicehalflaughing but tender also you mustnt stay away too long ill feel as if i werent earning my salary while youre gone  i wish you were going too she said she had thought this many times but had not permitted herself to utter it why cant youand alicecome with us  i cant afford it for one thing the captain spoke of it but its out of the question  hell pay you wages just the same  i wouldnt want pay no it isnt that but alice isnt able to go and i cant think of going without her  this was a good reason and bertha looking towards alice saw in her face the pain which masks itself in color and movement the dinnertable was exquisite and the company gay and bertha felt herself a part of the great world of dignity and beauty where eating is made to seem a graceful art and wine is only a bit of color and not a lure she vaguely comprehended that this little party was of a tone and quality of the best the world overthat it was of a part and interfused with the dining customs of london and paris and new york it will be au fait miss franklin had said sententiously for alice heath knows  mrs crego who sat nearly opposite stared at the girl in stupefaction she makes me feel dowdy she had confessed to lee in the dressingroom why didnt you warn me to come in my best who has been coaching her alice heath i suppose she now wondered as sharply over the girls manner for bertha carried out of herself by bens word of praise felt no desire to drink or to eat and her reticence and the delicacy of her appetite conferred a distinction which concealed her lack of small talk and protected her from the criticism to which exuberance of manner ordinarily exposed her  she was deeply impressed too with bens management of the waiters and with the ease and skill with which he supported alice in carrying forward the courses it was a revelation of training which instructed her absurdly for her mind was quick to link and compare it leaped so swiftly and so subtilely along connecting lines of thought that a hint alone sufficed to set in motion a hundred latent memories and inherited aptitudes her father had been a man of native refinement and she possessed unstirred deeps of character as alice now well understood and from her end of the table she glanced often at the sweetly smiling girlwife whose beauty abashed haney at last she said to him your wife is very lovely tonight captain  he hesitated a moment then replied slowly she is shes as fine as anny queen then after another pause added and the more shame to me being what i am shes a good girl miss true as steel never a word of complaint or a frown she bears with me like an angel  youre doing a great deal for her  his face lightened so she says i mean to do more i mean to show her the world thats the only comfort i have my money is giving her nice clothes and a home as good as anny and tonight i feel tis giving her friends  but she is worth while even without the money  true he quickly said but i take comfort in the consideration that had i not carried her away shed be in sibley junction this night  sibley junction can this radiant young creature sitting there at the head of my table be the clerk of the golden eagle hotel thought alice money is magical no wonder we all work for itand worship it  the dinner was both early and short in order that bertha and the captain might take the train at ten oclock and as they were to have the drawingroom in the sleepingcar bens suggestion they went directly to the coach in their party clothes and so it happened that this little woman who had never occupied a berth in a pullman entered her compartment in the robes of a princess  alice had suggested a maid but bertha would not hear to that but she was willing that their coachman should go along to help the captain ben had interposed here and said you need some one used to travelling i know a colored fellow who is out of service just now and would like to come to you hes a good reliable man and a fine nurse so she had engaged him he was on the platform as they drove upa slight quiet man of gentle speech and indeterminable age who took charge of the captain at once as if he had been his servant for years  alice said goodbye at the carriage door but ben went with them into the coach and in the excitement of getting to the train and into the car bertha had been able to forget the sick feeling about her heart but now as he turned and said its nearly time to start and held out his hand in parting a desolation a loneliness a helpless hunger swept over her the like of which had never anguished her before  i wish you were going too she faltered her speech broken and full of sad cadences  he too was tense with emotion as he answered i wish i were but i canti must not then with the gesture of a brother he bent and kissed her and turned away blind to everything else but his pain and so stumbling and shaken vanished from her sight  for a moment she remained standing in the aisle the touch of his lips still clinging to her cheek surprised full of bewildered defence then as reckless of onlookers as he had been she rushed to the window in swift attempt to catch a final glimpse of him but in vain he had hurried away without looking back her look of wonder and surprise still dazzling him with its significance a kiss with him as with her had never been a thing lightly given or received and this caress so simple to others sprang from an impulse that was elemental that he had both shocked and angered her he fully believed but the arch of her brows the wistful curve of her lips and the pretty almost childish push of her hands against his breast were still so appealingly vivid that he entered the carriage and took his seat beside alice with a kind of rebellious joy hot in his blood  however as his passion ebbed his uneasiness deepened and he went to his room that night with a feeling that his connection with the haneys so profitable and so pleasant was in danger of being irremediably broken off she will be justified in refusing ever to see me again he groaned and in this spirit of selfcondemnation and loneliness he took up his work next day  berthas selfrevelation was slower she was so young and so innately honest and good that no sense of guilt attached to the pleasure she felt in the sudden revelation that this splendid young man loved hera pleasure which grew as the first shock of the parting the pain and the surprise wore away he likes me he said i was beautiful he kissed me these were the rounds in the ladder of her ascent and she was carried high only to fall into despair for was she not leaving him and all the pleasant people she had come so recently to knowhurrying away into darkness with a crippled man old before his time out into a world of which she knew littlefor which at this moment she cared nothing  she went back a few moments later with this sorrow written on her face to find lucius the colored man deftly preparing the captain for bed the old borderer looked up with a smile in which shame and sadness mingled well bertie i didnt think id come to thisme that could once sit in me saddle and pick a dollar out o the dust but so it is  ill take care of you she cried in swift contrition turning almost fiercely to the valet she said you can go ill tend to him  the captain stopped her gently no darlin bens right im too clumsy and heavy for you i need just such a handy man now now let be go ahead lucius strip off these monkeyfixens and dom the man that gets me into them again  efficient as she was the girl could not but admit that lucius was better able to serve her husband than herself he was both deft and strong and though the swaying of the car troubled his master he steadied him and guided him and stowed him away as featly as if it were the fiftieth instead of the first time then with a few words of explanation to the wife he quietly withdrew and shut the door with a final touch of considerate care which was new to her  she would have been less troubled by him had he been a black man but he was not he seemed more like a spaniard and his grizzled mustache yellowish skin and big dreamy black eyes lent him a curious distinction and the thought that he was to take her place as crutch and cane to the captain gave her a sense of uselessness which she had not up to this moment confessed  his suggestions combined to the minute instructions of miss franklin enabled her to get to her bunk in fair order but no sleep came to her for hours she longed for her mother more childishly than at any time since her marriage she reproached herself for not bringing miss franklin why did i come at all she wailed in final accusation  there had been a time when the thought of this tripof chicago new york and washingtonwas big in her mind but it was so no longer these great cities were but namesempty sounds compared to the realities she was leaving her splendid house her horses and dogsand her daily joy in ben fordyce she did not put these visits in their highest place not even when remembering his parting kiss but she dwelt upon the inspiriting morning drives the talks in the mellowtinted sunshinelighted office she recalled the lunches they took together and the occasional wild gallops up the cañonthese she treasured as the golden realities for the loss of which she was even now heartsick  one thought alone steadied hergave her a kind of resignation the captain wanted to find his sisters to revisit the scenes of his youth and it was her duty to go with him and in this somewhat dreary comfort she fell asleep at last  she was awakened next morning by a pleasant voice saying the first call for breakfast has been made mrs haney and she looked up to find lucius peering in at the door with serious kindly eyes he added formally if i can assist you in any way call me and please let me know when you are ready to have me come in  his speech was so precise and his manner so perfect that bertha was puzzled and a little embarrassed by them it seemed abnormal to have a hired servant so polished so thoughtful she dressed hurriedly while the captain yawned and talked between his yawning that yellow chap is sure handy i wish id had him before twould have saved you a power o work and worry did ye sleep last night  not very well i hope you did you cant complain of the bunk  tis luxurioustis so but theres nothing like the west side of colorado avenue after all or a bed of pine boughs beside a roaring mountain stream twas a fine little supper ben gave us last night  the level lands awed and depressed the mountain girl they seemed to type the flat and desolate spiritual world into which she was entering and the ride seemed interminable carrying her every hour farther from the scenes and sounds to which her love clung she was bitterly homesick and nothing seemed to promise comfort she gazed with lacklustre eyes on the towns and rivers along the way and she entered the great inland metropolis by the lake with dread and a deepening sense of her inexperience and youth  on the neighboring track stood the return sleepers headed for the hills and she acknowledged a wild desire to take her place among the jocund folk who stood on the observationplatform exchanging goodbyes with friends thunderous smothering and vast the city seemed as they drove through it on their way to the hotel and upon reaching her room she flung herself down on her bed and sobbed in a frenzy of homesickness  haney who had never before perceived a tear on her face was startled and stood in puzzled pain looking down at her while the tactful lucius went about the unpacking of the trunks confident that the shower would soon be over  whats the ail of it asked the captain tell me darlin are ye sick  she shook her head from side to side like a suffering and weary child and made no further answer     chapter xv  marts visit to his sister   bertha woke next morning with a sense of weariness and desolation still at her heart but she dressed and went to breakfast with haney at an hour so early that the diningroom was nearly empty lucius with quiet insistence upon the importance of his employers had secured a place at a window overlooking the lake and was glad to see his mistress brighten as her eyes swept the burnished shoreless expanse  haney still troubled by her languid air and gloomy face took heart and talked of what chicago was in the days when he saw it and what it was now people say it dont improve but listen when i was here the palmer house was the newly built wonder of the west the streets were tinkling with bobtail horsecars and now look at it  bertha went back to her room still in nerveless and despondent mood not knowing what to do the captain proposed the usual round well take an autocar and go to the parks and inspect the lake shore drive and the potter palmer castle then well go down and see where the worlds fair was then well visit the wheat pit tis all there is bedad  lucius who had been answering the phone in the hall came in at the moment to say a lady wishes to speak with mrs haney  a lady who  a certain mrs brenta friend of miss franklins  berthas face darkened oh id forgot all about her miss franklin gave me a letter to her she explained as she went out  she had no wish to see mrs brent on the contrary she had an aversion to seeing or doing anything but there was something compelling in the cool sweet quiet voice which came over the line and before realizing it she had promised to meet her at eleven oclock  mrs brent then added i am consumed with desire to see you for dori mean miss franklinhas been writing to me about you youre just in time to come to a little dinner of minedont make any engagement for tomorrow night im coming down immediately  bertha quite gravely answered all right ill be here and hung up the receiver committed to an interview that became formidable now that the sweetness of the voice had died out of her ears  who was it asked the captain  a friend of miss franklinssounds just like her voice but i think shes only a cousin she wants to see me and ive promised to be here at eleven  the captain looked a little disappointed well we can take a spin up the lake lucius go hire a buckboard and were off  theres an autocar waiting sir i ordered it half an hour ago  the gambler looked at him humorously ye must be a mindreader  a tap on the door called the man out and when he returned he bore a telegram for you captain he said presenting it on the salver  the gambler took it with sudden apprehension in his face i hope theres no trouble at the mine he muttered  bertha leaning over his shoulder read it first its from ben she called joyously aint it just like him  this message seemed a little bit foolish to haney       just to say hello all well here have a good time      fordyce  to bertha it made all the difference between sunshine and shadow she thrilled to it as if it had been a voice he knew id be homesick and so he sent this to cheer me up she said and in this she was right her shoulders lifted and her face cleared come on captain if were going  as they came down the elevator men in buttons met them and attended them to the door and turned them over to still other uniformed attendants who were fain to help them into the autocar for lucius had managed to convey to the hotel a proper sense of his employers money value he himself was always close to his masters side for lately haney had taken to stumbling at unexpected moments and his increasing bulk made a fall a real danger  a thrill of delight of elation ran through the young wife as she glanced up and down chicagos proudest avenue it conformed to her notion of a city the level park flooded with spring sunshine was walled on the west by massive buildings while to the east stretched the shining lake from here the city seemed truly cosmopolitan it had dignity and wealth of color and to the girl from sibley junction was completely satisfyingalmost inspiring  it was uplifting also to be attended to a splendid autocar by willing alert servants and to feel that the passersby were all envious of her careless ease bertha forgot her homesickness and took her seat in the spirit of one who is determined to have the worth of her money for once anyhow and the pedestrians if they had any definite notion of her at all probably said there goes a rich old cattle king and his pretty daughter its money that makes the mobile go  she held to this pose for half an hour while they threaded the tumult of wabash avenue and crossing the river swept up the lake shore drive but the lake filled her with other thoughts i wish we had this at the springs she said this is fine  we have our share answered he if we had this at our door there wouldnt be anything left to go to  they whizzed through the park and down another avenue into the thick tangle of traffic which scared them both and so back to the hotel the captain saying my my but she has grown tis twenty years since i took this turn  in some strange way bertha had drawn courage resolution pride and ambition from what she saw on this short ride that she was in a car and mistress of it was in itself a marvellous distinction and the thought of what she would have beenas a roundtripper from sibley junctionadded to her pleasure and pride she was always doing sums in her head now thus suppose our excursion does cost twenty dollars per day thats only one hundred and fifty per week six hundred per month and our income is ten times that and more she had not risen above the habit of calculation but she was fast rising to higher levels of expenditure  she met mrs brent with something of this mood in her manner but was instantly softened and won by her visitor who did not in the least resemble miss franklin in appearance though her voice was wonderfully the same her eyes were wide her brow serene and her lips smiling  why youre a child she saida mere babe dorothy didnt tell me that  bertha stiffened a little and mrs brent laughingly added please dont be offendedi am really surprised and then her manner became so winning that before the western girl realized it she had given her consent to join a dinnerparty the following night come early for we are to go to the theatre afterwards ill have some of the university people in to see you miss franklin has made us all eager to meet you  bertha had a dim perception that this eagerness to meet her was curiosity but her loyalty to her teacher and the charm of her visitor kept her from openly rebelling  the captain was not so easily persuaded tis poor business for me he said time was when i went to bed like a wolfwhen the time served but now im as regular to me couch as a onelegged duck however to keep me wife in tune ill go or come as the case may be  mrs brent did not attempt to be funny with this wounded bear and they parted very good friends  as her visitor was going bertha suddenly said wait a minute and going to her handbag brought out an envelope addressed in congdons big scrawling hand do you know these people  mrs brent glanced at it why yes joe moss is an artist hes wellknown here and youll like him his wife is a very talented woman and will be of great advantage to you they know all the artistic gang as they call themselves and they live a delightfully bohemian life theyre right near here and if i were you id go in to see them id thought of having the mosses tomorrow night and this settles it they must come goodbye till tomorrow at 7 pm and she went out leaving the girl in a glow of increasing goodwill  haney was looking over a list of names and addresses which lucius had brought to him and as bertha returned he put his finger on one and said i believe on me soul that this patrick mcardle is me second sisters husband patrick mcardle patternmaker sure charles said he was in a stove foundry tis over on the west side lucius says how would it do to slide over and see  im agreeable she carelessly answered her mind full of mrs brent and the dinner  lucius interposed a word its a very poor neighborhood captain we can hardly get to it with a machine  well then well drive i want to make a stab at finding my sister anyhow  lucius submitted but plainly disapproved of the whole connection on the way haney talked of his sister fanny she was a bouncing jollytempered girl always down at the heels but good to me she was two years older and was mothers main guy as the sailors say she was fairly industrious though none of us ever worked just for the fun of it fan married all the other girls off to saloonkeepers or aldermen which is all the same in pay and then ended up by takin a man far older than herself who was not very strong and not very smart he makes patterns in sand for the leaves and acorns you see on stove doors for all we know he may have made them thats on your new range at home  the mention of that range brought to berthas mind a picture of her lovely kitchen so light and bright and shining and another spasm of homesickness and doubt seized her mart we had no business to come away and leave that house and all our nice things in it  miss franklin will see after it  but how can she shes gone nearly all day and besides shes not up to housekeepingit aint her line i feel like going right back this minute  this feeling of dismay was increased by the glimpses of the grimy west side into which they were plunging every moment deeper after leaving the asphalt pavement the noise increased till they were unable to make each other hear without shouting and so they sat in silence while the driver turned corners and dodged carts and cars till at last he turned abruptly into a sidestreet and driving slowly along over a rotting block pavement drew up before a small twostory frame housea relic of the oldtime city  the yards were full of children who all stopped their play to stare at this carriage especially impressed by lucius who sat very erect on the seat beside the driver resolutely doing a very disagreeable duty at the door he got down and said now captain you give me a pointer or two and ill find out whether this is your mcardle or not  just ask if mrs mcardle was fan haney of troy thatll cover the specification he answered  by this time a large fairhaired slovenly woman had opened the door and with truculent voice called out who do you want to find  fan haney of troy answered the captain  thats me the woman retorted  ye are so very well thin consider yourself under arrest this minute said haney beginning to clamber out of the carriage  the woman stared a moment then a slow grin developed on her face so like to haneys own that bertha laughed the lost sister was found  as haney neared her he called out well fan yere the same old sloven ye were when i used to kick your shins in troy for soapin me mouth  mart haney by the piper she exclaimed wiping her lips and hands in anticipation of a caress where did ye borry the funeral wagon  he shook her handthe kiss was out of his inclinationand responded in the same vein of mockery a friend of mine died the day and i broke out of the procession to pay a call divil a bit the dead man cares  whos with you in the carriage  mrs haney bedad  naw it is not  sure thing  shes too young and prettyand mart yere lame and howly saints man ye look old i wouldnt have known ye but fer the mouth and the eyes of ye ye have the same old grin  the same to you  i get little chance to practise it these days  tis the same here  but how came ye hurt  a felly with a grievance poured a load of buckshot into me side and one of them lodged in me spine so they say  she clicked her tongue in ready sympathy dear dear but come in and sit ye down ask yer girl to come inim not perticular  shes me lawful wife he said and his tone changed her manner into something like sweetness and dignity  go ye in mart ill fetch her  as the young wife sat in her carriage before this wretched little home and watched that slatternly sister of her husband approach she rose on a wave of selfappreciation haney lost in dignity and power by this association for the first time in her life the girl acknowledged a fixed difference between her blood and that of mart haney she was disgusted and ashamed as mrs mcardle coming to the carriage side said bluffly tis a poor parlor i have mrs haney but if yell light out and come in ill send for pat hell be wantin to see ye both  bertha would have given a good deal to avoid this visit but seeing no way to escape she stepped from the carriage under the keen scrutiny of her hostess and walked up the rickety steps with something of the same squeamish care she would have shown on entering a cowbarn  here benny called mrs mcardle run you to dad and tell him me brother mart has come and to hurry home off wid ye now  the poverty of this city workingmans home was plain to see it struck in upon bertha with the greater power by reason of her six months of luxury it was not a dirty home but it was cluttered and haphazard the old wooden chairs were worn with scouring but littered with childrens rags of clothing the smell of boiling cabbage was in the air for dinnertime was nigh there were three rooms on the groundfloor and one of these was livingroom and diningroom the other the kitchen and a small bedroom showed through an open door for all its disorder it gave out a familiar odor of homeliness which profoundly moved haney  yeve grown like the mother fan and i do believe some of these chairs are hers  they are when dad broke up the house and went to live with kate i put in a bid for the stuff and i brought some of it out here with me  im glad ye did that old rocker nowsure its the very one we used to fight for ill give ye twentyfive dollars for it fan  ye can have it for the askin mart she generously repliedtears of pleasure in her eyes sure after all the tales i heard of yeits to see you takin fine to the mothers chair she was a good mother to us mart  she was he answered  and if the old dad had been as much of a man as she was wed all stand in better light today im thinkinthough the father did the best he knew  the worst he did was to let us all run wild a club about our shoulders now and then would have kept our tempers sweeter  bertha in rich new garments seemed as alien to the scene as any fine lady visiting among the slums she was struggling too between disgust of her sisterinlaws slovenly house and untidy dress and the good humor tender sentiment and innate motherliness of her nature there was charm in her voice and in her big gray eyes irish to the core she could storm at one child and coo with another an instant later she was like mart or rather mart became every moment more of her kind and less of the bold and remorseless desperado he had once seemed to be the deeper they dug into the past the more of his essential kinship to this woman he discovered he greeted her children with kindly interest leaving a dollar in each chubby dirty fist and when mcardle came into the room fan had quite conquered her awe of berthas finery  mcardle was a small bent man with a black beard a pale serious face and speculative eyes he looked like a wondering rather cautious animal as he came in he wore a cheap gray suit and a celluloid collar and was as careless in his way as his wife it was plain that he was gentle absentminded and industrious  he listened to his wifes voluble explanations in silence inwardly digesting all that was said then shook handsstill without a word and when all these preliminaries were over he laid his hat aside and ran his fingers through his thin hair with a perplexed and troubled gesture asking irrelevantly hows the weather out there  nobody saw the humor of this but his wife who explained pat is a fiend on the weather he was raised on a farm ye see and he cant get over it i say to him what difference does the state o the weather make to you thats under a roof all day but divil a change does it make in him the first thing in the morning he turns to the weather report  mcardles eyes showed traces of a smile if it werent for the papers and the weather reports me days would be alike but sit by he added hospitably waving his hand towards the table on which the dinner was steaming  they were drawing up to the board when a puffing and blowing and the furious clatter of feet announced the inrushing of the children  not the mothers shrill whooping but the sight of the strange guests transformed them into mutes the carriage outside had filled them with wild alarms but the sight of their parents alive and entertaining guests of shining quality was almost as satisfyingly unusual as death and a funeral  they were a noisy hearty throng and berthas heart went out to poor patrick mcardle who sat amid the uproar silent patient the heroic breadwinner for them all no wonder he was old before his time slowly her antipathy died out she began to find excuses even for the mother to feed such a herd of little pigs and calves even out of wooden troughs would require much labor to keep them buttoned combed and fit for school was an appalling task mart must help these folks she said to herself  mcardle had nothing to say during the meal and bertha could see that his family did not expect him to do more than answer a plain question indeed the children created a hubbub that quite cut off any connected intercourse and fan with a grin of despair at last said theyll be gorged in a few minutes and then well have peace  this is what lack of money means bertha was thinking and her house her automobile her horses became at the moment as priceless as remote as crown jewels and papal palaces then conversely she grew to a larger conception of the possibilities which lay in sixty thousand dollars a year not only did it lift her and all hers above the heat and mire and distress of the world of toil it enabled them to help others  swiftly the children filled their stomachs and seizing each a piece of cake or pie withdrew leaving the old folks and their guests in peace  thereupon mcardle taking a pipe from his pocket and knocking it absentmindedly on the seat of the chair dryly remarked now that we can hear ourselves think lets have it all over again who air ye and why air ye here  being told a second time that this was his brotherinlaw a miner from colorado he shook hands all over again and accepted marts cigar with careful fingers as if fearing to drop and break the precious thing  bertha said i think wed better be going captain our carriage is outside  gracious peter cried mrs mcardle i forgot all about it is he by the day or by the hour  mart answered with an amused smile well now i dont know i think by the hour  yere makin a big bluff mart were properly impressed said his sister go pay him off and save the money  mcardle put in a query you must have a good thing out there  tis enough to pay me carriage hire answered mart and his tone satisfied mcardle who with reflective eye on bertha puffed away at his cigar while mart gave his promise to call again ill come over and get you all and take you to the theatre in me autocar he said as he rose but we must be going now  fan was beginning to perceive in him more and more of the man of power and substance and her manner changed ye were always the smartest of the lot of us mart  no i was not charles was the bright boy  so he was but he was lazy that was why he took up with playactingtis an easy job  even that is too much work for him remarked mcardle  i reckon thats right laughed mart as he turned towards the door  come again if ye find time called fan as they went down the steps  mcardle with his cigar in his hand waved it in a sign of parting and so their visit to the mcardles closed  mart turned to his silent and thoughtful wife and said with a great deal of meaning in his voice well now what do you think of that for a fine litter of pups  they seem hearty  they do tis on such that the future of the raypublic rests and then he added sure bertie it gripped me heart to see the mothers old chair     chapter xvi  a dinner and a play   lucius seemed to know the city very well and to have a list of its principal citizens in his memory he knew the best places to shop and the selectest places to eat and bertha soon came to ask his advice about other and more intimate affairs she showed him mrs brents card and explained that they were going out there to dinner  i know the locality he said much impressed and i think i know the house its likely to be quietly swell and youd better wear your best gown  the black dress said haney who was a deeply concerned witness i like that  lucius was respectful but firm you are very well in that mrs haney but if i were you id have a new gown youll need it i know just the saleslady to fit you out  but ive only worn the black dress once she exclaimed in dismay  lucius explained that people who went out much in the city made a point of not wearing the same gown in the same circle a second time and as you only have two presentable evening gowns you certainly need another  haney joined in emphatically sure thing whats the good of money if you dont use it to buy things  tremulous with the excitement of it she went with the captain to several of the largest and most sumptuous establishments on state street and lucius who accompanied them ostensibly to be of service to his master was of the greatest service to his mistress he was so quiet so unobtrusive so thoroughly the footman in appearance so helpful and so masterful in fact a faint shake of his head a nod a gesture decided momentous questions  the girl sitting there surrounded by scurrying clerks and saleswomen had a return of her bewilderment and doubt can it be true that i can buy any of these cloaks and hats she asked herself what was the magic that had made her lightest wish realizable when a splendid cloak fell round her shoulders and she looked in the glass at the tall figure there she glowed with pride  madam carries a cloak beautifully the saleswoman said with sincerity this is our smartest modelperfectly exclusive and new only such a figure as the madams properly sets it off  while the women were making measurements for some slight alterations lucius said it would be nice if you decided on that automobile and took mrs haney to the dinner in it  haneys face lighted up i will sh not a word well surprise her  if you dont mind ill hustle up a footmans livery  so do anything goesfor her lucius  bertha thought she had already rubbed the side of her wonderful lamp to a polish but under the almost hypnotic spell of her westindian attendant she bought shoes hats hosiery and toilet articles till her room looked like christmas morning as haney said and yet there was little that could be called foolish or tawdry she wore little jewelry having resisted haneys attempt to load her with rings and necklaces miss franklin had impressed upon her the need of being simple when she put on her dinnerdress and faced him mart haney was humbled to earth sure yere beautiful as an angel he exulted as if addressing a saint and as she swept before the tall glass and saw her radiant self therein she thought of ben and her face flamed with lovely color i wish he could see me now she inwardly exclaimed  miss franklin in writing to her friend mrs brent had said in a sense the haneys are impossiblehe is an exgambler and she is the daughter of a woman who kept a miners boardinghouse in the mountains but this sounds worse than it really is i like the captain whatever he was in the days before his accident i dont knowthey say he was a terror but when i entered the family he was as he is nowa pathetic figure he isnt really old but hes horribly crippled and takes it very hard he is kindness itself to his wife and to every one round him and will be grateful for anything you do for him bertha is young but maturing very rapidly and theres no telling where she will stop shes been studying with me and ive told her you will advise her while shes in chicago you neednt go far with her if you dont want to the hallidays and voughts wont mind the back pages of the haney history and you neednt say anything about the captains career if you dont want to hes a big mineowner now and is out of the gambling and saloon business altogether bertha is perfectly eligible in herself and as many of us started on farms or poor little villages we cant afford to take on any airs over her shes of good parentage and as true as steel she likes the captain and is devoted to him  dr brent was not connected with the university but his wifes brother had been a student there and was now an instructor in one of the scientific departments and mrs brents charm of manner and the doctors easygoing hospitality made their fine little kenwood home the centre of a certain intellectual bohemia on the borders of the institution and the artistic gang occasionally met and genially interfused with the professors round the big brent fireplace being rich in his own right brent took his practice in such moderation as to be of the highest effectiveness when he consented to operate and was in demand for difficult surgical cases he was slender blond and languid of movementnot in the least suggestive of the western hustle of chicago and yet he was born within twenty miles of the courthouse indeed it was the spread of the city which had enriched his fathers estate and which now permitted him to work when he felt like it and to assemble round his hearthstonean actual stone by the waythe people he liked best the amount of hickory wood he burned was stupendous  mrs brent was known as the audacious hostess because she was not afraid to invite anybody who interested her you take your reputation in your hand her friends often said to those about to make their first call you may meet an actor from new york or a stonemason from the west sideone never knows their house was an adaptation of the mission style of california and possessed one big room on the first floor which their friends called congress hall  miss franklin was certain that this circle would enjoy the captain once he became at ease and she really hoped mrs brent would advise the girl and as she put it help her to get at the pleasant side of chicago shes very rich and shes intelligent but she is very raw shes very like a boy but shes worth while she wanted me to come with her but i could have done so only by giving up here and going as her companion and that im not ready to doat present  after carefully considering all these points mrs brent phoned her friends being careful to explain that dorothy franklin had sent her some fleecy specimens of colorado society and that she was asking a few of the bold and fearless among her set to meet them  who are the guests of honor she was asked by each favored one  each received the same reply marshall haney the gambler prince of cripple creek and his bride deadshot nell biscuitshooter from honey gulch  honest  hope to die  its too good to be true of course ill come do we have a quiet game after dinner  ah no that would be too cruelto captain haney no we go to the theatre so be on hand at 7 pm sharp  in this way she had prepared her friends to be surprised by berthas good looks and the captains tame and courteous manner but was herself soundly jarred when her wildwest people came up to the door in an autocar that must have cost five or six thousand dollars and when a colored footman in bottlegreen uniform leaped out to open the door for them it was lucius in his new suithe was playing all the parts brent with a comical look at his wife remarked i suppose this is in lieu of broncos  they are branching out she gasped and see her clothes  she might well exclaim for bertha in her long cloak her head bare and her pretty dress showing did not in the least resemble the picture miss franklin had drawn neither did she resemble the demure almost sullen girl mrs brent had met in the hotel the captain too for the second time in his life wore evening dress but citing to his sombrero so that he resembled a tennessee congressman at the inaugural ball as he came slowly up the short walk and mrs brent deeply regretted that no one was present to take the shock with herself and the doctor  the maid at the door who knew nothing of the wild reputation of the haneys guided them upstairs to their respective dressingrooms and helped to remove their wraps so expeditiously that they were on their way back to the first floor before any other guests arrived bertha was delighted but not awed by the fine room into which they were ushered for was not her own house larger and more splendid she had grown accustomed to big thingsit was the tasteful beauty of the room that moved her  in the side of the room a big plain brick fireplace was filled with a crackling fire and in the light of it stood her host and hostess bertha was glad to find them aloneshe had expected to face a room full of people she was not specially attracted to dr brent and remained so coldly restrained that he was quite baffled and turned away to the captain who sought the fire saying this looks good i feel the cold nowi dont know why i should  this opened the way to a very confidential talk on wounds and diet  berthas new gown of pale blue made her look very young and very sweet and the eager guests were sadly disappointed in herthat is to say the ladies were the men seemed quite content with her as she was they took the biscuitshooter description to be a piece of fooling on mrs brents part and as they had no time after dinner to get the captain started they remained quite convinced that he too had been maligned in their hostesss description  as a result mrs brent and her other guests were forced to do the talking for bertha had not only warned mart against reminiscence but had determined to keep a tight hold on her own tongue and though she listened with the alertness of a bird she answered only in curt phrase making yes and no do their full duty she perceived that the people round her were of intellectual companionship to the crego and congdon circles and these young men so easy and graceful of manner reminded her of ben none of them were entirely strange to her now and yet she dimly apprehended something uncomplimentary veiled beneath their polite regard she did not entirely trust any of themnot even her host indeed she liked mrs brent less than at their first meeting in the hotel  the dinner was rather hurried and they would have been late had it not been for haneys new autocar which carried six and made two trips to the station unnecessary it was fine to see the captain put his machine at the disposal of his hostess i told lucius to wait he boasted i thought we might need him  dr brent succeeded at last in drawing his pretty guest into conversation by remarking on the captains color hes feeding improperly if you dont mind my saying so hes putting on weight he tells me but feels cold and nerveless cut him down on starchy foods how long is it since he was hurt  about eight months  must have been a tearing beast of an accident to wing a man of his frame  it was tore his whole side to pieces  who put him togethersteele of denver  no a man in cripple  sure he was the right man  he was the best i could get  you arouse my professional egotism id like to examine the captain if you dont objectnot for any fee you understand but a fellow of his build and yearshe tells me hes only fortyfive  only fortyfive thought the girl what strange ideas these older people have and ben was twentysix just what the doctor said afterwards she didnt hear for she was thinking of the swift wide arc of change through which her mind had swung from the time when marshall haney first came to sibleyso grand of stride so erect so powerful he too seemed young then now he was oldold and feeblea man to be advised protected humored she dimly understood too that corresponding change had come to her that she was far away from the girl who had stood behind the counter defending herself against the lovemaking of the bummers and drummers among her patronsand yet she was the same after all ive not changed as much as he has was her conclusion and she enjoyed the gayety and beauty of her companions but she said little to express it  the play that night appalled her by its fury of passion its mockery of woman its cynical disbelief in man with startling abruptness and in most colloquial method it delineated the beginning of a young wifes wrongdoing and when the lover caught the innocent ensnared woman to his bosom a flaming sword seemed to have been plunged into berthas own breast she quivered and flushed and when the actress displayed the awakened conscience of the erring one putting into words as well as into facial expression her feeling of guilt and remorse the girlwife in the box shrank and whitened her big eyes fixed upon the sobbing suffering character before her defending herself against the dramatist as against an enemy he was a liar there was no wrong in bens kiss and no remorse in her own heart as she remembered the caress even if he loves me that doesnt make him horrible  the dramatist went remorselessly on he showed the husbandold coarse brutal he put him in sharpest relief in order that the woman should be tempted to her ruin and in the end the lovervirile handsome and unscrupulouswins the tortured womans souland they flee leaving the usual note behind  what can you expect remarked the cynical friend of the injured husband given a young and lovely wife like rose and an old limping warrior like you and an elopement follows as a matter of course q e d and so the curtain fell  relentless realist in the first act the dramatist in the second act began to hedge he made the life of the erring woman conventionally miserable her lover beat her neglected her and finally deserted her and in the last act she crawled back into her husbands home like a starved cat to die while he scarred old beast cried out the wages of sin is death whether the writer intended this scene to be ironical or not the effect was to awaken a murmur of laughter among the illrestrained of the auditors but bertha hot with anger towards both author and players could not join in mrs brents smiling comment isnt that comical  the doctor coolly said a good conventional british ending why didnt he clap a pair of wings on the old reprobate and run him up on a wire the way they used to do in translating little eva in uncle toms cabin  afterwards mrs brent proposed that they go to a german restaurant and have some beer and skittles but this struck harshly on bertha who still palpitated with the passion of the play i reckon wed better not the captain is pretty tired and if you dont mind well quit now  without saying ive had a lovely time she shook hands all round and taking her husbands arm moved off into the street leaving her hostess a little uneasy and wholly perplexed mrs brents joke about the captain and his wife had as the doctor expressed it queered the whole affair  but how did she know  shes a good deal sharper than you gave her credit for being he replied you easterners never can learn to take diamonds in the rough  berthas mind was in tumult and she wished to be alone mart irritated her she refused to talk to him about the play or the dinner and turning him over to lucius went at once to her own bed thus far she had not attempted to closely analyze her relationship to marshall haney he had been to her a good friend rather than a husband a companion who needed her and who had given her everything she asked for keenly forward almost precocious on the calculative side she had remained singularly untroubled on the emotional side she knew that certain problems of sex existed in the world and she was only mentally aware of temptationsshe had never really felt them now all at once her whole nature awoke her mind engaged a legion of vaguely defined enemies out of the shadow stepped words of no weight of no significance hitherto encircling her panoplied with meaning the halfheard comment of the camp the dimly perceived gossip of the springs the flattering looks of the artistsall helped her to see herself as she was a handsome young girl like that on the stage married to a crippled middleaged man of evil history  but he is good to me she argued against her new self i was poor and he has made me rich and all ive done is to nurse him and keep house for him with this thought came a realization that she had never been a full and complete wife to him and with a flush of shame and repulsion she added and now i never can be no matter if he were to become as straight as strong and as handsome as he was in those days i cannot love him as a wife should  once having admitted this feeling of repulsion once having clearly perceived the vast distance between herself and her husband the repulsion deepened the separating space widened he seemed ten years older as they met next morning and his face was heavy and his frame lax her pity had not lessened but it was mixed now with a qualifying emotion which she had not yet acknowledged to be disgust his skin was waxy white and his jowls drooping im not at all up to the work he said with a return of his humor tis a killing pace weve struck bertie and the old man must take the flag if you keep it up  i dont intend to keep it up she answered shortly i think wed better go home at the word home a little thrill went through her it was so bright and big and desirable that mansion under the purple peaks  no i must go trail up me old dad and leave him provided for fan doesnt even know his address the more shame to her but ill find him if yere tired and would rather go home ill go on alone  oh no you mustnt do that she exclaimed instantly feeling the sincerity of his desire to please her ill go but we mustnt stay long and she took up the direction of his life again the mood of the night had passed away leaving only a clearer perception of his growing age and helplessness  you must let dr brent examine you she said a little later he dont think your lameness is caused by your wound he says youre out of condition  he looked at her with shadowed face and sorrowful eyes im only a poor old skate windbroken and lazy ye have the right to cut me loose any time  you mustnt talk like that she said sharply when i want to cut loose ill let you know  i hold ye to that he answered with intent look     chapter xvii  bertha becomes a patron of art   bertha deeply engrossed in the conceptions called up by this visit did not feel like calling upon the mosses even though they were almost next door she was troubled too with a feeling of helplessness in the use of a pen she wanted to write to fordyce but was afraid to do so knowing that a letter would disclose her ignorance of polite forms but this instead of discouraging her roused her to a determination to learn this was the saving clause in her character she acknowledged shortcomings but not defeats here again she was of the spirit that lifts the selfmade man  the congdons had been most generous of letters of introduction and in addition to those to mrs brent and the mosses bertha was in possession of two or three envelopes addressed to people in new york city presumably artists also as they bore the names of certain studios the note to moss was unaffected and simple in itself quite innocent of any qualification but the letter which had privately preceded it was in the true congdon vein and moss like mrs brent did not delay his call his card was in the haney box when they returned sorry to miss you come into my studio at five if you can he had pencilled on the back  your artistic bunch congdon had written wont mind meeting one of the most successful and picturesque of our gamblers marshall haney especially as the walls of his big house are bare and his wife is pretty they are ripping types old man not in the best society you understand but i know youll like em be as good to em as you can without involving anybody little mrs haney is a corker good start on a selfmade career theyre both unsophisticated in a way and a little real sympathy will drag their secret history to the light do a sketch of her for me shes likely to be famous haney is rolling in dough these daysminerand shes bound for some whooping big thing i dont know what but shes like a country boy with a stirring ambition it wouldnt surprise me to see her on fifth avenue one of these days with these few burning words i commend them into your plastic hands dont let sammy paint her for gods sake oh yes i worked em for a couple of canvases what do you think in this buoyant climate we all move yours in the velvet  with such a letter before him joe moss awaited his amazing guests with impatience cautioning the few who were in the secret not to dodge when the captain reached for his pockethandkerchief and above all you are to praise colorado and condemn the east as a place of residence joe prided himself on his savoir faire and on his apparel which had nothing about it to distinguish the sculptor in fact he often said there are people who say im not a sculptor be that as it may i manage by daily care to look like a clerk in a hardware store  and he did he customarily wore a suit of pepper and salt neat and trig a bowler hat as they say in london a readymade fourinhand tie and a small pearl scarfpin no more fuzzy hair for me no red tie no dandruff he had said on his return from paris right here we melt into the undistinguishable ocean of the millions unless we can be distinguished by reason of our sculpture he always included julia his wife in this way although she never modelled a lick for she wrote all his letters made out all his checks and took charge of him generally some said his success was due to her management she was a darkeyed smiling little woman exquisite in her dress and brisk in her manner  their studio occupied the whole north side of the attic of a big office building in the heart of the citys traffic we want to be in the midst of trade but above it moss explained to those who wondered at his choice of location sculpture as i see it is a part of architecture im not above modelling a doorknocker if theyll only let me do it my way sculpture was a part of life in the old days and we dont want to make it a thing too precious now i want to get close to the business men not to avoid them i like the roar of trade  the haneys therefore led by the sagacious lucius soon found themselves in the wisconsin block and shooting aloft in a bronze elevator that seemed fired from a cannon express to the 10th floor with nothing to suggest art in the men or in the signs about them on the thirteenth story they alighted and walking up one flight of stairs found themselves at the end of a bright hall before a door which bore in simple gold letters jos moss sculptor bertha heard laughter within and her heart misgave her it was not easy for her to meet these artist folk of business men miners railway managers she was unafraid but these people who joke and bullyrag each other and talk high philosophy one minute and gossip the next like the congdons were pretty swift for her after a moments pause she said to the captain they cant kill us here goes and knocked gently  moss himself opened the door and his cordial how de do mrs haney established him in her mind at once as a good fellow he was quite as direct as congdon im glad to see you he said to the captain come in he looked keenly at lucius who composedly explained himself the captain is a little lame and i just came along to see that he got here all right ill be back at 530  the door opened into a big room which was darkened at the windows and lighted by shaded electric globes it was cool and bare in effect around a small table in a far corner a halfdozen people were sitting mrs moss who was pouring tea rose in her place at the teaurn as her husband approached and cordially shook hands with her guests im very glad you came please tell me how youll have your tea she said  bertha was accustomed to take her tea any old way and said so being influenced by mrs moss candid eyes and merry smile haney with a queer feeling of being on the stage as a character in a play sank heavily into the chair at his hostess right hand and said i never took tea in my life but im not dodgin anything you mix  joe earnestly protested dont do it captain theres some scotch down cellar  mrs moss indicated one or two other dimly seen faces about her and introduced their owners in a most casual manner while she compounded a hot drink for her western guest  how long have you been in our horrible town mr haney she asked heedful of joes warning  one day maam  youre just passing through i presumethats the way all colorado people do  haney smiled he was getting the drift of her remarks tis natural maam for you see tis a long run and a heavy grade and hard to sidetrack on the way  bertha to whom moss addressed himself was candidly looking about herprofoundly interested in what she saw dim forms in bronze and plaster stood on shelves brackets and pedestals and at the end of the long room a big group of figures writhed as if in mortal combat it was a workshopthat was evident even to herwith one small nook devoted to tea and talk  would you like to poke about he asked anticipating her request  yes i would she bluntly replied  there isnt much to see he said im the kind of sculptor who works on order i believe in the art for service idea and when i get an order i fill it as well as i can make it as beautiful as i can and send it out on its mission id like to model mantelpieces and andirons because they are seen and actually influence peoples lives what i started to say was this my stuff all goes outmy real stuff my fool failures stay by methis thing for instance he indicated the big clump of nude forms i had an idea when i started but it was too ambitious and too literary moreover it isnt democratic it dont gibe with the present id be a wildanimal sculptor if i knew enough about them  it was a profoundly moving experience for this raw mountainbred girl to stand there beside that colossal group while the man who had modelled it took her into his confidence there was no affectation in mosss candor he had come to a swift conclusion that congdon had attempted to let him into a trap for berthas reticence and dignity quite reassured him if she had uttered a single one of the banal compliments with which visitors kill artists he would have stopped short but she didnt she only looked and something in her face profoundly interested him suddenly she turned and said  tell me what it means  it dont mean anythingnow originally i intended it to mean the conquest of art by the spirit of business or something like that i started it when i was fresh from paris and wore a red tie and a pointed beard i keep it as a record of the folly into which exotic instruction will lead a man if i were to go at it now id turn the whole thing aroundid make it art inspiring business  bertha did not follow his thought entirely but she felt herself in the presence of a serious problem and listening to something deep down in the heart of a strong man here was another worldnot an altogether strange world for congdon had also talked to her of his workbut a world so far removed from her own life that it seemed some other planet how well he talks she thought like a book  how charming she is he was thinking and the alert aspiring pose of her head made his thumb nervously munch at the bit of clay he had picked up  they wandered up and down the long room while he showed her tiles for mantel decoration bronze cats heads for doorknobs and curious and lovely figures for lamps and ashtrays i take a shy at most everything he explained  do you sell these she asked indicating some designs for electric desklamps  he smiled sometimesnot as often as id like to  how much are they  fifty dollars each  ill take them both she said and her pulse leaped with the pride of being a patron of art  now see here mrs haney im not displaying these to you as a salesmannot that im so very delicate about offering my things but i try to wait till a second visit he really did feel mean about it dont take emwait till tomorrow theyre pretty middling bad anyway theyre supposed to be mountain lions but as a matter of fact i never saw a mountain lion outside the zoo  theyre lions all right i want em and i know the captain will like em she stepped back to call haney but finding him surrounded by all of the other callers they had got him going telling stories of his wild life in the west she turned to the sculptor with a smile saying never mind i know theyre what he needsif he dont and moss recalling congdons description of the haneys material condition answered very well if you insist but i really feel as though i had played a confidence game on you  can you fix em up with lights she asked eager as a child i mean right now  certainly he unscrewed a couple of small bulbs from a nearby bracket and putting them into place on the lamps turned on the current she laughed out in delight one of the lions was playing with the stem which supported the light as if rising from a sleep he lay upholding the globe on one highraised paw the othera counterpart or nearly so in posehad a different expression the cub was snarling and clutching at the light as if it were a bird about to escape  i had an idea of putting them on the corners of a mantel to light a piece of low relief he explained but i never got at the relief it ought to be characteristic western scenery and ive never seen the west shameful isnt it  i want you to do that mantel for me she said i dont know what you mean by low relief but i know it would be up to these and they are right  your trust in me is beautiful mrs haney and maybe ill come out this summer and try to meet it  i wish you would she said and she meant it ill show you colorado  if youre starting to be a patron of art mrs haney dont overlook congdon hes a firstclass man he became humorous again were moving swiftly but im going to tell you that he wanted me to make a sketch of you if youll be so good as to give me two or three sittings ill do something we can send out to himif you wish  what do you mean by a sketch  something like this and leading her before a curious halfhuman veiled object he began to unwind damp yellow cloths till at last the head of a young woman appeared on a small revolving stand it was very dainty very sweet and smiling  bertha was puzzled it aint your wife and yet it looks like her  it is my wifes sistera quick study from lifejust the kind of thing frank wants will you sit for me a couple of mornings will answer he was eager to do her now her profile so clear so firm so strangely boyish pleased him he could feel the snap that the sketch would have when it was done  bertha considered she owed a great deal to the congdons and she liked this man her homesickness at the moment was abated and to stay two or even three days in chicago promised at the moment to be not so dreadful after all  yes ill do it she decided i dont know what mr congdon will do with a picture of me but thats his funeral and her laughing lip made her seem again the untaught girl she really was  as they went back to the group around the captain julia moss treated her husband to a glance of commiseration thinking him a bored and defeated man youve missed the captains racy talk she whispered  haney was enjoying himself very well in the centre of the stage and doing himself credit never in his life had he known a keener audience than these artists who studied him from every point of view  yes haney was saying tis possible to bust a bank if the game is straightthat is at faro but most machine games are built so that the housethat is the bankis protected my machines was always straight id as soon turn a sausagegrinder as run a wheel that was fixed in me favor  bertha did not like this talk of his abandoned trade and her cheeks burned as she put her hand on his shoulder i reckon wed better be going  he recovered himself of course i quit all that when i married he explained and dutifully rose  oh mrs haney pleaded mrs moss dont take him away we were just getting light on the game of faro please sit down again  bertha resented this tone no weve got to go glad to have met you she nodded towards the men who had risen much obliged she said again to moss ill send for them things tomorrow  mrs moss cordially insisted on their coming again  shes going to pose for me reported moss tomorrow morning at ten he inquired  ten suits me as well as any time bertha replied  mrs moss beamed at haney you come too captain i want to know more about those delightful games of chance  bertha went back to her hotel with throbbing brain the day had been so full of experience she was tired out and fairly bewildered by it all  as her excitement ebbed and she had time to recover her own point of view colorado her home the springs and the memory of her own people came rushing back upon her making the city and all it contained but a handful of east wind bens kiss burned vividly again upon her lips was it wrong of him to say what he did she began to ask herself a goodbye kiss would not have so deeply stirred her it was his face his voice his intensely uttered words which deeply thrilled her even now as she recalled them one by one you are beautiful and i love you these were the most important words to a woman and they had come at last to her  then her cheek flushed with shame of her husband as she remembered his gambling talk at the studio why must he always go back to that she asked hotly  they ate their dinner in the big diningroom surrounded by waiters while the captain discussed his sister and her family ill do something for fan he said shes a different sort from charles mcardle seems a hardworkin chap the kind that a little help wouldnt spile what do you think of buyin them a bit of a house somewhere  bertha listened with a languor of interest new to her and when he repeated his question and asked her if she were tired she answered yes and i think ill go to bed early tonight its been a hard day     chapter xviii  berthas portrait is discussed   joe moss was delighted with the haneys for they talked of their native west as people should talk they were as absolute in their convictions as a kentuckian for them there was no other gods country and as it was his latest dream to go west and do a big thing on a cliff or something he put off every other engagement to enjoy their racy speech he said at the first sitting ive had an idea of working the thorwaldsen trick find some fine site out there some wall of rock close to the railway and hew out a monster grizzly or mountain lion the railway could then advertise it you see trains could stop there five minutes to permit a view of mosss lion they could use a cut of it on all their folders if there was a spring near by they could advertise the water and bottle it a picture of my lion on the label ah it is a fine scheme  tis so said haney i wonder nobody thought of it before  it takes a yankee after all to plan new suspender buttons the sculptor replied and all the time he talked his hands were dabbling his thumbs gouging his dibble cutting and smoothing  haney watched him with amused glance sure i didnt know ye went at it so i thought ye chipped each picture out o stone and when the process of molding in plaster was explained to him he said tis like mcardles trade entirely he takes a rise in the world since i know hes an artist like yourself  what is his line  patternmaker for a stove foundry  moss beamed just what id like to be if theyd only pay a little more wages and furnish a better place to work  bertha never knew when he was in earnest so habitually mocking was his tone but she grew towards a perception of his ideal and dimly apprehended in him a mind far beyond any she had ever known mrs moss almost as reticent as mrs haney herself came and went about the studio brightly briskly keeping vigilant eye on her husbands mail moistening his mud ladies and defending him from inopportune callers insistent beggars and wandering models bertha though sitting with the stolid patience of a mississippi clamfisher was thinking at express speed her mind was of that highly developed type where a hint sets in motion a score of related cognitions and a word here and there in mosss rambling remarks instructed her like a flash of light she was at school in a high sense and improving her time the sketch was expanding into a carefully studied portrait bust and moss was happy  one day a fellowartist came in casually and they both squinted measured and compared the portrait and herself with the calm absorption of a couple of prizepig committeemen at a cattleshow you see this line is shorter the stranger said almost laying his finger on berthas neck not so straight as youve got it thats a fine line  i know it is  and you dont want to spoil it i dont like your fad for cutting down the bust the neck is nothing but a connecting link between the head and the bust now here you have a charming and youthful head and facelet the neck at least suggest the woman below  oh yes thats good logic provided youre after that but what i want here is springtimejust a fresh alert lovely fragment this pure line must be kept free from any earthiness  i suppose you know what you want i wont say you dont but if i were painting her id get that sweeping line there that ends by suggesting the summer  they talked disjointedly elliptically and of course mainly of the clay and yet bertha grew each moment more clearly aware that they considered her not merely interesting but beautiful and this was a most momentous and developing assurance she had hoped to be called goodlooking but no one thus far excepting ben fordyce had ever called her beautiful and these judgments on the part of joe moss and his brother artist were made the more moving by reason of their precision of knowledge and their professional candor they spoke as freely in discussion of her charm as if she were deaf and dumb  the painter who had been introduced in a careless way as mr humiston of new york turned to bertha at last and assuming the ordinary politeness of a human being said id like to make a study of you too mrs haney if youll permit i can bring my canvas in here and work with joe so that it neednt be any trouble to you  bertha her wealth still new upon her had no suspicion of the motives of those who addressed her was deeply flattered by this request and as moss made no objection she consented  the only thing that troubled moss was her growing tendency to lapse into troubled thought remember now youre the crocus the first violet or something like thatnot the last rose of summer dont think dont droop there thats right what have you to think or droop about when youre as old and blasé as humiston there youll have a right to ponder the mysteries but not now you and i are young thank god  humiston was dabbling at his small canvas swiftly lightly as unmoved by his fellowartist as if his voice were the wind in the casement he was a tall sickly looking man with grizzled hair and pale deeply lined face he was fresh from paris with a small exhibition of his pictures which were very advanced as mrs moss privately explained to bertha and hes rather bitter against americans because they dont appreciate his work but joe asks why should they theyre undemocraticlittle highkeyed precious bits pictures for other artists not real paintings or they are unacceptable otherwise hes a wonderful technician though and hell make an exquisite sketch of you  the western girlwife was completely fascinated by this small dusky dim and richly colored heart of the fierce and terrible city whose material bulk alone is known to the world to go from the crash and roar of the savage streets into this studio was like climbing from the level of the water in the black cañon to the sunlit grassy peaks where the indian pink blossoms in silence she was of the aspiring nature she had commonly played with children older than herself she had read books she could not understand she had always reached upward and here she found herself surrounded by men and women who excited her imagination as congdon had done they helped her forget the doubt of herself and her future which was gnawing almost ceaselessly in her brain and she was sorry when moss said to her come in once more tomorrow and see me do the real sculptors act no dont look at it he flung a cloth over his work you may look at it tomorrow  may i see my picture she asked of humiston  he turned the easel towards her without a word  good work cried moss  mrs moss came from her dark corner i knew youd do something exquisite  bertha looked at it in silence it was as lovely in color as a flower a dreamgirl not bertha haney and at last she said its fine but it isnt me  humiston broke forth almost violently of course it isnt you its the way you look to me i never paint people as they look to themselves nor to their friends i am painting my impression of you  do you really see me like that she both asked and exclaimed and at the moment she was more moving than she had ever been before and humiston in a voice of anguish cried  my god why didnt i do her like that and he fell to coughing so violently that bertha shuddered  moss defended himself i couldnt do her in all her fine poses he complained i had to select why didnt you do her that way yourself  the painter put his shorthand sketch away with a sigh if you venture as far as new york i hope you and the captain will visit my studio he said  with no suspicion of being passed from hand to hand she promised to send him her address and said id like to see the pictures you have here  moss became abusive now see here jerry i cant let you take mrs haney to that show of yours ill go myself to point out their weak points  i know their weak points a bloody sight better than you do answered humiston readily  if you do you dont speak of em  why should i you dont call out the defects of your hardware do you  mrs moss interposed thats just what he does do and it hurts trade i think ill take mrs haney over to see the pictures myself  humiston brightened very well but you must all lunch with me youre about the only civilized people i know in this crazy town and i need you  no said bertha its our treat you all come over and eat with us  haney who had been keeping in the background now came forward i second that motion he heartily said we dont get a chance every day to feed a bunch of artists  you can have that pleasure any day here said moss our noses are always over the bars waiting  when she emerged from the gallery an hour later bertha enjoyed an exalted sense of having been carried through some upper serener world where business politics and fashion had little place it was only a dip as mrs moss saidjust to show the way but it set the girls brain astir with halfformed disconnected aspirations only as she reentered the hotel the centre of obsequious servants did she become again the wife of marshall haney and mrs moss noting the eager attention of the waiters was amazed and delighted at the look of calm command which came over the girls face  art is fine and sweet as a side issue said julia to her husband as they were going in but money makes the porters jump  bertha composed and serious seated her guests at a table which had been reserved for her near a window and charmingly decorated with flowers she put moss at her left hand and humiston at her right and as the eastern man settled into place he said really now this isnt so bad his experienced eye had noted the swift flocking of the waiters and with cynical amusement he commented upon it these people must smell of money and in his heart acknowledged that he and moss were not so very different from the servitors after all theyre out for tens were after thousands thats the main point of difference  bertha once the cutlets were served was able to give attention to the talkhumistons talk he was celebrated as a monologist for he had resumed the discussion into which he and moss had fallen i dont believe in helping people to study art i dont believe in charity this interfering with the laws of the universe that kill off the crippled and the weakly is pure sentimentalism that will fill the world with deformed diseased and incapable persons  youre a vile reactionary cried moss  i am notim for the future i want to see the world full of beauty  physical beauty  yes physical beauty i want to see vice and crime and crooked limbs and low brows die outnot perpetuated i believe in educating the people to the lovely in line and color  as he pursued this line of inexorable argument bertha looked at him in wonder did he mean what he said his burning eyes seemed sincereand yet he did not fail to accept a second helping of the mushrooms there was power in the man he pushed the walls of her intellectual world very wide apart he came from a strange chaotic regionfrom a land where ordinary modes and motives seemed lost or perverted he took a delight in shocking them all morality was a conventiona hypocritic agreement on the part of the few to reserve freedom to themselves at the expense of the many art is impossible to little people to those who starve the big side of their nature for fear of mrs grundy look at the real peoplerachel wagner turner bernhardt and a thousand others were they bound by the marriage laws what will these crowds of tiny men and petty women do who come from the country parlors and cornshocks of the west they will puddle around a little while paint and muddle a few petty things then marry and go back to the ironingboard and the furrow where they belong whats the matter with american art its too cursed normal thats what its too neat and sweet and restrainedno license no go to it whats the matter with you to be personal  too well balanced  precisely you talk like a man of power but model like a cursed niggling prude youre bitten with the new madness youre the bryan of art the dear people is your cry damn the people they dont know a good thing when they see it why consider the millions consider the few those who have the taste and the dollars thats the way all the big men of the past had to do look at rubens and michael angelo and titianall the big bunch they were all frank gross feeders lovers of beauty defiant of conventions  he had forgotten where he sat but he was not neglecting his hostess he took a satanic satisfaction in seeing her lovely eyes widen and glow as he went on subtly flattering her by including her among the very few who could understand his ideals he seemed to draw her apart to his sideappealing to her for support against the coarse and foolish hosts represented by the mosses while marshall haney sat in a kind of stupor his eyes alone speaking as if to ask what the divil is the little man with the cough so hot about  moss accustomed to humistons savage diatribes roared out objections or laughed him to scorn while mrs moss tried her best to turn the mad artists mind upon more suitable subjects he had been deeply hurt and financially distressed by the failure of his exhibits in pittsburg and chicago and was now taking it out on his friends his passion his bitter vengeful cry against the ignorant masses of the world was something bertha had read about but never felt but she quivered now with the halfdisclosed fury of the disappointed austere soul  could it be possible that this savage man so worn and ill had painted those dim vague pictures of flowerlike girls whose limbs were involved in blossoming vines  he concluded at last the only place in the world today for an artist is paris in no other city can he live his own life in frank fulness and find patrons who see the subtlest meaning of a line  bertha was tired of all thismentally weary and confused and she felt very grateful to mrs moss who came to the rescue the moment humiston paused  there mrs haney that is the end of professor jerry spoopendykes lecture on the undesirability of america as a place of residencefor him of course he dont mind selling his pictures just to enlighten our night of ignorance but as for going to sundayschool or keeping the decalogue thats our job  humiston had the grace to smile i beg your pardon mrs haney i have been a fool but that monkey over therejoe mossprovoked me with his accursed heresies about the democracy of art art has no democracy and democracy will never have an art  there there warned moss you said all that before  the painter wrenched himself away and turned to bertha you are coming to new york mrs haney  i dont know she said we may  if you do dont fail to let me know i would like to see you  all right said bertha ill send you a line and her frank smile made him sorry to say goodbye even for the day  as mart was going up the elevator he sighed and said it takes all kinds of people to make up a worldmr hummockstone is wan of the tothers he has a grouch agin the universe sure but hes been housin a gnawin serpent how twill all end i dunno  when alone in her room berthas mind again reverted to ben fordyce as she compared him with humiston he seemed handsomer and more boyishly frank than ever what did joe moss mean by calling mr humiston blasé she had seen that word in novels and it always meant something wicked how could this weary sick man be wicked she pitied him and wished to help him why should he take so much interest in me he dont have to of course the mosses are nice to me on congdons account but why does this great artist want me to come to his studio in new york he talks poor so maybe he wants me to buy some of his pictures that her money was a lure for wasps she did not yet realize that the waiters and clerks buzzed round her because she was rich she knew but that these men who talked of beauty and the higher life could flatter her with attentions with a base motive was incredible  she was shrewd as her yankee forbears but she was also an idealist and these artist folk now seemed to her the highest types she had ever known or was likely to know she felt the mystery and the power in humistons personality and his bitter and rebellious almost blasphemous words were counterpoised by his paintings which she acknowledged to be beautifultoo beautiful for her to comprehend he looked like a man of sorrow and weary of battle and she longed to know more about him when he was not fierce he was melancholy evidently his life had been a failure why shouldnt i buy some of his pictures she asked herself  hitherto the answer to any such question had been can we afford it but now another and deeper query came in answer like an echo is it right to spend mart haneys money i am only his trained nurse not his wife and she now knew that she could not be his wife she shrank from the weight of his hand and each day made clearer the wide spaces of years of family of ideals which lay between them the kiss ben fordyce had pressed upon her lips had brought this revelation but of this she was not yet aware she was only conscious of a growing dread of the future her duties as his nurse were lightening lucius indeed now took many of her tasks upon himself and she no longer helped him with his shoes or coat and what was still more significant she could not calmly think of going back to these wifely services  she dwelt treacherously on haneys own admission that she had been in a sense entrapped he had believed himself a dying man at the time and she had been too excited too exalted by the lurid romance of the scene to be clear about anything save the wish and the will to save him and now she knew that at bottom of all her willingness to serve him lay the consciousness that he was on his deathbed afterwards he had been to her only a bighearted generous friend in need of love and companionship this understanding had made it easy for her to prepare his meals to help him as a nurse would help him to dress and undress she had lost all of the fear and much of the admiration in which she used to greet him as he swung into the office of her little hotel he had become to her an invalid a child to be jollied and humored and yet respected for no one could have been kinder or more scrupulously just than he and it was the recollection of all his acts of selfsacrifice and loving patience which gave her assurance that he would never require obedience though he might sue for it  her danger lay in herself if he does ask me to be his real wifethen i must either agree or leave it wont be right for me to take all these benefits unless  and with this thought the big house in the springs the sleek horses their shining carriages the autocar her dresses the service of the big hotel and the consideration her husbands money gave to her all assumed a new and corrupting lustre she was growing accustomed to luxury and the thought of giving it up made her shiver like one who faces a plunge into a dark night and an icy river besides her sacrifice would involve others her mother her brother were already roundly ensnared in marts bounty  her head was aching with it all when a comforting thought came to her it was not necessary to decide it at that moment and with a sigh of relief she threw it aside and sat down to write a letter to her mother  i ought to have written before but ive been jumped right into the middle of things here the letters frank congdon gave me took me into an artistic bunch about as gay and queer as frank is but theyve been mighty nice to me ive been setting for my bust to mr moss who is a sculptor he has a big studio clear on the top of one of the tallest blocks here and has some dandy lamps and things ive bought some to bring back i met a mr humiston there from new york and he made a sketch of mewants me to see his studio in new york i dont know whether ill go on or let mart go with lucius lucius is all righti dont see how i got on without him he knows everything i wish i had half the education hes got hes up on all the society ways and puts me on for instance he told me the nice thing would be to give a dinner to this artist push and to the people that dorothy give me a letter to and im going to do it lucius will look out for the whole thing you should see the way the waiters tend i reckon lucius has told em were made of money im afraid were getting spoilt muzz it would be pretty tough to go back to the hotel now wouldnt it  we went to see marts sister fanny her house was a sight it was clean enough but litteredwell litter is no name for itbut shes a good old thing and so is mcardle he sat and looked at us the whole time like a turkey blind in one eyenever said a word the whole time but pass the ptaties i liked him though hes a kind of sculptor toomakes patterns for all these little acorns and leaves and dofunnies on stoves theyve got fortyleven children and need help and im perfectly willing mart should help em were looking up houses now hes going to buy a place for em on the west side wednesday night i went to see the doctor brents dorothys friends they had a dinnervery nice but they all kind o sat round and waited for us to perform i guess they thought we were mountain lions but they didnt make much out o me they was one chap there with goggles who looked at mart like an undertaker hes a scientific doctorone of these fellers that invent new ways of doing things his name is halliday i liked dr brent pretty wellbut mrs brent only soso the doctor wants to dagnose marts casesays it wont cost a cent we all went to a show at night and the captain was just about petered to a point hes better though the lower altitude helps his circulation i guess his heart is affected hes afraid now he wont ever be able to go back to the mines he wants to slide on to new york and see his father and wants me to gobut id rather come homeim homesick for the hills theyre nice to me herebut i want to see the old peak once more tell here she wrote ben and blotted it tell mr fordyce that were all right and to keep us posted every day we see by the papers that the mineowners are going to throw the unions out of business if they try that theyll be war again well be home soonor at least i will im getting homesicker every minute as i write  she added a postscript dont show my letters to any one i wish id a had a little more schooling     chapter xix  the farther east   haney visibly brightened as the days went by and took long rides in his auto sometimes with bertha sometimes alone with lucius and now and then with some old acquaintance who having seen his name in the paper ventured to call they were not very savory characters to tell the truth and he did not always introduce them to bertha but as his health improved he called upon a few of the more reputable of them billiardtable agents and the like of that and to these proudly exhibited his wife  bertha had hitherto accepted this with boyish tolerance but now it irritated her some of these visitors presumed on her husbands past and treated her with a certain freedom of tone and looseness of tongue which made plain even to her unsuspecting nature that they put no high value on her virtuein fact one fellow went so far as to facetiously ask where did mart find you are there any more out there and she felt the insult though she did not know how to resent it  haney so astute in many things saw nothing out of the way in this offhand treatment of his wife he would have killed the man who dared to touch her and yet he stood smilingly by while some chance acquaintance treated her as if she had been picked out of a denver gutter this threw bertha upon her own defence and at last she made even impudence humble itself she carried herself like a young warrior sure of her power and quick of defence  she refused to invite her husbands friends to lunch and the first real argument she had thus far held with him came about in this way she said yes you can ask mr black or mr brown to dinner but i wont set at the same table with them  why not he asked  because theyre not the kind of men i want to eat with she bluntly replied theyre just a little too coarse for me  theyre good business men and have fine homes  do they invite you to their homes  they do not he admitted but they mayafter our dinner  lucius says its their business to lead outand he knows i dont mind your lunching these dubs every day if you want to but i keep clear of em i tell you those  and so it fell out that while she was going about with the mosses and their kind mart was explaining to black and brown that his wife was a little shy you see she grew up in the hills like a doe antelope and its hard for her to get wonted to the noise of a great city he laboriously set forth but at heart he did not blame her he was coming to find them a little coarse himself  humiston was deeply enthralled by berthas odd speech her beauty her calm use of money and lingered on day by day spending nearly all his time at mosss studio or at the hotel seeking mrs haneys company he had never met her like and confessed as much to moss who jocularly retorted thats saying a good dealfor youve seen quite a few  humiston ignored this thrust she has beauty imagination and immense possibilities she dont know herself when she wakes up to her power then look out she cant go on long with this old wornout gambler  oh haney isnt such a beast as you make him out bertha told me he had never crossed her will hes really very kind and generous  that may be true and yet hes a millstone about her neck its a shamea waste of beautyfor the girl is a beauty  it was with a sense of relief that moss heard bertha say to his wife i guess ive had enough of this its me to the high ground tomorrow  arent you going on to the metropolis  i dont think it im hungry for the peaksand besides our horses need exercise i think ill pull out for the west tomorrow and leave the captain and lucius to go east together i dont believe i need new york  to this arrangement haney reluctantly consented youre missin a whole lot bertie i dont feel right in goin on to babylon without ye i reckon youd better reconsider the motion however ill not be gone long and if i find the old dad hearty i may bring him home with me hes liable to be livin with john donahue charles said he was a shiffless whelp and theres no telling how hes treating the old man anyhow ill let you know  she relented a little mabe i ought to go i hate to see you starting off alone  sure now dont ye worry darling lucius is handy as a bootjack and well get along fine besides i may come back immegitly for them mineowners are cooking a hellbroth for us all havin a governor on their side now they must set out to show their power  ben kept them supplied with home papers and as bertha took up one of these journals she found herself played upon by familiar forms and faces the very names of the streets were an appeal she saw herself sporting with her hounds riding with fordyce over the flowery mesa or facing him in his sunbright office discussing the worlds events and deciding upon their own policies and expenditures she grew very homesick as these pleasant familiar pictures freshened in her vision and her faith in bens honesty and essential goodness came back to her moreover her mind was not at rest regarding haney much as she longed to go home she felt it her duty to remain with him and as she lay in her bed she thought of him with much the same pity a daughter feels for a disabled father hes given me a whole loti ought to stay by him  she admitted also a flutter of fear at thought of meeting ben fordyce alone and this unformulated distrust of herself decided her at last to go on with mart and to have him for shield and armor when she returned to the springs  there are certain ways in which books instruct womenand men too for that matterbut there are other and more vital processes in which only experience individual or inherited teaches in her desultory reading little mrs haney like every other citizen had taken imaginative part in many murders seductions and marital infidelities and yet the motives for such deeds had never before seemed human now the dark places in the divorce trials the obscure charges in the testimony of deserted wives were suddenly illumined she realized how easy it would be to make trouble between mart and herself she understood the stain those strangers in the car could put upon her and she trembled at the mere thought of marts inquiring eyes when he should know of it why should he know of it it was all over and done with there was only one thing to doforget it  surely life was growing complex with bewildering swiftness the experiences of a woman of the world were advancing upon her and she with no brother or father to be her guard or friend to give her character with a husband whose very name and face were injuries was finding men in the centres of culture quite as predatory as among the hills where mart haneys fame still made his glance a warning these few weeks in chicago had added a year to her development but she dared not face ben fordyce alonenot just yetnot till her mind had cleared  in the midst of her doubt of herself and of him a message came which made all other news of no account he was on his way to chicago to consult mart so the words ran but in her soul she knew he was coming to see her was it to test her had he taken silence for consent was he about to try her faith in him and her loyalty to her husband  his telegram read coming on important business that might mean concerning the mineon the surface but beneath ran something more vital to them both than any mine or labor war something which developed in the girl both fear and wonderfear of the power that came from his eyes wonder of the world his love had already opened to her what was the meaning of this mad sweet riot of the bloodthis forgetfulness of all the rest of the worldthis longing which was both pleasure and pain doubt and delight which turned her face to the west as though through a long shining vista she saw loves messenger speeding towards her  sleep kept afar and she lay restlessly turning till long after midnight and when she slept she dreamed not of him but of sibley and her mother and the toilfilled untroubled days of her girlhood she rose early next morning and awaited his coming with more of physical weakness as well as of uncertainty of mind than she had ever known before  haney was also up and about an hour ahead of his schedule sure that bens business concerned the mine its the labor war breaking out again he repeated i feel it in my bones if it is back i go for the boys will be nading me  they went to the station in their autocar but at berthas suggestion mart sent lucius in to meet their attorney and to direct him where to find them the young wife had a feeling that to await him at the gate might give him a false notion of her purpose she grew faint and her throat contracted as if a strong hand clutched it as she saw his tall form advancing but almost instantly his frank and eager face his clear glance his simple and cordial greeting disarmed her transmuted her halfshaped doubts into golden faith he was true and goodof that she was completely reassured her spirits soared and the glow came back to her cheek  fordyce looking up at her was filled with astonishment at the picture of grace and ease which she presented as she leaned to take his hand she shone unmistakable mistress of the car while haney filled the rôle of trusted irish coachman  as he climbed in the young lawyer remarked merrily i dont know whether i approve of this extravagance or not he tapped the car door  its mighty handy for the captain she replied you see he cant get round in the streetcars very well and he says this is cheaper than cabs in the long run  it has never proved economical to me but it is handy he answered with admiration of her growing mastery of wealth  and so with something fiercely beating in their hearts these youthful warriors struggled to be true to othersfighting against themselves as against domestic traitors while they talked of the mine the state judiciary the operators and the unions their words were impersonal prosaic of association but their eyes spoke of love as the diamond speaks of light bens voice carefully controlled was vibrant with the poetry that comes but once in the life of a man and she listened in that perfect content which makes gold and glory but the decorations of the palace where adoration dwells  the great smoky thunderous city somehow added to the sweetness of the meetingmade it the more precious like a song in a tempest it seemed to ben fordyce as if he had never really lived before the very need of concealment gave his unspoken passion a singular qualitya tang of the wilding the dangersome which his intimacy with alice had never possessed  the haneys suite of rooms at the hotel called for comment surely haney is feeling the power of moneybut why not who has a better right to lovely things than bertha then aloud he repeated how well youre lookingboth of you city life agrees with you i never saw you look so well  this remark innocent on its surface brought selfconsciousness to bertha for the light of his glance expressed more than admiration and even as they stood facing each other alive to the same disturbing flush lucius called haney from the room leaving them alone together the moment of bens trial had come  for a few seconds the young wife waited in breathless silence for him to speak a sense of her own wordlessness lying like a weight upon her into the cloud of her confusion his voice came bringing confidence and calm i feel that you have forgiven meyour eyes seem to say so i couldnt blame you if you despised me i wont say my feeling has changed for it hasnt it may be wrong to say soit is wrong but i cant help it please tell me that you forgive me i will be happier if you do and i will never offend again his accent was at once softly pleading and manly and as she raised her eyes to his in restored selfconfidence she murmured a quaint short reassuring phrase oh thats all right her glance so shy so appealing united to the halfhumorous words of her reply were so surely of the mountainwest that ben was quite swept from the high ground of his resolution and his hands leaped towards her with an almost irresistible embracing impulse you sweet girl he exclaimed  dont she said starting back in alarmdont  his face changed instantly the clear candor of his voice reassured her dont be afraid i mean what i said you need have no fear that ithat my offence will be repeated then with intent to demonstrate his selfcommand he abruptly changed the subject the congdons sent their love to you and miss franklin commissioned me to tell you that she will give you all her time next summerif you wish her to do so  she was glad of this message and added i need her sure thing every day i spend here makes me seem like mary anni dont see how people can talk as smooth as they do im crazy to get to school again and make up for lost time joe moss makes me feel like a lead quarter being here with all these nice people and not able to talk with them is no fun couldnt i whirl in and go to school somewhere back here  oh no that isnt necessary you are getting your education by associationyou are improving very fast  her face lighted up am i do you mean it  i do mean it no one would knowto see you herethat you had not enjoyed all the advantages  oh yes but im such a bluff when i open my mouth they all begin to grin theyre onto my game all right  he smiled thats because of your picturesque phrasesthey like to hear you speak i assure you no one would think of calling you awkward oror lacking inin charm  haneys return cut short this defensive dialogue and with a sense of relief bertha retreatedalmost fled to her roomleaving the two men to discuss their business  at the moment she had no wish to participate in a labor controversy she was entirely the woman at last roused to the overpowering value of her own inheritance her desire to manage to calculate to plan her husbands affairs was gone and in its place was a willingness to submit a wish for protection which she had not hitherto acknowledged she brooded for a time on bens words then hurriedly began to dresswith illogical desire to make herself beautiful in his eyes as she reentered the room she caught haneys repeated declarationi will be loyal to the menand bens reply  very well ill go back and do the best i can to keep them in line but williams says the governor is entirely on the side of the mineoperators  does he retorted haney well you say to the governor that mart haney was a gambler and saloonkeeper during the other war and now that hes a mineowner with money to hire a regiment of deppyties his heart is with the redneckersjust where it was owning a paying mine has not changed me heart to a stone  ben as well as bertha understood the pride he took in not whiffling with the shift of wind but at the same time he considered it a foolish kind of loyalty very well ill take the sixoclock train tonight in order to be on hand  whats the rush said haney stay on a day or two and see the town with ustis a great show  bertha reentering at this moment in her shining gown put the young attorneys spartan resolution to rout he stammered i ought to be on the ground before the mineowners begin to open fire and besidesalice is not very well  at the mention of alices name berthas glance wavered and her eyelids fell she did not urge him to stay and haney spoke up heartily im sorry to hear shes not well she was pretty as a rose the night of the dinner  she lives on her nerves ben replied falling into sadness one day shes up in the clouds and dancing the next shes flat in her bed in a darkened room unwilling to see anybody  tis the way of the white death thought haney but he spoke hopefully well spring is here and a long summer before hershell be herself against october  i trust so said ben but bertha could see that he was losing hope and that his life was being darkened by the presence of the death angel  haney changed the current of all their thinking by saying to bertha if you are minded to go home now is your chance acushla you can return with mr fordyce while lucius and i go on to new york the morning  no no she cried out in a panic no i am going with youi want to see new york myself she added in justification the thought of the long journey with ben fordyce filled her with a kind of terror a feeling she had never known before she needed protection against herself  very well said haney thats settled now lets show mr fordyce the town  ben put aside his doubt and went forth with them resolute to make a merry day of it he seemed to regain all his carefree temper but bertha remained uneasy and at times abnormally distraught she spoke with effort and listened badly so busily was she wrought upon by unbidden thoughts the question of her lovers disloyalty to alice heath strange to say had not hitherto troubled herso selfishly so childishly had her own relationship to him filled her mind she now saw that alice heath was as deeply concerned in bens relationship to her as haney and the picture of the poor pale despairing lady worn with weeping persistently came between her and the scenes mart pointed out on their trips about the city did alice knowdid she suspect was that why she was sinking lower and lower into the shadow  with these questions to be answered as well as those she had already put to herself concerning mart she could not enjoy the days outing she rode through the parks with cold hands and white lips and sat amid the color and bustle and light of the diningroom with only spasmodic return of her humorous girlish self the love which shone from bens admiring eyes only added to her uneasiness  she was very lovely in a new gown that disclosed her firm rounded young bosom like a rosebud within its calyxthe distraction upon her brow somehow adding to the charm of her faceand ben thought her the most wonderful girl he had ever known so outwardly at ease and in command was she could any one he thought be more swiftly adaptable  they went to the theatre and her beauty and her curiously unsmiling face aroused the admiration and curiosity of many others of those who saw her at last under the influence of the music her eyes lost their shadow and grew tender and wistful she ceased to question herself and gave herself up to the joy of the moment the play and the melodyhackneyed to many of those presentappealed to her imagination liberating her from the earth and all its concerns she turned to ben with eyes of rapture saying isnt it lovely  and he to whom the music was outworn and a little shoddy instantly agreed yes it is very beautiful and he meant it for her pleasure in it brought back a knowledge of the charm it had once possessed  they dined together at the hotel but the thought of bens departure brought a pang into berthas heart and she fell back into her uneasy distracted musing she was being tempted through her husband who repeated with the halfforgetfulness of age and weakness youd better go back with mr fordyce bertie but there was something stronger than her individual will in her replysome racial resolution which came down the line of her good ancestry and with almost angry outcry she answered  theres no use talking that im going with you and with this she ended the outward siege but the inward battle was not closed till she had taken and dropped the hand her lover held out in parting next morning and even then she turned away with his eyes and the tender cadences of his voice imprinted so vividly on her memory that she could not banish them and she set face towards the farther east with the contest of duty and desire still going forward in her blood     chapter xx  bertha meets manhattan   it was a green land in which she woke the leaves were just putting forth their feathery fronds of foliage and the shorn lawns the waving floods of growing wheat and the smooth slopes of pastures presented pleasant pictures to the mountainborn girl these thickly peopled farmlands the almost contiguous villages the constant passing of trains roused in her a surprise and wonder which left her silent such weight of human life such swarming populations appalled her how did they all live  at breakfast haney was in unusual flow of spirits twas here i rode the trucks of a freightcar he said once and again in this town i slept all night on a bench in the depot i know every tie from here to syracuse i wonder is the station agent living yet twould warm me heart to toss him out ten dollars for that nights lodging them was the great days in syracuse i worked for a liverystableman as hostler and i would have gone hungry but for the scullion maggie crosseyed was maggie but her heart beat warm for the lad in the loft and manys the plates of beef and bowls of hot soup she handed to mepoor girl id like to know where she is had i the power of locomotion id look her up too  again bertha was brought face to face with the great sacrifice she was obscurely contemplating the magic potency of money was brought before her eyes as she contrasted the ragged homeless boy with the man who sat beside her the fact that he had not earned the money only made its magic the more clearly inherent in the gold itself it panoplied the thiefs carriage it made dwarfs admirable and gave dignity and honor to the lowly it made it possible for marshall haney to retrace in royal splendor the perilous and painful journey he had made into the west some thirty years agorewarding with regal generosity those who threw him a broken steak or a halfeaten rolland she could imaginatively enter into the exquisite pleasure this largess gave the man  and there was father mcbreen he resumed with a chucklesure the mark of satan is on the by he used to say every time my mother told him of one of my divilments and he was right all the same id like to drop in on him and surprise him with a checkat the moment he forgot that he was old and a cripplejust to let him know the divil hadnt claimed me yet id like to show him me wife he put his hand on her arm and smiled sure the old man would revise his prediction could he see you he might say the divil had got youbut he couldnt pity me  she turned him aside from this by saying i reckon new york is a great deal bigger than chicago mr moss says it makes any other town seem like a county seat im dead leery of it i want to see it but it just naturally locoes me to think of it  tis the only place to spend moneyso the boys tell me ive never been there but once and then only for three days i went on to get a man when i was sheriff in san juan i saw it then mostly as a wonderful fine swamp to lose a thief in  did you get your man she asked with formal interest  i did soand nearly died for want of sleep on the way home he was a desprit character was black hosay but i linked him to me arm and tuck chances  once she had listened to these stories with eager interest now they were but empty boastingso deeply inwrought was her soul with matters that more nearly concerned her womans need and womans nature the potency of goldcould any magic be greater they lived like folk in a flying palace with books and papers easychairs and cardtables eating carefully cooked meals served by attendants as considerate and as constant as those at their own fireside the broad windows gave streaming panorama of town and country hill and river and the young wife accepted it all with the haughty air of one who is wearied with splendor but inwardly the knowledge that it all came to haney as to her unearned troubled her luck was his god but she while accepting from him these marvellous shining gifts had another godone derived from her saxon ancestors one to whom luxury was akin to harlotry  they left the train at albany and went to the best hotel in the city to spend the night tomorrow ill see if i can find anybody who knows where the old dad is said haney tis too late and im too weary to do it tonight  bertha was tired toomentally wearied and glad of a chance to be alone she went at once to her room leaving the captain and lucius busy with the troy directory  haney set about his search next day with the eager zeal of a lad he took an almost childish pleasure in displaying his goodfortune through lucius he hired an autocar as good as the one he had left in chicago and together he and bertha rode into his native town up into the bleak brickpaved ward through which he had roamed when a cub it had changed of course as all things american must but it was so much the same after all that he could point out the alleys where he used to toss pennies and play cards and fight every corner was historic to him phil obrien used to keep saloon hereand ive earned many a dime sweepin out for his barkeeper i was never a drunken lad he gravely said i dont know whyi had all the chance there was ive been moderate of drink all me life no i wont say thatill say i tuck it as it came with no fear and no favor when playin i always let it aloneit spiled me nervei let the other felly do the drinkin  some of the signs were unchanged and he sent lucius in to ask the proprietor of the hoosac market to step out and when he appeared a plump man with closeclipped gray hair and smoothly shaven face he shouted tis old ottojust the man i nade howdy otto siegel  siegel shaded his eyes and looked up at haney you haff the edventege off me alretty  im mart haneyyou remember mart haney  siegel grasped the situation sure vy how you vass dis dime eh vell vellyou gome pack in style aint it your daughteryes  my wife said haney  siegel raised a fat arm which a dirty blue undershirt imperfectly draped and bertha shook hands with curt politeness vell vell mart you must haff struck a coldmine by now hah  thats what  vell vell and i licked you fer hookin apples off me vonceaind dot right  mart grinned i reckon thats so i said id cut you in two when i grew up all boys say

mostly dey are scattered some are teadtmany are teadt he added on second thought  well goodluck and haney reached down to shake hands again and the machine began to whiz tell all the boys how  for half an hour they ran about the streets at his direction while he talked on about his youthful joys and sorrows you wouldnt suppose a lad could have any fun in such a place as this he said musingly but i did i was a careless godivil pup and had a power of friends and these alleys and bare brick walls were the only playground we had you cant cheat a boyhes goin to have a good time if he has three grains of corn in his belly and a place to sleep when hes tired i was all right till me old dad started to put me into the factory to work then i broke loose i could work for an hour or two as hard as anny one but a whole long daynot for mart right there i decided to emigrate and grow up with the injuns  bertha listened to his musing comment with a new light upon his life she had little cause for the feeling of disgust which came to her while studying the scenes of his boyhoodher own childhood had been almost as humble almost as cheerlessand yet she could not prevent a sinking at the heart the gambler so picturesque in his wickedness was becoming commonplace he rose from such petty conditions after all  thus far the question of his family relations had not troubled her very much for aside from the chance coming of charles she had had little opportunity of knowing anything about the haneys and they had seemed a very long way off but now as she was rushing down upon new york city with the promise of not only finding the father but of taking him back with them to live she began to doubt his character was of the greatest importance in view of his taking a seat beside their fire  it was singular it was bewildering this change in her estimate of marshall haney the deeper he sank in reminiscent meditation the farther he withdrew from the bold and splendid freebooter he had once seemed to her she was now unjust to him for he was still capable of what his kind call standing pat the roughandready borderman was still housed under the same thatch of hair with the sentimental old irishman and yet it would have sorely puzzled the keenest observer to discover the relationship of that handsome rather seriousbrowed richly clothed young woman and her big elderly garrulous companion bertha was not easy to classify in herself for she gave out an air of reserve not readily accounted for she looked to be the wellclothed carefully reared american girl but her gestures the silent unsmiling way in which she received what was said to hersomething indefinably alert and selfmasterful without being selfconsciousgave her a mysterious charm  she was profoundly absorbed in the great historic river on her right and yet she did not cry out as other girls of her age would have done she read her folder and kept vigilant eyes upon all the passing points of interesteven as haney rumbled on about charles and his father and katemore than half distraught by the vague recollections she had of her school histories and geographies how little she knew i must buckle down to some kind of study she repeatedly said to herself as if it helped her to a more inflexible resolution  soon the mighty city and its fabled seashore began to scare her soul with vague alarms and exultations manhattan was as remote to her as london and as splendidly alien as paris it was indeed both london and paris to her its millions of people appalled her how could so many folk live in one place  again the magic power of money bucklered her it was good to think that they were to go to the best hotels and that she had no need to trouble herself about anything for lucius settled everything he telegraphed for rooms he assembled all their baggage and tipped their porters and when they rushed into the long tunnel in harlem he was free to take the captain by the arm and help him to the forward end of the car ready to alight leaving bertha to follow without so much as a satchel to burden her arm haney had accepted lucius assurance that the park palace was the smart hostelry and to this they drove as to some unknown inn in a foreign capital  it was gorgeous enough to belong in the tale of aladdins lampa palace in very truth with entrancehall in keeping with the glittering roaring avenue through which they drove and which was to bertha quite as strange as a boulevard in berlin would have been lucius conducted them into the receptionroom with an air of proprietorship and soon had waiters maids and bellboys jumping his management was masterful he knew just what time to give each man and just how much to say concerning his master and mistress he conveyed to the clerk that while captain haney didnt want any foolish display he liked things comfortable round him and the colored mans tone as he spoke that word comfortable was farreaching in effect the best available places were put at his command  bertha accepted it all with cold impassivity it was only a little higher gloss a little more glitter than they had suffered in chicago and she was getting used to seeing men in braid and buttons hustle when she came near the suite of rooms to which they were conducted looked out on fifth avenue as lucius proudly explained and from their windows he designated some of the houses of the millionaires who receive the homage of the less rich and of the very poor which only nobility can command in europe bertha betrayed no eager interest in these notables but she was very deeply impressed by the farfamed avenue which was already thickening with the daily fiveoclock parade of carriages autocars and pedestrians  lucius explained this custom and said if youd like to go out ill get a car  lets do it she exclaimed to haney  sure get one these smellwagons must have been invented for cripples like me  bertha took that ride in the spirit of one who never expects to do it again and so deeply did the city print itself upon her memory that she was able to recall years afterwards a hundred of its glittering points angles and facets she felt herself upborne by money without haneys bankbook she would have been merely one of those minute insects who timidly sought to cross the street and yet philosophers marvel at the race men make for gold so long as silken parasols and automobiles mad with pride are keenly enjoyed so long will americansand all others who have them notstruggle for them for they are not only the signs of distinction and luxury they are delights a private car is not merely display it is comfort to have a suite of rooms at the park palace is not all show it makes for homely ease cleanliness repose and these people riding imperiously to and fro in fifth avenue buy not merely diamonds but wellcooked food warm and shining raiment and freedom from the scramble on the pave  some understanding of all this was beating home to berthas head and heart she had as yet no keen desire for the glitter of wealth but its grateful shelter its power to defend and nurture were qualities which had begun to make its lure almost irresistible haney liked the autocar not for its red and gold which delighted lucius but for its handiness in taking him about the city it saved him from climbing in and out of a high car door it was swifter and safer than a carriage therefore he was ready to purchase its speed and convenience he cared little for the sensation he would create in riding up to his sisters door in brooklyn though he chuckled mightily at the thought of what his old dad would say and as they claimed a place among the millionaires he broke into a sly smile if ever a bogtrotter landed at castle garden me father was wan o them i can remember the hat he wore twas a stovepipe sure enough it had no rim at all at all it was fuzzy as a cat if he didnt have a green vest it was a wonder he took me to see a play once just to show me how he did look he was onto his own curves was old dad i hope hes livin yet id like to take him up the avenue in this car and hear the speel hed put up  bertha was in growing uneasiness and when alone at the close of her wonderful ride through this marvellous city so clean so vast so packed with stores of all things rich and beautiful she went to her room in a blur of doubt now that an unspoken halfformed resolution to free herself was in her mind she realized that every extravagance like this ride these gorgeous rooms sank her deeper into helpless indebtedness to marshall haney and this knowledge now took away the keen edge of her delight making her food bitter and her pillow hot  in the midst of her troubled thinking lucius knocked at the door to ask will you go down to dinner or shall i have it sent up  oh no ill go down  they dress for dinner maam  do they whatll i wear  he considered a moment any light silksemidress will do ill send a maid in to help you  no i dont need a maid theyre a nuisance she quickly answered  lucius attitude towards her was more than respectfulit was paternal for she made no more secret of her early condition than haney and the colored man enjoyed serving them he seemed perfectly happy in advising cautioning directing them and was deeply impressed with their powers of adaptabilitywas in truth developing a genuine affection for them both he was a lonely little man bertha had learned with no near kin in the states and the fact that he came from an island in the sea made him less of a nigger to the captain who had the usual amount of prejudice against both black and red men  the highkeyed sumptuous dininghall was filled with small tables exquisitely furnished and the carpets underfoot thickpiled and deeptoned gave a singular solemnity to the function of eating it was a temple raised to the glory of terrapin and alligator pears and as the captain moved slowly across the aisles closely attended by a zealous waiter he smiled and said to his wife this is a long ways from sibley and the golden eagle bertie dont you think  it sure is she replied and her laughing lips and big pansypurple eyes made her seem very young and very gay again  around her men and women in evening dress were feeding subduedly while bevies of hawklike waiters swooped and circled bearing platters tureens and baskets of iced winebottles it made the hotel at chicago appear like a plain oldfashioned tavern so remote so european so lavish and yet so exaggeratedly quiet was this service some of the women at the tables were spangled like the queens of the stage mainly they were not only gloriously gowned but in harmony with the sumptuous beauty around them their adornments made bertha feel very rural and very shy  i wish i was younger the captain said id take ye to the theatre tonight but im too tired i could go for a couple of hours butto miss me sleep  dont think of it she hastened to command i dont want to go im just about all in myself  tis a shame darlin surely it is to keep you from havin a good time just because i am an old helpless side o beef tis not in me heart to play dog in the manger bertie if yed like to go do so lucius will take ye  nit she curtly replied you rest up and well go tomorrow night we might take another turn and see the town by electric light you could kind o lean back in the car and take it easy  this they did and it was more moving more appalling to the girl than by day the fury of traffic on broadway the crowds of people the endless strings of brilliantly lighted streetcars the floods of busses autocars cabs and carriages poured in upon the girls receptive brain a tide of perceptions of the citys wealth power and complexity of social life which amazed while it exalted her the idea that she might share in all this dazzled her we could live here she thought the captains income would keep us just anyway we wanted to live but a vision of her own beautiful house under the shadow of the great peak came back to reproach her her horses and dogs awaited her this tumultuous island was only a place to visit after all  do you suppose this goes on every night she said to haney as they turned off broadway  i reckon it does he said how is that lucius he asked is this a special performance or does the old town do this every night  in the season yes sir its the last week of the opera and itll be quieter now till november  they returned to their hotel with a sense of having touched the ultimate in civic splendor human pride and social complexity new york had met most of their ideals they were glad it was on american soil and in the nations metropolis but after all it remained alien and mysterious of a rank with paris and londonthe gateway city of the nation where the old world meets and mingles with the new     chapter xxi  bertha makes a promise   as for marshall haney as he went about new york and brooklyn in search of his relations he was astounded at the translation of the irish laborer into something else in my time when i left troy all the work in the streets was done by micks as they called em now theyre gonewhisked away as yed sweep away a swarm of red ants and heres these black dagos in their places wheres the irishman goneup or down thats whats eatin me is he dead or translated to a higher speer tis a mysterious dispensation and troubles me much  he found a good many donahues in brooklyn and plenty of them barkeepers and after hed pulled up half a dozen times at these joints bertha began to pout she didnt like such places and as they were riding in a showy autocar the grandest lucius could secure they were pretty middling noticeable at last she said more sharply than she had ever spoken to him before mart i dont want any more of this if you want to visit all the saloons in brooklyn i dont heres where i get out  he was instantly remorseful i was thinkin of that myself bertie lucius and i will go on alone well send you back to the hotel in the mobile whilst we take a hack  half doubting half glad she consented to this arrangement and was soon whirling back towards the ferry her guilty feeling giving place to a sense of relief as if a huge weight had been lifted from her shouldersfor a moment she began to understand that half the pleasure she had taken in her hours with moss and humiston lay in the freedom from her husbands overshadowing presence he was not a man to be ignored as she had seen wives ignore and put aside their meek partners marshall haney even yet was a dominating personality even though his family affairs were so insistent and so difficult to manage or explain if the father came her joy in her home would be gone and yet she had no right to refuse him shelter  at the same time she was less sure of her place in the world now that she was alone she had the feeling that if anything were to happenif the motorman should demand his pay at the door or the hotelkeeper refuse to go her bond she would be helpless the captain for all his shortcomings and physical disability was master of every situation he had been schooled by stern powers and his capabilities of defence were still equal to almost any need  on the ferryboat she found herself surrounded by the swarms of people who are forever calculating expenditures who never desert a garment and who finger a nickel lovingly and she caught them looking at her as upon one of those who enjoy without earning it the product of their toil they made way for her as she got down and walked to the railing as they would have done for a millionaires daughter a little surlily and she divined without understanding this enmity but was too exalted by the glittering bay with its romance of ship and sea and shore and town to very much mind what her threadbare fellowpassengers thought of her these darkhulled oceangoing vessels these alien flags widened her horizondeepened her sense of the earths wonder and the wideflung nerves of national interest from this sealevel she looked up in fancy to her brothers ranch near sibley as at a cabin on a mountainside how still and faint and far it seemed at the moment  at the word of the chauffeur she climbed back into her car returning to the isolation which money now provided for her and so girt about with velvet and costly wood and gilding she rode up through the tearing throngs of the wharf whirling past cars and trucks outspeeding cabs and carriages protected by a gamblers name royally isolated and defensible by his money as she spun through fifth avenue so smooth of pave so crowded so sparkling so farreaching in its suggestions of security and power the girls soul entered upon a new and fierce phase of its struggle  it was a larger and more absorbing fairy story than any in the arabian nights without marshall haney without the gold he brought she could never have even looked upon this scene she would at this moment have been standing inside her little counter at the golden eagle selling cigars to some brakeman or cowboy ed winchell would be coming to ask her as usual to marry him and her mother would still be toiling in the hot kitchen or be at rest in her grave did ever aladdins lamp translate its owner farther or lift him higher was not her refusal to be marshall haneys wife the basest ingratitude  not merely so but the girl felt in herself potentialities not yet drawn upon unlimited capabilities leading towards the accomplishment of good money had not merely the magic of exalting educating refining and ennobling the individual herself it had radiating transforming power for others it could diffuse warmth like a flame and send forth joy like a bell with it i am safe strong i can help the poor without it i am only a struggling girl like millions of others with no chance and no power to aid those who suffer but at this point her love reentered and her sense of right was confused after all the heart ruled  at the hotel entrance the head porter was waiting to help her out and the chauffeur without a word or look of reminder puffed away secure in the reputation lucius had given to haney as she went to her room the maid met her with gentle solicitude and after attending to her needs considerately withdrew leaving her deepsunk in troubled musing  up to the coming of ben fordyce she had accepted all that haney gave her as from one good friend to another once having satisfied herself that the money was clean of any taint from gamblinghall and saloon she had not hesitated to use it but now something was rising within her which changed the current of her purpose haney was no longer before the bar of her conscience the soul under question was her own dimly yet with evergrowing definiteness she saw the moment of decision approach she must soon decide whether to continue on the smooth broad highway with haney or to return to the mountaintrail from which he had taken her  while still she sat sombrely looking out over the citys roofs humistons card was brought to her and at the moment in her loneliness and doubt he seemed like an old friend tell him to come up she said with instant cordiality and her face shone with innocent pleasure when she met him im mighty glad to see you she frankly said in greeting  he misconceived her feeling and took advantage of it to retain her hand i assure you i am delighted to find you again  i thought youd forgot us  his eyes expressed a bold admiration as he answered i have done nothing but remember you ive been in pittsburg only got back to town yesterday and here i am he looked about where is the captain  she withdrew her hand hes out looking for his father hell return soon hes liable to look in any minute now  you are lovelier than ever how is the captain  pretty well he gets tired fairly easy but he feels better than he did  his look of eager intensity embarrassed her after a little pause he remarked i am holding you to your promise cant you come over to my studio this afternoon  no not today i must be here when the captain comes he may bring the old father along and hed feel lost if i should be gone maybe i could come tomorrow  dont bring the captain unless you have tohell be bored he said in the hope that she would get his full meaning i want to introduce you to some friends of mine  oh dont do that she protested im afraid of your friendstheyre all so waywised while i am hardly bridlebroke  you need not fear he replied you are most to be envied no one can have more than health wealth and youth and beauty i would not hesitate to introduce you anywhere his admiration was so outspoken so choicely worded that she could not distrust him though mrs moss had more than once hinted to her that he was not to be entirely honored he isnt a man to be careless with she had once said and yet he seemed so highminded so profoundly concerned with the beautiful world of art how could a singlehearted western girl believe ill of him he could not be evil in the ways in which men were wicked in sibley his sensitive face was too weary and his eyes too sad  he was adroit enough to make his call short and withdrew leaving a very pleasant impression in her mind she felt distinctly less lonely now that she knew he was in the city and she was still at the window musing about him when haney returned bringing his father with him  the elder haney interested and amused her in spite of her perplexitieshe was so quaintly of the old type of irishman and so absurdly small to be the father of a giant he carried a shrewd and kindly face withered and toothless yet not without a certain charm of line marts fine profile was like his sires only larger bolder and calmer  with a chuckle he introduced him bertie this is me worthless old dad and patrick though he was sidling and sidestepping with the awkwardness of a cat on wet ice still retained his celtic selfpossession  lave mart to slander the soorce av aal his good qualities he retorted he was iver an uncivil divil to meafter the day he first thrun me down the big gawk  mart took the little man by the collar and twirled him about luk at im did he ever feel the like of such cloes in his life  patrick grinned a wide silent mirthful grimace sure me heart is warmed wid em i feel as well trussed as me ladys footman  it was plain that every thread on the old man was new mart explained i stripped him to the buff and built him up plumb to his necktie which is greenthe wan thing he would have to his own taste tomorrow we go to the toothfactory  tis a waste of good money interjected patrick i ate soup  soup be damned yeve many a steak to eat with me ye contrary little baboon tis a pity if i cant do as i like with me own do as i say and be gay  patrick cackled again and his little twinkling eyes were half hid ye may load me with jewels and goold me lad but divil a once do i allow a man wid a feetlathe boringmachine to enter me head  ye have nothing to bore ye old jackass divil a rock is left to prospect inso dont fuss  bertha interjected a question where did you find him  marking up in a poolroom nice place for the father of captain haney come out o that i says or fight me and the old fox showed gooms at me and says he i notice yere crippled mart i think ill jest take what ye owe me out of yer hide they both chuckled at the recollection of it then mart went on ill not disgrace me wife by telling what the old tramp had on i tuck him by the shoulder and i said have ye anny sunday clothes i said narry a thread says he come along with me i says you cant visit my wife in the hotel till every thread on yer corpus is changed for donahue keeps a dirty place so here he isscrubbed fumigated barbered and tailored and when he gets his cellulide teeth hell make as slick a little irishman as ever left the old sod here his face became sadly tender i wish the mother was alive too id make her rustle in silks so i would heaven rest her  the fathers face grew suddenly accusing in line ye waited too long ye vagabond yer change of heart comes too late  i know iti know it but i could never find time till a man with a shotgun pointed the way to it now i have all the time there is and shes gone  in this moment of passing shadow bertha caught a glimpse of the significance of the sceneof the wonder almost alarm which filled the old mans heart as he stood there scared of the flaming splendor of the room into which the sunlight fell exaggerating its gold and pink and green but bringing out the excellence of the furnishing the richness of the silk tapestry  the old man touched a gilded chair tenderly and mart cried out lay hold man twill not rub off sit down and look about ye out with your new pipe and smoke up  he took a seat with forced confidence and looked about him i wish donahue and kate could see this  mart turned a quietly humorous eye on bertha not this trip i couldnt manage kate he explained she looks like fanonly more so and she has a litter o young donahues would make ye wonder could the world have room for them all  haney the elder had something more than the bogtrotter in him for as he grew towards a little more assurance that mart would not be thrown out of his hotel for nonpayment of bills he settled down to enjoy his glass of rare whiskey and a costly cigar with an assumption of ease that almost deceived the maid though lucius being in the secret watched him anxiously for fear he might expectorate on the rug  mart had some potographs of his house in the springs and showed them to patrick do ye see yerself smokin a pipe on that porch  i do not the father energetically replied i see meself goin the rounds of that garden with a waterinpot and a pair of shears  i thought ye was a bricklayer or is it a

to a trade sure id be layin brick in troy this day  this retort fairly blinded the sturdy little father the charge was false and yet here sat marta gentleman while still he puzzled over the dangerous acknowledgment involved in his sons accusation mart turned to bertha do ye mind the old mans spendin the rest of his days with us darlin  youre the doctor mart its your house not mine  he felt the change in her oh no it isnt its our house i never would have had it only for you he paused a moment the dad is a wellmeaning old rascal and ill go bail he dont do mischief  patrick took this up he is

object to spendin a year with you in coloraydo but dont think patrick haney is to be pinsioner on anny one not even his son  berthas heart vibrated in sympathy with this note of independence and she heartily said i hope you will come mr haney the captain is alone a good deal and youd be a comfort to him  ill consider the old man said i must have time to realize it he quaintly added i must smoke me pipe in me own garret once more and talk it all over with kate and the donahues he refused to stay to dinner with them which was a relief to lucius and went away jaunty as a bucko from county clare  he was no sooner gone from the room than bertha turned to her husband and said mart i want to talk things over with you  something in her voice as well as in the words made him turn quickly and regard her anxiously  what about what is it darlin  i have something on my mind and ive got to spit it out before i can rest tonight ive just about decided to leave you i dont feel right livin with you  he looked at her steadily but a gray pallor began to show on his face he asked quietly do ye mean to go fer good  her heart was beating fast but she bravely faced him yes mart i dont feel right living with you and spending your money the way ive been doing  why not it isnt mineits yours ye airn every cent ye spend  no i dont she cried passionately now that youre getting better and lucius has come im not even a nurse  ill send him away  no no hes worth more than i am  ill not listen to such talk bertie ye well know youre the thing most precious to me i cant live without ye his voice

do nothing to pay for what you do for me its better for me to go  she could not bring herself to be as explicit as she should have been but he was not far from understanding her real meaning as he brokenly replied ive been afraid of this my girl ive thought of it all the money i spend fer ye is but a small part of my debt you say you do nothing for me why darlin every time you come into the room or smile at me you do much for me im a selfish old wolf but im not so bad as you think i am if anny nice young felly comes alonga good square manill get off the track but i want you to let me

cant live and i darent die without yenow thats the eternal truth darlin promise ye wont goyet awhile  wordless as full of pain as he she sat silently weeping unable to carry out her resolutionunable

congdons and the mosseswhilst i am only an old brokendown skate im worse than you know i went down to sibley first with hell in me heart towards you but that soon passed awayi loved ye as a man should

whenever you say the word i hope you dont object to the old father if ye do  oh no i like him  then well take him but remember ill let no one come into our home that will trouble you id as soon have a cinder in me eye as a man i dont like sitting beside me fire and if the old man is a burden to ye out he goes he rose and came painfully to where she sat and in a voice of humble sorrow slowly said i dont ask ye to love menowim not worth it and once i thought id like a son to bear my name but tis better not ill never lay that burden upon ye all i ask is the touch of yer hand now and then and your presence when i come to dieim scared to die alone twill be a dark long journey for old mart and he wants your face to remember when he sets forth     chapter xxii  the serpents coil   lofty as jerome humiston talked and poetic as his face seemed to bertha haney he was at heart infinitely more destructive than any man she had ever known for he took a satanic delight in proving that all women were alike in their frailty he had reached also that period of decay wherein the libertine demands noveltywhere struggle is essential and to conquer easily is to fail of the joy of victory  he too had rushed to the conclusion that this girl had married an old and broken gambler for his money and that she was of those to be easily won her air of demure reserve piqued himpleased him she is no silly kitten he mentally remarked after their second meeting shes in for a big career with beauty and youth and barrels of money she will go far and i will be her guideunless i have lost my cunning she will share her fortune with me some day and i will teach her to live  he met her at the door of his studio next day with a grave and tender smile im glad youve come he said but ill have to confess that i have very little to show you here my pictures are all down at the gallery and some of them not yet hung next week they will all be in place but sit down while i boil some tea my friends who own this workshop are out theyll be in soon  i dont believe i can stay today the captain is below  please do sit down for a moment ill be hurt if you dont  the studio was a big bare barn of a place with a few broad canvases upon the wallsnot a bit like humiston and he explained that his stay in america being short he could not afford to have a studio of his own im glad you came you must let me take you to see my show next week your fresh young western eyes are just what i need this was false for he was impatient of all criticism i need comfort he added wearily smiling i didnt sell enough in the west to pay my railway fare  he seemed ill as well as sad and bertha felt sorry for him wont you come with us for a ride  id rather have you stay and talk with me  oh i cant do that the captain is waiting for me he said to bring you  but i dont want to go i hate automobiles i hate seeing sights i despise this town ive a grouch against everything in americaexcept you let me go down and tell the captain to take his spin alone  no no she sharply said i keep my word i said id be back in a few minutes and im going  he sighed resignedly very well but youll let me come to see you  why cert come to dinner any day we dont browse around much outside the hotel were mostly always feeding at six  ill come and you must not fail to let me show you my pictures  sure thing i want to buy one to take home with me  he assumed great candor i wont say that your ability to buy one of my pictures is not of interest to me for it is but quite aside from that there is something in you that appeals to me you make me think better of the westof america i feel that you will find something in my pictures which the critics miss then with mournful abruptness he added no doubt joe told you of my unhappy marriage  no he didnt  my wife cares nothing for my work she takes no interest in anything but the frippery side of life thats what appeals to me in youyou are so aspiring i feel that you have such wonderful possibilities you would spur a man to big things  they were both standing as if he had forgotten where he was and she embarrassed but fascinated by his words and especially held by his voice dared not make a motion till he released her he looked round him i dont wonder you dislike this room its horribly cold and depressing to me i cant work here i wish you could see my den in paris perhaps you will let me show it to you some day all my happiest days have been spent in france i am more french than american now  he took her hand again and with a return to his studiedly cheerful manner called her to witness that she had promised to come to see his paintings and please remember that i am going to take you at your word and dine with youperhaps this very night  all right come along she replied and went away filled with wonder at the familiar almost humble attitude he had assumed towards her  he did indeed dine with them that night and quite won the captain to a belief in him come again he heartily said and the great artist feelingly answered i mean to for strange to say i am almost as lonesome in this big town as anybody could be this was a lie but haneys sympathy was roused therell always be an empty chair for you he repeated with a feeling that he too was encouraging art  humiston pursued this game with singular and joyous skill he talked of the west and of politics with the captain and of love and art and his essentially lonely life to bertha he returned often to the wish that they might meet in paris a trip abroad would do you infinite good he insisted what you need is three years of life in paris with your beauty and money and above all with your personal magnetism you could reign like a queen i wonder that you dont go it would be worth more to you than any other possible schooling i dont know of anything in this world that would give me greater pleasure than to show you paris  berthas silence in face of these approaches deceived him the throbbing of her bosom the fall of her eyelashes were due to instinctive distrust of him that he was more dangerous than the rough miners and cowboys of the west she could not believe and yet she drew back in growing fear of one who openly claimed the right to plow athwart all the barriers of law and custom his minds flight was like that of the eaglenow rising to the sun in exultation now falling to the gray sea to slay at times she felt a kind of gratitude that he should be willing to sit beside her and talkhe so skilled so learned so famous  the chicago papers were still filled with criticism of his work and his theories and this discussion as well as the appearance of his portrait in the magazines had made of him a very exalted person in little mrs haneys eyes and the interest he took in her was too subtly flattering not to affect her he seemed fond of the captain too and often joined them in their trips about the city and the fellows who had known humiston in paris and who did not know bertha nodded knowingly jerrys amusing himself as usual i wonder who she is  he explained his poverty one day as he sat with her in the little gallery where his paintings were hung the fact is while other men have been painting to order and doing stunts for the salon ive gone on refining seeking new shades new allurements subordinating line to color story to harmony till my work is sublimated beyond my public the people that bought my things once cant follow me it is only now and then that a man or a woman feels what im afterand so i live i hold all things beautiful to paint america does not  he liked her all the better because she did not try to say what she thought of his pictures and when she insisted on taking one of them home he quickly stopped her im not asking you to take pity on me he sharply said and in this lay the subtlest touch of flattery he had yet used the idea that she an ignorant mountain girl could be accused of patronizing a man so distinguished so gifted as he moved her in spite of all warnings why should she not use her money to help this wonderful artist  she insisted on a picture and asked him to select one for her ive got a big house out in the springs and id like something of yours  not out of this collection he declared these are not the ones on which my fame rests the ones that represent me are in the cellar  her eyes were wide in question what do you mean by that  american dealers wont include my best things in the exhibitthey are too direct they are stored over here in a warehouse id like to show them to you will you come he asked with eager eyes  and she with a sense of being distinguished above the great public consented humiston rose animatedly lets go over and see them now  his gentle camaraderie his eagerness touched bertha and when he took her arm to help her into the elevator or to make sure she did not stumble at the crossing she was stirrednot as bens hand had moved her but her blood nevertheless palpably quickened was it not wonderful that she so lately from the mountains should be walking here in the midst of the thronging multitudes of a great city street in the company of one of the chief artists of the world  humiston crafty cruel unscrupulous returned to his abuse of the city and explained to her that american dealers had no real appreciation of art they sell anything that will sell any cheap daub and yet they dared to refuse to exhibit my best things it was the same in pittsburg and buffalo theyre all alike but what can you expect of these densely material towns beauty means only prettiness to them  the salesman of the shop accustomed to seeing humiston pass in and out with friends paid no special heed to the painter as he led bertha into the farther room where a few of his pictures hung among a dozen others no one was in the gallery and just as she was wondering where the other paintings could be he opened a door which was cut out of the wall and partly concealed by paintings and smilingly said here is the inner temple enter  she obeyed with a little hesitation for the storeroom was not well lighted and she had a wild birds distrust of dark enclosing walls  humiston shut the door behind him and followed her plaintively saying isnt it hard lines to have to bring my friends into this hole to show my masterpieces and by this she inferred that there was nothing unusual in the experience  it was a long bare hall filled with boxes and littered with bits of excelsior and bertha looked about her uneasily while humiston bent over some canvases stacked on the floor he seemed to be selecting one with care an electric lamp was swinging from the ceiling and under it stood a large easel and on this he placed a canvas and stepping back with eyes fixed on her said with spirit this is one of my best it was in the new salonhere is the number and yet it may not be exhibited in this rotten town  bertha inwardly recoiled from the canvas for it was a painting of a nude figure of a girl at the bath the critics had said it is naked rather than nude and the dealers objected to it on this ground and to the western girl it was both shocking and ugly before she had caught her breath he continued in a tone that was at once a seduction and a defence there is nothing more beautiful in the world than the female form it is the flower of flowers why should it not be painted and then while still he argued for the return of the greeks love of beauty covering his moral depravity with the mantle of the philosopher he placed another canvas before hersomething so unrefined so animal so destructive of womanly modesty and of all reserve that any one looking upon it would instantly know that the man who had painted it was a degenerate demonan associate of dissolute models an anarchist in the world of women it was fit only for the banquethalls of the damned  bertha stared at itfascinated by the sense of the tempters nearness it was as if a satyr had suddenly revealed his lawless soul to her her thinking for an instant chained her feet and her silence emboldened him  even as she turned to flee she felt his arm about her waist his breath upon her cheek dont go he pleaded and in his eyes was the same look she had seen in the face of charles haney at last he stood revealed his artist soul could stoop as low in purpose as a drunken tramp beating him off with her strong hands she ran down the hall and burst into the brilliantly lighted exhibition room such a picture of affrighted outraged girlhood that the salesman stared upon her in wonder his look of surprise warned bertha of her danger composing herself by tremendous effort of the will she closed the door and walked slowly out into the street her brain in a tumult of anger and shame  it seemed at the moment as if every man she had ever known was a brutedemon seeking to destroy her she understood now the reason for the great painters flattering deference to her opinion from the first he had sought to blind her his ways were subtler than those of charles haney and his like but his soul was no higher it was indeed more ignoble for he was of those who claim to dispense learning and light pretending to add beauty to the world he was ready to feed himself at the cost of a womans soul she recalled mrs moss hints about his life in paris and understood at last that he had wilfully misread her homage and trust a realization of this perfidy filled her with a fury of hate and disgust was ben fordyce like all the rest did his candor his sweetness of smile but veil another mode of approach was his kiss as vile in its disloyalty his embrace as remorseless in its design  she walked back along the shining avenue to her hotel with drooping head she knew the worst of humiston now she burned with helpless wrath as she dwelt upon his assumptions of superiority she hated the whole glittering unresting lavish city at the moment and her soul longed for the silence of the peaks to the west she turned to her husband as one who seeks a tower of refuge in time of war     chapter xxiii  berthas flight   before she had fairly recovered her poise next day lucius brought to her a letter from humistona suave impudent note wherein he expressed the hope that she was well and went on to plead in veiled phrase im sorry you did not stay to see the rest of my pictures i meant it all as a compliment to your innate good taste and purity of thought i expected you to see them as i painted themin pure artistic delight you misunderstood me i hope you will let me see you again you must remember you promised to let me make a portrait sketch of you  although not skilled in polite duplicity bertha was able to read beneath the serene insolence of these lines something so diabolically relentless that she turned cold with fear and repulsion she had no experience which fitted her to deal with such a pursuer and she shuddered at the rustling of the paper in her hand as she had once quivered in breathless terror of a rattlesnake stirring in the leaves near the door of her tent her first impulse was to lay the whole affair before the captain but the knowledge of his deadly temper when roused decided her to slip out at the other side of this fearsome thicket and leave the serpent in possession she longed to return to the west the little group of people in the springs allured her they were to be trusted congdon and crego and benthese men she knew and respected her joy of the big outside eastern world had begun to pass and she dreaded to encounter again the bold eyes and coarse compliments of the men who loaf about the hotels and clubs  she turned to haney as he came into her room and said mart i want to go hometoday  all right bertie im readyor will be as soon as i pick up the old father but dont you want to see that show weve got tickets for  no ive had enough of this old town im crazy to go home  home it is then he called sharply lucius the man appeared impassive noiseless unhurried the captain issued his orders thrun me garbage into a thrunk and call some one to help the missus were goin to hit the sunset trail tonight phone me old dad besides and have him come over at wanst here we emigrate westward by the next express  the man quietly took control of the situation and in a few moments the captains commands were being carried out with the precision of a military camp  bertha alarmed by humistons letter refused to go down to the public diningroom a fear that she might encounter the painter possessed her and the thought of him was at once a shame and torment therefore she had her luncheon sent up and lucius himself found time to wait upon them  as they were in the midst of their meal haney remarked rather than asked of course youre going back with us lucius  i have thought of it sir but it isnt in our contract  we can put it in said bertha  we cant do without you now added mart  lucius seemed pleased thank you for that captain i dont particularly care for the west but i find service with you agreeable  haney chuckled service do ye call it sure man tis you are in command im but a high private in the rear rank  luciuss yellow face flushed and his eyes wavered i hope i havent assumed  assumed no tis we who are obligated we need you as bad as a plainsman needs a guide in the green timber and if you dont mind a steady job of looking after us social tenderfeet im willing to make it right with youand mrs haney feels just the way i do  sure martonly trouble with lucius is he leaves so little for me to do hes too handyif anything  thatll wear off replied haney well then its all settled but the price and i reckon we can fix that if i cant pay cash ill let you in on the mine  lucius smiled thank you captain its not entirely a question of pay with me my wants are few  bertha seized the moment to put a question she had been minded many times to ask lucius whats your plan you cant intend to do this all your life tell us your ambitionmaybe we can help you  he looked away and a deeper shadow fell over his face i had ambitions once mrs haney but my color was against me yes i think ill stay as i am there is a certain security in being valet you white people know exactly where to find me and i know just how to meet you in my profession it was differenti was always being cursed for presumption  what was your profession asked haney  i studied lawand practised for a year or two in washington but i didnt like my position i was neither white nor colored so when i got a good chance i went out to service with a senator as bodyservant he stopped abruptly as though that were all of his tale  haney said well if you can put up with an ignorant old hillclimber like meself ill be grateful and ill try not rub your fur the wrong way  lucius became very earnest for the first time there sir is one point upon which i must insist if i go with you you are to treat me just as you have been doingas a trusted servant im sorry i told you anything about myself my service thus far has been very pleasant very satisfactory and unless we can go on in the same way i must leave  very well replied haney its all settledyoure adjutantgeneral of the haneys forces  after lucius went away bertha said thoughtfully i wish he hadnt told us that i cant order him around the way ive been doing  haney smiled did ye order him around i niver chanced to hear ye do anything but ask him questions lucius will ye do this lucius wont ye do that  bertha was troubled and found herself embarrassed by the mulattos services she now perceived sadness beneath the quiet lines of his face and hardwon culture in the tones of his voice the essential tragedy of his defeat grew more poignant to her as she watched him getting the trunks strapped surrounded by maids and porters how could she have misread his manner he was performing his duties not with quiet gusto but in the spirit of the trained nurse  this mountain girl had always regarded illinois as the east but after a few weeks in new york city she now looked away to chicago as a western town she was glad to face the sunset sky again and yet as she wheeled away to the train she acknowledged a regret under the skilful guidance of lucius she had seen a great deal of the splendid and furious manhattan she had gazed with unenvious admiration on the palaces of upper fifth avenue and the park together with haney she had spun up riverside drive past grants tomb and on through washington heights with joy of the farspreading panorama she had visited the battery and sailed the shining way to staten island in silent awe of the shipfilled bay she had heard the sunsetguns thunder at fort hamilton and had threaded the mazes of the brooklyn navyyard and each day the masthemmed island widened in grandeur and thickened with threads of human purpose making the america she knew very simple very quiet and very remote  night by night she had gone to the musichalls and theatres and her mind had been powerfully wrought upon by what she had seen and heard in all these trips haney had heroically accompanied his wife though he frequently dropped asleep in his seat and he too left the city with regret though he said thank god im out of it as they settled into their seats in the ferry tis not the night traffic that wears me downim used to being on the night shift tis the wild pace lucius sets by day faith twas the aquarium in the morning and the circus in the afternoon me dreams have been wan long procession of misbegotten fish balletdancers dirty monkeys and big elephants the nights tis a great city but i am ready to return to me peaceful perch above the faroboard i think twould rest me soul to see a game of craps  why didnt you order lucius to let up on the sightseeing business bertha said  and expose me weak knees to me nigger no no mike  i wanted you to let me rummage about alone  you did but i could not allow that neyther so long as i can sit the roadcart or run me arms into a biled shirt ill stay by darlin tis not safe for you to go about alone in the hellbroth of these eastern streets besides while im losin weight im lighter on me feet than when i came ive enjoyed me trip but it does seem sinful to think of our big house standing empty and the horses stockin in their stalls and im glad were edgin along homeward  so am i bertha heartily agreed even as she looked lovingly back upon the mighty walls and towers which filled the sky behind her it was a gloriously exciting place to live in after all some day i may come back she promised herself but the thought of humiston lurking like a wolf in the shadow came to make her going more and more like an escape  the elder haney amused her by his frank comment on everything that was strange to him his new teeth which did not fit him very securely troubled him greatly and he spoke with one hand held alertly ready to catch them if they fell but his smile was a radiant grin and his shrewd old face was good to look at as he faced the splendors of the limited express  tis foine as a barroom said he to be whisked about over the world like this is no hairdship bedad if id known how aisy it was id a visited mcardle befoore he pretended to believe that everybody travelled this way and that mart was merely doing the ordinary in the matter of meals and stateroom and as he wandered from end to end of the train and found only luxurious coaches and people taking their ease he had all the best of the argument lucius he regarded as a man of his own level and they held long confabulations togetherthe colored man accepting this comradeship in the spirit of democracy in which it was given mart for his part sat looking out of the window dreaming of the past  as she neared chicago next day bertha thought with pleasure of seeing the mosses again now that humiston was eliminated she had only the pleasantest memories of the people she had met in the smoky city it was as if in a dark forest of lofty trees she had found a pleasant mead on which the warm sunlight fell the mellow charm of the studios was made all the more appealing by reason of the drab and desolate waste through which she was forced to pass to attain the light and laughter of those high places  chicago had grown more gloomily impressive and at the same timeby reason of her knowledge of the larger plans and mightier enterprises of new yorkit seemed simpler and bertha reentered the hotel which had once dazzled her in confidence finding it cheerful and familiar she liked it all the better because it was less pretentious it gave her a pleasant sense of getting back home to have the men in buttons smile and say glad to see you mrs haney the head clerk was very cordial he even found time to come out and shake hands i cant give you precisely your old quarters he said but i can fix you out on the next floor im sure youll be very comfortable thereupon she took up her quietly luxurious life at the point where she had dropped it some weeks before  there lay in this western girl a strongly marked tendency towards the culture and refinement of the east and though she had grown up far from anything æsthetic in homelife she instinctively knew and loved the beautiful in nature the right thing in art and now that she was about to leave the east for the westperhaps to abandon the town for the villageshe found herself aching with a hunger which had hitherto been unconscious she was torn with desire to go and a longing to stay new york paris the world was open before her if only she were content to take marshall haneys money and use it to these ends  that night as she lay in her bed hearing the rumble and jar of the citys traffic her mind recalled and dwelt upon the wonderful scenes especially the beautiful pictures which her eyes had gleaned from the east the magical glittering spread of manhattan harbor the silver sweep of the hudson at west point the mighty panorama from grants tomb the silken sheen of fifth avenue on a rainy night the crash and glitter of upper broadway the splendid halls of art literature and especially of music and the dramaall these came back one by one to claim a place beside her peaks and cañons sharing the glory of the purple deeps and the snowy heights of the mountains she had hitherto loved so singleheartedly and so well  she saw sibley now for what it wasa village almost barren of beautya good kindly homey place but so little and so dull to go back there to live was quite impossible if i quit mart i must find something to do herein the east i cant stand sibley  she longed for the springs because of her home there and because of benbut she realized that it possessed after all but very limited opportunities for the purchase of culture the great centres had begun to exercise dominion over her she had ever been a lonely little soul with no confidante of her own sex speech had never been fluent with her and she was still elliptical curt and in a sense inexpressive she had no chatter and the ways of women were in many directions alien to her miss franklin had been her teacher and yet while respecting her she had never learned to love her next to ben fordyce she leaned upon the judgment and sympathy of the sculptor whose fine eyes were aglow with a high purpose she was certain that he was both good and wise  mart was much amused at his father who refused to sleep a second night at the hotel its too far from the street said he i think ill go stay with fan if yell lay out the course that leads to her dure so lucius went with him bearing a message from haney tell fan ill be over to see her tomorrow im too tired to go today and the father hurried away in joyous relief  tis unnatural to see a son of mine in such babylonish splendor he confided to lucius faith it gives me a turn every time i see him unwind a bill from that big wad he carries in his pocket tis like palin a red onion to himnothing more  the captain was up early next day and eager to see how his sister was getting along in her new house and to please him bertha went with him the transposition of the mcardles like most charitable enterprises had not been entirely a success the children had blubbered at being torn away from their playmates and the alleys and runways which they infested they were like lusty rats suddenly let loose in a fine new barn with no dark corners no burrows no rotten planks chips or coalheaps to dig into or hide beneath the alleys in glenwood were leafy lanes the streets parked and concreted and the schoolyard unnaturally clean and shaded by fine young treeswhich no one was allowed to climb  furthermore there was work to do in the gardenand this was onerous to the boys then too they had to fight their battles all over again however they did this with pleasure establishing dreadful reputations among the neat knickerbocker sissies who were foolish enough to cross them dress mrs mcardle declared was now a real trial the girls had to be in trim all the time and the boys were as violently in contrast to their fellows as a litter of brindle barnkits beside a wellgroomed tabbycats family im clean worn out with it mart she confessed weve been here two weeks the day and the children howlin the whole time to go back and mcardle workin himself to the figger of a spoon with a mind to polish the lawn and get the garden into seed  but mart only smiled tis good discipline fan  haney senior was delighted with his daughters household faith the roar and tumble of the whelps brings back to me me own wife and childer them was good days twas hard skirmishin some weeks for bacon and ptaties but i got em someway and you ate ivery flick of itsnappin and snarlin but happy as a box of pups  his son and daughter looked at each other and laughed then mart said tis a sad memory the father has a most inconvenient and embarrassing mind  they all stayed to dinner and bertha rolled up her sleeves and helped in the kitchen while the captain went to market with lucius mcardle having got a halfday off came home highly wrought up again at thought of meeting captain haney and his handsome wife he looked distinctly less careworn though he confessed that it was hard to rise at the hour necessary to reach his work at seven berthas heart warmed to him in a certain dreamy speculative turn of eye he was like her fathera man inventing new forms as naturally as other minds copy worn models he was gaining in conversational powers as he came to know mart better and took occasion to lay before him the plans for several inventions small in themselves but of possible value so lucius said  there was something hearty wholesome and satisfying in this visit and bertha went away with increased liking for the mcardles im glad you gave them a boost mart she said as they left the house and you fixed it fine mac talked to me a halfhour explaining that you hadnt put it on a charity basisjust sold the house on long time  that was luciuss idea wasnt it lucius  lucius did not appear to hear  they were whirring down an avenue bordered by elms in expanding leaf the sky was filled with big white clouds like those which come and go over the great domes of the rockies and the air was warm and sweet not yet dusked by the citys chimneys berthas heart rose on joyous wing lets call and take the mosses for a ride she suggested  with all the pleasure in the world he replied and when they drew up before the side door of the huge block bertha sprang out and hurried in without waiting for lucius to accompany her  mrs moss came to the studio door and berthas shining face so wrought upon her that she seized her and kissed her with sincere pleasure joe heres mrs haney  moss was modelling a small figure on a stand near one of the windows but left his work and came towards her with beaming smile what a coincidence we were just discussing you how do you do shake my armmy hands are muddy she took his outbent wrist and shook it with frank heartiness he explained i said youd come back julia declared no once she tastes the glories of new york goodbye to chicago and the west  bertha interrupted i want you to lay off and go out for a whirl in our machine  how gay cried moss i ought to be working for my rent is coming due but whats the diff here goes come on julia well shut up shop and let art wag  julia was doubtful you know you promised  of course i didthats the prerogative of the artist come on now ill work tonight  tonight is the halls circus party  so it is well no matter im hungry for some whizzing lashing cool clear air  dodging behind a screen in the corner like an actor doing a stunt he reappeared a few moments later with clean hands wearing a gray jacket and cap hurry hurry he called he was like a lad invited to go fishing or swimming  ive been all balled up since you went away he explainedtook a contract to produce a certain line of ornamental reliefs it never pays to be mercenary but there it is i was greedy i went out for moneynow behold me in the grasp of a business agreement cant sleep cant breathe country airhad to work all day sunday  itll pay some of our debts though explained mrs moss and buy the childrens summer suits  summer suits why summer suits i only had one complete suit a year when i was a childand that was a buff  all the way down the elevator he gazed admiringly at bertha my my how fit you look julia why dont you get a hat and cloak like that  why dont i do you know why then as they came out in sight of the mobile she said why dont you furnish me an autocar like this  i will he said as though the notion had just risen in his mind ill secure one this week  mart who had taken a seat with lucius was touched and warmed by their hearty greeting and they rolled away up the street as merry as schoolchildreneven the selfcontained lucius smiled at joes odd turns of speech berthas heart swelled with the keen delight of giving pleasure to her friends this was indeed the chief of all the wondrous powers of moneyit enabled one to be hospitable to possess a home wherein visitors were always welcome to own a car in which dear friends could ride for the moment her resolution to give it all up weakened  moss was delirious with joy as they went sweeping up the lake shore drive he took off his cap and stood up in the car in order to drink deep of the wind that came over the water crisp and clean and crystalline  on the park mead the boys were playing ball and the combination of green grass and soft and feathery foliage was very beautiful the waterfowl were out the captive cranes crying and the drives were full of carriages and cars it was all very cheering with death and winter far away  moss sobering somewhat began to set forth his plan for making chicago a new and greater venice by bringing the lake into all the city boulevards and spanning these waterways with stately bridges of a new type designed by joe moss of course he added twould make venice look like a faded print in a lovely old songbook  his talk took hold of berthas imaginationnot because she cared to see chicago adorned but because he was so singularly altruistic in his concernments that a man should live to make the world more beautiful was a wondrous discovery for her he was not specially troubled about the physical welfare or the morals of the average citizen but the citys grossness its willingness to perpetuate ugly forms rasped him angered him  she was eager to tell him of her own change of view but waited till their ride was over and they were seated in the studio and a moments private conversation was possible tingling with the stimulus of his fragmentary exclamations she impulsively began if i were a poor girl who wanted to earn a living in the world what would you advise me to do  get married his answer was jocular but observing her displeasure he added im sorry i said that in just that tone but at the same time i really mean it a woman can do other things but marry she must if she is to fulfil her place in the worldand be happy  she was balked and disappointed he perceived and he was forced to go further i certainly wouldnt advise any girl to study painting or sculpture in the hope of making a living by it the only side of art that isnt hopelessly out of the running is the decorativehome decoration is a sure and worthy profession people dont feel keen need of sculpture but they do like pretty walls and nice furniture i know several highly successful women decoratorsbut i wouldnt advise that work for any one as an easy way to make a living for the decorative sense is either a gift at birth or acquired after hard study  do they teach it over there she nodded towards the lake i liked it over there she said wistfully you see i didnt get much of a show at school i began to stay out to help mother when i was fourteen i missed a whole lot id kind o like to make it up now if i could  moss was eager to probe a little deeper your life is thrillingly romantic to usthe kind of thing we read of congdon writes that you have a superb home i should think youd hate to leave it even for a visit  her hands strained together as if in resistance to an impulse of pleading then she answered yesbut then you see it isnt really mineits the captains  yours by marriage  thats what people saybut i dont know sometimes i think i have no right to any part of it you have to earn what you own dont you  what was this doubt at her heart the unexplained emotion in her voice moved him profoundly he cautiously approached of course we know frank congdonhe likes to string us easterners and we take his yarns with due discount i suppose captain haney like many other western men is ready to try his luck now and again and in that sense really is a gambler  she faced him squarely no he has been the real thing he kept a saloonwhen i first knew him but he gave it all up for me i wouldnt promise to marry him till he did everybody out there knows his career and most people think he got his money underhand but he tells me he didnt and i take his word every dollar he spends on me or on our home comes out of some mines he owns i told him i wouldnt touch a dollar of the saloon moneyand i wont some folks think i dont care but i do i dont like the saloon business and he got out and hes livin straight now as straight as any man its pretty hard on him too though he wont admit it he must get awful sick of sittin round the way he does i tell him he neednt cut out all his old cronies on my account he says he aint sufferin but its like shuttin a bronco up in the corral and lettin the herd go back into the hills  perhaps he thinks youre better fun than any of his cronies  she ignored the implied compliment and went on  all the same its drawin mighty close lines on him you cant take a man living a freeandeasy life the way he was and wing him all at once and tie him down to a chair without seein some suffering dont you know it  does he complain  not a whimper sometimes i wish he would no he just waitsbut im afraid hell get lonesome some day and break loose and go back to the game  in this way the sculptor had come very close to her secret and she was trembling to deeper confidence when he said very gently of course it does seem a little strange to me that one so young and charming as you are should be married to a man of his type but i suppose he was a handsome figure before hisaccident  her eyes glowed he was one of the grandestlooking men i never liked his tradeand i mistrusted him at first but when he cut himself out of the whole businessfor mei couldnt help likin him he was so bighearted and freehanded we needed his help all right mother was sick and my brothers ranch was playing to hard luck but dont think i married him for his moneyi liked him then and besideswell i thought i was doing the right thingbut nowwell im guessing she ended abruptly and in the tremor of that final word moss read her secret she had never loved her husband pity and a kind of loyalty to her word had carried her to his side and now a sense of duty bound her there  with sincere sympathy he said we all do wrong at times that good may come out of it you could not foresee the futurethe best of us can only guess at the effect of any action you did the best you knew at the moment the question you have to face now has only slight relation to the past no one can enter wholly into anothers perplexityim not even sure of a single one of my inferencesbut if you are thinking ofseparation i would say meet this crisis as bravely as you met the other but i dont believe we should decide any such question selfishly i am not of those who always seek the side on which lies personal happiness because a happiness that is essentially selfish wont last the captain lives only for youany one can see that what he does for you springs from deep affection what would happen to himif you left him  he paused a moment and watched her subduing her tears then added i wont say i was unprepared for what youve said for the entire relationship from our first meeting seemed too abnormal to be altogether happy money will buy a great many desirable things but it has its limits at the same time it is too much to expect of youif your feeling for him has changed  his delicacy his sympathy for her was made apparent by the unusual hesitation of his speech and she would have broken down completely had not julia moss called out joe turn on the lightsits getting dark  conscious of berthas emotion he did not immediately do as he was bidden i wish youd talk this over with julia he ended gently shes a very wise little woman  bertha shook her head i didnt intend to talk it over with you i dont know what possessed me i had no business to say what i did  he reassured her all youve told me and the part ive guessed is quite safe i will not even permit julia to share your confidence till you are willing to speak to her yourself  as he slowly lighted the studio bertha was surprised and a little troubled to find that two or three other visitors had slipped in through the dusk and were grouped about the teatable and that the captain was again the centre of an eagereyed group they treat him as if he were an eskimo she thought bitterly and rose to join the circle and protect him from their inquisition  haney was feeling extremely well and talked with so much of his old time vigor and slash of epithet that his little audience was quite entranced he enlarged upon the experiences of a year he had spent in alaska mining up there in them days made gambling slow business he said he had told bertha that he had made an attempt to get out of the trade but she was content to have him put it on less selfrighteous grounds he contrived to make his hearers feel very keenly the pitiless longdrawn ferocity of that sunless winter he made it plain why men in that far land came together in vile dens to drink and gamble and moss glowed with the wonder and delight of those great boys who could rush away to the arctic edge of the world and die with laughing curses on their lips  what did you all do it for he asked bluntly for money  partlybut more for the love of doing something hard no man but a miser punishes himself for love of goldits for love of what the stuff will buy that men fight the snows  while haney talked of these things berthas eyes were musingly turned on the face of the sculptor and her mind was far from the scenes which mart so vividly described this side of his life no longer amused heron the contrary she shrank from any disclosure of his savage career she was now as unjust in her criticism as she had been fond in her admiration and when with darkening brow she cut short his garrulous flow of narrative julia perceived her displeasure  haney apologized handsomely its natural for the ould bedraggled eagle in the cage with a club on his wrist to dream of the circles he used to cut and the fish he set claw to in them days i feared no mans weight and no night or stream twas all joyous battle to me and now as i sit here on velvet with only to snap me fingers for anything i want i look back at thim fierce old times with a sneaking kind o wish to live em all over again bertie knows me weakness i would talk forever did she lave me go on but tis no blame to herit was a cruel bad careless life  when i come west said moss sincerely well go camping together and every night by the fire well smoke and you can tell me all about your journeys i assure you they are epic to me  dr brent a little later put in a private word to bertie now youre going back into the high country and youll find it necessary to watch the captain pretty closely i suspect hell find his heart thumping briskly when he reaches the springs he may stand that altitude all right but dont let him go higher he will be taking chances if he goes above six thousand feet youd better have steel of denver come down and examine him to see how he stands the first few days i mention steel because i know himive no doubt there are plenty of good men in the springs  whatll i do if hes worse  bring him back here or go to sea levelonly beware of high passes     chapter xxiv  the haneys return to the peaks   the forces that really move most men are the small concrete individual experiences of life the death of a child is of more account to its parents than the fall of a republic napoleon did not forget josephine in his italian campaigns and grant inflexible commander of a halfmillion men never failed even in the wilderness to remember the plain little woman whose fireside fortunes were so closely interwoven with his epochmaking wars  as ben fordyce lost interest in the question of labor and capital and the political struggles of the state because they were of less account than his own combat with the powers of darkness so bertha had little thought of the abstract the sociologic in her uneasinessthe strife was individual the problems personaland at last weary of question of doubt she yielded once more to the protecting power which lay in haneys gold and permitted herself to enjoy its use its command of men there was something like intoxication in this sense of supremacy this freedom from ceaseless calculation and to rise above the doubt in which she had been plunged was like suddenly acquiring wings  she accepted any chance to penetrate the citys life determined to secure all that she could of its light and luxury and in return intrusted lucius with plans for luncheons and dinners which he carried out with lavish hand  mart seconded all her resolutions with hearty voice theres nothing too good for the haneys he repeatedly chuckled  in the midst of other gayeties she had the mcardles over to midday dinner one saturday and afterwards took them all a noisy gang to the theatrepatrick haney as much of a boy as his grandsons mcardle alone being unhappy as well as uneasy  she went about the shops buying with reckless hand treasures for the house in the springs and this gave her husband more satisfaction than any other extravagance for each article seemed a gage of the permanency of his home in support of her mood he urged her to even larger expenditures buy buy like a queen he often commanded as she mused upon some choice take the best  there was instruction as well as a guilty delight in all this conjuring with a magic checkbook and bertha grew in grace and dignity in her rôle as hostess her circle of acquaintances widened but the mosses her first friends in the city were not displaced in her affections to them she continued to play the generous fairy in as many pleasant ways as they would permit the theatre continued to be her delight as well as her school of life and a boxparty followed nearly every dinner she was like a child in the catholicity of her appetite for she devoured shakespearian bread ibsen roasts and comic opera creampuffs with almost equal gustoand mentally thrived upon the mixture to the outsider she seemed one of the most fortunate women in the world  and yet every day made her less tolerant of the crippled old man at her side she did not pout or sulk or answer him shortly but she often forgot himfailed to answer himnot out of petulance or disgust but because her mind was busy with other people gradually without realizing it she got into the habit of leaving him to amuse himself as he best could for she knew he did not specially care for the pursuits which gave her the keenest joy in consequence of this unintentional neglect he very naturally fell more and more into the hands of the barroom spongers who loitered about the hotel corridors he dreaded loneliness and it was to keep his companions about him that he became a spendthrift in liquors sternly and deliberately temperate during his long career as a gambler he fell at last into drinking to excess and on one unhappy afternoon returned to bertha quite plainly drunk  she was both startled and disgusted by this sign of weakness and he was not so blinded by the mist of his potations but that he perceived the shrinking reluctance of her touch as she aided lucius in lifting him into the bed his inert lumpish form was at the moment hideously repulsive to her and physical contact with him a dreaded thing what was left if he lost that selfcontrol which had made him admirable she had always been able to qualify his other shortcomings by saying well anyhow he dont drink she could boast of this no longer  it was a most miserable night for her at dinner she was forced to lie about him for the first time and she did it so badly that joe moss divined her trouble and came generously to her aid with a long and amusing story about whistler  the play to which she took her guests did not help her to laughter for it set forth with diabolic skill the life of a woman who loathed her husband dreaded maternity and hated herselfa baffling marvellously intricate and searching playmeat for well people not for those mentally ill at ease or morally unstable of a truth bertha saw but half of it and comprehended less for she could not forget the leaden hands and flushed face of the man she called husbandand whom she had left in his bed to sleep away his hours of intoxication she pitied him nowbut in a new fashion her compassion was mixed with contempt and that showed more clearly than any other feeling could the depth to which marshall haney had sunk  when she came home at midnight she listened at his door but did not enter for luciusskilled in all such mattersreported the captain to be all right  she went to her own room in a more darkly tragic mood than she had ever known before her punishment her time for trouble had begun i reckon im due to pay for my fun she said to herself but not in the way ive been figuring on haney seemed at the moment a complete physical ruin and the change which his helplessness wrought in her was most radical  his deeply penitent mood next morning hurt and repelled her almost as much as his maudlin jocularity of the night before she would have preferred a brazen levity to this humble confession twas me boast he sadly asserted that no man ever caught me with me eyes full of sand and me tongue twistedand now look at me tis what comes of having nothing to do but trade lies with a lot of flatbottomed loafers in a gaudy barroom but dont worry darlin right here old mart pulls up youll not see anny more of this forget it dearheartwont you now  she promised of course but the chasm between them was widened and a fear of his again yielding to temptation cut short her stay in the city for lucius warningly explained the captain is settling into a corner of the barroom with a gang of sponging blackguards around him and every day makes it less easy for him to break away id advise going home he ended quietly the springs is a safer place for him now  the hyenas were beginning to prowl around the disabled lion and this the faithful servant knew even better than the wife  all right home we go she replied and the thought of home was both sweet and perilous  haney met her decision with pathetic instant joy im ready i was only waitin he said after all your own shack is better than a pearl palace in anny town and its gettin hot besides  bertha parted from the mosses with keen sorrow joe had come to be like an elder brother to hera brother and a teacher and next to ben fordyce was more often in her thought than any other human being she had lost part of her awe of him but her affection had deepened as she came to understand the essential manliness and simplicity of his character he redeemed the artistworld from the shame men like humiston had put upon it  as she entered for the last time the studio in which she had spent so many happy hours and from whose atmosphere of work and high endeavor she had derived so much mental and moral development she was sad and this sadness lent a beauty to her face that it had never before attained she looked older too and contrasting her with the girl who had first looked in at his door moss could scarcely believe that less than half a year had affected this change in her he was too keen an observer not to know that part of this was due to a refining taste in hats and gowns but beneath all these superficial traits she had grown swiftly in the expression of security and power  he greeted her as usual with a frank nod and his hands being free from clay advanced to shake hands dont tell me youve come to say goodbye  thats what she curtly said its up to me to take the captain home hes getting into bad habits lying around this hotel  his face clouded ive been afraid of that he answered gently yes youd better go home its harder for a man to have a good easy time than it is for a woman but sit down julia will be in soon you mustnt go without seeing her  after some further talk on trains and other commonplaces she became abruptly personal ive been having a whole lot of fun buying things and planting dollars but im beginning to see an end to that kind of business after youve got your house filled up with furniture and jimcracks what you going to do then  burn em  and begin all over again you cant buy out the town its a real circus for a while but i can see theres a limit to it once you find out you can just go down here to one of these jewelrystores and order anything you wantyou dont want anything here i am with a lot of money that aint mine having a gay whirl spending it but i can see my finish right now to go on in this line would take all the fun out of life what am i to do  moss took a seat and looked at her thoughtfully i dont know i used to think if i had money id start out and do good to people but im not at all sure that charity isnt all a damned impertinence a couple of years ago i would have said go in for neighborhood settlements free libraries noonday rests openair funds and all the rest of it but now i ask why weve had our wave of altruism and im inclined to think a wave of selfishness would do us all goodbut youre too young to be bothered with these problems go home and be happy while you can enjoy your gold while it glitters work is my only funreal enduring funand im not a bit sure that will last whatever you do be yourself dont try to be what you think i or some one else would like to have you i like you because you are so straightforwardly yourself i shall be heartbroken if you take on the disease of the age and begin to prate of your duty  she listened to him with only partial comprehension of his meaning but she answered i was brought up to think duty was the whole works  yes and your teacher meant duty to god duty to others well theres duty to ones self the war of money and duty is the biggest mix of our day its simpler to be poor then all youve got to worry about is bread and shoes and shingles  thats just it sometimes i wish i was back in the golden eagle where i she ended in midsentence  he laughed you sound like a middleaged financier who mourns tattooed with dollarmarks for the days when he used to husk corn at seventy cents a day she saw the humor of this but was aware that without a knowledge of ben fordyce joe could not understand her problem therefore she abandoned her search for light and leading well anyhow right here i quit what you fellows call civilization i hate to lose you and julia and the rest of the folks but its me to the high hills youll never know how much youve helped me  i hope youll never know how thoroughly weve done you an evilminded person would say wed worked you for dinners and drives most shameful however if you have enjoyed our company as thoroughly as weve delighted in your champagne and birds well cry quits all my theories of art and life i advance gratis i ought to do something handsome for youyouve listened so divinely  underneath his banter moss was sincerely moved it was hard to say goodbye to this curious earnest seeking mind this unspoiled child in whose face the world was being reflected as in a magical mirror he loved her with frank affectiona pure passion that was more intimate than fraternal love and more exalted in a sense than the selfish devouring passion of the suitor it would have been difficult for him to say what his relationship to her at the moment was it was more than friendship more than brotherly care and yet it was definably less than that of the lover  julia came in and was quite as outspoken in her regret and both refused to say goodbye at the moment well see you at the station they said and bertha went away feeling the pain of parting less keen by reason of this promise  afterwards as the hour for departure came near she hoped they would not come it was less difficult to say ill see you again than to utter the curt goodbye which means so much in anglosaxon life  they came however together with several others of her friends but in the bustle and confusion of the depot not much of sentiment could be uttered and though she felt that she was going for a long stay she was prodigal of promises to return soon  patrick haney was there but refused to go with them sure im at the jumpinoff place now and to immigrate furder would be to put meself in the hands of the murtherin redskins his talk was the touch of comedy which the situation needed av ye dont mind ill stay wid fan he said a little more seriously to haney who replied  all right tis as fan says and so they entered the train for the upward climb  haney himself had only joy of the return he sat at one of the windows of the library car and studied the prairie swells with a faint musing smile till the darkness fell and was up early next morning eager and curious to see how the increasing altitude would affect him only towards the end of the second day after eating his dinner did he begin to feel oppressed  i smell the altitude he confessedme breath is shortenin a bit but tis good to see the peaks again  in this long ride the girlwife dwelt dangerously on the bright face of ben fordyce it was the thought of seeing him again that came at last to steal away her regret at parting from her eastern friends the splendor of the eastern world faded at last and she too soared gladly towards the mountains every doubt was swallowed up in a pleasure which was at once pure and beyond her control  ben would be at the station she was certain for lucius had wired to him the time of their arrival and he had instantly replied ill be there and very glad to see youthese words few and simple were addressed to marshall haney but they thrilled her almost as if ben had spoken them to her was he as glad to have her return as she was to meet him again  a fine lad remarked haney as he pocketed the envelope i wonder does he marry soon hed better decide now i reckon alice is not long for this climatepoor girl  his remark so simple in itself pierced to the centre of berthas momentary selfdeception i have no right to think of him he belongs to alice heath but the feeling that she herself belonged to marshall haney was gone that she owed him service was true but since the night of his drunkenness she had definitely and finally abandoned all thought of being his wife soul to soul in the rite that sanctifies law true he had kept his word he had not offended again but the mischief was done to return to the plane on which they had stood when she gave her promise was impossible  the day and the hour were such as make the plain lover content with his world the earth a mighty robe of closely woven velvet mottled softly in variant greens swept away to the west under a soaring convexity of saffron sky towards a cloudy altar whereon small wisps of vapor were burning down to golden embers while beneath lay the darkblue rampart range it was a world for horsemen for free rovers and for swift and tireless desertkine the course of winds it lay a playground for tempests that formed along the great divide and swept down over the antlike homes of men acknowledging no barrier exultant of their strength of wing and the weight of their horizontouching armament  bertha loved this land but only because it was an approach to the hills she would have shuddered at its desolate limitless sweep treeless shelterless had not the dim forms of the distant peaks she loved so well rose just beyond she lost her doubt as they approached welcoming them as the gates of home she forgot all save the swelling tide of longing in her heart  as the train drew slowly in she caught sight of bens intent face among the throng and was moved to the point of beating upon the window he seemed careworn and older in this glimpse but at sight of her his sunny smile came back radiantly to his lips and glinted like sunshine from his eyes in tremulous voice she called there he is  selfrevelation lay in this ecstatic cry and in the glad haste which kept her on her feet but haney unsuspicious content found no cause for jealousy in her innocent and unrestrained delight at getting home  progress down the aisle seemed intolerably slow for the passengers ahead of her stubbornly sluggish barred her way but at last she stood looking into her lovers face her eager hand pressed between his palms  welcome home he called and drew her to him as if moved almost beyond his control with desire to clasp her to his bosom in that instant they forgot all their doubts and scruplesoverpowered by the sense of each others nearness  she was the first to recover her selfcommand and pushing him away with a quick decisive gesture turned to aid mart whom lucius was bringing slowly down the step  her heart was still laboring painfully as she faced congdon but she contrived to return his greeting as he remarked with quizzical glance i hope youll not find our little town dull mrs haney  dull she wanted to scream out her joy she felt like racing to the big black team to throw her arms about their necks dull there was no other spot in all the world so exalting as this small town and its overpeering peaks  where is mrs congdon she succeeded in asking at last  she has visitors and couldnt come he answered but wheres that mobile weve heard so much about  coming by fast freight  freight from all ive heard of your doings in chicago i expected it to come as excess baggage  it was cool delicious green dusknot darkwith a small sickle of moon in the west and as they drove up the broad avenue towards home the town the universe was strangely sweet and satisfying it seemed as though she had been gone an ageso much had come to herso thick was the crowd of new experiences standing between her going and her returnso swiftly had her mind expanded in these months of vivid city life ill never go away again she said to ben this country suits me  im glad to hear you say that he answered softly in the most natural way he had put congdon with haney in the rear seat and had taken the place beside bertha and this nearness filled her with pleasure and an unwonted confusion how big he was and how splendid his clear youthful profile seemed as it gleamed silverwhite in the light of the big streetlamps never had his magnetic young body acted upon her so powerfully so dangerously his firm arm touching her own was at once a delight and a dread she was all woman at last awake palpitant with loves fullflooding tidebewildered dizzy with rapture speech was difficult and her thought had neither sequence nor design  fordyce was under restraint also and the burden of the talk fell upon congdon who proceeded in his amusingly hitormiss way to detail the important or humorous happenings of the town and so they rolled along up the wide avenue to the big stone steps before the looming lamplit palace which they called home  ben sprang out first glad of another opportunity to take berthas hand a clasp that put the throbbing pain back in her bosomfilling her with a kind of fear of him as well as of herselfand without waiting for the captain she ran up the walk towards the wide doorway where miss franklin stood in smiling welcome  her greeting over the young wife danced about the hall crying oh isnt it big and fine and arent you glad its our own she appeared overborne by a returning sense of security and ownership and ran from room to room with all the ecstasy and abandon of a childbut she stopped suddenly in the middle of her own chamber as if a remorseless hand were clutching at her heart but it is not minei must give it all up  thrusting this intruding thought away she hurried back to the library where the men were seated at ease sipping some iced liquor in gross content  haney was beaming it makes me over new to sniff this air again he was saying tis a bad plan to let go your hold on mountain air me lungs have contracted a trifle but theyll expand again ill be riding a horse in a month  ben was sympathetic but had eyes only for bertha whose improvement in mind as in bearing astonished and delighted him her trip coming just at the period when her observation was keenest and her memory most tenacious had subtly swiftly ripened her wrought upon by a thousand pictures moved by strange words and faces unconsciously changing to the color of each new conception deriving sweetness and charm from every chanceheard strain of music and poetry she had opened like a rose  the middleaged are prone to go about the world carrying their habits their prejudices and their ailments with them to return as they went forth but youth like berthas adventures out into the world eager to be built upon ready to be transformed from child to adult as it would seem in a day  she has achieved new distinction ben exulted as he watched her moving about the room so supple so powerful and so graceful but though he was careful not to utter one word of praise he could not keep the glow of admiration from his eyes  an hour later as he said goodnight and went away with congdon his heart burned with secret rebellious fire was it not hateful that this glorious girl should be doomed to live out the sweetest most alluring of her years with a gross and crippled old man to leave her under the same roof with mart haney seemed like exposing her to profanation and despair  they were hardly out of the gate before congdon broke forth in open praise of her when mart dies what a witching morsel for some man  fordyce did not answer on the instant and when he did his voice was constrained you dont think hes in immediate danger of itdo you  quite the contrary he looks to be on the upgrade but its a safe bet she outlives him and then think of her with a hundred thousand dollars a year to spend talk about honeypotsand flies after a moments silence he added musingly funny how ones ideas change a year ago i thought she was deeply indebted to him now i feel that with all his money he cant possibly repay her for what shes giving up on his account and yet his chink has made her what she is money is a weird power when applied to a woman tiled bathrooms silk stockings and bonnets work wonders with the sex shes improved mightily on this trip  after leaving congdon ben went to his apartment and telephoned alice to say that the haneys had arrived and that he had left them under their own roof in good repair  how is the captains health she asked with the morbid interest of the invalid gossip  he feels the altitude a little but that is probably only temporary they both seem very glad to get home  hes made a mistake he cant live herei am perfectly sure of it how is she  very welland beautifully dressed which is the main thing he added with a slight return of his humor they asked after you very particularly  unable to sleep he went out to walk the night blind envy in his brain and a hot hunger in his heart moved as he had never been moved before at thought of haneys nearness to that glowing girl their union was monstrous incredible  he no longer attempted to deceive himself he loved this young wife whose expanding personality had enthralled him from their first meeting it was not alone that she was possessed of bodily charmshe called to him through the mysterious ways which lead the one man to the predestined woman the affection he had borne towards alice heath was but the violet ray of friendship compared to the lambent leaping red flame of his passion for bertha haney she represented to him the mysterious potency and romance of the westtypifying its amazing resiliency its limitless capability of adaptation in a way that seemed roundabout and strange but which was after all very simple and very direct she had lifted her family as well as herself out of poverty back into the comfort which was their right odd masculine unexpected of phrase she had never been awkward or cheap congdon was right she was capable of high things she made mistakes of course but they were not those which a shallow personality would makethey sprang rather from the overflow of a vigorous and abounding imagination  all she needs is contact with people of the right sort she is capable of the highest culture he concluded  that she was more vital to him than any other woman in the world he now knew but he acknowledged nothing base in this confession he was not seeking ways to possess her of his loveon the contrary he was resolved to conduct himself so nobly that she would again trust and respect him my love is honorable he said i will go forward as in the beginningwhy should i notenjoying her companionship as any honest man may do  the question of his relation to alice was not so easily settled she had come to irritate him now her changeable swiftwitted moody hysterical invalidism had begun to wear upon him intolerably everything she did was wrong it was brutal even to admit this but he could no longer conceal it either from himself or from her it was deeply sadly painful to recall the promise the complete confidence and happiness with which they had both started towards the west how sure of her recovery they had been how gay and confident of purpose now she not only refused to listen to his demand for an early marriage but hampered and annoyed him in a hundred ways as he walked the silent night he was forced to acknowledge that she had been right in delaying their union and yet how dependent upon him she was her life was so tragically inwound with his that to think of shaking away her hand seemed the act of a sordid egoist  and even were i free nothing is solved  the situation took on the insoluble and the tragic in the fashion of wellbred soundly nurtured american youth he had thought of such complications only as subjects for novelists there must be concealment but not duplicity in my attitude he decided he longed for the constant light of berthas face the frequent touch of her hand her laughter was so endlessly charming her step so firm so light so graceful the grace of her bosomthe sweeping line of her side  he stopped there in that direction lay danger she trusts me and i will repay her trust she has chosen me to be her adviser putting her wealth in my handswell why not we will see whether an honorable man cannot carry forward even so difficult a relationship as this i will visit her every day i will enjoy her hospitality as freely as congdon and i will fulfil my promise to aliceif she asks it of me  but deep under the sombre resolution lay an unuttered belief in his future in his happinessfor this is the prerogative of youth the dim mountains the sinking crescent moon and the silence of the plain all seemed somehow to prophesy both happiness and peace     chapter xxv  berthas decision   it was good to wake in her old room and see the morning light breaking in golden waves against the peaks to hear her dogs bay and to listen to the murmuring voice of the fountains on the lawn it was deliciously luxurious to sit at breakfast on the vineclad porch with the shining new coffeeboiler before her while miss franklin expressed her admiration of the napery and china which the mosses had helped her to select  it was glorious to go romping with the dogs about the garden and most intoxicating to mount her horse and ride away upon the mesa mad with speed and ecstatic of the wind no one could have kept pace with her that first day at home she ran from one thing to the other she unpacked and spread out all her treasures she telegraphed her mother and phoned her friends she gave direction to the servants and examined every thing from the horses hoofs to the sewingmachine she went over the house from top to bottom to see that it was in order she was crazy with desire of doing her midday meal was a mere touchandgo lunch but when at last she was seated in her carriage with haney and miss franklin she fell back in her seat saying i feel kind o sleepy and tired  i should think you would exclaimed her teacher  of all the galloping creatures you are the most wonderful i hope youre not to keep this up  haney put in a quiet word she will not sure she cannot therell be nothin left for tomorrow  their ride was in the nature of a triumphal progress many people who had hesitated about bowing to them hitherto took this morning to unbend and mart observed with a good deal of satisfaction the town seems powerful cordial i think ill launch me boom for the senate  at the bankdoor where the carriage waited while bertha transacted some business within he held a veritable reception and the swarming tourists looking upon the sleek and shining team and the gray mustached dignified old man leaning from his seat to shake hands wondered who the local magnate was and those who chanced to look in at the window were still more interested in the handsome girl in whose honor the president of the bank left his mahogany den  in truth bertha had won almost without striving for it the recognition of the town those who had never really established anything against her seized upon this return as the moment of capitulation there was no mystery about her life she was known now and no one really knew anything evil of herwhy should she be condemned  in such wise the current of comment now set and mrs haney found herself approached by ladies who had hitherto passed her without so much as a nod she took it all composedly and in answer to their invitations bluntly answered the captain aint up to going out much and i dont like to leave him alone come and see us  she was composed with all save fordyce who now produced in her a kind of breathlessness which frightened her she longed for yet dreaded his coming and for several days avoided direct conversation with him he respected this reserve in her but was eager to get her comment on the east  how did you like new york he asked one night as they were all in the garden awaiting dinner  it scared me she answered made me feel like a ladybug in a cloverhuller but it never phased the captain she added with a smile theres nothin too good for the haneys says he and we sure went the pace we turned lucius loose we spent money wickedenough to buy out a fullsized hotel  her quaint shrewd comment on her extravagances amused ben exceedingly and by keeping to a line of questioning he drew from her nearly all her salient experiencesexcepting of course her grapple with the degenerate artist  lucius turned out the jewel they said he was  she responded with enthusiasm i should say he did he knew everything we wanted to know and more too wed have wandered around like a couple of utes if it hadnt been for him when in doubt ask lucius was our motto  she told stories of the elder haney and the mcardles and described the trials of the children in their new home till ben laughingly said its hard to run somebody elses lifeive found that out  and haney admitted with a chuckle that mac was a little bewildered like a hen with a red rag on her taildivided in his mind like as for dad he still thinks me a burglar on an improved plan  they also talked of berthas studies for miss franklin began at once to give her daily instruction in certain arts which she considered necessary to women of mrs haneys position and always at the moment of meeting they spoke of alicethat is to say haney with invariable politeness asked after her health and quite as regularly ben replied not very well once he added i can hardly get her out any more she seems more and more despondent  this report profoundly troubled bertha and the sight of alices drawn and tragic face made her miserable there was something in the sick womans gaze which awed her and she was careful not to be left alone with her the thought of her suffering and its effect on ben threw a dark shadow over the brightness of her world she was filled also with a growing uneasiness by reason of marts change of attitude towards herself in the excitement of his homecoming he seemed about to regain a large part of his former health and spirits his eyes brightened his smile became more frequent the appealing lines of his brow smoothed out and save for an occasional shortening of the breath his condition appeared to be improving  this access of vitality was apparent to bertha and should have brought joy to her as to him but it did not for with returning vitality his attitude towards her became less of the invalid and more of the lover he said nothing directlyat firstbut she was able to interpret all too well the meaning of his jocular remarks and his wistful glances once he called her attention to the returning strength in his arm the ould man is not dead yet he exulted lifting his disabled arm and clinching his fist i feel younger than at any time since me accident and as he spoke she perceived something of the lion in the light of his eyes  one night as she was passing his chair he reached for her and caught her and drew her down upon his knee sit ye down a wink yere always on the move like a flibbertybidget  she struggled free of his embrace her face clouded with alarm and anger dont be a fool she said harshly  he released her saying humbly dont be angry darlin tis foolish of me an ould crippled wolf to be thinking of matin with a fawn like yrself i dont blame ye go your ways  she went to her room with his voiceso humbly penitent and resignedlingering in her ears trembling with the weight of the burden which his amorous mood had laid upon her  she resented his action the more because life at the moment was so full of joy each morning was filled with pleasant duties and each afternoon they drove to the office to discuss the mines with ben and in the evening he called to sit for an hour or two on the porch smoking talking till mart grew sleepy and yawned these meetings were deliciously calmly delightful for mrs gilman or miss franklin was always present and though the talk was general ben talked for her ears at times but always impersonally and she honored him for his delicacy his reserve his respect for her position as a married woman recognizing the care with which he avoided everything which might embarrass her  and now by force of marts humble suing her halfforgotten scruples were revived her uneasiness began again a decision was finally and definitely thrust upon her instantly she was beset by all her doubts and desires and the sky darkened with clouds of trouble  to make mart happy was still her wish but the way was not so easy of choice nor so simple to follow as it had once seemed the briers were thick before her feet there was so much of personal gratification so much of selfish pleasure in remaining his companion warmed and defended by all the comfort and dignity which his wealth had brought to her that it seemed a kind of treachery to halt with her duty half done to be his spouse to become the mother of his children this alone would entitle her to his bounty i cant do it she cried outi cant i cant and yet not to do his will was to remain a pensioner and to be under indictment as an adventuress  she had read somewhere these words from a great philosopher the woman who bears a child to any man should instantly be lawfully seized of onehalf his goods for by that sublime act she takes her life in her hand as truly as the soldier who charges upon an invading host the anguish of maternity should sanctify every woman  on the other side of her hedge lay enticing freedom it seemed at times as though to be again in the little office of the golden eagle hotel would be a more perfect happiness than this she now enjoyedbut that too was illusory how could she repay the money she had used the moment she left marshall haney she would not only be poor she would be profoundly in his debt where could she find the money to repay him and to make her schooling possible  perplexity was in her darkened eyes happiness and sorrow doubt and delight grew along each paththickly interwovenand decision became each day more difficult it was hateful to lie under the charge of having married merely for a gamblers money and yet to plunge her mother and herself back into poverty would seem to others the act of one insane as she pondered the problem of her life she lost all of her girlish lightness of heart and lay in her luxurious bed a brooding troubled woman  she could have gone on indefinitely with the halffilial halffraternal relationship into which she and mart had fallen but the thought of that other most intimate most elemental union which his touch had made more definite than ever before produced in her a shudder of repulsion of positive loathing she could no longer endure the clasp of his hand and in spite of herself she was forced by contrasting experience to acknowledge the allurement which lay in ben fordyces handsome face and strong and graceful body  i must go awayfor a while at least ill go back to the ranch and think it over  and yet even the ranch was partly haneys how could she escape from her indebtedness to him to what could she turn to make a living to leave this big house and her horses her garden her dresses and jewels required heroic resolution but what of the long days of toil and dulness to which she must return  worn with the ceaseless alternations of these thoughts she fell into a dream that was half a waking vision she thought she had just packed a bag with the gown she wore the night she came to haneys rescue when he came shuffling into her room and said where are you goin darlin  she replied to the ranchto think things over  the tears came to his eyes and he said tis the sun out of me sky when ye go bertie do not stay long  she promised to be back soon but rode away with settled intent never to return  no one knew her on the train for she had drawn her veil close and sat very still it seemed that she went near the mine in some strange way and at the switch williams got on the train to stop her and persuade her to return he was terribly agitated didnt you know mart is sick he said in a tone of reproach it seemed as if a broad river of years flowed between herself and the girl who used to see this queer little man enter her hotel doorbut he was unchanged you cant do this thing he went on his lips trembling with emotion  what thing she asked  fordyce tells me youre going to throw poor old mart overboard  thats my notioni cant be his wife and so im getting out she answered  but girl you cant do that and he swore in his excitement mart needs youwe all need you itll kill him  i cant help it she answered with infinite weariness in throat and brain i pass it up and go back to my brother  i dont see why  because ive no right to marts money  youre crazy to think of such a thing you a queen whos goin to catch the money when you drop it he asked and helplessly added i dont believe you youre kiddin youre tryin us out  im doing nothing to earn this luxury  doing nothing my god youve made mart haney over new youve converted himas they say youve redeemed him let me tell you something little sister mart worships you it does him good just to see you you dont expect the moon to fry bacon do you stars dont run pumps mart is satisfied every time you speak to him or pass by him he gets happy all the way throughi know for i feel just the same  there was something in his eloquence that went to the heart of the dreaming girl if any one in her world was to be trusted it was this ugly little man who never presumed to ask even a smile for himself and whose unswerving loyalty to mart made her own flight a base and cruel act and yet even as he pleaded his face faded and she fancied herself stepping from the train in sibley unnoticed by even the hackmen who used to bring the humbler passengers of each train to the door of the golden eagle hotel  she walked up the sidewalk surprised to find it changed to brick the hotel was gone and in its place stood a saloon marked haneys place this hardened her heart again that settles it she said bitterly hes gone back to his old business  the road out to the ranch seemed very long and hot but she had no money not a cent left with which to hire a carriage and she kept saying to herself if mart knew this hed send lucius and the machine i reckon hed be sorry to see me walking in this dust its a good thing i have my old brown dress on she passed lovingly regretfully over the splendid gowns which hung in her wardrobe what will become of them she asked fan cant wear them this called up a vision of fan and her eldest daughter sweeping about in her splendor her operacloak only half encompassing the mother while the girl swished over the floor in the gown she had worn at her last dinner in the east she laughed and cried at the same timeit was painful to see them thus abused  then she seemed suddenly to enter the grove of twisted haglike cedars which stood upon the mesa back of the ranchhouse byandby i will look like this she dreamed and laid her hand on one that was ragged and gnarled and gray with a thousand years of sun and wind and even as she stood there with the old crones moaning round her ben suddenly confronted her  her first impulse was for flight so sad and bitter was his face she began to pity him his boyhood seemed to have slipped from him like a gay cloak revealing the stern man beneath  he met her gravely selfcontainedly yet with restrained passion and his voice was sternly calm as he began i have come to ask you what you wish to do with marshall haneys inheritance i will not be a party to your action i helped him plan out his will and he said he could trust you to do the right thing and i have come to tell you that his will must be yours  what do you mean she asked  he is dead he replied  her heart turned to ice at the sound of his words so clear succinct and piercing then the cedars began to wail and wail and sway in eldrich grief but she who felt most remorse could not utter a sound to prove her own despair and in the tumult her dream ended abruptly and she woke to hear the night wind whistling weirdly through the screen of her open window  she lay in silence shuddering with the subsiding terror of her vision till she came to a full realization of the fact that it was all but a night terror and that mart was still alive and her decision not yet irrevocably made  she shuddered againnot in grief but in terroras she relived the vivid hour of selfchosen poverty which her dream had brought her yes the magic of wealth had spoiled her for sibley and the ranch to go back there was impossible i will try the east she said the mosses will help me and yet to return to chicagoafter having played the grand ladywould be bitterly hard suppose her friends should meet her with cold eyes and hesitating words suppose they too had loved her money and not herself suppose even joe who seemed as true as williams should prove to be a selfish sycophant ah yes it would be a different city with the magic of haneys money no longer hers to command  in this hour of deepest misery and despair the sheen of his gold returned like sunlight after a storm and yet even as she permitted herself to imagine how sweetly the new day would dawn with her determination to remain the mistress of this great house the old fear the new disgust returned to plague her her love for ben fordyce came alsoand the knowledge that alice was dying of a broken heart because of bens growing indifferenceall these perplexities made the coming of sunlight a mockery  she rose to the new day quite as undecided as before and more deeply saddened one thing was plainben should come no more to visit herfor alices sake he must keep the impersonal attitude of the legal adviser in that way alone could even the semblance of peace be won     chapter xxvi  alice visits haney   alice heath was dying of something far subtler than the white death to which haney so often referred tortured by bens studied tenderness when at her side she suffered doubly when he was away knowing all too well that his keenest pleasure now lay in berthas companionship her doubt darkened into despair in certain moments of exaltation she rose to such heights of impersonal passion as to acknowledge fully generously the claims of youth and healthadmitting that she and marshall haney were the offenders and not the young lovers whose desire for happiness was but an irresistible manifestation of the mystic force which binds the generations together  why do we not quietly take ourselves off and make them happy she asked herself of what selfish quality is our love here am i only a spiteful hopeless invalidi hate myself i despise my body and everything i am i loathe my wrinkled face my shrivelled hands my flat chest i am fit only to be bride to death im tired of the worldtired of everythingand yet i do not die why cant i die  these moods never soared high enough or sank quite low enough to permit the final severing stroke and she ended each of them in a flood of tears filled with evergreater longing for the beautiful young lover whose heart had wandered away from her it was hard not to welcome him when he came but infinitely harder to send him away for life held no other solace the day no other aim  in her saner moments she was aware of her own misdemeanor she knew that her morbid questioning her ceaseless grievings were wearing away her vital force and that no doctor could ever again medicine her to sweet sleep that no wind or cloud would bring coolness to her burning brain i am no longer worthy of any mans love she admitted to her higher self  she did not question bens honorhe was of those who keep faith he has no hope of ever being other than the distant lover of bertha haney and he is ready to fulfil his word to me but i will not permit him to bind himself to me it would be a crime to lay upon him the burden of a wife old before her time sterile and doomed to a slow decline she revolted too at the thought of having a husband whose heart was elsewhere whose restless desire could not be held within the circuit of his wifes armsand yet she could not give him up  as her flesh lost its weight and her blood its warmth her mind burned with even more mysterious brightness sending out rays of such perilous sublimation that she was able to perceive as no earthly inhabitant should do the jealously guarded secrets of those surrounding her and on the night of berthas struggle against her fate she divined in some supersensuous way the tumult in the young wifes mind  she laughed at first with a cruel bitter delight but at last her nobler self conquered and she resolved to have private speech with haney she perceived a danger in the everdeepening passion of the young lovers she began to fear that their love might soon break over all barriers and this she was still sane enough of thought and generous enough of soul to wish to prevent  her decision to act was hastened by a slurring paragraph in the morning paper wherein veiled allusion was made to a developing scandal she lay abed all the forenoon brooding over it and when she rose it was to dress for her visit to haney sick as she was and almost hysterical with her mood she ordered a carriage and drove to the gamblers house hoping to find him alone determined upon an interview  it chanced that he was sitting in his place upon the porch watching the gardener spraying a tree he greeted his visitor most cordially inviting her to a seat bertie is down town but shell be back soon  im glad she is away captain haney for i have something to say to you alone  have you indeed very well ive nothing to do but listentis not for me to boss the gardener  she looked about with uneasy eyes finding it very difficult to begin her attack how much youve improved the place she remarked irrelevantly her voice betraying the deepest agitation  he looked at her white face in astonishment how are ye the day miss  im better thank you but a little out of breathi walked too fast i think  does the altitude make your heart jump too he asked solicitously  no my trouble is all in my mindi mean my lungs she answered then with a ghastly attempt at sprightliness she added now lets have a nice long talk about symptomsits so comforting how are you feeling these days  haney answered with unwonted dejection im not so well today worse luck this is me day for thinkin the doctors are right they all agree that me hearts overworked up here his dejection was really due to berthas moody silence  im sorry to hear that do they think you may live safely at sealevel  they say so me own feeling is that the climate is not to blame tis age im like a hollowhearted tree ready to fall with the first puff of ill wind ive never been a man since that devil blew me to pieces  she put her right hand upon his arm is it not a shame that you and i should stand in the way of two fine wholesome young peopleshutting them off from happiness  he turned a glance upon her quite too penetrating to be borne you manewhatwho  i mean bertha  do i stand in the way of her happiness  she met the question squarely speaking with tense drawn lips yes just as i do in bens way were neither of us fit to be married and they are  his eyes wavered thats true im no mate for herand yet i think ive made her happy he was silent a moment then faltered ye lay your hand on a sore spotye do surely tis true ive tried to have the money make up for me other shortcomings he ended almost humbly  money can do much but it cant buy happiness  thats true toobut tis able to buy comfort and thats next door to happiness in the longrun im thinkin but im watchin her and i dont intend to stand in her way miss ive told her so and when the conquering lad comes along i mane to get out of the road  have you said that her face reached towards his with sudden intensity and a snakelike brilliancy glittered in her eyes youve gone as far as that  i have  then act for the time has come to make your promise good bertha already loves a man as every girl should love who marries happily and the gossips are even now busy with her name  he was hard hit and slowly said i dont believe it who is the mantell me he demanded this in a tone that was not to be denied  she delivered her sentence quickly she loves ben havent you seen it she has loved him from their first meeting i have known it for a long time almost from the first now everybody knows it and the society reporters are beginning their innuendoes the next thing will be her picture in the sensational press and a scandal dont you know this it must not happen we must make way for themyou and i we cumber the path  he sank back into his seat and studied her from beneath his overhanging eyebrows as intently as alertly as silently as he was wont to do when watching the faces of his opponents in a game of high hazard there was something uncanny almost elfish in the womans voice and eyes and yet even before her words were fully uttered the truth stood revealed to him his eyes lost their stern glare his hands which had clutched the arms of his chair relaxed are you sure he asked again but more gently youve got to be sure he ended almost in menace  you may trust a jealous woman she answered i dont blame themobserve that we are the ones to blamewe who are crippled and in the way and it is our duty to take ourselves off what is the use of spoiling their lives just for a few years of selfish gratification of our own miserable selves  he felt about for comfort they are young they can wait he stammered huskily  but they wont wait she replied love like theirs cant wait dont you understand they are in danger of forgetting themselves cant you see it ben talks of nothing else dreams of nothing else but her and she is fighting temptation every day and shows it its all so plain to me that i cant bear to see them together they have loved each other from the very first night they meti felt it that day we first rode together ive watched her grow into bens life till she absorbs his every thought hes a good boy and i want to keep him so he respects your claim and he is trying to be loyal to me but he cant hold out i am ready to sacrifice myself but that would not save him he loves your wife and until you free her he is in danger of wronging her and himself and you ive given up there is nothing more on this earth for me what do you expect to gain by holding to a wifes garment when shethe womanis gone  the wildness in her eyes and voice profoundly affected haney who was without subtlety in affairs of the heart the women he had known had been mainly coarsefibred or of brutish directness of passion and purpose and this womans words and tone at once confused and appalled him all she said of his unworthiness as a husband was true he had gone to sibley at first to win bertha at less cost than making her his wifebut of that he had repented and on his deathbed as he thought he had sought to endow her with his gold since then he had lived but only as half a man up to this moment he had hoped to regain his health but now every hope died within him  part of this he admitted at once but he ended brokenly tis a hard task you set for me shes the vein of me bosom tis easy talkin but the doin is like takin yr heart in your two hands and throwin it away i knew she liked the ladi had no doubt the lad liked herbut i did not believe shed go to him so i cant believe it yetbut i will not stand in her way as i told her i did not expect to tie her to an old hulk i thought i was dying when i married her and i only had the ceremony then to make sure that me money should feed her and protect her from the storms of the world i wanted to take her out of a hole where she was sore pressed and i wanted to make her people comfortable ive brought her to this house me money has always been to her hand it rejoices me to see her spend it and ive been hoping that these thingsme moneywould make up for me poor old crippled body ive been a rough man i lived as men who have no ties have always livedtill i met her then i quit the game i put aside everything that could make her ashamed im no toad missi know she has that in her soul that can take her out of my level were i twenty years younger and a well man i could folly herbut tis no use debating now ill talk with her this night he paused abruptly and turned upon her with piercing inquiry have you discussed this with ben  she was beginning to tremble in face of the storm which she foresaw looming before her noi lacked the courage  a faintly bitter smile stirred his upper lip shall i tell him what you have said to me  no no she exclaimed in sudden affright i will tell him  be sure ye do as for these editors i have me own way of dealing with them i will soon know whether you are right or wrong yere a sick woman and such they say have queer fancies you admit youre jealous and ive heard that jealous women are built of hellfire and vitriol anyhow youve not shaken me faith in me girlbut ye have in ben for i know the heart of man were all alike when it comes to the question of women  please dont misunderstand meit is to keep them both what they are good and true that i come to youwe must not tempt them to evil  i understand what you say miss and i think youre honest but you may be mistaken i saw her meetup with fine young fellies in the east i could see they admired herbut she turned them down easily shes no weakminded chippy as i know on me own accountthe more shame to me  of course she turns others down for the reason that ben fills her heart she began to weary of her selfimposed task  he too was tired well see well see he repeated musingly and gazed away towards the cloudenshrouded peaks in sombre silencethe lines of his lips as sorrowful as those of an old lion dying in the desert arrowsmitten and alone he had forgotten the hand that pierced his heart  thus dismissed she rose her eyes burning like deep opals in the parchment setting of her skin  life is so cruel she said i have wished a thousand times that love had never come to me love means only sorrow at the end ben has been my life my only interestand nowas he begins to forgetoh i cant bear it it will kill me she sank back into her chair and burying her face sobbed with such passion that her slight frame shook in the tempest of it  haney turned and looked at her in silenceprofoundly stirred to pity by her sobs no longer doubting the reality of her despair when he spoke his voice was brokenly sweet and very tender  tis a bitter world miss and me heart bleeds for such as you tis well ye have a hope of paradise for if all you say is true ye must go from this world cheated and hungry like meself ye have one comfort that i have nottis not your own doing yeve not misspent your life as i have done what does it all show but that life is a game where each man good or bad takes his chance the cards fall against you and against me without care of what we are i can only say i take me chances as i take the rain and the sun  her paroxysm passed and she rose again drawing her veil closely over her face goodbye we will never meet again  dont say that he said struggling painfully to his feet never is a long time and goodbye a cruel sad word to say lets call it so long and better luck  you are not angry with me she turned to ask  not at all missi thank ye fer opening me eyes to me selfishness  goodbye  so long and may ye have better luck in the new deal miss  as she turned at the gate she saw him standing as she had left him his brow white and sad and stern his shoulders drooping as if his strength and love of life had suddenly been withdrawn  while still in this mood she sent word to ben that she wished to see him at once and he responded without delay  he was appalled by the change in her her interview with haney had profoundly weakened her chilled her she was like some exquisite lamp whose golden flame had grown suddenly dim and fordyce was filled with instant remorseful tenderness his sense of duty sprang to arms and without waiting for her to begin he said i hate to think of you as a pensioner in this house you should be in your own homeour homewhere i could take care of you come let me take you out of this private hospitalthats what it is  she struggled piteously to assure him that she would be back to par in a few days but he was thoroughly alarmed and refused to listen to further delay  your surroundings are bad you need a change  she read him to the soul knew that this argument sprang not from love but from pity and selfaccusation therefore forcing a light tone she answered i dont feel able to take command of a cook and second girl just yet bennie dear besides youre all wrong about this being a bad atmosphere for me im horribly comfortable here my own sister couldnt be kinder than julia is no no wait a few months longer till you get settled a little more securely in business i may pick up a volt or two more of electricity by that time then as she saw his face darken and a tremor run over his flesh she lost her selfcontrol and broke forth with sudden bitter intensity why dont you throw me over and marry some nice girl with a healthy body and sane mind why cheat yourself and me  he recoiled before her question too amazed to do more than exclaim against her going on  she was not to be checked let us be honest with ourselves you know perfectly well im never going to get betteri do if you dont i may linger on in this way for years but i will never be anything but a querulous invalid now thats the bitter truth you mustnt marry mei wont let you then her mood changed and yet its so hard to go on aloneeven for a little way  her eyes closed on her hot tears her head drooped and ben putting his arm about her neck and pressing her quivering face against his breast reproached her very tenderly i wont let you say such things dearestyou must not youre not yourself today  oh yes i am my mind is very clear too horribly clear ben dear i mean all i sayyou shall not link yourself to me i have no delusions now ill never be well againand you must know it  oh yes you will dont give up youre only tired today youre really much better than you were last week  no im not let us not deceive ourselves any longer the change of climate has not done me good we waited too long it has all been a mistake let me go back to chesterim afraid to die out here i cant bear the thought of being buried in this soil its so bleak and lonely and alien i want to go back to the sweet kindly hillsperhaps i can reconcile myself to death thereto sink into the earth on this plain is too dreadful  he struggled against the weight of her sorrowful pleadings this is only a mood dearest you are overtired and things look black to youi have such dayseverybody has these hours of depression but we must fight them it would be so much better for us both if i were your husband then i could be with you and watch over you every hour i could help you fight these dismal moods it would be my hourly care come lets go out and seriously set to work to find a cottage  she was silenced for the moment but when he had finished his counterplea she looked up at him with deepset glance and quietly said ben its all wrong it was wrong from the very beginning you are lashing yourself into uttering these beautiful words and you do not realize what you are saying i am too old for younow listenits true im twenty years older in spirit i havent been really well for ten years you talk of fighting this havent i fought ive danced when i should have been in bed ive had a premonition of early decay for yearsthats why ive been so reckless of my strength i couldnt bear to let my youth pass dullyand now its gone waitive deceived you in other ways ive been full of black thoughts ive been jealous and selfish all along you deserve the loveliest girl in the world and it is a cruel shame for me to stand in the way of your happiness just to have you light my darkness for a few hours i know what you want to sayyou think you can be happy with me ben its only your foolish sense of honor that keeps you loyal to mei dont want thati wont have it take back your pledge she pushed away from him and twisted a ring from her finger take this dear boy you are absolutely free go and be happy  he drew back from her hand in pain and bewilderment alice you are crazy to say such things to me he studied her with suffering in his eyes you are delirious i am going to send the doctor to you at once  no im not delirious i know only too well what im sayingi have made my decision i will never wear this ring again she turned his words against himself you must not marry a crazy woman  i didnt mean thatyou know what i meant all you say is morbid and unreasonable and i will not listen to it you are clouded by some sick fancy today and i will go away and send a physician to cure you of your madness  she thrust the ring into his hand and rose her face tense her eyes wonderfully big and luminous she seemed at the moment to renew her health and to recover the imperious grace of her radiant youth as she exaltedly said now i am free you must ask me all over againand when you do i will say no  he sat looking up at her too bewildered too much alarmed to find words for reply he really thought that she had gone suddenly madand yet all that she said was frightfully reasonable in his heart he knew that she was uttering the truth their marriage was now impossiblea bridal veil over that face was horrifying to think upon  she went on now run awayim going to cry in a moment and i dont want you to see me do it please go  he rose stiffly and when he spoke his voice was quivering with anxiety i am going to send julia to you instantly  no youre not i wont see her if you do she cant help menobody can but youand i wont let you even see me any more im going home to chester tomorrow so kiss me goodbyeand go  he kissed her and went blindly out their engagement ring tightly clinched in his hand it seemed as if a wide cold gray cloud had for the first time entirely covered his sunny youthful world     chapter xxvii  marshall haneys sentence   after alice heaths carriage had driven away haney returned to his chair and with eyes fixed upon the distant peaks gave himself up to a review of all that the sick woman had said and entered also upon a forecast of the game  he was not entirely unprepared for her revelation he was indeed too wise not to know that bertha must sometime surely find in another and younger man her hearts hunger but his wish had set that dark day far away in the future moreover he had relied on her promise to confide in him and it hurt him to think that she had not fulfilled her pledge yet even in this he sought excuses for her  she may love him without knowing it anyhow hes a fine young lad far better for her than an old shouldershot cayuse like meself his sense of unworthiness became the solvent of other and sweeter emotions his wealth no longer seemed capable of bridging the deep chasm widening between them  this day had shown a black sky to him even before alice heaths disturbing call for bertha had been darkly brooding at breakfast and silent at lunch and immediately after rising from the table had gone away alone without a word of explanation to any member of her household she had not even taken her dogs with her and her face was set and almost sullen as she passed out of the door and down the walk all this was so unlike her that mart was greatly troubled it gave weight and significance to every word of alice heaths warning  bertha was gone till nearly six oclock and her mood seemed no whit lightened as she entered the gate and came slowly up the walk to marts humbly spoken query what troubles ye darlin she made no reply but went at once to her room  the old gambler seemed pitiably helpless and forlorn as he sat there in his accustomed chair waiting her return the bees and birds were busy among the vines and all the welloiled machinery of his splendid home was going forward to the end that his sweet girlwife should be served if she were unhappy of what value were these soft rugs these savory dishes this shining silver there was in truth something mocking and terrifying in the swift welltrained action of the servants who went about their tasks unmoved and apparently unacquainted with any change in the mind of their young mistress  in the kitchen the cook was carefully compounding the soup while watching the roast lucius deft and absorbed was preparing the table arranging the coffee service and deciding upon the china on the seat under the peartrees miss franklin was chatting with mrs gilman and in the barn the coachman could be heard giving the horses their evening taste of green grassand yet how empty aimless and foolish it all is if bertha is unhappy thought the master  he grew alarmed for fear she would not come down but at last he heard her light step on the stairs and when she came in view his dim eyes were startled by the transformation in her she had put on the plainest of her gowns and she wore no jewels by other ways which he felt but could not analyze she expressed some portentous shift of mood he could not define why but her step scared him so measured and resolute it seemed  she called to her mother and miss franklin and then asked has dinner been announced  her tone was quiet and natural and mart was relieved he answered with attempt at jocularity lucius is this minute winkin at me over the souptureen  as they took seats at the table mrs gilman exclaimed why dearie where did you dig up that old waist  will it do to visit sibley in  no indeed i should say not when you go back there i want you to wear the best youve got theyll consider it an insult if you dont  a faint smile lighted berthas pale face i dont think theyll take it so hard as all that  are you goin to sibley asked mart an anxious tone in his voice  i thought of it mother is going over tonight and i rather guess ill run over with her ive never been back you see since that night  there was something ominous in her restraint in her abstraction of glance and especially in her lack of appetite she took little account of her guests and seemed profoundly engaged upon some inward calculation the beautifully spread table which would have thrilled her a few short weeks ago was powerless to even hold her gaze and it was lucius deft and watchful who brought the meal to a successful conclusionfor the mother was awed and helpless in the presence of the queenly daughter whom wealth had translated into something almost too high and shining for her to lay hand upon  miss franklin did her best but she was not a person of light and dancing intellectual feet and she had never understood haney anyhow altogether it was a dismal and difficult halfhour  when the coffee came on bertha rose abruptly saying come out into the garden mart ive got something to say to you  he obeyed with a sense of being called to account and as they walked slowly across the grass which the light of a vivid orange sunset had made transcendently green he glanced to the west with foreboding that this was the last time he should look upon the kingly peak at sunset time a flaming helmet of cloud shone upon the chief and all the lesser heights were a deep purple bank out of which each serrate summit rose without perspective sharply set against the other like a monstrous silhouette of cardboard  it should have been indeed a very sweet and odorous and peaceful hour the murmur of the water from the fountain had the lulling sound of a hive of bees as they settle to rest and to the suffering man it seemed impossible that this his cherished world could change to the black chaos which the loss of his adorable wife would bring upon it  the settee was of wire and curved so that when they had taken seats they faced each other and the sight of her so slender so graceful so womanly filled him with a fury of hate against the assassin who had torn him to pieces making him old before his time a cripple impotent inert and scarred  bertha did not wait for him to begin and her first words smote like bullets mart im going back to sibley  he looked at her with startled eyeshis brow wrinkling into sorrowful lines for how long  i dont knowit may be a good while im going away to think things over then she added firmly i may not come back at all mart  for gods sake dont say that girlie you dont mean that his voice was husky with the agony that filled his throat i cant live without ye now dont gothat way  ive got to go mart my mind aint made up to this proposition i dont know about living with you any more  why not whats the matter darlin cant ye put up with me a little longer i know im only a piece of a manbut tell me the truth cant you stay with meas we are  she met him with the truth but not the whole truth everybody thinks i married you for your money martit aint truebut the evidence is all against me the only way to prove it a lie is to just naturally pull out and go back to work i hate to leave so long as youfeel about me as you dobut mart im bleeged to do it my mind is so stirred upi dont enjoy anything any more i used to like everything in the houseall my nice thingsthe dresses and trinkets you gave me it was fun to run the kitchennow it all goes against the grain some way fact is none of it seems mine  his eyes were wet with tears as he said its all my fault its all because of what i said last night  she stopped him no it aint thatit aint your fault its mine somethings gone wrong with me i love this home and my dogs and horses and alland yet i cant enjoy em any more they dont belong to menow thats the fact mart  ill make em yours darlin ill deed em all over to you  no no that wont do it my mind has got to change its all in my mind dont you see ive got to get away from the whole outfit and think it all out if i can come back i will but you mustnt bank on my return mart you mustnt be surprised if i settle on the other side of the range  i know he said sadly i know your reason and i dont blame you tis not for an old derelict like me to hold youbut you must let me give you some of me moneytis of no value to me now if ye do not let me share it with you me heart will break entirely  i havent a right to a cent of it marti owe you more than i can ever pay no i cant afford to take another cent  in the pause which followed his face took on a look of new resolution bertie ive had something happen to me today ive learned something i should have known long since  her look of surprise deepened into dismay as he went on i know whats the matter with you girlie tis after seeing ben your face always shines you love him bertieand i dont blame you  a carriage driving up to the gate brought diversion and she sprang up her face flushed her eyes big and scared there comes dr steele id plumb forgot about his call  so had i he answered as he rose to meet his visitor  dr steele a grayhaired vigorous man entered the gate and came hurriedly up the path something fateful in his stride he greeted them both casually smilelessly ive got to get that next train he announced mechanically looking at his watch and that leaves me just twenty minutes in which to thump you  bertha was in awe of this blunt tactless man of science and as they moved towards the house listened in chilled silence while he continued brent writes me that you were doing pretty well down by the lake why didnt you stay he says he advised you not to come back  this is me home answered haney simply  lucius took berthas place at marts shoulder and the three men went into the library leaving her to wait outside in anxious solitude there was something in the doctors manner which awed her filled her with new conceptions new duties  steele was one of these coldblooded practitioners who do not believe in the oldfashioned manner cheery suggestion was nonsense to him his examination was to bertha as to haney a dreaded ordeal however brent had advised it and they had agreed to submit to it and now here he was and upon his judgment she must rest  for half an hour she waited in the hall almost without moving so farreaching did this verdict promise to be her anxiety deepened into fear as steele came out of the room and walked rapidly towards her hes a very sick man he burst forth irritably get him away from here as quickly as you canbut dont excite him dont let him exert himself at all till you reach a lower altitude keep him quiet and peaceful and dont let him clog himself up with starchy foodand above all keep liquors away from him he shouldnt have come back here at all brent warned him that he couldnt live up here slide him down to sealevelif hell goand take care of him his heart will run along all right if he dont overtax it hell last for years at sealevel  he hates to leavehe says he wont leave she explained  the man of science shrugged his shoulders all right he can take his choice of roadshe used an expressive gestureup or down one leads to the new jerusalem and is shortas hell find out if he stays here goodnight i must get that train  wait a minute she called after him is there anything i can do did you leave any medicine  he turned and came back yes a temporary stimulant but medicine is of little use if you can get away tomorrow you do it  she stood a few minutes at the library door listening waiting and at last hearing no sound opened the door decisively and went in  haney ghastly pale in limp dejection almost in collapse was seated in an easychair with lucius holding a glass to his lips he was stripped to his undershirt and looked like a defeated gray old gladiator fallen helpless in the arena deserted by all the world save his one faithful servantand berthas heart was wrenched with a deep pang of pity and remorse as she gazed at him the doctors warning became a command to desert him in returning health was bad enough to desert him now was impossible  running to him all her repugnance gone all her tenderness awake she put her arm about his shoulders oh mart did he hurt you are you worse  he raised dim eyes to her eyes that seemed already filmed with deaths opaque curtains but bravely slowly smiled im down but not out darlin that brute of a doctor jolted me hard i nearly took the countbut imstill in the ring harness me up lucius ill show that sawbones the power of mind over matterthe ould croaker  he recovered rapidly and was soon able to stagger to his feet then with a return of his wonted humor he stretched out his big right arm im not to be put out of business by wan punch from an old puddin like steele i am not the stiff he thinks he had me agin the ropes tis true but ill surprise him yet  what did he say she persisted in demanding  he shook his head thats bechune the two of us he nodded warningly at lucius for one thing he says me heart cant stand the high country its you to the deep valley says he  her decision was ready all right then we go  he faced her quickly did ye say we bertie did ye say it sweetheart  i did martive changed my mind once more im goin to stick by youtill youre settled somewhere i wont leave till youre better  the tears blinded his eyes again and his lips twitched youre gods own angel bertie but i dont deserve it no stay you hereim not worth your sacrifice no no i cant have it stay here with ben and look after the mines  her face settled in lines that were not girlish as she repeated its up to me to go and im going mart i didnt realize how bad it was for you herei didnt really  its all wrong im afraidall wrong he answered but the lord knows i need you worse than ever  shut off on all that she commanded lucius help me take him outside where the air is better  mart put the man away one is enough he said brusquely and so leaning on his strong young wife he went slowly out into the dusk where the mother and miss franklin were sitting quite unconscious of the deep significance of the doctors visit not a word to them warned haneyat any rate not tonight  they were now both facing the pain of instantly abandoning all these beautiful and ministering material conditions which money had called round them it seemed so foolish so incredibly sillythis mandate of the physician could any place on the earth be more healthful more helpful to human life than this wideporched coolhalled house this garden this air what difference could a few thousand feet make on the hearts action  the thought of putting away all hope of seeing ben fordyce came at last to overtop all berthas other regrets as the lordly peak overrode the cloudsand yet she was determined to go very quietly she told her mother that she had decided to put off her visit to sibley and at 1030 she drove down to the station and sent her away composedly at the moment she was glad to get her out of the town so that she should not share in the grief of next days departure to miss franklin she then confided the doctors warning and together they began to pack  haney with lowering brow and bleeding heart went to his bed denouncing himself i have no right to her tis the time for me to step out if the doctor knows his business tis only a matter of a few weeks anyhow when my seat in the game will be empty why not stay here in me own home and so end it all comfortably  this was so simpleand yet he spent most of the night fighting the desire to live out those years the doctor had promised him it was so sweet to sit opposite that dear girlface of a morning to feel her hand on his hairnow and again shes only a childshe can wait ten years and still be young but then came the thought tis harder for her to wait than it is for me to go tis mere selfishness what can i do in the world i have no interest in the game outside of her no mart the consumptive is right tis up to you to slip away genteel and quiet so that your widow will not be troubled by anny gossip  to use the pistol was easy the handle fitted his hand but to die so that no shock or shame would come to her that was his problem i will not leave her the widow of a suicide he resolved i must go so sly so casuallike that no one will be able to point the finger at her or ben  can i visit the mine once more he had asked steele no the doctor had replied to go a thousand feet higher than this would be fatal  as he mused on this he began to feel the wonder of the body in which he dwelt that a machine so bulky and so gross could be so delicate that a change in the pressure of the atmosphere might be fatal astonished him ill soon know he said for i cross the range tomorrow  the dark shadow of the unseen world once so dim and far now rose formidable as a mountain on the horizon of his thought it was so difficult to leave the house in which he had found peace and a strange kind of happiness the happiness of a soldier home on parole convalescent and content under the appletreesit was very hardand the tenderness the care to which his little wife had returned and which filled his heart with sweetness added to his irresolution  he fell into deep sleep at last still in debate with himself  he woke quietly next morning like a child and as his eyes took in the big room in which he had slept for a year surrounded by such luxury as he had never dreamed of having even for a day life seemed very easy of continuance and steele a mistaken egotist a foul destroyer of mens peace but as he rose to dress and saw himself in the glass the figure he presented decided his hand was this mart haneythis unshaven haggard and wrinkled old man  leaning close to the mirror he studied his face as if it were a mask deep creases ran down on either side of the nose giving to his gaze the morose expression of an aged slavering mastiff his nerveless cheeks depended his neck was stringy puffy sacs lay under the eyes and the ashen pallor of his skin told how the heart was laboring to maintain lifes red current in its round  as he looked his decision was taken mart the game has run mostly in your favor for twentyfive yearsbut tis agin ye now the quiet old gentleman with the bony grin holds the winning fist lay down your cards and quit the board this day like a man why drag on like this for a year or two more a burden to yourself and a curse to her  and yet though crippled and gray death was somehow more dreadful to him at this moment than when in his remorseless and powerful young manhood he had looked again and again into the murderous eyes of those who were eager to shed his blood he shivered at the thought of the dark river as those whose limbs having grown pale and thin dread the cold wind of the night  i wonder is the mother over there waitin fer me he half whispered if ye are your soul will be floating far above me in the light while iburdened by me sinsmust wallow below in purgatory but i go and the divil take his toll  there was not much preparation to be made his will was written fully attested and filed in a safe place his small personal belongings he was willing to leave in berthas hands it was hardest of all to vanish without a word of goodbye to any soul but this was essential to his plan no one must suspect design in me departure he muttered i must drop outby accident i must cut loose during the day toono night trips for mein a way that will look natural if steele knows his business mart haney will go out of the game on the summit if not tis easy for a cripple to stagger and fall from a rock thank god i leave her as i found hersmall credit to me in that  lucius coming in soon after found his master unexpectedly cheerful and vigorous  in answer to his query the gambler said i take me medicine lucius like a cheyenne tis all in the game some man must lose in order that another may win the wheel rolls and the board is charged in favor of the bank damn the man that squeals when the cards fall fair     chapter xxviii  virtue triumphs   mart maintained his deceptive cheer at the breakfasttable and the haggard look of the earlier hour passed away as he resolutely attacked his chop he spoke of his exile in a tone of resignationmixed with humor sure the old dad will have the laugh on us he told us this was the jumpinoff place  what will we do about the house asked bertha will we sell or rent  nayther lave it as it is replied he quickly so long as i live i want to feel tis here ready for ye whinever ye wish to use it tis not mine without you i never would have had it and i want no other mistress in it sure every chair every picture on the walls is there because of ye tis all you and no one else shall mar it while i live  this was the note which was most piercing in her ears and she hastened to stop it by remarking the expense of maintaining the placeits possible decay and the like but to all this he doggedly replied i care not id rather burn it and all there is in it than turn it over to some other woman go you to ben and tell him my will concerning it  this gave a new turn to her thought i dont want to do that why dont you go and tell him yourself  didnt the doctor say i must save meself worry i hate to ask ye to shoulder the heavy end of this proposition his face lost its forced smile im a sick man darlin i know it now and i must save meself all i can ye may send lucius down and bring him up or well drive down and see him maybe the ride would do me good but i cant climb them stairs agin  the temptation to see ben once more alone in the bright office proved too great for berthas resolution and she answered all right ill go but only to bring him down to you you must give the orders about the house  in spite of his iron determination to be of good cheer in her presence marts lips quivered with pain of parting as he looked round the splendid diningroom into which the sunlight was pouring suddenly he broke forth ye must stay here darlinnever mind me tis a sin and a shame to ask ye to lave all this to go with a poor old  stop that she called sharply i wont listen to any such talk and he said no more  they decided to go down about ten oclock when the daily tide of his life rode highest this hour suited his own plan for a train left for the mountains not long after and he had resolved to make his escape while bertha was with ben in the office there will be no need of any change in the house he thought but twill do no hurt for them to talk it all over  for an hour or two he hobbled about the yard and garden taking a final look at the horses and dogs and his face was very lax and gray and his voice broken as he talked with his men who had learned of the doctors orders and were awkwardly silent with sympathy he soon grew tired and came back to the porch to rest and wait for the hour of his departure settling into his accustomed chair which faced directly upon the mountains over which the sun wearing to the south was beginning to hang its vivid shadows he sat like a man of bronze the clouds which each day clothed the scarred and naked peaks with a mantle of ermine and purple were already assembling the range assumed a new and overpowering grandeur in his eyes for it typified the big divide which lay between him and the country of the soundless dawnless night  up that deep fold which lay between the chieftain and his consort to the north ran the western waya trail with no returning footprints and the thought made his heart beat painfully while a sense of the wonder and the terror of death came to him he was going away as the wounded grizzly crawls to the thicket to die unseen of his kind even of his mate  to never return to mount and mount each league separating him forever from the mansion he had come to enjoy the wife he loved better than his own life i cannot believe it he whispered and yet i must make it so  then he began to wonder grimly just when his heart would fail just where it would burst like a rotten cinch will it be on the train suppose i last to the coalswitch then i must climb to the mine suppose i live to reach the mine then what oh well tis easy to slip from the cliff  meanwhile out under the trees the gardener was spading turf the lawnmower was purring briskly and as though no sentence of death had been passed upon the master of the place in this haney saw the worlds action typified the individual is of little valuethe race alone counts  he shuffled down to meet the carriage at the gate and lucius helped him in before bertha could reach him and they drove off down the street so exactly in their usual way that bertha was moved to say i dont believe it i cant realize were quitting this town tomorrow  no more can i but i reckon its goodbye all the samefor me anyhow i despise meself for asking ye to go darlini dont ask it stay you im not demanding anything at all tis fitter for me to go alone stay on darlintwill comfort me to lave ye safe and happy here  she shook her head with quite as much determination as he no mart my mind is made upi know my job and im going to muckle to it like a little lady so dont fuss  the air was beautifully clear and bracing and a minute later haney remarked sadly i reckon the doctor knows his trade but tis bitter nonsense to me when a man says the murky wind of the low country is better for a sick man than this  she was very tender at heart as she replied im afraid hes right mart i could see you werent so well here but i was selfishi tried to argue different youll be better down below thats dead certain  well the bets are all laid and the wheel spinning im ready to take me exilebut i hate to drag ye down with me  dont worry about me she answered with intent to reassure him to be honest i kind o like the east  at the door of bens office building she got out leaving him in the carriage as she looked back at him from the doorway something which seemed like anguish in his face moved her and she returned to the wheel to say never mind mart well buy a new home down there  he was struggling as if with the pangs of death but he said tis childish i know but i hate to say goodbye to it all  she patted his hand as if soothing a child and turning mounted the stairway how weak and old he seemed at the moment  fordyce was at work she could hear his typewriter click laboriously he was his own typist as yet and she stood for a moment in the hall with hand pressed hard upon her bosom the full significance of this last visit overwhelming her here was the end of her own happinessthe beginning of longdrawn misery and hearthunger her blood beat tumultuously in her throat and each throb was a physical smothering pain  at last she grew calmer and knocked ben opened the door and his face shone with joy youre late he reproachfully exclaimed then as he peered into the hall he asked wheres the captain  she was very white as she answered he cant come up this morning he aint able  is he worse his face expressed swift concern  yesdr steele came last night and examined him  what did he say  he told us to get out of herequick  he drew her in and shut the door tell me all about it what is the matter  its his heart he cant stand it here weve got to get awaydown the slopetomorrow  not to stay  thats what steele says marts in bad shape  he searched her face with earnest gaze i cant understand that he seemed so happy and so much better too  hes been a good deal worse than he let on or else he fooled himself the doctor found his heart jumping cogs right along  and he positively ordered you to go below  yeshe scared me he said mart might die any minuteif he stayed  in the silence that followed his face became almost as white as her own for he understood and shared her temptation at last he said slowly and you are going with him  yes i must dont you see i must  he understood too haney had refused to go without her and to stay would be to shorten his life  how did the captain take it he asked with effort  mighty hard at first but hes fairly cheerful today he wants to leave me herebut im going with him its my business to be where he is she added he sure needs me now  what are you going to do with the house  leave it just as it is he wont sell it or rent it he wants you to look after all his business just the same  i cant do that  why not  because i dont intend to stay here as he spoke his excitement mounted my little world was all askew before you came youve put the finishingtouch to it im ready to make my own will at this moment  you mustnt talk that way she admonished i dont like to see you lose your grip her words were commonplace but her hesitating tremulous voice betrayed her and exalted him imwe are depending on you  his face his eyes filled her with light she forgot all the rest of the world for the moment and he looking upon her with a knowledge that she loved him and was about to leave him spoke fatefullyas if the words came forth in spite of his will you dont seem to realize how deeply im going to miss you you cannot know how much your presence means to me here in this small town i will not stay on without the hope of seeing you if you go i will not remain here another day  she fought against the feeling of pride of joy which these words gave her you mustnt say thatyouve got to stay with alice  alice his voice rose alice has given me back my ring and is going home when you are gone what is left in this town for me he rose and walked up and down a choking sob in his throat my god its horrible to feel our good days ending in a crash like this what does it all mean i refuse to admit that our shining little world is only a house of cards are we never to see each other again i refuse to say goodbye i wont have it so he faced her again with curt inquiry where are you going to live  i dont knowmaybe in chicagomaybe in new york  no matter where it is i will come to you i cannot lose you out of my lifei will not  no you mustnt do that it aint square to marti cant see you any morenow  he seized upon the significance of that little final word what do you mean by now do you mean because mart is worse or do you mean that i have forfeited your goodwill by my own action he came closer to her and his voice was low and insistent as he continued or do you meansomething very sweet and comforting to me do you love me bertie do you is that your meaning  she struggled against him as she answered i dont knowyes i do knowit aint right for mefor you to say these things to me while i am mart haneys wife  he caught at her hands and looked upon her with face grown older and graver as he bitterly wailed why couldnt we have met before you went to him you must not go with him now for you are mine at heart you belong to me  she rose with instinctive desire to flee but he held her hands in both of his and hurried on you do love me i am sure of it why try to conceal it you would marry me if you were free his eyes pierced her as he proceeded transformed by the power of his own plea we belong to each otherdont you know we do i am sorry for alice but i do not love heri never loved her as i love you she understands this that is why she has returned my ringthere is nothing further for me to say to her as for marshall haney i pity him as you do but he has no right to claim you  he dont claim me he wants me to stay here  then why dont you  because he needs me  so do i need you  but not the wayi mean he is sick and helpless  he drew her closer you must not go i will not let you go youre a part of my life now his words ceased but his eyes called with burning intensity  she struggled not against him but in opposition to something within herself which seemed about to overwhelm her will it was so easy to listen to yieldand so hard to free her hands and turn away but the thought of haney waiting and a knowledge of his confident trust in her brought back her sterner self  no she cried out sharply imperiously i wont have it you mustnt touch me again not while he lives you mustnt even see me again  he understood and respected her resolution but could not release her at the moment wont you kiss me goodbye  she drew her hands away no its all wrong and you know it ill despise you if you touch me again goodbye  thereupon his clean bright honorable soul responded to her reproof rose to dominion over the flesh and he said forgive me i didnt mean to tempt you to anything wrong goodbye and so they parted in such anguish as only lovers know when farewells seem final and their empty hearts calling for a word of promise are denied     chapter xxix  marshall haneys last trail   marshall haney was a brave man and his resolution was fully taken but that final touch of berthas hand upon his arm very nearly unnerved him his courage abruptly fell away and leaning back against the cushions of his carriage with closed eyelids from which the hot tears dripped he gave himself up to the temptation of a renewal of his life it was harder to go infinitely harder because of that impulsive sweet caress her face was so beautiful too with that upward tender pitying look upon it  while still he sat weak and hesitant a roughly dressed man of large and decisive movement stopped and greeted him hello mart how are you this fine day  haney put his tragic mask away with a stroke of his hand and hastily replied comin along dan comin along how are things up on the peak  still pretty mixed replied the miner lightly then with a further look around he stepped a little nearer the wheel hells about to break loose again mart  whats the latest  i cant go into details and i mustnt be seen talking with you but williams is in for trouble tell him to reverse engine for a few weeks goodday and he walked off leaving the impression of having been sent to convey a friendly warning  haney seized upon this message his resolution returned his voice took on edge and decision oscar he called quickly drive me down to the station i want to get that tenthirtyseven train  as the driver chirruped to his horses and swung out into the street marshall haney with full understanding that this was to be his eternal farewell turned and looked up hoping to catch a last glimpse of his wifes sweet face at the window a sign a smile a beckoning and his purpose might still have faltered but the recall did not take place and facing the west he became again the man of will when the carriage drew up to the platform he gave orders to his coachman as quietly as though this were his usual morning ride now oscar you heard what that friend of mine said  yes sir  well forget it  very well sir  but tell mrs haney ive gone up to the mine you can say to her that williams sent for me you can tell her but to no one else what you heard dan say you understand  yes sir  all right that stands now you go home and wait till about twelvethirty then go down for mrs haney  the coachman a stolid reliable man well trained to his duties did not offer to assist his master but sat in most approved alertness upon his box while haney painfully descended to the walk  the train was about to move and the conductor had already signalled the engineer to go ahead but at sight of the gambler whom he knew stopped the train and helped haney aboard a minute more and you would have been left going up to the mine i reckon  they were still on the platform as mart answered yes im due to take a hand in the game up there he said this with intent to cover his trail  he was all but breathless as he dropped into a seat near the door the sense of leaden weakness with which he had come to struggle daily had deepened at the moment into a smothering pain which threatened to blind him  i must be quiet he thoughti will not die in the car there seemed something disgraceful something ignominious in such a death  gradually his fear of this misfortune grew less what does it matter where death comes or when it comes the quicker the better for all concerned  nevertheless he opened the little phial of medicine which steele had given him and swallowed two of the pellets that they were a powerful stimulant of the heart he knew but that an overdose would kill he only suspected from steeles word of caution  they were indeed magical in their effect his brain cleared his pulse grew stronger and the feeling of benumbing weakness which dismayed him passed away  the conductor on his round found him sitting silently at the window very pale and very stern his eyes fixed upon the brawling stream along whose winding course the railway climbed while noting the number of marts pass the official leaned over and spoke in a low voice but haney heard what he said as through a mist he was no longer moved by the sound of the bugle a labor war was temporary like a storm in the pines it might arrest the mining for a few weeks or a month but through it all no matter what happened deep down in the earth lay berthas wealth secure of any marauder so much he was able to reason out  one or two of the passengers who knew him drew near civilly inquiring as to his health and to each one he explained that he was on the gain and that he was going up to the camp to study conditions for himself they were all greatly excited by the news of battle but they did not succeed in conveying their emotion to haney with impassive countenance he listened and at the end remarked tis all of a stripe to me boys im like the soldier on the battlefield with both legs shot off i hear the shouting and the tumult but im out of the running  without understanding his mood they withdrew leaving him alone his mind went back to bertha what will she do when she finds me gone she will not be scared at first she will wire to stop me but no matterbefore she can reach me ill be high in the hills  he could not prevent his mind from dwelling on her he tried to fix his thoughts upon his life as a boyish adventurer but could not keep to those earlier periods of his career all of his days before meeting her seemed base or trivial or purposeless she filled his memory to the exclusion of all other loves and desires she was at once his wife and his child he possessed a thousand bright pictures of her swift and graceful body her sunny smile her sweet grave eyes he recalled the first time he saw her on the street in sibley and groaned to think how basely he had planned against her she never knew that thank god he said fervently  then came that unforgetable drive to the ranch when she put her hand in hisand on this hour he dwelt long searching his mind deeply in order that no grain of its golden store of incident should escape him his throat again began to ache with a full sense of the loss he was inflicting upon himself tis a lonely trail im takin for your sake darlin he whispered but tis all for the best  slowly the train creaked and circled up the heights following the sharp turnings of the stream passing small towns which were in effect summer camps of pleasureseekers on and upward into the moist heights where the grass was yet green and the slopes gay with flowers a mood of exaltation came upon the doomed man as he rose this was the place to dieup here where the affairs of men sank into insignificance like the sound of the mills and the rumble of trains here the centuries circled like swallows and the personal was lost in the ocean of silence  at one of these towns which stood almost at the summit of the pass the conductor brought a telegram and mart seized it with eager trembling hands it was as he expected a warning from bertha she implored him to let the mine go and to return by the next train  he was too nerveless of fingers to put the sheet back within its envelope and so thrust it a crumpled mass into his pocket it was as if her hand was at his shoulder her voice in his ear but he did not falter to go back now would be but a renewal of his torture there could not come a better time to goto go and leave no suspicion of his purpose behind him  just over the summit at a bare little station the train was held for orders and haney who was again suffocating and almost blind took another dose of the mysterious drug and with its effect returned to a dim perception of his surroundings he was able vaguely to recall that a trail which began just back of the depot mounted the hill towards his largest mine a desire to see williams his faithful partner his most loyal friend came over him and rising to his feet he painfully crept down the aisle to the rear of the car and dropped off unnoticed just as the conductors warning cry started a rush for the train  as the last coach disappeared round the turn the essential bleak loneliness of the place returned the station seemed deserted by every human being even the operator was lost to sight and the gambler utterly solitary with clouded brain and laboring breath turned towards the height his left leg dragging like a shackle  for the first halfmile the way was easy and by moving slowly he suffered less pain than he had expected around him the frostsmitten aspens were shivering in the wind their sparse leaves dangling like coins of redandyellow gold and all the billowing land below to the west was iridescent with green and flamecolor and crimson a voiceless regret a dim widereaching wistful sadness came over him but did not shake his resolution he had but to look down at his crippled body to know that the beauty of the world was no longer his to enjoy his days were now but days of pain  he had always loved the heights from the time he had first sighted this range he had never failed to experience a peculiar exaltation as he mounted above the ranch and the mine gambler and nightowl though he had been he had often spent his afternoons on horseback riding high above the camps and now some small part of his love of the upper air came back to lead him towards his grave with face turned to the solitudes of the snows with everfaltering steps he commenced his challenging march towards death  at the first sharp upraise in the way his heart began to pound and he swayed blindly to and fro unable to proceed for an instant he looked down in dismay at the rocky waiting earth a most inhospitable grave a few minutes rest against a tree and his brain cleared higheri must go higher he said to himself theyll find me here  as he rose he could see the town spread wide on the hilltops beneath himthe cabins mere cubes the mill a childs toy he could discern men like ants moving to and fro as if in some special excitementbut he did not concern himself with the cause his one thought was to mountto blend with the firs and the rocks he drew the phial from his pocket and held it in his hand in readiness with a dull fear that the chemical would prove too small too weak to end his pain  it was utterly silent and appallingly lonely on this side of the great peak hunters were few and prospectors were seldom seen these upwardlooping trails led to no mineonly to abandoned prospect holesfor no mineral had ever been found on the western slope the copses held no life other than a few minute squirrels and no sound broke the silence save the insolent cry of an occasional jay or campbird to die here was surely to die alone and to lie alone as the fallen cedar lies wrought upon by the wind and the snows and the rain  nevertheless his suicidal idea persisted it had become the one final overpowering directing resolution there is no passion more persistent than that which leads to selfdestruction in the midst of the blinding swirl of his thought he maintained his purpose to put himself above the world of human effort and to become a brother of the clod to mix forever with the mould  slowly he dragged himself upward foot by foot seeking the friendly shelter and obscurity of a grove of firs just above him twice he sank to his knees a numbing pain at the base of his brain his breath roaring his lips dry but each time he rose and struggled on eager to reach the green and grateful shelter of the forest filled with desire to thrust himself into its solitude and when at last he felt the chill of the shadow and realized that he was surely hidden from all the world he turned poised for an instant on a mound where the trail doubled sharply gave one long slow glance around then hurled himself down the rocky slope even as he leaped his heart seemed to burst and he fell like a clod and lay without further motion it was as if he had been smitten in flight by a rifleball  around him the small animals of the wood frolicked and the jay called inquiringly but he neither saw nor heard he was himself but a gasping creature with reason entirely engaged in the blind struggle which the physical organism was instinctively making to continue in its wonted ways all the world and all his desires save a longing for his fair young wife were lost out of his mind and he thought of bertha only in a dim and formless wayfeeling his need of her and dumbly wondering why she did not come in final desperate agony he lifted the phial of strychnine to his lips hoping that it might put an end to his suffering but before this act was completed a sweet devouring flood of forgetfulness swept over him his hand dropped and the unopened bottle rolled away out of his reach then the golden sunlight darkened out of his sky and he diedas the desert lion diesalone                                       when they found him two days later he lay with his head pillowed upon his left arm his right hand outspread upon the pine leavespalm upward as if to show its emptiness a birdthe roguish gray magpiehad stolen away the phial as if in consideration of the dead mans wish and no sign of his last despairing act was visible to those who looked into his face his going was well planned selfmurder was never written opposite the name of marshall haney  the end
