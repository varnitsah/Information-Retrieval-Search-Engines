12853426	the king of pirates  being an account of the famous enterprises of captain avery the mock king of madagascar  with  his rambles and piracies wherein all the sham accounts formerly publishd of him are detected    in two letters from himself one during his stay at madagascar and one since his escape from thence    london  printed for a bettesworth in paternoster row c king in westminsterhall j brotherton and w meadows in cornhill w chetwood in coventgarden and sold by w boreham in paternoster row 1720  price 1 s 6 d             the preface   one of the particular advantages of the following letters from captain avery is the satisfaction they will give the readers how much they have been imposd upon in the former ridiculous and extravagant accounts which have been put upon the world in what has been publishd already  it has been enough to the writers of this mans life as they call it that they could put any thing together to make a kind of monstrous unheard of story as romantick as the reports that have been spread about of him and the more those stories appeard monstrous and incredible the more suitable they seemd to be to what the world would have been made to expect of captain avery  there is always a great deference between what men say of themselves and what others say for them when they come to write historically of the transactions of their lives  the publisher of these letters recommends this performance to the readers to make their judgment of the difference between them and the extravagant stories already told and which is most likely to be genuine and as they verily believe these letters to be the best and truest account of captain averys piracies that ever has or ever will come to the knowledge of the world they recommend them as such and doubt not but they will answer for themselves in the reading  the account given of captain averys taking the great moguls daughter ravishing and murdering her and all the ladies of her retinue is so differently related here and so extravagantly related before that it cannot but be a satisfaction to the most unconcernd reader to find such a horrible piece of villainy as the other was supposd to be not to have been committed in the world  on the contrary we find here that except plundering that princess of her jewels and money to a prodigious value a thing which falling into the hands of freebooters every one that had the misfortune to fall into such hands would expect but that excepting this the lady was used with all the decency and humanity and perhaps with more than ever women falling among pirates had found before especially considering that by report she was a most beautiful and agreeable person herself as were also several of those about her  the booty taken with her tho infinitely great in itself yet has been so magnifyd beyond common sense that it makes all the rest that has been said of those things ridiculous and absurd  the like absurdity in the former relations of this matter is that of the making an offer of i know not how many millions to the late queen for captain averys pardon with a petition to the queen and her majestys negative answer all which are as much true as his being master of so many millions if money which he nor his gang never had and of his being proclaimd king of madagascar marrying the moguls daughter and the like and by the bye it was but ill laid together of those who publishd that he first ravishd her then murderd her and then marryd her all which are very remarkable for the recommending the thing to those that read it  if these stories are explaind here and duly exposd and the history of captain avery set in a fairer light the end is answerd and of this the readers are to be the only judges but this may be said without any arrogance that this story strippd of all the romantick improbable and impossible parts of it looks more like the history of captain avery than any thing yet publishd ever has done and if it is not provd that the captain wrote these letters himself the publisher says none but the captain himself will ever be able to mend them     the king of pirates   you may be sure i receivd with resentment enough the account that a most ridiculous book entitled my life and adventures had been publishd in england being fully assurd nothing of truth could be containd in such a work and tho it may be true that my extravagant story may be the proper foundation of a romance yet as no man has a title to publish it better than i have to expose and contradict it i send you this by one of my particular friends who having an opportunity of returning into england has promisd to convey it faithfully to you by which at least two things shall be made good to the world first that they shall be satisfyd in the scandalous and unjust manner in which others have already treated me and it shall give in the mean time a larger account of what may at present be fit to be made publick of my unhappy tho successful adventures  i shall not trouble my friends with any thing of my original and first introduction into the world i leave it to you to add from yourself what you think proper to be known on that subject only this i enjoin you to take notice of that the account printed of me with all the particulars of my marriage my being defrauded and leaving my family and native country on that account is a meer fable and a made story to embellish as the writer of it perhaps supposd the rest of his story or perhaps to fill up the book that it might swell to a magnitude which his barren invention could not supply  in the present account i have taken no notice of my birth infancy youth or any of that part which as it was the most useless part of my years to myself so tis the most useless to any one that shall read this work to know being altogether barren of any thing remarkable in it self or instructing to others it is sufficient to me to let the world know as above that the former accounts made publick are utterly false and to begin my account of myself at a period which may be more useful and entertaining  it may be true that i may represent some particulars of my life in this tract with reserve or enlargement such as may be sufficient to conceal any thing in my present circumstance that ought to be conceald and reservd with respect to my own safety and therefore if on pretence of justice the busy world should look for me in one part of the world when i am in another search for my new kingdom in madagascar and should not find it or search for my settlement on one side of the island when it lies on another they must not take this ill for selfpreservation being the supreme law of nature all things of this kind must submit to that  in order then to come immediately to my story i shall without any circumlocutions give you leave to tell the world that being bred to the sea from a youth none of those romantick introductions publishd had any share in my adventures or were any way the cause of my taking the courses i have since been embarkd in but as in several parts of my wandring life i had seen something of the immense wealth which the buccaneers and other adventurers met with in their scouring about the world for purchase i had for a long time meditated in my thoughts to get possessd of a good ship for that purpose if i could and to try my fortune i had been some years in the bay of campeachy and tho with patience i endurd the fatigue of that laborious life yet it was as visible to others as to myself that i was not formd by nature for a logwoodcutter any more than i was for a foremastman and therefore night and day i applyd myself to study how i should dismiss myself from that drudgery and get to be first or last master of a good ship which was the utmost of my ambition at that time resolving in the mean time that when ever any such thing should happen i would try my fortune in the cruising trade but would be sure not to prey upon my own countrymen  it was many years after this before i could bring my purposes to pass and i servd first in some of the adventures of captain sharp captain sawkins and others in their bold adventures in the south seas where i got a very good booty was at the taking of puna where we were obligd to leave infinite wealth behind us for want of being able to bring it away and after several adventures in those seas was among that party who fought their way sword in hand thro all the detachments of the spaniards in the journey over land cross the isthmus of darien to the north seas and when other of our men gat away some one way some another i with twelve more of our men by help of a periagua gat into the bay of campeachy where we fell very honestly to cutting of logwood not for want but to employ ourselves till we could make off  here three of our men dyd and we that were left shard their money among us and having stayd here two years without seeing any way of escape that i dard to trust to i at last with two of our men who spoke spanish perfectly well made a desperate attempt to travel over land to l having buryd all our money which was worth eight thousand pieces of eight a man tho most of it in gold in a pit in the earth which we dug twelve foot deep and where it would have lyen still for no man knew where to look for it but we had an opportunity to come at it again some years after  we travelld along the seashore five days together the weather exceeding hot and did not doubt but we should so disguise ourselves as to be taken for spaniards but our better fortune provided otherwise for us for the sixth day of our march we found a canoe lying on the shore with no one in her we found however several things in her which told us plainly that she belongd to some englishmen who were on shore so we resolvd to sit down by her and wait by and by we heard the englishmen who were seven in number and were coming back to their boat having been up the country to an ingenio where they had gotten great quantities of provision and were bringing it down to their boat which they had left on the shore with the help of five indians of whom they had bought it not thinking there was any people thereabouts when they saw us not knowing who we were they were just going to fire at us when i perceiving it held up a white flag as high as i could reach it which was in short only a piece of an old linnen wastcoat which i had on and pulld it off for the occasion upon this however they forbore firing at us and when they came nearer to us they could easily see that we were their own countrymen they enquird of us what we came there for we told them we had travelld from campeachy where being tird with the hardships of our fortune and not getting any vessel to carry us where we durst go we were even desperate and cared not what became of us so that had not they came to us thus happily we should have put our selves into the hands of the spaniards rather than have perishd where we were  they took us into their boat and afterwards carryd us on board their ship when we came there we found they were a worse sort of wanderers than ourselves for tho we had been a kind of pyrates known and declard enemies to the spaniards yet it was to them only and to no other for we never offerd to rob any of our other european nations either dutch or french much less english but now we were listed in the service of the devil indeed and like him were at war with all mankind  however we not only were obligd to sort with them while with them but in a little time the novelty of the crime wore off and we grew hardend to it like the rest and in this service i spent four years more of my time  our captain in this pirate ship was namd nichols but we calld him captain redhand it seems it was a scots sailor gave him that name when he was not the head of the crew because he was so bloody a wretch that he scarce ever was at the taking any prize but he had a hand in some butchery or other  they were hard put to it for fresh provisions or they would not have sent thus up into the country a single canoe and when i came on board they were so straitend that by my advice they resolvd to go to the isle of cuba to kill wild beef of which the south side of the island is so full accordingly we saild thither directly  the vessel carryd sixteen guns but was fitted to carry twenty two and there was on board one hundred and sixty stout fellows as bold and as casehardend for the work as ever i met with upon any occasion whatever we victuald in this place for eight months by our calculation but our cook who had the management of the salting and pickling the beef orderd his matters so that had he been let alone he would have starvd us all and poisond us too for as we are obligd to hunt the black cattle in the island sometimes a great while before we can shoot them it should be observd that the flesh of those that are heated before they are killd is not fit to be pickled or salted up for keeping  but this man happening to pickle up the beef without regard to this particular distinction most of the beef so pickled stunk before we left the place so that we were obligd to throw it all away the men then said it was impossible to salt any beef in those hot countries so as to preserve it and would have had us given it over and ha gone to the coast of new england or new york for provisions but i soon convincd them of the mistake and by only using the caution viz not to salt up any beef of those cattle that had been hunted we curd one hundred and forty barrels of very good beef and such as lasted us a very great while  i began to be of some repute among them upon this occasion and redhand took me into the cabin with him to consult upon all emergencies and gave me the name of captain though i had then no command by this means i gave him an account of all my adventures in the south seas and what a prodigious booty we got there with captain goignet the frenchman and with captain sharp and others encouraging him to make an attempt that way and proposing to him to go away to the brasils and so round by the straits of magellan or cape horn  however in this he was more prudent than i and told me that not only the strength but the force of his ship was too small not but that he had men enough as he said very well but he wanted more guns and a better ship for indeed the ship we were in was but a weak crazy boat for so long a voyage so he said he approvd my project very well but that he thought we should try to take some more substantial vessel for the business and says he if we could but take a good stout ship fit to carry thirty guns and a sloop or brigantine he would go with all his heart  this i could not but approve of so we formd the scheme of the design and he calld all his men together and proposd it to them and they all approvd it with a general consent and i had the honour of being the contriver of the voyage from this time we resolvd some how or other to get a better ship under us and it was not long before an opportunity presented to our mind  being now upon the coast of the island of cuba we stood away west coasting the island and so went away for florida where we cruisd among the islands and in the wake of the gulph but nothing presented a great while at length we spyd a sail which provd an english homeward bound ship from jamaica we immediately chacd her and came up with her she was a stout ship and the captain defended her very well and had she not been a comberd deep ship being full loaded so that they could scarce come at their guns we should have had our hands full of her but when they found what we were and that being full of men we were resolvd to be on board them and that we had hoisted the black flag a signal that we would give them no quarter they began to sink in their spirits and soon after cryd quarter offering to yield redhand would have given them no quarter but according to his usual practice would have thrown the men all into the sea but i prevaild with him to give them quarter and good usage too and so they yielded and a very rich prize it was only that we knew not what to do with the cargo  when we came to consider more seriously the circumstances we were in by taking this ship and what we should do with her we found that she was not only deep loaden but was a very heavy sailer and that in short she was not such a ship as we wanted so upon long debate we resolvd to take out of her all the rum the indigo and the money we could come at with about twenty casks of sugar and twelve of her guns with all the ammunition small arms bullets c and let her go which was accordingly done to the great joy of the captain that commanded her however we took in her about six thousand pounds sterling in pieces of eight  but the next prize we met suited us better on all accounts being a ship from kingsale in ireland loaden with beef and butter and beer for barbadoes never was ship more welcome to men in our circumstances this was the very thing we wanted we saw the ship early in the morning at about five leagues distance and we was three days in chace of her she stood from us as if she would have run away for the cape de verd islands and two or three times we thought she saild so well she would have got away from us but we had always the good luck to get sight of her in the morning she was about 260 tun an english frigatbuilt ship and had 12 guns on board but could carry 20 the commander was a quaker but yet had he been equal to us in force it appeard by his countenance he would not have been afraid of his flesh or have baulkd using the carnal weapon of offence viz the cannon ball  we soon made ourselves master of this ship when once we came up with him and he was every thing that we wanted so we began to shift our guns into her and shifted about 60 tun of her butter and beef into our own frigate this made the irish vessel be a clear ship lighter in the water and have more room on board for fight if occasion offerd  when we had the old quaking skipper on board we askd him whether he would go along with us he gave us no answer at first but when we askd him again he returnd that he did not know whether it might be safe for him to answer the question we told him he should either go or stay as he pleasd why then says he i had rather ye will give me leave to decline it  we gave him leave and accordingly set him on shore afterwards at nevis with ten of his men the rest went along with us as volunteers except the carpenter and his mate and the surgeon those we took by force we were now supplyd as well as heart could wish had a large ship in our possession with provisions enough for a little fleet rather than for a single ship so with this purchase we went away for the leeward islands and fain we would have met with some of the new york or new england ships which generally come loaden with peas flower pork c but it was a long while before any thing of that kind presented we had promisd the irish captain to set him on shore with his company at nevis but we were not willing till we had done our business in those seas because of giving the alarm among the islands so we went away for st domingo and making that island our rendezvous we cruisd to the eastward in hopes of some purchase it was not long before we spyd a sail which provd to be a burmoodas sloop but bound from virginia or maryland with flower tobacco and some malt the last a thing which in particular we knew not what to do with however the flower and tobacco was very welcome and the sloop no less welcome than the rest for she was a very large vessel and carryd near 60 tun and when not so deep loaden provd an excellent sailer soon after this we met with another sloop but she was bound from barbadoes to new england with rum sugar and molosses nothing disturbd us in taking this vessel but that being willing enough to let her go for as to the sugar and molosses we had neither use for them or room for them but to have let her go had been to give the alarm to all the coast of north america and then what we wanted would never come in our way our captain justly calld redhand or bloodyhand was presently for dispatching them that they might tell no tales and indeed the necessity of the method had very near prevaild nor did i much interpose here i know not why but some of the other men put him in as good a way and that was to bring the sloop to an anchor under the lee of st domingo and take away all her sails that she should not stir till we gave her leave  we met with no less than five prizes more here in about 20 days cruise but none of them for our turn one of them indeed was a vessel bound to st christophers with madera wine we borrowd about 20 pipes of the wine and let her go another was a new england built ship of about 150 tun bound also home with sugar and molosses which was good for nothing to us however we gat near 1000 l on board her in pieces of eight and taking away her sails as before brought her to an anchor under the lee of the sloop at last we met with what we wanted and this was another ship of about 100 tun from new england bound to barbadoes she had on board 150 barrels of flower about 350 barrels of pease and 10 tun of pork barrelld up and pickeld besides some live hogs and some horses and six tun of beer  we were now sufficiently provided for in all those prizes we got also about 56 men who by choice and volunteer agreed to go along with us including the carpenters and surgeons who we obligd always to go so that we were now above 200 men two ships and the burmoodas sloop and giving the other sloop and the new england homeward bound ship their sails again we let them go and as to the malt which we took in the burmoodas sloop we gave it the last new england master who was going to barbadoes  we gat in all those ships besides the provisions abovementiond about 200 musquets and pistols good store of cutlasses about 20 tun of iron shot and musquet ball and 33 barrels of good powder which was all very suitable things to our occasions  we were fully satisfyd as we said to one another now and concluded that we would stand away to the windward as well as we could towards the coast of africa that we might come in the winds way for the coast of brasil but our frigat i mean that we were first shippd in was yet out upon the cruise and not come in so we came to an anchor to wait for her when behold the next morning she came in with full sail and a prize in tow she had it seems been farther west than her orders but had met with a spanish prize whither bound or from whence i remember we did not enquire but we found in her besides merchandize which we had no occasion for 65000 pieces of eight in silver some gold and two boxes of pearl of a good value five dutch or rather flemish seamen that were on board her were willing to go with us and as to the rest of the cargo we let her go only finding four of her guns were brass we took them into our ship with seven great jars of powder and some cannonshot and let her go using the spaniards very civilly  this was a piece of meer good fortune to us and was so encouraging as nothing could be more for it set us up as we may say for now we thought we could never fail of good fortune and we resolvd one and all directly to the south seas  it was about the middle of august 1690 that we set forward and steering e by s and e s e for about fifteen days with the winds at n n w variable we came quickly into the trade winds with a good offing to go clear of all the islands and so we steerd directly for cape st augustin in the brasils which we made the 22nd of september  we cruisd some time upon the coast about the bay of all saints and put in once or twice for fresh water especially at the island of st johns where we got good store of fish and some hogs which for fresh provisions was a great relief to us but we gat no purchase here for whether it was that their european ships were just come in or just gone out we know not or whether they suspected what we were and so kept close within their ports but in thirteen days that we plyd off and on about fernambuque and about fourteen days more that we spent in coasting along the brasil shore to the south we met not one ship neither saw a sail except of their fishingboats or small coasters who kept close under shore  we crossd the line here about the latter end of september and found the air exceeding hot and unwholsome the sun being in the zenith and the weather very wet and rainy so we resolvd to stand away south without looking for any more purchase on that side  accordingly we kept on to the south having tolerable good weather and keeping the shore all the way in view till we came the length of st julien in the latitude of 48 degrees 22 minutes south here we put in again being the beginning of november and took in fresh water and spent about ten days refreshing ourselves and fitting our tackle all which time we livd upon penguins and seals of which we killd an innumerable number and when we prepard to go we salted up as many penguins as we found would serve our whole crew to eat them twice a week as long as they would keep  here we consulted together about going thro the straits of magellan but i put them quite out of conceit of making that troublesom and fatieguing adventure the straits being so hazardous and so many winds requird to pass them and having assurd them that in our return with bat sharp we went away to the latitude of 55 degrees 30 minutes and then steering due east came open with the north seas in five days run they all agreed to go that way  on the 20th of november we weighd from port julien and having a fair wind at n e by e led it away merrily till we came into the latitude of 54 when the wind veering more northerly and then to the n w blowing hard we were driven into 55 degrees and half but lying as near as we could to the wind we made some westward way withal the 3d of december the wind came up south and s e by s being now just as it were at the beginning of the summer solstice in that country  with this wind which blew a fresh gale we stood away n n w and soon found ourselves in open sea to the west of america upon which we hauld away n by e and n n e and then n e when on the 20th of december we made the land being the coast of chili in the latitude of 41 degrees about the height of baldivia and we stood out from hence till we made the isle of st juan fernando where we came to an anchor and went on shore to get fresh water also some of our men went a hunting for goats of which we killd enough to feed us all with fresh meat for all the while we stayd here which was 22 days jan 11  during this stay we sent the sloop out to cruise but she came back without seeing any vessel after which we orderd her out again more to the north but she was scarce gone a league when she made a signal that she saw a sail and that we should come out to help them accordingly the frigat put to sea after them but making no signal for us to follow we lay still and workd hard at cleaning our ship shifting some of the rigging and the like  we heard no more of them in three days which made us repent sorely that we had not gone all three together but the third day they came back tho without any prize as we thought but gave us an account that they had chacd a great ship and a bark all night and the next day that they took the bark the evening before but found little in her of value that the great ship ran on shore among some rocks where they durst not go in after her but that manning out their boats they got on shore so soon that the men belonging to her durst not land that then they threatend to burn the ship as she lay and burn them all in her if they did not come on shore and surrender they offerd to surrender giving them their liberty which our men would not promise at first but after some parly and arguing on both sides our men agreed thus far that they should remain prisoners for so long as we were in those seas but that as soon as we came to the height of panama or if we resolvd to return sooner then they should be set at liberty and to these hard conditions they yielded  our men found in the ship 6 brass guns 200 sacks of meal some fruit and the value of 160000 pieces of eight in gold of chili as good as any in the world it was a glittering sight and enough to dazzle the eyes of those that lookd on it to see such a quantity of gold laid all of a heap together and we began to embrace one another in congratulation of our good fortune  we brought the prisoners all to the island fernando where we used them very well built little houses for them gave them bread and meat and every thing they wanted and gave them powder and ball to kill goats with which they were fully satisfyd with and killd a great many for us too  we continud to cruise feb 2 hereabout but without finding any other prize for near three weeks more so we resolvd to go up as high as puna the place where i had been so lucky before and we assurd our prisoners that in about two months we would return and relieve them but they chose rather to be on board us so we took them all in again and kept on with an easy sail at a proper distance from land that we might not be known and the alarm given for as to the ship which we had taken and which was stranded among the rocks as we had taken all the men out of her the people on the shore when they should find her could think no other than that she was driven on shore by a storm and that all the people were drownd or all escapd and gone and there was no doubt but that the ship would beat to pieces in a very few days  we kept i say at a distance from the shore to prevent giving the alarm but it was a needless caution for the country was all alarmd on another account viz about an 130 bold buccaneers had made their way over land not at the isthmus of darien as usual but from granada on the lake of nicaragua to the north of panama by which tho the way was longer and the country not so practicable as at the ordinary passage yet they were unmolested for they surprizd the country and whereas the spaniards looking for them at the old passage had drawn entrenchments planted guns and posted men at the passages of the mountains to intercept them and cut them off here they met with no spaniards nor any other obstruction in their way but coming to the south sea had time undiscoverd to build themselves canoes and periaguas and did a great deal of mischief upon the shore having been followd among the rest by 80 men more commanded by one guilotte a frenchman an old buccaneer so that they were now 210 men and they were not long at sea before they took two spanish barks going from guatimala to panama loaden with meal coco and other provisions so that now they were a fleet of two barks with several canoes and periaguas but no guns nor any more ammunition than every one carryd at first at their backs  however this troop of desperadoes had alarmd all the coast and expresses both by sea and land were dispatchd to warn the towns on the coast to be upon their guard all the way from panama to lima but as they were represented to be only such freebooters as i have said ships of strength did not desist their voyages as they found occasion as we shall observe presently we were now gotten into the latitude of 10 11 and 12 degrees and a half but in our overmuch caution had kept out so far to sea that we missd every thing which would otherwise have fallen into our hands but we were better informd quickly as you shall hear  early in the morning one of our men being on the missentop cryd a sail a sail it provd to be a small vessel standing just after us and as we understood afterwards did so believing that we were some of the kings ships looking after the buccaneers as we understood she was astern of us we shortend sail and hung out the spanish colours separating ourselves to make him suppose we were cruising for the buccaneers and did not look for him however when we saw him come forward but stretching in a little towards the shore we took care to be so much to starboard that he could not escape us that way and when he was a little nearer the sloop plainly chacd him and in a little time came up with him and took him we had little goods in the vessel their chief loading being meal and corn for panama but the master happend to have 6000 pieces of eight in his cabin which was good booty  but that which was better than all this to us was that the master gave us an account of two ships which were behind and were under sail for lima or panama the one having the revenues of the kingdom of chili and the other having a great quantity of silver going from puna to lima to be forwarded from thence to panama and that they kept together being ships of force to protect one another how they did it we soon saw the effects of  upon this intelligence we were very joyful and assurd the master that if we found it so we would give him his vessel again and all his goods except his money as for that we told him such people as we never returnd it any body however the mans intelligence provd good for the very next day as we were standing southwest our spanish colours being out as above we spyd one of the ships and soon after the other we found they had discoverd us also and that being doubtful what to make of us they tackd and stood eastward to get nearer the land we did the like and as we found there was no letting them go that way but that we should be sure to lose them we soon let them know that we were resolvd to speak with them  the biggest ship which was three leagues astern of the other crowded in for the shore with all the sail she could make and it was easy for us to see that she would escape us for as she was a great deal farther in with the land than the other when we first gave chace so in about three hours we saw the land plain ahead of us and that the great ship would get into port before we could reach her  upon this we stretchd ahead with all the sail we could make and the sloop which crowded also very hard and outwent us engagd the small ship at least an hour before we could come up but she could make little of it for the spanish ship having 12 guns and 6 patereroes would have been too many for the sloop if we had not come up however at length our biggest ship came up also and running up under her quarter gave her our whole broadside at which she struck immediately and the spaniards cryd quarter and miserecordia upon this our sloops men enterd her presently and securd her  in the beginning oft his action it seems our redhand captain was so provokd at losing the greater prize which as he thought had all the money on board that he swore he would not spare one of the dogs so he calld the spaniards in the other ship but he was prevented and it was very happy for the spaniards that the first shot the ship made towards us just as we were running up to pour in our broadside i say the first shot took captain redhand full on the breast and shot his head and one shoulder off so that he never spoke more nor did i find that any one man in the ship shewd the least concern for him so certain it is that cruelty never recommends any man among englishmen no tho they have no share in the suffering under it but one said dn him let him go he was a butcherly dog another said dn him he was a merciless son of a bch another said he was a barbarous dog and the like  but to return to the prize being now as certain of the smaller prize as that we had missd the great one we began to examine what we had got and it is not easy to give an exact account of the prodigious variety of things we found in the first place were 116 chests of pieces of eight in specie 72 bars of silver 15 bags of wrought plate which a fryer that was on board would have perswaded us for the sake of the blessed virgin to have returnd being as he said consecrated plate to the honour of the holy church the virgin mary and st martin but as it happend he could not perswade us to it also we found about 60000 ounces of gold some in little wedges some in dust we found several other things of value but not to be namd with the rest  being thus made surprisingly rich we began to think what course we should steer next for as the great ship which was escapd would certainly alarm the country we might be sure we should meet with no more purchase at sea and we were not very fond of landing to attack any town on shore in this consultation tis to be observd that i was by the unanimous consent of all the crew made captain of the great ship and of the whole crew the whole voyage hither and every part of it having for some time before been chiefly managd by my direction or at least by my advice  the first thing i proposd to them all was seeing we had met with such good luck and that we could not expect much more and if we stayd longer in these seas should find it very hard to revictual our ships and might have our retreat cut off by spanish men of war five of which we heard were sent out after the other buccaneers we should make the best of our way to the south and get about into the north seas where we were out of all danger  in consequence of this advice which was generally approvd we stood away directly south and the wind blowing pretty fair at n n e a merry gale we stood directly for the isle of juan fernando carrying our rich prize with us  we arrivd here the beginning of june having been just six months in those seas we were surprizd when coming to the island we found two ships at an anchor close under the lee of the rocks and two little periaguas farther in near the shore but being resolvd to see what they were we found to our satisfaction they were the buccaneers of whom i have spoken above the story is too long to enter upon here but in short without guns without ship and only coming over land with their fusees in their hands they had rangd these seas had taken several prizes and some pretty rich and had got two pretty handsome barks one carryd six guns and the other four they had shard as they told us about 400 pieces of eight a man besides one thing they had which we were willing to buy of them they had about 100 jarrs of gunpowder which they took out of a store ship going to lima  if we was glad to meet them you may be sure they were glad to meet with us and so we began to sort together as one company only they were loth to give over and return as we were and which we had now resolvd on  we were so rich ourselves and so fully satisfyd with what we had taken that we began to be bountiful to our countrymen and indeed they dealt so generously with us that we could not but be inclind to do them some good for when we talkd of buying their gunpowder they very frankly gave us 50 jarrs of it gratis  i took this so kindly that i calld a little council among ourselves and proposd to send the poor rogues 50 barrels of our beef which we could very well spare and our company agreeing to it we did so which made their hearts glad for it was very good and they had not tasted good saltbeef for a long time and with it we sent them two hogsheads of rum this made them so hearty to us that they sent two of their company to compliment us to offer to enter themselves on board us and to go with us all the world over  we did not so readily agree to this at first because we had no new enterprize in view but however as they sent us word they had chosen me so unanimously for their captain i proposd to our men to remove ourselves and all our goods into the great ship and the sloop and so take the honest fellows into the fregat which now had no less than 22 guns and would hold them all and then they might sail with us or go upon any adventures of their own as we should agree  accordingly we did so and gave them that ship with all her guns and ammunition but made one of our own men captain which they consented to and so we became all one body  here also we shard our booty which was great indeed to a profusion and as keeping such a treasure in every mans particular private possession would have occasiond gaming quarrelling and perhaps thieving and pilfering i orderd that so many small chests should be made as there were men in the ship and every mans treasure was naild up in these chests and the chests all stowd in the hold with every mans name upon his chest not to be touchd but by general order and to prevent gaming i prevaild with them to make a law or agreement and everyone to set their hands to it by which they agreed that if any man playd for any more money than he had in his keeping the winner should not be paid whatever the loser run in debt but the chest containing every mans dividend should be all his own to be deliverd whole to him and the offender whenever he left the ship if he would pay any gaming debts afterward that was another case but such debts should never be paid while he continud in that company  by this means also we securd the ships crew keeping together for if any man left the ship now he was sure to leave about 6000 pieces of eight behind him to be shard among the rest of the ships company which few of them card to do  as we were now all embarkd together the next question was whither we should go as for our crew we were so rich that our men were all for going back again and so to make off to some of the leeward islands that we might get ashore privately with our booty but as we had shippd our new comrades on board a good ship it would be very hard to oblige them to go back without any purchace for that would be to give them a ship to do them no good but to carry them back to europe just as they came out from thence viz with no money in their pockets  upon these considerations we came to this resolution that they should go out to sea and cruise the height of lima and try their fortune and that we would stay 60 days for them at juan fernando  upon this agreement they went away very joyful and we fell to work to new rig our ship mending our sails and cleaning our bottom here we employd ourselves a month very hard at work our carpenters also took down some of the ships upper work and built it as we thought more to the advantage of sailing so that we had more room within and yet did not lie so high  during this time we had a tent set up on shore and 50 of our men employd themselves wholly in killing goats and fowls for our fresh provisions and one of our men understanding we had some malt left on board the ship which was taken in one of the prizes set up a great kettle on shore and went to work to brewing and to our great satisfaction brewd us some very good beer but we wanted bottles to keep it in after it had stood a while in the cask  however he brewd us very good small beer for present use and instead of hops he found some wild wormwood growing on the island which gave it no unpleasant taste and made it very agreeable to us  before the time was expird our frigat sent a sloop to us which they had taken to give us notice that they were in a small creek near the mould of the river guyaquil on the coast of peru in the latitude of 22 degrees they had a great booty in view there being two ships in the river of guyaquil and two more expected to pass by from lima in which was a great quantity of plate that they waited there for them and beggd we would not think the time long but that if we should go away they desird that we would fix up a post with a piece of lead on it signifying where they should come to us and wherever it was east or west north or south they would follow us with all the sail they could make  a little while after this they sent another sloop which they had taken also and she brought a vast treasure in silver and very rich goods which they had got in plundering a town on the continent and they orderd the sloop to wait for them at the island where we lay till their return but they were so eager in the pursuit of their game that they could not think of coming back yet neither could we blame them they having such great things in view so we resolvd in pursuit of our former resolution to be gone and after several consultations among our selves in what part of the world we should pitch our tent we broke up at first without any conclusion  we were all of the opinion that our treasure was so great that wherever we went we should be a prey to the government of that place that it was impossible to go all on shore and be conceald and that we should be so jealous of one another that we should certainly betray one another everyone for fear of his fellow that is to say for fear the other should tell first some therefore proposd our going about the south point of cape horne and that then going away to the gulph of mexico we should go on shore at the bay of campeachy and from thence disperse ourselves as well as we could and every one go his own way  i was willing enough to have gone thither because of the treasure i had left there under ground but still i concluded we were as i have said too rich to go on shore any where to separate for every man of us had too much wealth to carry about us and if we separated the first number of men any of us should meet with that were strong enough to do it would take it from us and so we should but just expose ourselves to be murderd for that money we had gotten at so much hazard  some proposd then our going to the coast of virgina and go some on shore in one place and some in another privately and so travelling to the seaports where there were most people we might be conceald and by degrees reduce our selves to a private capacity every one shifting home as well as they could this i acknowledge might be done if we were sure none of us would be false one to another but while tales might be told and the teller of the tale was sure to save his own life and treasure and make his peace at the expence of his comrades there was no safety and they might be sure that as the money would render them suspected wherever they came so they would be examind and what by faltering in their story and by being crossexamind kept apart and the one being made to believe the other had betrayd him and told all when indeed he might have said nothing to hurt him the truth of fact would be draggd out by piecemeal till they would certainly at last come to the gallows  these objections were equally just to what nation or place soever we could think of going so that upon the whole we concluded there was no safety for us but by keeping all together and going to some part of the world where we might be strong enough to defend ourselves or be so conceald till we might find out some way of escape that we might not now be so well able to think of  in the middle of all these consultations in which i freely own i was at a loss and could not tell which way to advise an old sailor stood up and told us if we would be advisd by him there was a part of the world where he had been where we might all settle ourselves undisturbd and live very comfortably and plentifully till we could find out some way how to dispose of ourselves better and that we might easily be strong enough for the inhabitants who would at first perhaps attack us but that afterwards they would sort very well with us and supply us with all sorts of provisions very plentifully and this was the island of madagascar he told us we might live very well there he gave us a large account of the country the climate the people the plenty of provisions which was to be had there especially of black cattle of which he said there was an infinite number and consequently a plenty of milk of which so many other things was made in a word he read us so many lectures upon the goodness of the place and the conveniency of living there that we were one and all eager to go thither and concluded upon it  accordingly having little left to do for we had been in a sailing posture some weeks we left word with the officer who commanded the sloop and with all his men that they should come after us to madagascar and our men were not wanting to let them know all our reasons for going thither as well as the difficulties we found of going any where else which had so fully possessd them with the hopes of farther advantage that they promisd for the rest that they would all follow us  however as we all calculated the length of the voyage and that our water and perhaps our provisions might not hold out so far but especially our water we agreed that having passd cape horn and got into the north seas we would steer northward up the east shore of america till we came to st julien where we would stay at least fourteen days to take in water and to store ourselves with seals and penguins which would greatly eek out our ships stores and that then we should cross the great atlantick ocean in a milder latitude than if we went directly and stood immediately over from the passage about the cape which must be at least in 55 or 56 and perhaps as the weather might be would be in the latitude of 60 or 61  with this resolution and under these measures we set sail from the island of st juan fernando the 23d of september being the same there as our march is here and keeping the coast of chili on board had good weather for about a fortnight octob 14 till we came into the latitude of 44 degrees south when finding the wind come squally off the shore from among the mountains we were obligd to keep farther out at sea where the winds were less uncertain and some calms we met with till about the middle of october 16 when the wind springing up at n n w a pretty moderate gale we joggd s e and s s e till we came into the latitude of 55 degrees and the 16th of november found our selves in 59 degrees the weather exceeding cold and severe but the wind holding fair we held in with the land and steering e s e we held that course till we thought ourselves entirely clear of the land and enterd into the north sea or atlantick ocean and then changing our course we steerd n and n n e but the wind blowing still at n n w a pretty stiff gale we could make nothing of it till we made the land in the latitude of 52 degrees and when we came close under shore we found the winds variable so we made still n under the lee of the shore and made the point of st julien the 13th of november having been a year and seven days since we parted from thence on our voyage outwardbound  here we rested ourselves took in fresh water and began to kill seals and fowls of several sorts but especially penguins which this place is noted for and here we stayd in hopes our fregate would arrive but we heard no news of her so at parting we set up a post with this inscription done on a plate of lead with our names upon the lead and these words     gone to madagascar december 10 1692  being in that latitude the longest day in the year and i doubt not but the post may stand there still  from hence we launchd out into the vast atlantick ocean steering our coast e by n and e n e till we had saild by our account about 470 leagues taking our meridian distance or departure from st julian and here a strong gale springing up at s e by e and e s e encreasing afterwards to a violent storm we were forcd by it to the norward as high as the tropick not that it blew a storm all the while but it blew so steady and so very hard for near 20 days together that we were carryd quite out of our intended course after we had weatherd this we began to recover ourselves again making still east and endeavouring to get to the southward we had yet another hard gale of wind at s and s s e so strong that we could make nothing of it at all whereupon it was resolvd if we could to make the island of st helena which in about three weeks more we very happily came to on the 17th of january  it was to our great satisfaction that we found no ships at all here and we resolvd not by any means to let the governor on shore know our ships name or any of our officers names and i believe our men were very true to one another in that point but they were not at all shy of letting them know upon what account we were c so that if he could have gotten any of us in his power as we were afterwards told he endeavourd by two or three ambuscades to do we should have passd our time but very indifferently for which when we went away we let him know we would not have faild to have beat his little port about his ears  we stayd no longer here than just servd to refresh ourselves and supply our want of fresh water the wind presenting fair feb 2 1692 we set sail and not to trouble my story with the particulars of the voyage in which nothing remarkable occurd we doubled the cape the 13th of march and passing on without coming to an anchor or discovering ourselves we made directly to the island of madagascar where we arrivd the 7th of april the sloop to our particular satisfaction keeping in company all the way and bearing the sea as well as our ship upon all occasions  to this time i had met with nothing but good fortune success answerd every attempt and followd every undertaking and we scarce knew what it was to be disappointed but we had an interval of our fortunes to meet with in this place we arrivd as above at the island on the 13th of march but we did not care to make the south part of the island our retreat nor was it a proper place for our business which was to take possession of a private secure place to make a refuge of so after staying some time where we put in which was on the point of land a little to the south of cape st augustine and taking in water and provisions there we stood away to the north and keeping the island in view went on till we came to the latitude of 14 degrees here we met with a very terrible tornado or hurricane which after we had beat the sea as long as we could obligd us to run directly for the shore to save our lives as well as we could in hopes of finding some harbour or bay where we might run in or at least might go into smooth water till the storm was over  the sloop was more put to it than we were in the great ship and being obligd to run afore it a little sooner than we did she servd for a pilotboat to us which followd in a word she run in under the lee of a great headland which jetted far out into the sea and stood very high also and came to an anchor in three fathom and a half water we followd her but not with the same good luck tho we came to an anchor too as we thought safe enough but the sea going very high our anchor came home in the night and we drove on shore in the dark among the rocks in spight of all we were able to do  thus we lost the most fortunate ship that ever man saild with however making signals of distress to the sloop and by the assistance of our own boat we savd our lives and the storm abating in the morning we had time to save many things particularly our guns and most of our ammunition and which was more than all the rest we savd our treasure tho i mention the saving our guns first yet they were the last things we savd being obligd to break the upper deck of the ship up for them  being thus got on shore and having built us some huts for our conveniency we had nothing before us but a view of fixing our habitations in the country for tho we had the sloop we could propose little advantage by her for as to cruising for booty among the arabians or indians we had neither room for it or inclination to it and as for attacking any european ship the sloop was in no condition to do it tho we had all been on board for every body knows that all the ships trading from europe to the eastindies were ships of force and too strong for us so that in short we had nothing in view for several months but how to settle ourselves here and live as comfortably and as well as we could till something or other might offer for our deliverance  in this condition we remaind on shore above eight months during which time we built us a little town and fortifyd it by the direction of one of our gunners who was a very good engineer in a very clever and regular manner placing a very strong double palisado round the foot of our works and a very large ditch without our palisado and a third palisado beyond the ditch like a counterscarp or coverdway besides this we raisd a large battery next to the sea with a line of 24 guns placd before it and thus we thought ourselves in a condition to defend ourselves against any force that could attempt us in that part of the world  and besides all this the place on which our habitation was built being an island there was no coming easily at us by land  but i was far from being easy in this situation of our affairs so i made a proposal to our men one day that tho we were well enough in our habitation and wanted for nothing yet since we had a sloop here and a boat so good as she was twas pity she should lye and perish there but we should send her abroad and see what might happen that perhaps it might be our good luck to surprise some ship or other for our turn and so we might all go to sea again the proposal was well enough relishd at first word but the great mischief of all was like to be this that we should all go together by the ears upon the question who should go in her my secret design was laid that i was resolvd to go in her myself and that she should not go without me but when it began to be talkd of i discoverd the greatest seeming resolution not to stir but to stay with the rest and take care of the main chance that was to say the money  i found when they saw that i did not propose to go myself the men were much the easier for at first they began to think it was only a project of mine to run away from them and so indeed it was however as i did not at first propose to go my self so when i came to the proposal of who should go i made a long discourse to them of the obligation they had all to be faithful one to another and that those who went in the sloop ought to consider themselves and those that were with them to be but one body with those who were left behind that their whole concern ought to be to get some good ship to fetch them off at last i concluded with a proposal that who ever went in the sloop should leave his money behind in the common keeping as it was before to remain as a pledge for his faithful performing the voyage and coming back again to the company and should faithfully swear that wherever they went for as to the voyage they were at full liberty to go whither they would they would certainly endeavour to get back to madagascar and that if they were cast away stranded taken or whatever befel them they should never rest till they got to madagascar if it was possible  they all came most readily into this proposal for those who should go into the sloop but with this alteration in them which was easy to be seen in their countenances viz that from that minute there was no striving who should go but every man was willing to stay where they were this was what i wanted and i let it rest for two or three days when i took occasion to tell them that seeing they all were sensible that it was a very good proposal to send the sloop out to sea and see what they could do for us i thought it was strange they should so generally shew themselves backward to the service for fear of parting from their money i told them that no man need be afraid that the whole body should agree to take his money from him without any pretended offence much less when he should be abroad for their service but however as it was my proposal and i was always willing to hazard myself for the good of them all so i was ready to go on the conditions i had proposd to them for others and i was not afraid to flatter myself with serving them so well abroad that they should not grudge to restore me my share of money when i came home and the like of all those that went with me  this was so seasonably spoken and humourd so well that it answerd my design effectually and i was voted to go nemine contradicente then i desird they would either draw lots for who and who should go with me or leave it in my absolute choice to pick and cull my men they had for some time agreed to the first and forty blanks were made for those to whose lot it should come to draw a blank to go in the sloop but then it was said this might neither be a fair nor an effectual choice for example if the needful number of officers and of particular occupations should not happen to be lotted out the sloop might be obligd to go out to sea without a surgeon or without a carpenter or without a cook and the like so upon second thoughts it was left to me to name my men so i chose me out forty stout fellows and among them several who were trusty bold men fit for any thing  being thus mannd the sloop riggd and having cleard her bottom and laid in provisions enough for a long voyage we set sail the 3d of january 1694 for the cape of good hope we very honestly left our money as i said behind us only that we had about the value of 2000 pound in pieces of eight allowd us on board for any exigence that might happen at sea  we made no stop at the cape or at st helena tho we passd in sight of it but stood over to the caribbee islands directly and made the island of tobago the 18th of february where we took in fresh water which we stood in great need of as you may judge by the length of the voyage we sought no purchase for i had fully convincd our men that our business was not to appear as we were used to be upon the cruise but as traders and to that end i proposd to go away to the bay of campeachy and load logwood under the pretence of selling of which we might go any where  it is true i had another design here which was to recover the money which my comrade and i had buryd there and having the man on board with me to whom i had communicated my design we found an opportunity to come at our money with privacy enough having so conceald it as that it would have lain there to the general conflagration if we had not come for it our selves  my next resolution was to go for england only that i had too many men and did not know what to do with them i told them we could never pretend to go with a sloop loaden with logwood to any place with 40 men on board but we should be discoverd but if they would resolve to put 15 or 16 men on shore as private seamen the rest might do well enough and if they thought it hard to be set on shore i was content to be one only that i thought it was very reasonable that whoever went on shore should have some money given them and that all should agree to rendezvous in england and so make the best of our way thither and there perhaps we might get a good ship to go fetch off our comrades and our money with this resolution sixteen of our men had three hundred pieces of eight a man given them and they went off thus the sloop stood away north thro the gulph of florida keeping under the shore of carolina and virginia so our men droppd off as if they had deserted the ship three of the sixteen run away there five more went off at virginia three at new york three at road island and myself and one more at new england and so the sloop went away for england with the rest i got all my money on shore with me and conceald it as well as i could some i got bills for some i bought molosses with and turnd the rest into gold and dressing myself not as a common sailor but as a master of a ketch which i had lost in the bay of campeachy i got passage on board one captain guillame a new england captain whose owner was one mr johnson a merchant living at hackney near london  being at london it was but a very few months before several of us met again as i have said we agreed to do and being true to our first design of going back to our comrades we had several close conferences about the manner and figure in which we should make the attempt and we had some very great difficulties appeard in our way first to have fitted up a small vessel it would be of no service to us but be the same thing as the sloop we came in and if we pretended to a great ship our money would not hold out so we were quite at a stand in our councils what to do or what course to take till at length our money still wasting we grew less able to execute any thing we should project  this made us all desperate when as desperate distempers call for desperate cures i started a proposal which pleasd them all and this was that i would endeavour among my acquaintance and with what money i had left which was still sixteen or seventeen hundred pound to get the command of a good ship bearing a quarter part or thereabout myself and so having gat into the ship and got a freight the rest of our gang should all enter on board as seamen and whatever voyage we went or wheresoever we were bound we would run away with the ship and all the goods and so go to our friends as we had promisd  i made several attempts of this kind and once bought a very good ship calld the griffin of one snelgrove a shipwright and engagd the persons concernd to hold a share in her and fit her out on a voyage for leghorn and venice when it was very probable the cargo to be shippd on board casually by the merchant would be very rich but providence and the good fortune of the owner prevented this bargain for without any objection against me or discovery of my design in the least he told me afterwards his wife had an ugly dream or two about the ship once that it was set on fire by lightning and he had lost all he had in it another time that the men had mutinyd and conspird to kill him and that his wife was so averse to his being concernd in it that it had always been an unlucky ship and that therefore his mind was changd that he would sell the whole ship if i would but he would not hold any part of it himself  tho i was very much disappointed at this yet i put a very good face upon it and told him i was very glad to hear him tell me the particulars of his dissatisfaction for if there was any thing in dreams and his wifes dream had any signification at all it seemd to concern me more than him who was to go the voyage and command the ship and whether the ship was to be burnt or the men to mutiny tho part of the loss might be his who was to stay on shore all the danger was to be mine who was to be at sea in her and then as he had said she had been an unlucky ship to him it was very likely she would be so to me and therefore i thankd him for the discovery and told him i would not meddle with her  the man was uneasy and began to waver in his resolution and had it not been for the continud importunities of his wife i believe would have come on again for people generally encline to a thing that is rejected when they would reject the same thing when proferd but i knew it was not my business to let myself be blowd upon so i kept to my resolution and wholly declind that affair on pretence of its having got an ill name for an unlucky ship and that name stuck so to her that the owners could never sell her and as i have been informd since were obligd to break her up at last  it was a great while i spent with hunting after a ship but was every way disappointed till money grew short and the number of my men lessend apace and at last we were reducd to seven when an opportunity happend in my way to go chiefmate on board a stout ship bound from london to        n b in things so modern it is no way convenient to write to you particular circumstances and names of persons ships or places because those things being in themselves criminal may be calld up in question in a judicial way and therefore i warn the reader to observe that not only all the names are omitted but even the scene of action in this criminal part is not laid exactly as things were acted least i should give justice a clew to unravel my story by which no body will blame me for avoiding  it is enough to tell the reader that being put out to sea and being for conveniency of wind and weather come to an anchor on the coast of spain my seven companions having resolvd upon our measures and having brought three more of the men to confederate with us we took up arms in the middle of the night securd the captain the gunner and the carpenter and after that all the rest of the men and declard our intention the captain and nine men refusd to come into our projected roguery for we gave them their choice to go with us or go on shore so we put them on shore very civilly gave the master his books and every thing he could carry with him and all the rest of the men agreed to go along with us  as i had resolvd before i went on board upon what i purposd to do so i had laid out all the money i had left in such things as i knew i should want and had causd one of my men to pretend he was going to  to build or buy a ship there and that he wanted freight for a great deal of cordage anchors eight guns powder and ball with about 20 tun of lead and other bulky goods which were all put on board as merchandize  we had not abundance of bail goods on board which i was glad of not that i made any conscience or scruple of carrying them away if the ship had been full of them but we had no market for them our first business was to get a larger store of provision on board than we had our voyage being long and having acquainted the men with our design and promisd the new men a share of the wealth we had there which made them very hearty to us we set sail we took in some beef and fish at  where we lay fifteen days but out of all reach of the castle or fort and having done our business saild away for the canaries where we took in some butts of wine and some fresh water with the guns the ship had and those eight i had put on board as merchandize we had then two and thirty guns mounted bur were but slenderly mannd tho we gat four english seamen at the canaries but we made up the loss at fiall where we made bold with three english ships we found and partly by fair means and partly by force shippd twelve men there after which without any farther stop for men or stores we kept the coast of africa on board till we passd the line and then stood off to st helena  here we took in fresh water and some fresh provisions and went directly for the cape of good hope which we passd stopping only to fill about 22 butts of water and with a fair gale enterd the sea of madagascar and sailing up the west shore between the island and the coast of africa came to an anchor over against our settlement about two leagues distance and made the signal of our arrival with firing twice seven guns at the distance of a twominute glass between the seven when to our infinite joy the fort answerd us and the longboat the same that belongd to our former ship came off to us  we embracd one another with inexpressible joy and the next morning i went on shore and our men brought our ship safe into harbour lying within the defence of our platform and within two cables length of the shore good soft ground and in eleven fathom water having been three months and eighteen days on the voyage and almost three years absent from the place  when i came to look about me here i found our men had encreasd their number and that a vessel which had been cruising that is to say pirating on the coast of arabia having seven dutchmen three portuguese and five englishmen on board had been cast away upon the northern shore of that island and had been taken up and relievd by our men and livd among them they told us also of another crew of european sailors which lay as we did on the main of the island and had lost their ship and were as the islanders told them above a hundred men but we heard nothing who they were  some of our men were dead in the mean time i think about three and the first thing i did was to call a muster and see how things stood as to money i found the men had been very true to one another there lay all the money in chests piled up as i left it and every mans money having his name upon it then acquainting the rest with the promise i had made the men that came with me they all agreed to it so the money belonging to the dead men and to the rest of the forty men who belongd to the sloop was divided among the men i brought with me as well those who joind at first as those we took in at the cape de verd and the canaries and the bails of goods which we found in the ship many of which were valuable for our own use we agreed to give them all to the fifteen men mentiond above who had been savd by our men and so to buy what we wanted of those goods of them which made their hearts glad also  and now we began to consult what course to take in the world as for going to england tho our men had a great mind to be there yet none of them knew how to get thither notwithstanding i had brought them a ship but i who had now made myself too publick to think any more of england had given over all views that way and began to cast about for farther adventures for tho as i said we were immensely rich before yet i abhorrd lying still and burying my self alive as i calld it among savages and barbarians besides some of our men were young in the trade and had seen nothing and they lay at me every day not to lie still in a part of the world where as they said such vast riches might be gaind and that the dutchmen and englishmen who were cast away as above and who our men calld the comelings were continually buzzing in my ears what infinite wealth was to be got if i would but make one voyage to the coast of malabar coromandel and the bay of bengale nay the three portuguese seamen offerd themselves to attack and bring off one of their biggest galleons even out of the road of goa on the malabar coast the capital of the portuguese factories in the indies  in a word i was overcome with these new proposals and told the rest of my people i was resolvd to go to sea again and try my good fortune i was sorry i had not another ship or two but if ever it lay in my power to master a good ship i would not fail to bring her to them  while i was thus fitting out upon this new undertaking and the ship lay ready to sail and all the men who were designd for the voyage were on board being 85 in number among which were all the men i brought with me the 15 comelings and the rest made up out of our old number i say when i was just upon the point of setting sail we were all surprizd just in the grey of the morning to spy a sail at sea we knew not what to make of her but found she was an european ship that she was not a very large vessel yet that she was a ship of force too she seemd to shorten sail as if she lookd out for some harbour at first sight i thought she was english immediately i resolvd to slip anchor and cable and go out to sea and speak with her if i could let her be what she would as soon as i was got a little clear of the land i fird a gun and spread english colours she immediately brought too fird three guns and mannd out her boat with a flag of truce i did the like and the two boats spoke to one another in about two hours when to our infinite joy we found they were our comrades who we left in the south seas and to whom we gave the fregate at the isle of juan fernando  nothing of this kind could have happend more to our mutual satisfaction for tho we had long ago given them over either for lost or lost to us and we had no great need of company yet we were overjoyd at meeting and so were they too  they were in some distress for provisions and we had plenty so we brought their ship in for them gave them a present supply and when we had helpd them to moor and secure the ship in the harbour we made them lock all their hatches and cabins up and come on shore and there we feasted them five or six days for we had a plenty of all sorts of provisions not to be exhausted and if we had wanted an hundred head of fat bullocks we could have had them for asking for of the natives who treated us all along with all possible courtesy and freedom in their way  the history of the adventures and success of these men from the time we left them to the time of their arrival at our new plantation was our whole entertainment for some days i cannot pretend to give the particulars by my memory but as they came to us thieves they improvd in their calling to a great degree and next to ourselves had the greatest success of any of the buccaneers whose story has ever been made publick  i shall not take upon me to vouch the whole account of their actions neither will this letter contain a full history of their adventures but if the account which they gave us was true you may take it thus  first that having met with good success after they left us and having taken some extraordinary purchase as well in some vessels they took at sea as in the plunder of some towns on the shore near guyaquil as i have already told you they got information of a large ship which was loading the kings money at puna and had orders to sail with it to lima in order to its being carryd from thence to panama by the fleet under the convoy of the flotilla or squadron of men of war which the kings governor at panama had sent to prevent their being insulted by the pirates which they had intelligence were on the coast by which we suppose they meant us who were gone for they could have no notion of these men then  upon this intelligence they cruisd off and on upon the coast for near a month keeping always to the southward of lima because they would not fall in the way of the said flotilla and so be overpowerd and miss of their prize at last they met with what they lookd for that is to say they met with the great ship abovenamd but to their great misfortune and disappointment as they first thought it to be she had with her a man of war for her convoy and two other merchant ships in her company  the buccaneers had with them the sloop which they first sent to us for our intelligence and which they made a little fregate of carrying eight guns and some patareroes they had not long time to consult but in short they resolvd to double man the sloop and let her attack the great merchantship while the fregate which was the whole of their fleet held the man of war in play or at least kept him from assisting her  according to this resolution they put 50 men on board the sloop which was in short almost as many as would stand upon her deck one by another and with this force they attackd the great merchantship which besides its being well mannd had 16 good guns and about 30 men on board while the sloop thus began the unequal fight the man of war bore down upon her to succour the ship under her convoy but the fregate thrusting in between engagd the man of war and began a very warm fight with her for the man of war had both more guns and more men than the fregate after she had parted with 50 men on board the sloop while the two men of war as we may now call them were thus engagd the sloop was in great danger of being worsted by the merchantship for the force was too much for her the ship was great and her men fought a desperate and close fight twice the sloopmen enterd her and were beaten off and about nine of their men killd several other wounded and an unlucky shot taking the sloop between wind and water she was obligd to fall astern and heel her over to stop the leek during which the spaniards steerd away to assist the man of war and pourd her broadside in upon the fregate which tho but small yet at a time when she lay yardarm and yardarm close by the side of the spanish man of war was a great extremity however the fregate returnd her broadside and therewith made her sheer off and which was worse shot her mainmast thro tho it did not come presently by the board  during this time the sloop having many hands had stoppd the leak was brought to rights again and came up again to the engagement and at the first broadside had the good luck to bring the ships foremast by the board and thereby disabled her but could not for all that lay her athwart or carry her by boarding so that the case began to be very doubtful at which the captain of the sloop finding the merchant ship was disabled and could not get away from them resolvd to leave her a while and assist the fregate which he did and running a longside our fregate he fairly laid the man of war on board just thwart his hawser and besides firing into her with his great shot he very fairly set her on fire and it was a great chance but that they had been all three burnt together but our men helpt the spaniards themselves to put out the fire and after some time masterd it but the spaniards were in such a terrible fright at the apprehension of the fire that they made little resistance afterwards and in short in about an hours fight more the spanish man of war struck and was taken and after that the merchant ship also with all the wealth that was in her and thus their victory was as compleat as it was unexpected  the captain of the spanish man of war was killd in the fight and about 36 of his men and most of the rest wounded which it seems happend upon the sloops lying athwart her this man of war was a new ship and with some alteration in her upper work made a very good fregate for them and they afterwards quitted their own ship and went all on board the spanish ship taking out the mainmast of their own ship and making a new foremast for the spanish ship because her foremast was also weakend with some shot in her this however cost them a great deal of labour and difficulty and also some time when they came to a certain creek where they all went on shore and refreshd themselves a while  but if the taking the man of war was an unexpected victory to them the wealth of the prize was much more so for they found an amazing treasure on board her both in silver and gold and the account they gave me was but imperfect but i think they calculated the pieces of eight to be about 13 tun in weight besides that they had 5 small chests of gold some emeralds and in a word a prodigious booty  they were not however so modest in their prosperity as we were for they never knew when to have done but they must cruise again to the northward for more booty when to their great surprize they fell in with the flotilla or squadron of men of war which they had so studiously avoided before and were so surrounded by them that there was no remedy but they must fight and that in a kind of desperation having no prospect now but to sell their lives as dear as they could  this unlucky accident befel them before they had changd their ship so that they had now the sloop and both the men of war in company but they were but thinly mannd and as for the booty the greater part of it was on board the sloop that is to say all the gold and emeralds and near half the silver  when they saw the necessity of fighting they orderd the sloop if possible to keep to windward that so she might as night come on make the best of her way and escape but a spanish fregate of 18 guns tended her so close and saild so well that the sloop could by no means get away from the rest so she made up close to the buccaneers fregate and maintaind a fight as well as she could till in the dusk of the evening the spaniards boarded and took her but most of her men gat away in her boat and some by swimming on board the other ship they only left in her five wounded englishmen and six spanish negroes the five english the barbarous spaniards hangd up immediately wounded as they were  this was good notice to the other men to tell them what they were to expect and made them fight like desperate men till night and killd the spaniards a great many men it provd a very dark rainy night so that the spaniards were obligd by necessity to give over the fight till the next day endeavouring in the mean time to keep as near them as they could but the buccaneers concerting their measures where they should meet resolvd to make use of the darkness of the night to get off if they could and the wind springing up a fresh gale at s s w they changd their course and with all the sail they could make stood away to the n n w slanting it to seawards as nigh the wind as they could and getting clear away from the spaniards who they never saw more they made no stay till they passd the line and arrivd in about 22 days sail on the coast of california where they were quite out of the way of all enquiry and search of the spaniards  here it was they changd their ship as i said and quitting their own vessel they went all on board the spanish man of war fitting up her masts and rigging as i have said and taking out all the guns stores c of their own ship so that they had now a stout ship under them carrying 40 guns for so many they made her carry and well furnishd with all things and tho they had lost so great a part of their booty yet they had still left a vast wealth being six or seven tun of silver besides what they had gotten before  with this booty and regretting heartily they had not practisd the same moderation before they resolvd now to be satisfyd and make the best of their way to the island of juan fernando where keeping at a great distance from the shore they safely arrivd in about two months voyage having met with some contrary winds by the way  however here they found the other sloop which they had sent in with their first booty to wait for them and here understanding that we were gone for st julien they resolvd since the time was so long gone that they could not expect to find us again that they would have tother touch with the spaniards cost what it would and accordingly having first buryd the most part of their money in the ground on shore in the island and having revictuald their ship in the best manner they could in that barren island away they went to sea  they beat about on the south of the line all up the coast of chili and part of peru till they came to the height of lima itself  they met with several ships and took several but they were loaden chiefly with lumber or provisions except that in one vessel they took between 40 and 50000 pieces of eight and in another 75000 they soon informd themselves that the spanish men of war were gone out of those seas up to panama to boast of their good fortune and carry home their prize and this made them the bolder but tho they spent near five months in this second cruise they met with nothing considerable the spaniards being every where alarmd and having notice of them so that nothing stirrd abroad  tird then with their long cruise and out of hope of more booty they began to look homeward and to say to one another that they had enough so in a word they came back to juan fernando and there furnishing themselves as well as they could with provisions and not forgeting to take their treasure on board with them they set forward again to the south and after a very bad voyage in rounding the terra del fuego being driven to the latitude of 65 degrees where they felt extremity of cold they at length obtaind a more favourable wind viz at s and s s e with which steering to the north they came into a milder sea and a milder coast and at length arrivd at port st julien where to their great joy they found the post or cross erected by us and understanding that we were gone to madagascar and that we would be sure to remain there to hear from them and withal that we had been gone there near two year they resolvd to follow us  here they staid it seems almost half a year partly fitting and altering their ship partly wearing out the winter season and waiting for milder weather and having victualld their ship in but a very ordinary manner for so long a run viz only with seals flesh and penguins and some deer they killd in the country they at last launchd out and crossing the great atlantick ocean they made the cape of good hope in about 76 days having been put to very great distresses in that time for want of food all their seals flesh and penguins growing nauseous and stinking in little less than half the time of their voyage so that they had nothing to subsist on for seven and twenty days but a little quantity of dryd venison which they killd on shore about the quantity of 3 barrels of english beef and some bread and when they came to the cape of good hope they gat some small supply but it being soon perceivd on shore what they were they were glad to be gone as soon as they had filld their casks with water and gat but a very little provisions so they made to the coast of natal on the south east point of africa and there they gat more fresh provisions such as veal milk goatsflesh some tolerable butter and very good beef and this held them out till they found us in the north part of madagascar as above  we staid about a fortnight in our port and in a sailing posture just as if we had been windbound meerly to congratulate and make merry with our newcome friends when i resolvd to leave them there and set sail which i did with a westerly wind keeping away north till i came into the latitude of seven degrees north so coasting along the arabian coast e n e towards the gulph of persia in the cruise i met with two persian barks loaden with rice one of which i mannd and sent away to madagascar and the other i took for our own ships use this bark came safe to my new colony and was a very agreeable prize to them i think verily almost as agreeable as if it had been loaded with pieces of eight for they had been without bread a great while and this was a double benefit to them for they fitted up this bark which carryd about 55 tun and went away to the gulph of persia in her to buy rice and brought two or three freights of that which was very good  in this time i pursud my voyage coasted the whole malabar shore and met with no purchase but a great portugal eastindia ship which i chacd into goa where she got out of my reach i took several small vessels and barks but little of value in them till i enterd the great bay of bengale when i began to look about me with more expectation of success tho without prospect of what happend  i cruisd here about two months finding nothing worth while so i stood away to a port on the north point of the isle of sumatra where i made no stay for here i gat news that two large ships belonging to the great mogul were expected to cross the bay from hugely in the ganges to the country of the king of pegu being to carry the grandaughter of the great mogul to pegu who was to be marryd to the king of that country with all her retinue jewels and wealth  this was a booty worth watching for tho it had been some months longer so i refolvd that we would go and cruise off of point negaris on the east side of the bay near diamond isle and here we plyd off and on for three weeks and began to despair of success but the knowledge of the booty we expected spurrd us on and we waited with great patience for we knew the prize would be immensely rich  at length we spyd three ships coming right up to us with the wind we could easily see they were not europeans by their sails and began to prepare ourselves for a prize not for a fight but were a little disappointed when we found the first ship full of guns and full of soldiers and in condition had she been managd by english sailors to have fought two such ships as ours were however we resolvd to attack her if she had been full of devils as she was full of men  accordingly when we came near them we fird a gun with shot as a challenge they fird again immediately three or four guns but fird them so confusedly that we could easily see they did not understand their business when we considerd how to lay them on board and so to come thwart them if we could but falling for want of wind open to them we gave them a fair broadside we could easily see by the confusion that was on board that they were frighted out of their wits they fird here a gun and there a gun and some on that side that was from us as well as those that were next to us the next thing we did was to lay them on board which we did presently and then gave them a volley of our smallshot which as they stood so thick killd a great many of them and made all the rest run down under their hatches crying out like creatures bewitchd in a word we presently took the ship and having securd her men we chacd the other two one was chiefly filld with women and the other with lumber upon the whole as the grandaughter of the great mogul was our prize in the first ship so in the second was her women or in a word her houshold her eunuchs all the necessaries of her wardrobe of her stables and of her kitchin and in the last great quantities of housholdstuff and things less costly tho not less useful  but the first was the main prize when my men had enterd and masterd the ship one of our lieutenants calld for me and accordingly i jumpd on board he told me he thought no body but i ought to go into the great cabin or at least no body should go there before me for that the lady herself and all her attendance was there and he feard the men were so heated they would murder them all or do worse  i immediately went to the great cabindoor taking the lieutenant that calld me along with me and causd the cabindoor to be opend but such a sight of glory and misery was never seen by buccaneer before the queen for such she was to have been was all in gold and silver but frighted and crying and at the sight of me she appeard trembling and just as if she was going to die she sate on the side of a kind of a bed like a couch with no canopy over it or any covering only made to lie down upon she was in a manner coverd with diamonds and i like a true pirate soon let her see that i had more mind to the jewels than to the lady  however before i touchd her i orderd the lieutenant to place a guard at the cabindoor and fastening the door shut us both in which he did the lady was young and i suppose in their country esteem very handsome but she was not very much so in my thoughts at first her fright and the danger she thought she was in of being killd taught her to do every thing that she thought might interpose between her and danger and that was to take off her jewels as fast as she could and give them to me and i without any great compliment took them as fast as she gave them me and put them into my pocket taking no great notice of them or of her which frighted her worse than all the rest and she said something which i could not understand however two of the other ladies came all crying and kneeld down to me with their hands lifted up what they meant i knew not at first but by their gestures and pointings i found at last it was to beg the young queens life and that i would not kill her  i have heard that it has been reported in england that i ravishd this lady and then used her most barbarously but they wrong me for i never offerd any thing of that kind to her i assure you nay i was so far from being inclind to it that i did not like her and there was one of her ladies who i found much more agreeable to me and who i was afterwards something free with but not even with her either by force or by way of ravishing  we did indeed ravish them of all their wealth for that was what we wanted not the women nor was there any other ravishing among those in the great cabin that i can assure you as for the ship where the women of inferior rank were and who were in number almost two hundred i cannot answer for what might happen in the first heat but even there after the first heat of our men was over what was done was done quietly for i have heard some of the men say that there was not a woman among them but what was lain with four or five times over that is to say by so many several men for as the women made no opposition so the men even took those that were next them without ceremony when and where opportunity offerd  when the three ladies kneeld down to me and as soon as i understood what it was for i let them know i would not hurt the queen nor let any one else hurt her but that she must give me all her jewels and money upon this they acquainted her that i would save her life and no sooner had they assurd her of that but she got up smiling and went to a fine indian cabinet and opend a private drawer from whence she took another little thing full of little square drawers and holes this she brings to me in her hand and offerd to kneel down to give it me this innocent usage began to rouse some goodnature in me tho i never had much and i would not let her kneel but sitting down myself on the side of her couch or bed made a motion to her to sit down too but here she was frighted again it seems at what i had no thought of for sitting on her bed she thought i would pull her down to lie with her and so did all her women too for they began to hold their hands before their faces which as i understood afterwards was that they might not see me turn up their queen but as i did not offer any thing of that kind only made her sit down by me they began all to be easier after some time and she gave me the little box or casket i know not what to call it but it was full of invaluable jewels i have them still in my keeping and wish they were safe in england for i doubt not but some of them are fit to be placd on the kings crown  being master of this treasure i was very willing to be goodhumourd to the persons so i went out of the cabin and causd the women to be left alone causing the guard to be kept still that they might receive no more injury than i would do them myself  after i had been out of the cabin some time a slave of the womens came to me and made sign to me that the queen would speak with me again i made signs back that i would come and dine with her majesty and accordingly i orderd that her servants should prepare her dinner and carry it in and then call me they provided her repast after the usual manner and when she saw it brought in she appeard pleasd and more when she saw me come in after it for she was exceedingly pleasd that i had causd a guard to keep the rest of my men from her and she had it seems been told how rude they had been to some of the women that belongd to her  when i came in she rose up and paid me such respect as i did not well know how to receive and not in the least how to return if she had understood english i could have said plainly and in good rough words madam be easy we are rude roughhewn fellows but none of our men should hurt you or touch you i will be your guard and protection we are for money indeed and we shall take what you have but we will do you no other harm but as i could not talk thus to her i scarce knew what to say but i sate down and made signs to have her sit down and eat which she did but with so much ceremony that i did not know well what to do with it  after we had eaten she rose up again and drinking some water out of a china cup sate her down on the side of the couch as before when she saw i had done eating she went then to another cabinet and pulling out a drawer she brought it to me it was full of small pieces of gold coin of pegu about as big as an english half guinea and i think there were three thousand of them she opend several other drawers and shewd me the wealth that was in them and then gave me the key of the whole  we had revelld thus all day and part of the next day in a bottomless sea of riches when my lieutenant began to tell me we must consider what to do with our prisoners and the ships for that there was no subsisting in that manner besides he hinted privately that the men would be ruind by lying with the women in the other ship where all sorts of liberty was both given and taken upon this we calld a short council and concluded to carry the great ship away with us but to put all the prisoners queen ladies and all the rest into the lesser vessels and let them go and so far was i from ravishing this lady as i hear is reported of me that tho i might rifle her of every thing else yet i assure you i let her go untouchd for me or as i am satisfyd for any one of my men nay when we dismissd them we gave her leave to take a great many things of value with her which she would have been plunderd of if i had not been so careful of her  we had now wealth enough not only to make us rich but almost to have made a nation rich and to tell you the truth considering the costly things we took here which we did not know the value of and besides gold and silver and jewels i say we never knew how rich we were besides which we had a great quantity of bales of goods as well calicoes as wrought silks which being for sale were perhaps as a cargo of goods to answer the bills which might be drawn upon them for the account of the brides portion all which fell into our hands with a great sum in silver coin too big to talk of among englishmen especially while i am living for reasons which i may give you hereafter  i had nothing to do now but to think of coming back to madagascar so we made the best of our way only that to make us quite distracted without other joy we took in our way a small bark loaden with arack and rice which was good sawce to our other purchace for if the women made our men drunk before this arack made them quite mad and they had so little government of themselves with it that i think it might be said the whole ships crew was drunk for above a fortnight together till six or seven of them killd themselves two fell overboard and were drownd and several more fell into raging fevers and it was a wonder in the whole they were not all killd with it  but to make short of the story as we did of the voyage we had a very pleasant voyage except those disasters and we came safe back to our comrades at madagascar having been absent in all about seven months  we found them in very good health and longing to hear from us and we were you may be assurd welcome to them for now we had amassd such a treasure as no society of men ever possessd in this world before us neither could we ever bring it to an estimation for we could not bring particular things to a just valuation  we livd now and enjoyd ourselves in full security for tho some of the european nations and perhaps all of them had heard of us yet they heard such formidable things of us such terrible stories of our great strength as well as of our great wealth that they had no thought of undertaking any thing against us for as i have understood they were told at london that we were no less than 5000 men that we had built a regular fortress for our defence by land and that we had 20 sail of ships and i have been told that in france they have heard the same thing but nothing of all this was ever true any more than it was true that we offerd ten millions to the government of england for our pardon  it is true that had the queen sent any intimation to us of a pardon and that we should have been receivd to grace at home we should all have very willingly embracd it for we had money enough to have encouragd us all to live honest and if we had been askd for a million of pieces of eight or a million of pounds sterling to have purchasd our pardon we should have been very ready to have complyd with it for we really knew not what to do with ourselves or with our wealth and the only thing we had now before us was to consider what method to take for getting home if possible to our own country with our wealth or at least with such part of it as would secure us easy and comfortable lives and for my own part i resolvd if i could to make full satisfaction to all the persons who i had wrongd in england i mean by that such people as i had injurd by running away with the ship as well the owners and the master or captain who i set ashore in spain as the merchant whose goods i had taken with the ship and i was daily forming schemes in my thoughts how to bring this to pass but we all concluded that it was impossible for us to accomplish our desires as to that part seeing the fact of our piracy was now so publick all over the world that there was not any nation in the world that would receive us or any of us but would immediately seize on our wealth and execute us for pirates and robbers of all nations  this was confirmd to us after some time with all the particulars as it is now understood in europe for as the fame of our wealth and power was such that it made all the world afraid of us so it brought some of the like sort with our selves to join with us from all parts of the world and particularly we had a bark and 60 men of all nations from martinico who had been cruising in the gulph of florida came over to us to try if they could mend their fortunes and these went afterwards to the gulph of persia where they took some prizes and returnd to us again we had after this three pirate ships came to us most english who had done some exploits on the coast of guinea had made several good prizes and were all tolerably rich  as these people came and shelterd with us so they came and went as they would and sometimes some of our men went with them sometimes theirs staid with us but by that coming and going our men found ways and means to convey themselves away some one way some another for i should have told you at first that after we had such intelligence from england viz that they knew of all our successful enterprizes and that there was no hopes of our returning especially of mine and some other men who were known i say after this we calld a general council to consider what to do and there one and all we concluded that we livd very happy where we were that if any of us had a mind to venture to get away to any part of the world none should hinder them but that else we would continue where we were and that the first opportunity we had we would cruise upon the english east india ships and do them what spoil we could fancying that some time or other they would proclaim a pardon to us if we would come in and if they did then we would accept of it  under these circumstances we remaind here off and on first and last above three year more during which time our number encreasd so especially at first that we were once eight hundred men stout brave fellows and as good sailors as any in the world our number decreasd afterwards upon several occasions such as the going abroad to cruise wandering to the south part of the island as above getting on board european ships and the like  after i perceivd that a great many of our men were gone off and had carryd their wealth with them i began to cast about in my own thoughts how i should make my way home also innumerable difficulties presented to my view when at last an account of some of our mens escape into persia encouragd me the story was this one of the small barks we had taken went to guzaratte to get rice and having securd a cargo but not loaded it ten of our men resolvd to attempt their escape and accordingly they drest themselves like merchantstrangers and bought several sorts of goods there such as an englishman who they found there assisted them to buy and with their bales but in them packd up all the rest of their money they went up to bassora in the gulph of persia and so travelld as merchants with the caravan to aleppo and we never heard any more of them but that they went clean off with all their cargo  this filld my head with schemes for my own deliverance but however it was a year more before i attempted any thing and not till i found that many of our men shifted off some and some nor did any of them miscarry some went one way some another some lost their money and some savd it nay some carryd it away with them and some left it behind them as for me i discoverd my intentions to no body but made them all believe i would stay here till some of them should come and fetch me off and pretended to make every man that went off promise to come for me if it ever was in his power and gave every one of them signals to make for me when they came back upon which i would certainly come off to them at the same time nothing was more certain than that i intended from the beginning to get away from the island as soon as i could any way make my way with safety to any part of the world  it was still above two years after this that i remaind in the island nor could i in all that time find any probable means for removing my self with safety  one of the ways i thought to have made my escape was this i went to sea in a longboat a fishing as we often did and having a sail to the boat we were out two or three days together at length it came into my thoughts that we might cruise about the island in this longboat a great way and perhaps some adventure might happen to us which we might make something of so i told them i had a mind to make a voyage with the longboat to see what would happen  to this purpose we built upon her made a stateroom in the middle and clapt four patareroes upon her gunnel and away we went being sixteen stout fellows in the boat not reckoning my self thus we ran away as it were from the rest of our crew tho not a man of us knew our own minds as to whither we were going or upon what design in this frolick we ran south quite away to the bay of st angustines in the latitude of 24 degrees where the ships from europe often put in for water and provisions  here we put in not knowing well what to do next i thought myself disappointed very much that we saw no european ship here tho afterwards i saw my mistake and found that it was better for us that we were in that port first we went boldly on shore for as to the natives we understood how to manage them well enough knew all their customs and the manner of their treating with strangers as to peace or war their temper and how to oblige them or behave if they were disobligd so we went i say boldly on shore and there we began to chaffer with them for some provisions such as we wanted  we had not been here above two or three days but that early in the morning the weather thick and haizy we heard several guns fire at sea we were not at a loss to know what they meant and that it was certainly some european ships coming in and who gave the signal to one another that they had made the land which they could easily see from the sea tho we who were also within the bay could not see them from the shore however in a few hours the weather clearing up wet saw plainly five large ships three with english colours and two with dutch standing into the bay and in about four or five hours more they came to an anchor  a little while after they were come to an anchor their boats began to come on shore to the usual wateringplace to fill their casks and while they were doing that the rest of the men lookd about them a little as usual tho at first they did not stir very far from their boats  i had now a nice game to play as any man in the world ever had it was absolutely necessary for us to speak with these men and yet how to speak with them and not have them speak with us in a manner that we should not like that was the main point it was with a great deal of impatience that we lay still one whole day and saw their boats come on shore and go on board again and we were so irresolute all the while that we knew not what to do at last i told my men it was absolutely necessary we should speak with them and seeing we could not agree upon the method how to do it friendly and fairly i was resolvd to do it by force and that if they would take my advice we would place ourselves in ambuscade upon the land somewhere that we might see them when they were on shore and the first man that straggled from the rest we would clap in upon and seize him and three or four of them if we could as for our boat we had securd it in a creek three or four miles up the country where it was secure enough out of their reach or knowledge  with this resolution we placd ourselves in two gangs eleven of us in one place and only three of us in another and very close we lay the place we chose for our ambuscade was on the side of a rising ground almost a mile from the wateringplace but where we could see them all come towards the shore and see them if they did but set their foot on shore  as we understood afterwards they had the knowledge of our being upon the island but knew not in what part of it and were therefore very cautious and wary how they went on shore and came all very well armd this gave us a new difficulty for in the very first excursion that any of them made from the wateringplace there was not less than twenty of them all well armd and they passd by in our sight but as we were out of their sight we were all very well pleasd with seeing them go by and being not obligd to meddle with them or show our selves  but we had not long lain in this circumstance but by what occasion we knew not five of the gentlemen tarrs were pleasd to be willing to go no farther with their companions and thinking all safe behind them because they had found no disturbance in their going out came back the same way straggling without any guard or regard  i thought now was our time to show our selves so taking them as they came by the place where we lay in ambuscade we placd ourselves just in their way and as they were entring a little thicket of trees we appeard and calling to them in english told them they were our prisoners that if they yielded we would use them very well but if they offerd to resist they should have no quarter one of them looking behind as if he would show us a pair of heels i calld to him and told him if he attempted to run for it he was a dead man unless he could outrun a musquetbullet and that we would soon let him see we had more men in our company and so giving the signal appointed our three men who lay at a distance shewd themselves in the rear  when they saw this one of them who appeard as their leader but was only the pursers clerk askd who we were they must yield to and if we were christians i told them jestingly we were good honest christian pirates and belongd to captain avery not at all letting them know that i was avery himself and if they yielded it was enough that we assurd them they should have fair quarter and good usage upon our honour but that they must resolve immediately or else they would be surrounded with 500 men and we could not answer for what they might do to them  they yielded presently upon this news and deliverd their arms and we carryd them away to our tent which we had built near the place where our boat lay here i enterd into a particular serious discourse with them about captain avery for twas this i wanted upon several accounts first i wanted to enquire what news they had had of us in europe and then to give them ideas of our numbers and power as romantick as i could  they told us that they had heard of the great booty captain avery had taken in the bay of bengale and among the rest a bloody story was related of avery himself viz that he ravishd the great moguls daughter who was going to be marryd to the prince of pegu that we ravishd and forcd all the ladies attending her train and then threw them into the sea or cut their throats and that we had gotten a booty of ten millions in gold and silver besides an inestimable treasure of jewels diamonds pearls c but that we had committed most inhuman barbarities on the innocent people that fell into our hands they then told us but in a broken imperfect account how the great mogul had resented it and that he had raised a great army against the english factories resolving to root them out of his dominions but that the company had appeasd him by presents and by assuring him that the men who did it were rebels to the english government and that the queen of england would hang them all when ever they could be taken i smild at that and told them captain avery would give them leave to hang him and all his men when they could take them but that i could assure him they were too strong to be taken that if the government of england went about to provoke them captain avery would soon make those seas too hot for the english and they might even give over their eastindia trade for they little thought circumstances captain avery was in  this i did as well to know what notions you had of us in england as to give a formidable account of us and of our circumstances to england which i knew might be of use to us several ways hereafter then i made him tell his part which he did freely enough he told us that indeed they had receivd an account in england that we were exceeding strong that we had several gangs of pirates from the spanish westindies that had taken great booties there and were gone all to madagascar to join captain avery that he had taken three great eastindia ships one dutch and two portuguese which they had converted into men of war that he had 6000 men under his command that he had twelve ships whereof three carryd 60 guns apiece and six more of them from 40 to 50 guns that they had built a large fort to secure their habitations and that they had two large towns one on one side one on the other of a river coverd by the said fort and two great platforms or batteries of guns to defend the entrance where their ships rode that they had an immense invaluable treasure and that it was said captain avery was resolvd to people the whole island of madagascar with europeans and to get women from jamaica and the leeward islands and that it was not doubted but he would subdue and make himself king of that country if he was let alone a little longer  i had enjoind my men in the first place not to let him know that i was avery but that i was one of his captains and in the next place not to say a word but just ay and no as things occurrd and leave the rest to me i heard him patiently out in all the particulars above and when he had done i told him it was true captain avery was in the island of madagascar and that several other societies of buccaneers and freebooters were joind him from the spanish westindies for said i the plenty and ease of our living here is such and we are so safe from all the world that we do not doubt but we shall be twenty thousand men in a very little time when two ships which we have sent to the westindies shall come back and shall have told the buccaneers at the bay of campeachy how we live here  but said i you in england greatly wrong captain avery our general so i calld myself to advance our credit for i can assure you that except plundering the ship and taking that immense booty which he got in the great ship where the great moguls daughter was there was not the least injury done to the lady no ravishing or violence to her or any of her attendance and this said i you may take of my certain knowledge for said i i was on board the ship with our general all the while and if any of the princesss women were lain with said i on board the other ship as i believe most of them were yet it was done with their own consent and good will and no otherwise and they were all dismissd afterwards without so much as being put in fear or apprehensions of life or honour  this i assurd him as indeed it was just and told him i hopd if ever he came safe to england he would do captain avery and all of us justice in that particular case  as to our being well fortifyd on the island and our numbers i assurd them all they were far from thinking too much of us that we had a very good fleet and a very good harbour for them that we were not afraid of any force from europe either by land or water that it was indeed in vain to pretend to attack us by force that the only way for the government of england to bring us back to our duty would be to send a proclamation from england with the queens pardon for our general and all his people if they came in by a certain time and added i we know you want money in england i dare say said i our general captain avery and his particular gang who have the main riches would not grudge to advance five or six millions of ducats to the government to give them leave to return in peace to england and sit down quietly with the rest  this discourse i suppose was the ground of the rumour you have had in england that avery had offerd to come in and submit and would give six millions for his pardon for as these men were soon after this dismissd and went back to england there is no doubt but they gave a particular account of the conference they had with me who they calld one of captain averys captains  we kept these five men six or seven days and we pretended to show them the country from some of the hills calling it all our own and pointing every way how many miles we extended ourselves we made them believe also that all the rest of the country was at our disposal that the whole island was at our beck we told them we had treasure enough to enrich the whole kingdom of england that our general had several millions in diamonds and we had many tuns of silver and gold that we had fifty large barns full of all sorts of goods as well european as indian and that it would be truly the best way for england to do as they said namely to invite us all home by a proclamation with a pardon and if they would do this said i they can ask no reasonable sum but our general might advance it besides getting home such a body of stout able seamen as we were such a number of ships and such a quantity of rich goods  we had several long discourses with them upon these heads and our frequent offering this part to them with a kind of feeling warmth for it was what we all desird has causd i doubt not the rumour of such great offers made by us and of a letter sent by me to the queen to beg her majestys pardon for myself and my company and offering ten millions of money advance to the queen for the publick service all which is a meer fiction of the brain of those which have publishd it neither were we in any condition to make such an offer neither did i or any of my crew or company ever write a letter or petition to the queen or to any one in the government or make any application in the case other than as above which was only matter of conversation or private discourse  nor were we so strong in men or ships or any thing like it you have heard of the number of ships which we had now with us which amounted to two ships and a sloop and no more except the prize in which we took the moguls daughter which ship we calld the great mogul but she was fit for nothing for she would neither sail or steer worth a farthing and indeed was fit for no use but a hulk or a guardship  as to numbers of men they belyd us strangely and particularly they seemd only to mistake thousands for hundreds for whereas they told us that you in england had a report of our being six thousand men i must acknowledge that i think we were never when we were at the most above six hundred and at the time when i quitted the country i left about one hundered and eight men there and no more and i am assurd all the number that now remains there is not above twenty two men no not in the whole island  well we thought however that it was no business of ours at that time to undeceive them in their high opinion of our great strength so we took care to magnify ourselves and the strength of our general meaning myself that they might carry the story to england depending upon it that a tale loses nothing in the carrying when they told us of our fort and the batteries at the mouth of the river where our ships lie we insinuated that it was a place where we did not fear all the fleets in the world attacking us and when they told us of the number of men we strove to make them believe that they were much many more  at length the poor men began to be tird of us and indeed we began to be tird of them for we began to be afraid very much that they would prye a little way into our affairs and that a little too narrowly that way so as they began to sollicit their deliverance we began to listen to their importunities in a word we agreed to dismiss them and accordingly we gave them leave to go away to the wateringplace as if they had made their escape from us which they did carrying away their heads full of all those unlikely projected things which you have heard above  in all this however i had not the good luck to advance one step towards my own escape and here is one thing remarkable viz that the great mass of wealth i had gotten together was so far from forwarding my deliverance that it really was the only thing that hinderd it most effectually and i was so sensible of it that i resolvd once to be gone and leave all my wealth behind me except some jewels as several of our men had done already for many of them were so impatient of staying here that they found means to get away some and some with no more money than they could carry about them particularly thirteen of our men made themselves a kind of shaloup with a mast and sail and went for the red sea having two patareroes for her defence and every man a thousand pieces of eight and no more except that one macmow an irishman who was their captain had five rubies and a diamond which he got among the plunder of the moguls ship  these men as i heard gat safe to mocca in the arabian gulph where they fetch the coffee and their captain managd for them all so well that of pirates he made them merchants laid out all the stock in coffee and got a vessel to carry it up the red sea to sues where they sold it to the factors for the european merchants and came all safe to alexandria where they parted the money again and then every one separated as they thought fit and went their own way  we heard of this by mere accident afterwards and i confess i envyd their success and tho it was a great while after this that i took a like run yet you may be sure i formd a resolution from that time to do the like and most of the time that i stayd after this was employd in picking out a suitable gang that i might depend upon as well to trust with the secret of my going away as to take with me and on whom i might depend and they on me for keeping one anothers council when we should come into europe  it was in pursuit of this resolution that i went this little voyage to the south of the island and the gang i took with me provd very trusty but we found no opportunity then for our escape two of the men that we took prisoners would fain have gone with us but we resolvd to trust none of them with the real and true discovery of our circumstances and as we had made them believe mighty things of ourselves and of the posture of our settlement that we had 5000 men 12 men of war and the like we were resolvd they should carry the delusion away with them and that no body should undeceive them because tho we had not such an immense wealth as was reported and so as to be able to offer ten millions for our pardon yet we had a very great treasure and being nothing near so strong as they had imagind we might have been made a prey with all our riches to any set of adventurers who might undertake to attempt us by consent of the government of england and make the expedition no purchase no pay  for this reason we civily declind them told them we had wealth enough and therefore did not now cruise abroad as we used to do unless we should hear of another wedding of a kings daughter or unless some rich fleet or some heathen kingdom was to be attempted and that therefore a new comer or any body of new comers could do themselves no good by coming over to us if any gang of pirates or buccaneers would go upon their adventures and when they had made themselves rich would come and settle with us we would take them into our protection and give them land to build towns and habitations for themselves and so in time we might become a great nation and inhabit the whole island i told them the romans themselves were at first no better than such a gang of rovers as we were and who knew but our general captain avery might lay the foundation of as great an empire as they  these big words amazd the fellows and answerd my end to a tittle for they told such rhodomantading stories of us when they came back to their ships and from them it spread so universally all over the eastindies for they were outwardbound that none of the english or dutch ships would come near madagascar again if they could help it for a great while for fear of us and we who were soon after this dwindled away to less than 100 men were very glad to have them think us too strong to meddle with or so strong that no body durst come near us  after these men were gone we rovd about to the east side of the island and in a word knew not what to do or what course to take for we durst not put out to sea in such a bauble of a boat as we had under us but tird at last we came back to the south point of the island again in our rounding the island we saw a great englishbuilt ship at sea but at too far distance to speak with her and if it had not we knew not what to have said to her for we were not strong enough to attack her we judgd by her course she stood away from the isle of st maurice or mauritius for the cape of good hope and must as we supposd come from the malabar coast bound home for england so we let her go  we are now returnd back to our settlement on the north part of the island and i have singld out about 12 or 13 bold brave fellows with whom i am resolvd to venture to the gulph of persia twenty more of our men have agreed to carry us thither as passengers in the sloop and try their own fortunes afterwards for they allow we are enough to go together we resolve when we come to bassaro to separate into three companies as if we did not know one another to dress ourselves as merchants for now we look like hellhounds and vagabonds but when we are well dressd we expect to look as other men do if i come thither i purpose with two more to give my companions the slip and travel as armenians thro persia to the caspian sea so to constantinople and i doubt not we shall one way or other find our way with our merchandize and money to come into france if not quite home to my own country assure yourself when i arrive in any part of christendom i will give you a farther account of my adventures        your friend and servant            avery      the end of the first letter     a second letter      sir   i wrote my last letter to you from madagascar where i had continud so long till my people began to drop from me some and some and indeed i had at last but few left so that i began to apprehend they would give an account in europe how weak i was and how easy it was to attack me nay and to make their peace might some of them at least offer their service to be pilots to my port and might guide the fleets or ships that should attempt me  with these apprehensions i not only was uneasy myself but made all my men uneasy too for as i was resolvd to attempt my own escape i did not care how many of my men went before me but this you must take with you by the bye that i never let them imagine that i intended to stir from the spot myself i mean after my return from the ramble that i had taken round the island of which i have given you an account but that i resolvd to take up my rest in madagascar as long as i livd indeed before i said otherwise as i wrote you before and made them all promise to fetch me away but now i gave it out that i was resolvd to live and die here and therefore a little before i resolvd upon going i set to work to build me a new house and to plant me a pretty garden at a distance from our fort only i had a select company to whom i communicated every thing and who resolvd that at last we would go altogether but that we would do it our own way  when i had finishd my new house and a mighty palace you would say it was if you had been to see it i removd to it with eight of the gang that were to be my fellow adventurers and to this place we carryd all our private wealth that is to say jewels and gold as to our share of silver as it was too heavy to remove and must be done in publick i was obligd to leave it behind but we had a stratagem for that too and it was thus  we had a sloop as you have heard and she lay in our harbour tis true but she lay ready to sail upon any occasion and the men who were of our confederacy who were not with me at my countryhouse were twelve in number these men made a proposal that they would take the sloop and go away to the coast of malabar or where else they could speed to their mind and buy a fraight of rice for the publick account in a free state as we were every body was free to go wherever they would so that no body opposd them the only dispute at any time was about taking the vessel we had to go in however as these men seemd only to act upon the publick account and to go to buy provisions no body offerd to deny them the sloop so they prepard for their voyage just as they were ready to go one of them starts it to the rest that it was very hazardous and difficult to run such a length every now and then to get a little rice and if they would go why should they not bring a good quantity this was soon resolvd so they agreed they should take money with them to buy a good ship wherever they could find her and then to buy a loading of rice to fill her up and so come away with her  when this was agreed they resolvd to take no money out of the grand stock but to take such mens money as were gone and had left their money behind and this being consented to truly my friends took the occasion and took all their own money and mine being 64 little chests of pieces of eight and carryd it on board as if it had been of men that were prickdrun and no body took any notice of it these twelve men had also now got twelve more with them under pretence of manning a ship if we should buy one and in this pickle away they put to sea  we had due notice of every thing that was done and having a signal given of the time they resolvd to go we packd up all our treasure and began our march to the place appointed which from our quarters was about forty mile farther north  our habitation that is to say my new house was about sixteen miles up the country so that the rest of our people could have no notice of our march neither did they miss us at least as i heard of for we never heard any more of them nor can i imagine what condition or circumstance they can be in at present if they are still upon the place as however i believe some of them are  we joind our comrades with a great deal of ease about three days afterwards for we marchd but softly and they lay by for us the night before we went on board we made them a signal by fire as we had appointed to let them know where we were and that we were at hand so they sent their boat and fetchd us off and we embarkd without any notice taken by the rest  as we were now loose and at sea our next business was to resolve whither we should go and i soon governd the point resolving for bassaro in the gulph of persia where i knew we might shift for ourselves accordingly we steerd away for the arabian coast and had good weather for some time even till we made the land at a great distance when we steerd eastward along the shore  we saw several ships in our way bound to and from the red sea as we supposd and at another time we would have been sure to have spoken with them but we had done pirating our business now was how to get off and make our way to some retreat where we might enjoy what we had got so we took no notice of any thing by the way but when we was thus sailing merrily along the weather began to change the evening grew black and cloudy and threatend a storm we were in sight or a little island i know nothing of its name under which we might have anchord with safety enough but our people made light of it and went on  about an hour after sunset the wind began to rise and blew hard at n e and at n e by n and in two hours time encreasd to such a tempest as in all my rambles i never met with the like we were not able to carry a knot of sail or to know what to do but to stow every thing close and let her drive and in this condition we continud all the night all the next day and part of the night after towards morning the storm abated a little but not so as to give us any prospect of pursuing our voyage all the ease we had was that we could just carry a little sail to steddy the vessel and run away before it which we did at that violent rate that we never abated till we made land on the east side of madagascar the very island we came from only on the other side of the island  however we were glad we had any place to run to for harbour so we put in under the lee of a point of land that gave us shelter from the wind and where we came to an anchor after being all of us almost dead with the fatigue and if our sloop had not been an extraordinary seaboat she could never have born such a sea for twelve days together as we were in the worst i ever saw before or since we lay here to refresh ourselves about twenty days and indeed the wind blew so hard all the while that if we had been disposd to go to sea we could not have done it and being here about seven of our men began to repent their bargain and left us which i was not sorry for it seems the principal reason of their looking back was their being of those who had left their money behind them they did not leave us without our consent and therefore our carpenters built them a boat during the three weeks we stayd here and fitted it very handsomely for them with a cabin for their convenience and a mast and sail with which they might very well sail round to our settlement as we suppose they did we gave them firearms and ammunition sufficient and left them furnishing themselves with provisions and this we suppose was the boat tho with other men in it which adventurd afterwards as far as the cape of good hope and was taken up by a portugese in distress by which means they got passage for themselves to lisbone pretending they had made their escape from the pirates at madagascar but we were told that the portuguese captain took a good deal of their money from them under pretence of keeping it from his own seamen and that when they came on shore and began to claim it he threatend them with taking them up and prosecuting them for pirates which made them compound with him and take about 10000 dollars for above 120000 which they had with them which by the way was but a scurvy trick they had it seems a considerable quantity of gold among them which they had the wit to conceal from the captain of the ship and which was enough for such fellows as them and more than they well knew what to do with so that they were rich enough still tho the portugal captain was nevertheless a knave for all that  we left them here as i have said and put to sea again and in about twenty days sail having pretty good weather we arrivd at the gulph of persia it would be too long to give you an account of the particular fortunes of some of our people after this the variety of which would fill a volume by itself but in the first place we who were determind to travel went on shore at bassaro leaving the rest of our men to buy rice and load the larger vessel back to their comrades which they promisd to do but how far they performd i know not  we were thirteen of us that went on shore here from whence we hird a kind of barge or rather a bark which after much difficulty and very unhandy doings of the men who we had hird brought us to babylon or bagdat as it is now calld  our treasure was so great that if it had been known what we had about us i am of opinion we should never have troubld europe with our company however we gat safe to babylon or bagdat where we kept ourselves incog for a while took a house by ourselves and lay four or five days still till we had got vests and long gowns made to appear abroad in as armenian merchants after we had got cloaths and lookd like other people we began to appear abroad and i that from the beginning had meditated my escape by myself began now to put it into practice and walking one morning upon the bank of the river euphrates i musd with myself what course i should take to make off and get quite away from the gang and let them not so much as suspect me  while i was walking here comes up one of my comrades and one who i always took for my particular friend i know what you are employd in said he while you seem only to be musing and refreshing yourself with the cool breeze why said i what am i musing about why said he you are studying how you should get away from us but muse upon it as long as you will says he you shall never go without me for i am resolvd to go with you which way soever you take tis true says i i was musing which way i should go but not which way i should go without you for tho i would be willing to part company yet you cannot think i would go alone and you know i have chosen you out from all the company to be the partner of all my adventures  very well says he but i am to tell you now that it is not only necessary that we should not go all together but our men have all concluded that we should make our escape every one for himself and should separate as we could so that you need make no secret of your design any more than of the way you intend to take  i was glad enough of this news and it made me very easy in the preparations we made for our setting out and the first thing we did was to get us more cloaths having some made of one fashion some of another but my friend and i who resolvd to keep together made us cloaths after the fashion of the armenian merchants whose country we pretended to travel through  in the mean time five of our men dressd like merchants and laying out their money in raw silk and wrought silks and other goods of the country proper for europe in which they were directed by an english merchant there resolvd to take the usual rout and travel by the caravans from babylon to alleppo and so to scanderoon and we staid and saw them and their bales go off in boats for a great town on the euphrates where the caravans begin to take up the passengers the other six divided themselves one half of them went for agra the country of the great mogul resolving to go down the river hoogly to bengal but whither they went afterward or what course they took i never knew neither whether they really went at all or not  the other three went by sea in a persian vessel back from the red sea to the gulf of mocca and i heard of them all three at marseilles but whither they went afterwards i never knew nor could i come to speak with them even there  as for me and my friend we first laid out all the silver we had in european ware such as we knew would vend at ispahan which we carryd upon twelve camels and hiring some servants as well for our guide as our guard we set out  the servants we hird were a kind of arab but rather looking like the great moguls people than real arabians and when we came into persia we found they were lookd upon as no better than dogs and were not only used ill but that we were used ill for their sakes and after we were come three days into the persian dominions we found ourselves obligd to part with them so we gave them three dollars a man to go back again  they understood their business very well and knew well enough what was the reason of it though we did not however we found we had committed a great mistake in it for we perceivd that they were so exasperated at being turnd off that they vowed to be revenged and indeed they had their revenge to the full for the same day at night they returnd in the dark and set eleven houses on fire in the town where we quartered which by the way had gone near to have cost me my life and would certainly have done so if in the hurry i had not seizd one of the incendiaries and deliverd him up to them  the people were so provokd at him that was taken that they fell upon him with all possible fury as the common incendiary and burner of the town and presently quitted us for they had before vowed our destruction but as i said quitted us immediately and thronged about the wretch they had taken and indeed i made no question but that they would have immediately murderd him nay that they would have torn him in pieces before they parted with him but after they had vented their rage at him for some time with all possible reproaches and indignities they carryd him before the cadi or judge of the place the cadi a wise grave man answered no he would not judge him at that time for they were too hot and passionate to do justice but they should come with him in the morning when they were cool and he would hear them  it is true this was a most excellent step of the cadi as to the right way of doing justice but it did not prove the most expedient in the present occasion though that was none of his fault neither for in the night the fellow got out of their hands by what means or by whose assistance i never heard to this day and the cadi fined the town in a considerable sum for letting a man accused of a capital crime make his escape before he was adjudged and as we call it discharged according to law  this was an eminent instance of the justice of these people and though they were doubly enraged at the escape of the fellow who without doubt was guilty yet they never opend their mouths against the cadi but acquiescd in his judgment as in that of an oracle and submitted to the national censure or censure according to the custom of their nation which he had passd upon them in their publick capacity for the escape of the man  we were willing to get out of this place as soon as we could for we found the peoples rage which wanted an object to vent itself upon began to threaten us again so having packd up our goods and gotten five ordinary cameldrivers for our servants in the country we set out again  the roads in persia are not so much frequented as to be well accommodated with inns so that several times we were obligd to lodge upon the ground in the way but our new servants took care to furnish us with lodging for as soon as we let them know we wanted rest and inclind to stop they set up a tent for us in so short a time that we were scarce able to imagine it possible and under this we encampd our camels being just by us and our servants and bales lying all hard by  once or twice we lodgd in publick inns built at the king of persias charge these are fair large buildings built square like a large inn they have all of them large stables and good forrage for the camels and horses and apartments for perhaps two or three hundred people and they are calld caravanseras as being built to entertain whole caravans of travellers on the great roads to tauris and the side of turky they are all fortifyd and are able to entertain five or six thousand people and have a stock to furnish what number of men can come with provisions nay it has been known that whole armies of the persians have on their march been furnishd with provisions in one of these caravanseras and that they have killd 2000 sheep for them in one nights time  in this manner we travelld to ispahan the capital of persia where appearing as merchants and with several camels loaden with merchandize we passd all possibility of suspicion and being perfectly easy we continud here some time sold our cargoes and would gladly have remitted the money to other places as for constantinople in particular but we found the turks and persians have no such thing as an exchange by bills running between them and other nations no nor between one town and another  we were invited here by a sudden accident to have gone home by the caspian sea and astracan so thro muscovy but i had heard so much of the barbarity of the russians the dangerous navigation of the caspian sea by reason of the calms and shoals the hazard of being robbd by the tartars on the river wolga and the like that i chose to travel to constantinople a journey through desarts over mountains and wastes among so many sorts of barbarians that i would run any kind of hazards by sea before i would attempt such a thing again  it would deserve another history to let you into all the different circumstances of this journey how well i was usd by some and how ill by others nay how well by some mahometans how ill by some christians but it shall suffice to tell you that i am at present at constantinople and tho i write this here i do not purpose to send it to you till i come to marseilles in france from whence i intend to go and live in some inland town where as they have perhaps no notion of the sea so they will not be inquisitive after us        i am c      finis
