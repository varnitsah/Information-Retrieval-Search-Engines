61865275	the wanderers necklace  by h rider haggard   first published 1914     dedication  in memory of oodnadatta and many wanderings oversea i offer these pictures from the past my dear vincent to you a lover of the present if an aspirant who can look upon the future with more of hope than fear your colleague  h rider haggard to sir edgar vincent kcmg  ditchingham  november 1913     note by the editor  it chances that i the editor of these pagesfor in truth that is my humble functionhave recovered a considerable knowledge of a bygone life of mine this life ended in times that are comparatively recent namely early in the ninth century as is fixed by the fact that the byzantine empress irene plays a part in the story  the narrative it will be observed is not absolutely consecutive that is to say all the details are not filled in indeed it has returned to me in a series of scenes or pictures and although each scene or picture has to do with every other there are sometimes gaps between them to take one example among severalthe journey of olaf in those days my name was olaf or michael after i was baptised from the north to constantinople is not recorded the curtain drops at aar in jutland and rises again in byzantium only those events which were of the most importance seem to have burned themselves into my subconscious memory many minor details have vanished or at least i cannot find them this however does not appear to me to be a matter for regret if every episode of a full and eventful life were painted in the canvas would be overloaded and the eye that studied it bewildered  i do not think that i have anything more to say my tale must speak for itself so i will but add that i hold it unnecessary to set out the exact method by which i have been able to dig it and others from the quarry of my past it is a gift which although small at first i have been able gradually to develop therefore as i wish to hide my present identity i will only sign myself  the editor      the wanderers necklace     book i  aar    chapter i  the betrothal of olaf  of my childhood in this olaf life i can regain but little there come to me however recollections of a house surrounded by a moat situated in a great plain near to seas or inland lakes on which plain stood mounds that i connected with the dead what the dead were i did not quite understand but i gathered that they were people who having once walked about and been awake now laid themselves down in a bed of earth and slept i remember looking at a big mound which was said to cover a chief known as the wanderer whom freydisa the wise woman my nurse told me had lived hundreds or thousands of years before and thinking that so much earth over him must make him very hot at nights  i remember also that the hall called aar was a long house roofed with sods on which grew grass and sometimes little white flowers and that inside of it cows were tied up we lived in a place beyond that was separated off from the cows by balks of rough timber i used to watch them being milked through a crack between two of the balks where a knot had fallen out leaving a convenient eyehole about the height of a walkingstick from the floor  one day my elder and only brother ragnar who had very red hair came and pulled me away from this eyehole because he wanted to look through it himself at a cow that always kicked the girl who milked it i howled and steinar my fosterbrother who had lightcoloured hair and blue eyes and was much bigger and stronger than i came to my help because we always loved each other he fought ragnar and made his nose bleed after which my mother the lady thora who was very beautiful boxed his ears then we all cried and my father thorvald a tall man rather loosely made who had come in from hunting for he carried the skin of some animal of which the blood had run down on to his leggings scolded us and told my mother to keep us quiet as he was tired and wanted to eat  that is the only scene which returns to me of my infancy  the next of which a vision has come to me is one of a somewhat similar house to our own in aar upon an island called lesso where we were all visiting a chief of the name of athalbrand he was a fiercelooking man with a great forked beard from which he was called athalbrand forkbeard one of his nostrils was larger than the other and he had a droop in his left eye both of which peculiarities came to him from some wound or wounds that he had received in war in those days everybody was at war with everybody else and it was quite uncommon for anyone to live until his hair turned grey  the reason of our visit to this chief athalbrand was that my elder brother ragnar might be betrothed to his only surviving child iduna all of whose brothers had been killed in some battle i can see iduna now as she was when she first appeared before us we were sitting at table and she entered through a door at the top of the hall she was clothed in a blue robe her long fair hair whereof she had an abundance was arranged in two plaits which hung almost to her knees and about her neck and arms were massive gold rings that tinkled as she walked she had a round face coloured like a wild rose and innocent blue eyes that took in everything although she always seemed to look in front of her and see nothing her lips were very red and appeared to smile altogether i thought her the loveliest creature that ever i had looked on and she walked like a deer and held her head proudly  still she did not please ragnar who whispered to me that she was sly and would bring mischief on all that had to do with her i who at the time was about twentyone years of age wondered if he had gone mad to talk thus of this beautiful creature then i remembered that just before we had left home i had caught ragnar kissing the daughter of one of our thralls behind the shed in which the calves were kept she was a brown girl very well made as her rough robe fastened beneath her breast with a strap showed plainly and she had big dark eyes with a sleepy look in them also i never saw anyone kiss quite so hard as she did ragnar himself was outpassed i think that is why even the great lady iduna the fair did not please him all the while he was thinking of the browneyed girl in the russet robe still it is true that browneyed girl or no he read iduna aright  moreover if ragnar did not like iduna from the first iduna hated ragnar so it came about that although both my father thorvald and idunas father athalbrand stormed and threatened these two declared that they would have nothing to do with each other and the project of their marriage came to an end  on the night before we were to leave lesso whence ragnar had already gone athalbrand saw me staring at iduna this indeed was not wonderful as i could not take my eyes from her lovely face and when she looked at me and smiled with those red lips of hers i became like a silly bird that is bewitched by a snake at first i thought that he was going to be angry but suddenly some idea seemed to strike him so that he called my father thorvald outside the house afterwards i was sent for and found the two of them seated on a threecornered flat stone talking in the moonlight for it was summertime when everything looks blue at night and the sun and the moon ride in the sky together near by stood my mother listening  olaf said my father would you like to marry iduna the fair  like to marry iduna i gasped aye more than to be high king of denmark for she is no woman but a goddess  at this saying my mother laughed and athalbrand who knew iduna when she did not seem a goddess called me a fool then they talked while i stood trembling with hope and fear  hes but a second son said athalbrand  i have told you there is land enough for both of them also the gold that came with his mother will be his and thats no small sum answered thorvald  hes no warrior but a skald objected athalbrand again a silly halfman who makes songs and plays upon the harp  songs are sometimes stronger than swords replied my father and after all it is wisdom that rules one brain can govern many men also harps make merry music at a feast moreover olaf is brave enough how can he be otherwise coming of the stock he does  he is thin and weedy objected athalbrand a saying that made my mother angry  nay lord athalbrand she said he is tall and straight as a dart and will yet be the handsomest man in these parts  every duck thinks it has hatched out a swan grumbled athalbrand while with my eyes i implored my mother to be silent  then he thought for awhile pulling at his long forked beard and said at last  my heart tells me no good of such a marriage iduna who is the only one left to me could marry a man of more wealth and power than this runemaking stripling is ever likely to be yet just now i know none such whom i would wish to hold my place when i am gone moreover it is spread far and wide throughout the land that my daughter is to be wed to thorvalds son and it matters little to which son at least i will not have it said that she has been given the goby therefore let this olaf take her if she will have him only he added with a growl let him play no tricks like that redheaded cub his brother ragnar if he would not taste of a spear through his liver now i go to learn idunas mind  so he went as did my father and mother leaving me alone thinking and thanking the gods for the chance that had come my wayyes and blessing ragnar and that browneyed wench who had thrown her spell over him  whilst i stood thus i heard a sound and turning saw iduna gliding towards me in the blue twilight looking more lovely than a dream at my side she stopped and said  my father tells me you wish to speak with me and she laughed a little softly and held me with her beautiful eyes  after that i know not what happened till i saw iduna bending towards me like a willow in the wind and thenoh joy of joysfelt her kiss upon my lips now my speech was unsealed and i told her the tale that lovers have always told how that i was ready to die for her to which she answered that she had rather that i lived since ghosts were no good husbands how that i was not worthy of her to which she answered that i was young with all my time before me and might live to be greater than i thought as she believed i should and so forth  only one more thing comes back to me of that blissful hour foolishly i said what i had been thinking namely that i blessed ragnar at these words of a sudden idunas face grew stern and the lovelight in her eyes was changed to such as gleams from swords  i do not bless ragnar she answered i hope one day to see ragnar and she checked herself adding come let us enter olaf i hear my father calling me to mix his sleepingcup  so we went into the house hand in hand and when they saw us coming thus all gathered there burst into shouts of laughter after their rude fashion moreover beakers were thrust into our hands and we were made to drink from them and swear some oath thus ended our betrothal  i think it was on the next day that we sailed for home in my fathers largest ship of war which was named the swan i went unwillingly enough who desired to drink more of the delight of idunas eyes still go i must since athalbrand would have it so the marriage he said should take place at aar at the time of the spring feast and not before meanwhile he held it best we should be apart that we might learn whether we still clung to each other in absence  these were the reasons he gave but i think that he was already somewhat sorry for what he had done and reflected that between harvest and springtime he might find another husband for iduna who was more to his mind for athalbrand as i learned afterwards was a scheming and a falsehearted man moreover he was of no high lineage but one who had raised himself up by war and plunder and therefore his blood did not compel him to honour    the next scene which comes back to me of those early days is that of the hunting of the white northern bear when i saved the life of steinar my fosterbrother and nearly lost my own  it was on a day when the winter was merging into spring but the coastline near aar was still thick with pack ice and large floes which had floated in from the more northern seas a certain fisherman who dwelt on this shore came to the hall to tell us that he had seen a great white bear on one of these floes which he believed had swum from it to the land he was a man with a clubfoot and i can recall a vision of him limping across the snow towards the drawbridge of aar supporting himself by a staff on the top of which was cut the figure of some animal  young lords he cried out there is a white bear on the land such a bear as once i saw when i was a boy come out and kill the bear and win honour but first give me a drink for my news  at that time i think my father thorvald was away from home with most of the men i do not know why but ragnar steinar and i were lingering about the stead with little or nothing to do since the time of sowing was not yet at the news of the clubfooted man we ran for our spears and one of us went to tell the only thrall who could be spared to make ready the horses and come with us thora my mother would have stopped usshe said she had heard from her father that such bears were very dangerous beastsbut ragnar only thrust her aside while i kissed her and told her not to fret  outside the hall i met freydisa a dark quiet woman of middle age one of the virgins of odin whom i loved and who loved me and save one other me only among men for she had been my nurse  whither now young olaf she asked me has iduna come here that you run so fast  no i answered but a white bear has  oh then things are better than i thought who feared lest it might be iduna before her time still you go on an ill errand from which i think you will return sadly  why do you say that freydisa i asked is it just because you love to croak like a raven on a rock or for some good reason  i dont know olaf she answered i say things because they come to me and i must that is all i tell you that evil will be born of this bear hunt of yours and you had better stop at home  to be laughed at by my brethren freydisa moreover you are foolish for if evil is to be how can i avoid it either your foresight is nothing or the evil must come  that is so answered freydisa from your childhood up you had the gift of reason which is more than is granted to most of these fools about us go olaf and meet your foreordained evil still kiss me before you go lest we should not see each other again for a while if the bear kills you at least you will be saved from iduna  now while she said these words i was kissing freydisa whom i loved dearly but when i understood them i leapt back before she could kiss me again  what do you mean by your talk about iduna i asked iduna is my betrothed and ill suffer no ill speech of her  i know she is olaf youve got ragnars leavings although he is so hotheaded ragnar is a wise dog in some ways who can tell what he should not eat there begone you think me jealous of iduna as old women can be but its not that my dear oh youll learn before all is done if you live begone begone ill tell you no more hark ragnar is shouting to you and she pushed me away  it was a long ride to where the bear was supposed to be at first as we went we talked a great deal and made a wager as to which of the three of us should first drive a spear into the beasts body so deep that the blade was hidden but afterwards i grew silent indeed i was musing so much of iduna and how the time drew near when once more i should see her sweet face wondering also why ragnar and freydisa should think so ill of her who seemed a goddess rather than a woman that i forgot all about the bear so completely did i forget it that when being by nature very observant i saw the slot of such a beast as we passed a certain birch wood i did not think to connect it with that which we were hunting or to point it out to the others who were riding ahead of me  at length we came to the sea and there sure enough saw a great icefloe which now and again tilted as the surge caught its broad green flank when it tilted towards us we perceived a track worn deep into the ice by the paws of the prisoned bear as it had marched endlessly round also we saw a big grinning skull whereon sat a raven picking at the eyeholes and some fragments of white fur  the bear is dead exclaimed ragnar odins curse be on that clubfooted fool who gave us this cold ride for nothing  yes i suppose so said steinar doubtfully dont you think that it is dead olaf  what is the good of asking olaf broke in ragnar with a loud laugh what does olaf know about bears he has been asleep for the last halfhour dreaming of athalbrands blueeyed daughter or perhaps he is making up another poem  olaf sees farther when he seems asleep than some of us do when we are awake answered steinar hotly  oh yes replied ragnar sleeping or waking olaf is perfect in your eyes for youve drunk the same milk and that ties you tighter than a rope wake up now brother olaf and tell us is not the bear dead  then i answered why of course a bear is dead see its skull also pieces of its hide  there exclaimed ragnar our family prophet has settled the matter let us go home  olaf said that a bear was dead answered steinar hesitating  ragnar who had already swung himself round in his quick fashion spoke back over his shoulder  isnt that enough for you do you want to hunt a skull or the raven sitting on it or is this perchance one of olafs riddles if so i am too cold to guess riddles just now  yet i think there is one for you to guess brother i said gently and it is where is the live bear hiding cant you see that there were two bears on that icehead and that one has killed and eaten the other  how do you know that asked ragnar  because i saw the slot of the second as we passed the birch wood yonder it has a split claw on the left forefoot and the others are all worn by the ice  then why in odins name did you not say so before exclaimed ragnar angrily  now i was ashamed to confess that i had been dreaming so i answered at hazard  because i wished to look upon the sea and the floating ice see what wondrous colours they take in this light  when he heard this steinar burst out laughing till tears came into his blue eyes and his broad shoulders shook but ragnar who cared nothing for scenery or sunsets did not laugh on the contrary as was usual with him when vexed he lost his temper and swore by the more evil of the gods then he turned on me and said  why not tell the truth at once olaf you are afraid of this beast and thats why you let us come on here when you knew it was in the wood you hoped that before we got back there it would be too dark to hunt  at this taunt i flushed and gripped the shaft of my long hunting spear for among us northmen to be told that he was afraid of anything was a deadly insult to a man  if you were not my brother i began then checked myself for i was by nature easytempered and went on it is true ragnar i am not so fond of hunting as you are still i think that there will be time to fight this bear and kill or be killed by it before it grows dark and if not i will return alone tomorrow morning  then i pulled my horse round and rode ahead as i went my ears being very quick i heard the other two talking together at least i suppose that i heard them at any rate i know what they said although strangely enough nothing at all comes back to me of their tale of an attack upon a ship or of what then i did or did not do  it is not wise to jeer at olaf said steinar for when he is stung with words he does mad things dont you remember what happened when your father called him niddering last year because olaf said it was not just to attack the ship of those british men who had been driven to our coast by weather meaning us no harm  aye answered ragnar he leapt among them all alone as soon as our boat touched her side and felled the steersman then the british men shouted out that they would not kill so brave a lad and threw him into the sea it cost us that ship since by the time we had picked him up she had put about and hoisted her large sail oh olaf is brave enough we all know that still he ought to have been born a woman or a priest of freya who only offers flowers also he knows my tongue and bears no malice  pray that we get him home safe said steinar uneasily for if not there will be trouble with your mother and every other woman in the land to say nothing of iduna the fair  iduna the fair would live through it answered ragnar with a hard laugh but you are right and what is more there will be trouble among the men also especially with my father and in my own heart after all there is but one olaf  at this moment i held up my hand and they stopped talking    chapter ii  the slaying of the bear  leaping from their horses ragnar and steinar came to where i stood for already i had dismounted and was pointing to the ground which just here had been swept clear of snow by the wind  i see nothing said ragnar  but i do brother i answered who study the ways of wild things while you think i am asleep look that moss has been turned over for it is frozen underneath and pressed up into little mounds between the bears claws also that tiny pool has gathered in the slot of the paw it is its very shape the other footprints do not show because of the rock  then i went forward a few paces behind some bushes and called out here runs the track sure enough and as i thought the brute has a split claw the snow marks it well bid the thrall stay with the horses and come you  they obeyed and there on the white snow which lay beyond the bush we saw the track of the bear stamped as if in wax  a mighty beast said ragnar never have i seen its like  aye exclaimed steinar but an ill place to hunt it in and he looked doubtfully at the rough gorge covered with undergrowth that some hundred yards farther on became dense birch forest i think it would be well to ride back to aar and return tomorrow morning with all whom we can gather this is no task for three spears  by this time i olaf was springing from rock to rock up the gorge following the bears track for my brothers taunts rankled in me and i was determined that i should kill this beast or die and thus show ragnar that i feared no bear so i called back to them over my shoulder  aye go home it is wisest but i go on for i have never yet seen one of these white icebears alive  now it is olaf who taunts in his turn said ragnar with a laugh then they both sprang after me but always i kept ahead of them  for the half of a mile or more they followed me out of the scrub into the birch forest where the snow lying on the matted boughs of the trees and especially of some firs that were mingled with the birch made the place gloomy in that low light always in front of me ran the huge slots of the bear till at length they brought me to a little forest glade where some great whirling wind had torn up many trees which had but a poor roothold on a patch of almost soilless rock  these trees lay in confusion their tops which had not yet rotted being filled with frozen snow on the edge of them i paused having lost the track then i went forward again casting wide as a hound does while behind came ragnar and steinar walking straight past the edge of the glade and purposing to meet me at its head this indeed ragnar did but steinar halted because of a crunching sound that caught his ear and then stepped to the right between two fallen birches to discover its cause next moment as he told me afterwards he stood frozen for there behind the boughs of one of the trees was the huge white bear eating some animal that it had killed the beast saw him and mad with rage at being disturbed for it was famished after its long journey on the floe reared itself up on its hind legs roaring till the air shook high it towered its hooklike claws outstretched  steinar tried to spring back but caught his foot and fell well for him was it that he did so for otherwise the blow which the bear struck would have crushed him to a pulp the brute did not seem to understand where he had goneat any rate it remained upreared and beating at the air then a doubt took it its huge paws sank until it sat like a begging dog sniffing the wind at this moment ragnar came back shouting and hurled his spear it stuck in the beasts chest and hung there the bear began to feel for it with its paws and catching the shaft lifted it to its mouth and champed it thus dragging the steel from its hide  then it bethought it of steinar and sinking down discovered him and tore at the birch tree under which he had crept till the splinters flew from its trunk just then i reached it having seen all by now the bear had its teeth fixed in steinars shoulder or rather in his leathern garment and was dragging him from under the tree when it saw me it reared itself up again lifting steinar and holding him to its breast with one paw i went mad at the sight and charged it driving my spear deep into its throat with its other paw it struck the weapon from my hand shivering the shaft there it stood towering over us like a white pillar and roared with pain and fury steinar still pressed against it ragnar and i helpless  hes sped gasped ragnar  i thought for a flash of time andoh well do i remember that moment the huge beast foaming at the jaws and steinar held to its breast as a little girl holds a doll the still snowladen trees on the top of one of which sat a small bird spreading its tail in jerks the red light of evening and about us the great silences of the sky above and of the lonely forest beneath it all comes back to mei can see it now quite clearly yes even the bird flitting to another twig and there again spreading its tail to some invisible mate then i made up my mind what to do  not yet i cried keep it in play and drawing my short and heavy sword i plunged through the birch boughs to get behind the bear ragnar understood he threw his cap into the brutes face and then after it had growled at him awhile just as it dropped its great jaws to crunch steinar he found a bough and thrust it between them  by now i was behind the bear and smiting at its right leg below the knee severed the tendon down it came still hugging steinar i smote again with all my strength and cut into its spine above the tail paralysing it it was a great blow as it need to be to cleave the thick hair and hide and my sword broke in the backbone so that like ragnar now i was weaponless the forepart of the bear rolled about in the snow although its after half was still  then once more it seemed to bethink itself of steinar who lay unmoving and senseless stretching out a paw it dragged him towards its champing jaws ragnar leapt upon its back and struck at it with his knife thereby only maddening it the more i ran in and grasped steinar whom the bear was again hugging to its breast seeing me it loosed steinar whom i dragged away and cast behind me but in the effort i slipped and fell forward the bear smote at me and its mighty forearmwell for me that it was not its clawsstruck me upon the side of the head and sent me crashing into a treetop to the left five paces i flew before my body touched the boughs and there i lay quiet  i suppose that ragnar told me what passed after this while i was senseless at least i know that the bear began to die for my spear had pierced some artery in its throat and all the talk which followed as well as though i heard it with my ears it roared and roared vomiting blood and stretching out its claws after steinar as ragnar dragged him away then it laid its head flat upon the snow and died ragnar looked at it and muttered  dead  then he walked to that top of the fallen tree in which i lay and again muttered dead well valhalla holds no braver man than olaf the skald  next he went to steinar and once again exclaimed dead  for so he looked indeed smothered in the blood of the bear and with his garments half torn off him still as the words passed ragnars lips he sat up rubbed his eyes and smiled as a child does when it awakes  are you much hurt asked ragnar  i think not he answered doubtfully save that i feel sore and my head swims i have had a bad dream then his eyes fell on the bear and he added oh i remember now it was no dream where is olaf  supping with odin answered ragnar and pointed to me  steinar rose to his feet staggered to where i lay and stared at me stretched there as white as the snow with a smile upon my face and in my hand a spray of some evergreen bush which i had grasped as i fell  did he die to save me asked steinar  aye answered ragnar and never did man walk that bridge in better fashion you were right would that i had not mocked him  would that i had died and not he said steinar with a sob it is borne in upon my heart that it were better i had died  then that may well be for the heart does not lie at such a time also it is true that he was worth both of us there was something more in him than there is in us steinar come lift him to my back and if you are strong enough go on to the horses and bid the thrall bring one of them i follow  thus ended the fight with the great white bear    some four hours later in the midst of a raging storm of wind and rain i was brought at last to the bridge that spanned the moat of the hall of aar laid like a corpse across the back of one of the horses they had been searching for us at aar but in that darkness had found nothing only at the head of the bridge was freydisa a torch in her hand she glanced at me by the light of the torch  as my heart foretold so it is she said bring him in then turned and ran to the house  they bore me up between the double ranks of stabled kine to where the great fire of turf and wood burned at the head of the hall and laid me on a table  is he dead asked thorvald my father who had come home that night and if so how  aye father answered ragnar and nobly he dragged steinar yonder from under the paws of the great white bear and slew it with his sword  a mighty deed muttered my father well at least he comes home in honour  but my mother whose favourite son i was lifted up her voice and wept then they took the clothes from off me and while all watched freydisa the skilled woman examined my hurts she felt my head and looked into my eyes and laying her ear upon my breast listened for the beating of my heart  presently she rose and turning said slowly  olaf is not dead though near to death his pulses flutter the light of life still burns in his eyes and though the blood runs from his ears i think the skull is not broken  when she heard these words thora my mother whose heart was weak fainted for joy and my father untwisting a gold ring from his arm threw it to freydisa  first the cure she said thrusting it away with her foot moreover when i work for love i take no pay  then they washed me and having dressed my hurts laid me on a bed near the fire that warmth might come back to me but freydisa would not suffer them to give me anything save a little hot milk which she poured down my throat    for three days i lay like one dead indeed all save my mother held freydisa wrong and thought that i was dead but on the fourth day i opened my eyes and took food and after that fell into a natural sleep on the morning of the sixth day i sat up and spoke many wild and wandering words so that they believed i should only live as a madman  his mind is gone said my mother and wept  nay answered freydisa he does but return from a land where they speak another tongue thorvald bring hither the bearskin  it was brought and hung on a frame of poles at the end of the niche in which i slept that as was usual among northern people opened out of the hall i stared at it for a long while then my memory came back and i asked  did the great beast kill steinar  no answered my mother who sat by me steinar was sore hurt but escaped and now is well again  let me see him with my own eyes i said  so he was brought and i looked on him i am glad you live my brother i said for know in this long sleep of mine i have dreamed that you were dead and i stretched out my wasted arms towards him for i loved steinar better than any other man  he came and kissed me on the brow saying  aye thanks to you olaf i live to be your brother and your thrall till the end  my brother always not my thrall i muttered for i was growing tired then i went to sleep again  three days later when my strength began to return i sent for steinar and said  brother iduna the fair whom you have never seen my betrothed must wonder how it fares with me for the tale of this hurt of mine will have reached lesso now as there are reasons why ragnar cannot go and as i would send no mean man i pray you to do me a favour it is that you will take a boat and sail to lesso carrying with you as a present from me to athalbrands daughter the skin of that white bear which i trust will serve her and me as a bedcovering in winter for many a year to come tell her thanks be to the gods and to the skill of freydisa my nurse i live who all thought must die and that i trust to be strong and well for our marriage at the spring feast which draws on say also that through all my sickness i have dreamed of none but her as i trust that sometimes she may have dreamed of me  aye ill go answered steinar fast as horses legs and sails can carry me adding with his pleasant laugh long have i desired to see this iduna of yours and to learn whether she is as beautiful as you say also what it is in her that ragnar hates  be careful that you do not find her too beautiful broke in freydisa who as ever was at my side  how can i if she is for olaf answered steinar smiling as he left the place to make ready for his journey to lesso  what did you mean by those words freydisa i asked when he was gone  little or much she replied shrugging her shoulders iduna is lovely is she not and steinar is handsome is he not and of an age when man seeks woman and what is brotherhood when man seeks woman and woman beguiles man  peace to your riddles freydisa you forget that iduna is my betrothed and that steinar was fostered with me why id trust them for a week at sea alone  doubtless olaf being young and foolish as you are also that is your nature now here is the broth drink it and i whom some call a wise woman and others a witch say that tomorrow you may rise from this bed and sit in the sun if there is any  freydisa i said when i had swallowed the broth why do folk call you a witch  i think because i am a little less of a fool than other women olaf also because it has not pleased me to marry as it is held natural that all women should do if they have the chance  why are you wiser and why have you not married freydisa  i am wiser because i have questioned things more than most and to those who question answers come at last and i am not married because another woman took the only man i wanted before i met him that was my bad luck still it taught me a great lesson namely how to wait and meanwhile to acquire understanding  what understanding have you acquired freydisa for instance does it tell you that our gods of wood and stone are true gods which rule the world or are they but wood and stone as sometimes i have thought  then think no more olaf for such thoughts are dangerous if leif your uncle odins high priest heard them what might he not say or do remember that whether the gods live or no certainly the priest lives and on the gods and if the gods went where would the priest be also as regards these godswell whatever they may or may not be at least they are the voices that in our day speak to us from that land whence we came and whither we go the world has known millions of days and each day has its godor its voiceand all the voices speak truth to those who can hear them meanwhile you are a fool to have sent steinar bearing your gift to iduna or perhaps you are very wise i cannot say as yet when i learn i will tell you  then again she shrugged her shoulders and left me wondering what she meant by her dark sayings i can see her going now a wooden bowl in her hand and in it a horn spoon of which the handle was cracked longways and thus in my mind ends all the scene of my sickness after the slaying of the white bear    the next thing that i remember is the coming of the men of agger this cannot have been very long after steinar went to lesso for he had not yet returned being still weak from my great illness i was seated in the sun in the shelter of the house wrapped up in a cloak of deerskinsfor the northern wind blew bitter by me stood my father who was in a happy mood now he knew that i should live and be strong again  steinar should be back by now i said to him i trust that he has come by no ill  oh no answered my father carelessly for seven days the wind has been high and doubtless athalbrand fears to let him sail from lesso  or perhaps steinar finds athalbrands hall a pleasant place to bide in suggested ragnar who had joined us a spear in his hand for he had come in from hunting there are good drink and bright eyes there  i was about to answer sharply since ragnar stung me with his bitter talk of steinar of whom i knew him to be somewhat jealous because he thought i loved my fosterbrother more than i did him my brother just then however three men appeared through trees that grew about the hall and came towards the bridge whereon ragnars great wolfhounds knowing them for strangers set up a furious baying and sprang forward to tear them by the time the beasts were caught and quelled these men aged persons of presence had crossed the bridge and were greeting us  this is the hall of thorvald of aar is it not and a certain steinar dwells here with him does he not asked their spokesman  it is and i am thorvald answered my father also steinar has dwelt here from his birth up but is now away from home on a visit to the lord athalbrand of lesso who are you and what would you of steinar my fosterling  when you have told us the story of steinar we will tell you who we are and what we seek answered the man adding fear not we mean him no harm but rather good if he is the man we think  wife called my father come hither here are men who would know the story of steinar and say that they mean him good  so my mother came and the men bowed to her  the story of steinar is short sirs she said his mother steingerdi who was my cousin and the friend of my childhood married the great chief hakon of agger two and twenty summers gone a year later just before steinar was born she fled to me here asking shelter of my lord her tale was that she had quarrelled with hakon because another woman had crept into her place finding that this tale was true and that hakon had treated her ill indeed we gave her shelter and here her son steinar was born in giving birth to whom she diedof a broken heart as i think for she was mad with grief and jealousy i nursed him with my son olaf yonder and as although he had news of his birth hakon never claimed him with us he has dwelt as a son ever since that is all the tale now what would you with steinar  this lady the lord hakon and the three sons whom that other woman you tell of bore him ere she diedfor after steingerdis death he married herwere drowned in making harbour on the night of the great gale eighteen days ago  that is the day when the bear nearly killed steinar i interrupted  well for him then young sir that he escaped this bear for now as it seems to us he is the lord of all hakons lands and people being the only male left living of his issue this by the wish of the head men of agger where is hakons hall we have come to tell him if he still lives since by report he is a goodly man and braveone well fitted to sit in hakons place  is the heritage great asked my father  aye very great lord in all jutland there was no richer man than hakon  by odin exclaimed my father it seems that steinar is in fortunes favour well men of agger enter and rest you after you have eaten we will talk further of these matters  it was just then that appearing between the trees on the road that ran to fladstrand and to the sea i saw a company mounted upon horses in front was a young woman wrapped in a coat of furs talking eagerly to a man who rode by her behind clad in armour with a battleaxe girt about him rode another man big and forkbearded who stared about him gloomily and behind him again ten or twelve thralls and seamen  one glance was enough for me then i sprang up crying  idunas self and with her my brother steinar the lord athalbrand and his folk a happy sight indeed and i would have run forward to meet them  yes yes said my mother but await them here i pray you you are not yet strong my son and she flung her arms about me and held me  presently they were at the bridge and steinar springing from his horse lifted iduna from her saddle a sight at which i saw my mother frown then i would no longer be restrained but ran forward crying greetings as i came and seizing idunas hand i kissed it indeed i would have kissed her cheek also but she shrank back saying  not before all these folk olaf  as you will i answered though just then a chill struck me which i thought to myself came doubtless from the cold wind it will be the sweeter afterwards i added as gaily as i could  yes she said hurriedly but olaf how white and thin you are i had hoped to find you well again though not knowing how it fared with you i came to see with my own eyes  that is good of you i muttered as i turned to grasp steinars hand adding i know well who it was that brought you here  nay nay she said i came of myself but my father waits you olaf  so i went to where the lord athalbrand forkbeard was dismounting and greeted him lifting my cap  what grumbled athalbrand who seemed to be in an ill temper are you olaf i should scarcely have known you again lad for you look more like a wisp of hay tied on a stick than a man now that the flesh is off you i see you lack bone unlike some others and he glanced at the broadshouldered steinar greeting to you thorvald we are come here through a sea that nearly drowned us somewhat before the appointed time becausewell because on the whole i thought it best to come i pray odin that you are more glad to see us than i am to see you  if so friend athalbrand why did you not stop away asked my father firing up then adding quickly nay no offence you are welcome here whatever your humour and you too my daughter that is to be and you steinar my fosterling who as it chances are come in a good hour  hows that lord asked steinar absently for he was looking at iduna  thus steinar these menand he pointed to the three messengershave but just arrived from agger with the news that your father hakon and your halfbrothers are all drowned they say also that the folk of agger have named you hakons heir as indeed you are by right of blood  is that so exclaimed steinar bewildered well as i never saw my father or my brothers and they treated me but ill i cannot weep for them  hakon broke in athalbrand why i knew him well for in my youth we were comrades in war he was the wealthiest man in jutland in cattle lands thralls and stored gold young friend your luck is great and he stared first at steinar then at iduna pulling his forked beard and muttering words to himself that i could not catch  steinar gets the fortune he deserves i exclaimed embracing him not for nothing did i save you from the bear steinar come wish my fosterbrother joy iduna  aye that i do with all my heart she said joy and long life to you and with them rule and greatness steinar lord of agger and she curtsied to him her blue eyes fixed upon his face  but steinar turned away making no answer only ragnar who stood by burst into a loud laugh then putting his arm through mine he led me into the hall saying  this wind is over cold for you olaf nay trouble not about iduna steinar lord of agger will care for her i think  that night there was a feast at aar and i sat at it with iduna by my side beautiful she was indeed in her garment of blue over which streamed her yellow hair bright as the gold rings that tinkled on her rounded arms she was kind to me also and bade me tell her the story of the slaying of the bear which i did as best i could though afterwards ragnar told it otherwise and more fully only steinar said little or nothing for he seemed to be lost in dreams  i thought that this was because he felt sad at the news of the death of his father and brethren since although he had never known them blood still calls to blood and so i believe did most there present at any rate my father and mother tried to cheer him and in the end bade the men of agger draw near to tell him the tale of his heritage  they obeyed and set out all their case of which the sum was that steinar must now be one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of the northern lands  it seems that we should all take off our caps to you young lord said athalbrand when he heard this tale of rule and riches why did you not ask me for my fair daughter he added with a halfdrunken laugh for all the liquor he had swallowed had got a hold of his brain recovering himself he went on it is my will thorvald that iduna and this snipe of an olaf of yours should be wed as soon as possible i say that they shall be wed as soon as possible since otherwise i know not what may happen  then his head fell forward on the table and he sank to sleep    chapter iii  the wanderers necklace  on the morrow early i lay awake for how could i sleep when iduna rested beneath the same roof with meiduna who as her father had decreed was to become my wife sooner than i had hoped i was thinking how beautiful she looked and how much i loved her also of other things that were not so pleasant for instance why did not everybody see her with my eyes i could not hide from myself that ragnar went near to hating her more than once she had almost been the cause of a quarrel between us freydisa too my nurse who loved me looked on her sourly and even my mother although she tried to like her for my sake had not yet learned to do so or thus it appeared to me  when i asked her why she replied that she feared the maid was somewhat selfish also too fond of drawing the eyes of men and of the adornment of her beauty of those who were dearest to me indeed only steinar seemed to think iduna as perfect as i did myself this so far as it went was well but then steinar and i had always thought alike which robbed his judgment of something of its worth  whilst i was pondering over these things although it was still so early that my father and athalbrand were yet in bed sleeping off the fumes of the liquor they had drunk i heard steinar himself talking to the messengers from agger in the hall they asked him humbly whether he would be pleased to return with them that day and take possession of his inheritance since they must get back forthwith to agger with their tidings he replied that if they would send some or come themselves to escort him on the tenth day from that on which they spoke he would go to agger with them but that until then he could not do so  ten days in ten days who knows what may happen said their spokesman such a heritage as yours will not lack for claimants lord especially as hakon has left nephews behind him  i know not what will or will not happen answered steinar but until then i cannot come go now i pray you if you must and bear my words and greetings to the men of agger whom soon i hope to meet myself  so they went as i thought heavily enough a while afterwards my father rose and came into the hall where from my bed i could see steinar seated on a stool by the fire brooding he asked where the men of agger were and steinar told him what he had done  are you mad steinar he asked that you have sent them away with such an answer why did you not consult me first  because you were asleep fosterfather and the messengers said they must catch the tide also i could not leave aar until i had seen olaf and iduna married  iduna and olaf can marry without your help it takes two to make a marriage not three i see well that you owe love and loyalty to olaf who is your fosterbrother and saved your life but you owe something to yourself also i pray odin that this folly may not have cost you your lordship fortune is a wench who will not bear slighting  i know it answered steinar and there was something strange in his voice believe me i do not slight fortune i follow her in my own fashion  then it is a mad fashion grumbled my father and walked away    it comes back to me that it was some days after this that i saw the ghost of the wanderer standing on his grave mound it happened thus on a certain afternoon i had been riding alone with iduna which was a great joy to me though i would sooner have walked for then i could have held her hand and perhaps if she had suffered it kissed her i had recited to her a poem which i had made comparing her to the goddess iduna the wife of bragi she who guarded the apples of immortal youth whereof the gods must eat or die she whose garment was the spring woven of the flowers that she put on when she escaped from winters giant grasp i think that it was a very good poem of its own sort but iduna seemed to have small taste for poetry and to know little of the lovely goddess and her apples although she smiled sweetly and thanked me for my verses  then she began to talk of other matters especially of how after we were wed her father wished to make war upon another chieftain and to seize his land she said that it was for this reason that he had been so anxious to form an alliance with my father thorvald as such an alliance would make him sure of victory before that time she told me that he athalbrand had purposed to marry her to another lord for this very reason but unhappily this lord had been killed in battle  nay happily for us iduna i said  perhaps she answered with a sigh who knows at any rate your house will be able to give us more ships and men than he who is dead could have done  yet i love peace not war i broke in i who hate the slaying of those who have never harmed me and do not seek to die on the swords of men whom i have no desire to harm of what good is war when one has enough i would be no widowmaker iduna nor do i wish that others should make you a widow  iduna looked at me with her steady blue eyes  you talk strangely olaf she said and were it not known to be otherwise some might hold that you are a coward yet it was no coward who leapt alone on board the battle ship or who slew the great white bear to save steinars life i do not understand you olaf you who have doubts as to the killing of men how does a man grow great except upon the blood of others it is that which fats him how does the wolf live how does the kite live how does odin fill valhalla by death always by death  i cannot answer you i said yet i hold that somewhere there is an answer which i do not know since wrong can never be the right  then as she did not seem to understand i began to talk of other things but from that moment i felt as though a veil swung between me and iduna her beauty held my flesh but some other part in me turned away from her we were different  when we reached the hall we met steinar who was lingering near the door he ran forward and helped iduna to dismount then said  olaf i know that you must not overtire yourself as yet but your lady has told me that she desires to see the sunset from odins mount have i your leave to take her there  i do not yet need olafs leave to walk abroad though some few days hence it may be different broke in iduna with a merry laugh before i could answer come lord steinar let us go and see this sunset whereof you talk so much  yes go i said only do not stay too long for i think a storm comes up but who is that has taught steinar to love sunsets  so they went and before they had been gone an hour the storm broke as i had foreseen first came wind and with it hail and after that thunder and great darkness lit up from time to time by pulsing lightning  steinar and iduna do not return i am afraid for them i said at last to freydisa  then why do you not go to seek them she asked with a little laugh  i think i will i said  if so i will come with you olaf for you still need a nurse though for my part i hold that the lord steinar and the lady iduna can guard themselves as well as most folk no i am wrong i mean that the lady iduna can guard herself and the lord steinar now be not angry heres your cloak  so we started for i was urged to this foolish journey by some impulse that i could not master there were two ways of reaching odins mount one the shorter over the rocks and through the forest land the other the longer ran across the open plain between the many earth tombs of the dead who had lived thousands of years before and past the great mound in which it was said that a warrior of long ago who was named the wanderer lay buried because of the darkness we chose this latter road and presently found ourselves beneath the great mass of the wanderers mount now the darkness was intense and the lightning grew rare for the hail and rain had ceased and the storm was rolling away  my counsel is said freydisa that we wait here until the moon rises which it should do soon when the wind has driven away the clouds it will show us our path but if we go on in this darkness we shall fall into some pit it is not cold tonight and you will take no harm  no indeed i answered for now i am as strong again as ever i was  so we stayed till the lightning flashing for the last time showed us a man and a woman standing quite close to us although we had not heard them because of the wind they were steinar and iduna talking together eagerly with their faces very near to each other at the same moment they saw us steinar said nothing for he seemed confused but iduna ran to us and said  thanks be to the gods who send you olaf the great storm caught us at odins temple where we were forced to shelter then fearing that you would grow frightened we started and lost our way  is it so i answered surely steinar would have known this road even in the dark but what matter since i have found you  aye he knew as soon as we saw this grave mound but steinar was telling me that some ghost haunts it and i begged him to stay awhile since there is nothing i desire so much as to see a ghost who believe little in such things so he stayed though he says he fears the dead more than the living freydisa they tell me that you are very wise cannot you show me this ghost  the spirit does not ask my leave to appear lady answered freydisa in her quiet voice still at times it does appear for i have seen it twice so let us bide here a little on the chance  then she went forward a few steps and began to mutter to herself  some minutes later the clouds broke and the great moon was seen riding low down in a clear sky illumining the grave mound and all the plain save where we stood in the shadow of the mount  do you see aught asked freydisa presently if not let us be gone for when the wanderer comes at all it is at the rising of the moon  steinar and iduna answered no but i who did see something said  look yonder among the shadows mayhap it is a wolf stirring nay it is a man look iduna  i look and find nothing she answered  look again i said he reaches the top of the mount and stands there staring towards the south oh now he turns and the moonlight shines upon his face  you dream olaf said steinar if you do not dream tell us of the likeness of this spirit  its likeness i answered is that of a tall and noble man worn as though with years and sorrows he wears strange rich armour that is dinted and soiled on his head is a cap of mail with two long earpieces beneath which appears his brown hair lined with grey he holds a redcoloured sword which is handled with a cross of gold he points the sword at you steinar it is as though he were angry with you or warned you  now when steinar heard these words he shook and groaned as i remembered afterwards but of this i took no note at the time for just then iduna cried out  say olaf does the man wear a necklace i see a necklace hanging in the air above the mount but naught else  yes iduna he wears a necklace above his mail how does it appear to you  oh beautiful beautiful she answered a chain of pale gold and hanging from it golden shells inlaid with blue and between them green jewels that hold the moon  that is what i see also i said as indeed i did there all is gone  freydisa returned and there was a strange smile on her dark face for she had heard all our talk  who sleeps in that mound freydisa asked iduna  how can i tell lady seeing that he was laid there a thousand years ago or mayhap more yet a story true or false remains of him that i have heard it is that he was a king of these parts who followed a dream to the south the dream was of a necklace and of one who wore it for many years he wandered and at length returned again to this place which had been his home wearing the necklace but when he saw its shore from the sea he fell down and his spirit left him what happened to him in his wanderings none know for the tale is lost only it is said that his people buried him in yonder mound still wearing his armour and the necklace he had won there as olaf has seen or thinks that he has seen but now he stands at moonrise ere trouble comes to any of his race and stares towards the southalways towards the south  is the necklace yet in the mound asked iduna eagerly  without doubt lady who would dare to touch the holy thing and bring on him the curse of the wanderer and his gods and with it his own death no man that ever sailed the seas i think  not so freydisa for i am sure i know one who would dare it for my sake olaf if you love me bring me that necklace as a marriage gift i tell you that having once seen it i want it more than anything in all the world  did you hear what freydisa said i asked that he who wrought this sacrilege would bring upon himself evil and death  yes i heard but it is folly for who need fear dead bones as for the shape you saw why it is strengthless for good or ill a shadow drawn from what has been by the magic moon or perchance by freydisas witchery olaf olaf get me that necklace or i will never kiss you more  that means you will not marry me iduna  that means i will only marry the man who gives me that necklace if you fear the deed perhaps there are some others by whom it might be tried  now when i heard these words a sudden rage seized me was i to be taunted thus by the fair woman whom i loved  fear is an ill word to use to me i said sternly know iduna that if it is put to me thus i fear nothing in life or death you shall have the necklace if it can be found in yonder earth chance what may to the searcher nay no more words steinar will lead you home i must talk of this matter with freydisa    it was midnight i know not on what day since all these things come back to me in vivid scenes as flashes of lightning show a landscape but are separated from each other by dense darkness freydisa and i stood by the wanderers grave and at our feet lay digging tools two lamps and tinder to light them we were setting about our grim task at dead of night for fear lest the priests should stay us also i did not wish the people to know that i had done this thing  here is work for a month i said doubtfully looking up at the great mass of the mound  nay replied freydisa since i can show you the door of the grave and perchance the passage still stands yet will you really enter there  why not freydisa must i bear to be taunted by the woman i am to wed surely it would be better to die and have done let the ghost slay me if he will it comes upon me that if so i shall be spared trouble  no bridegrooms talk said freydisa however true it may be yet young olaf do you take heart since i think that this ghost has no desire for your blood i am wise in my own fashion olaf and much of the past comes to me if little of the future and i believe that this wanderer and you have more to do with each other than we can guess it may be even that this task is appointed to you and that all these happenings which are but begun work to an end unseen at the least try your fortune and if you diewhy i who was your nurse from your mothers knee love you well enough to die with you together well descend to helas halls there to seek out the wanderer and learn his story  then throwing her arms about my neck she drew me to her and kissed me on the brow  i was not your mother olaf she went on but to be honest i would have been could i have had my fancy though strangely enough i never felt thus towards ragnar your brother now why do you make me talk foolishness come hither and i will show you the entrance to the grave it is where the sun first strikes upon it  then she led me to the east of the mound where not more than eight or ten feet from its base grew a patch of bushes among these bushes was a little hollow as though at this spot the earth had sunk in here at her bidding i began to dig and with her help worked for the half of an hour or more in silence till at length my spade struck against a stone  it is the doorstone said freydisa dig round it  so i dug till i made a hole at the edge of the stone large enough for a man to creep through after this we paused to rest a while and to allow the air within the mound to purify  now she said if you are not afraid we will enter  i am afraid i answered indeed the terror which struck me then returns so that even as i write i feel fear of the dead man who lay and for aught i know still lies within that grave yet i added never will i face iduna more without the necklace if it can be found  so we struck sparks on to the tinder and from them lit the two lamps of seal oil then i crept into the hole freydisa following me to find myself in a narrow passage built of rough stones and roofed with flat slabs of waterworn rock this tunnel save for a little dry soil that had sifted into it through the cracks between the stones was quite clear we crawled along it without difficulty till we came to the tomb chamber which was in the centre of the mound but at a higher level than the entrance for the passage sloped upwards doubtless to allow for drainage the huge stones with which it was lined and roofed over were not less than ten feet high and set on end side by side one of these upright stones was that designed for the door had it been in place we could not have entered the chamber without great labour and the help of many men but as it chanced either it had never been set up after the burial or this was done so hastily that it had fallen  we are in lucks way said freydisa when she noticed this no i will go first who know more of ghosts than you do olaf if the wanderer strikes let him strike me and she clambered over the fallen slab  presently she called back saying  come all is quiet here as it should be in such a place  i followed her and sliding down the end of the stonewhich i remember scratched my elbow and made it bleedfound myself in a little room about twelve feet square in this place there was but one thing to be seen what appeared to be the trunk of a great oak tree some nine feet in length and standing on it side by side two figures of bronze under a foot in height  the coffin in which the wanderer lies and the gods he worshipped said freydisa  then she took up first one and next the other of the bronze figures and we examined them in the light of the lamps although i feared to touch them they were statues of a man and a woman  the man who wore a long and formal beard was wrapped in what seemed to be a shroud through an opening in which appeared his hands in the right hand was a scourge with a handle and in the left a crook such as a shepherd might use only shorter on his head was what i took to be a helmet a tall peaked cap ending in a knob having on either side of it a stiff feather of bronze and in front above the forehead a snake also of bronze  the woman was clad in a straight and narrow robe cut low beneath her breast her face was mild and beautiful and in her right hand she held a looped sceptre her hair descended in many long plaits on to her shoulders for headdress she wore two horns supporting between them a burnished disc of gold like to that of the moon when it is full  strange gods i muttered  aye answered freydisa yet maybe true ones to those who worship them but we will talk of these later now for their servant  then she dropped the figures into a pouch at her side and began to examine the trunk of the oak tree of which the outer sap wood had been turned to tinder by age leaving the heart still hard as iron  see she said pointing to a line about four inches from the top the tree has been sawn in two lengthways and the lid laid on come help  then she took an ironshod staff which we had brought with us and worked its sharp point into the crack after which we both rested our weight upon the staff the lid of the coffin lifted quite easily for it was not pegged down and slid of its own weight over the side of the tree in the cavity beneath was a form covered with a purple cloak stained as though by salt water freydisa lifted the cloak and there lay the wanderer as he had been placed a thousand or more of years before our time as perfect as he had been in the hour of his death for the tannin from the newfelled tree in which he was buried had preserved him  breathless with wonder we bent down and examined him by the light of the lamps he was a tall spare man to all appearance of between fifty and sixty years of age his face was thin and fine he wore a short grizzled beard his hair so far as it could be seen beneath his helmet was brown and lightly tinged with grey  does he call anyone to your mind asked freydisa  yes i think so a little i replied who is it now oh i know my mother  that is strange olaf since to me he seems much like what you might become should you live to his years yet it was through your mothers line that aar came to your race many generations gone for this much is known well study him hard for look you now that the air has got to him he melts away  melt he did indeed till presently there was nothing left save a skull patched here and there with skin and hair yet i never forgot that face indeed to this hour i see it quite clearly when at length it had crumbled we turned to other things knowing that our time in the grave must be measured by the oil in the simple lamps we had freydisa lifted a cloth from beneath the chin revealing a dinted breastplate of rich armour different from any of our day and land and lying on it such a necklace as we had seen upon the ghost a beauteous thing of inlaid golden shells and emerald stones shaped like beetles  take it for your iduna said freydisa since it is for her sake that we break in upon this great mans rest  i seized the precious thing and tugged at it but the chain was stout and would not part again i tugged and now it was the neck of the wanderer that broke for the head rolled from the body and the gold chain came loose between the two  let us be going said freydisa as i hid away the necklace the oil in the lamps burns low and even i do not care to be left here in the dark with this mighty one whom we have robbed  theres his armour i said id have that armour it is wonderful  then stop and get it by yourself she answered for my lamp dies  at least i will take the sword i exclaimed and snatched at the belt by which it was girt about the body the leather had rotted and it came away in my hand  holding it i clambered over the stone after freydisa and followed her down the passage before we reached the end of it the lamps went out so that we must finish our journey in the dark thankful enough were both of us when we found ourselves safe in the open air beneath the familiar stars  now how comes it freydisa i asked when we had got our breath again that this wanderer who showed himself so threateningly upon the crest of his grave lies patient as a dead sheep within it while we rob his bones  because we were meant to take it as i think olaf now help me to fill in the mouth of that hole roughlyi will return to finish this tomorrowand let us away to the hall i am weary and i tell you olaf that the weight of things to come lies heavy on my soul i think wisdom dwells with that wanderers bones yes and foresight of the future and memories of the past    chapter iv  iduna wears the necklace  i lay sleeping in my bed at aar the sword of the wanderer by my side and his necklace beneath my pillow in my sleep there came to me a very strange and vivid dream i dreamed that i was the wanderer no other man and here i who write this history in these modern days will say that the dream was true  once in the far past i who afterwards was born as olaf and who am nowwell never mind my namelived in the shape of that man who in olafs time was by tradition known as the wanderer of that wanderer life however for some reason which i cannot explain i am able to recover but few memories other earlier lives come back to me much more clearly but at present the details of this particular existence escape me for the purpose of the history which i am setting down this matters little since although i know enough to be sure that the persons concerned in the olaf life were for the most part the same as those concerned in the wanderer life their stories remain quite distinct  therefore i propose to leave that of the wanderer so far as i know it untold wild and romantic as it seems to have been for he must have been a great man this wanderer who in the early ages of the northern world drawn by the magnet of some previous egyptian incarnation broke back to those southern lands with which his informing spirit was already so familiar and thence won home again to the place where he was born only to die in considering this dream which olaf dreamed let it be remembered then that although a thousand or maybe fifteen hundred of our earthly years separated us from each other the wanderer into whose tomb i broke at the goading of iduna and i olaf were really the same being clothed in different shapes of flesh  to return to my dream i olaf or rather my spirit dwelling in the wanderers body that body which i had just seen lying in the grave stood at night in a great columned building which i knew to be the temple of some god at my feet lay a basin of clear water the moonlight which was almost as bright as that of day showed me my reflection in the water it was like to that of the wanderer as i had seen him lying in his oak coffin in the mound only younger than he had seemed to be in the coffin moreover he wore the same armour that the man in the coffin wore and at his side hung the red crosshandled sword there he stood in the temple alone and looked across a plain green with crops on which sat two mighty images as high as tall pines looked to a great river on whose banks grew trees such as i had never beheld tall straight trees surmounted by a stiff crown of leaves beyond this river lay a white flatroofed city and in it were other great columned temples  the man in whom i olaf the dane seemed to dwell in my dream turned and behind him saw a range of naked hills of brown rock and in them the mouth of a desolate valley where was no green thing presently he became aware that he was no longer alone at his side stood a woman she was a very beautiful woman unlike anyone i olaf had ever seen her shape was tall and slender her eyes were large dark and soft as a deers her features were small and straight save the mouth of which the lips were somewhat full the face which was darkhued like her hair and eyes was sad but wore a sweet and haunting smile it was much such a face as that upon the statue of the goddess which we had found in the wanderers tomb and the dress she wore beneath her cloak was like to the dress of the goddess she was speaking earnestly  my love my only love she said you must begone this very night indeed the boat awaits you that shall take you down the river to the sea all is discovered my waitinglady the priestess but now has told me that my father the king purposes to seize and throw you into prison tomorrow and thereafter to put you on your trial for being beloved by a daughter of the royal blood of which as you are a foreign man however noble you may be the punishment is death moreover if you are condemned your doom will be my own there is but one way in which to save my life and that is by your flight for if you fly it has been whispered to me that all will be forgotten  now in my dream he who wore the wanderers shape reasoned with her saying at length that it was better they both should die to live on in the world of spirits rather than part for ever she hid her face on his breast and answered  i cannot die i would stay to look upon the sun not for my own sake but because of our child that will be born nor can i fly with you since then your boat will be stopped but if you go alone the guards will let it pass they have their commands  after this for a while they wept in each others arms for their hearts were broken  give me some token he murmured let me wear something that you have worn until my death  she opened her cloak and there upon her breast hung that necklace which had lain upon the breast of the wanderer in his tomb the necklace of gold and inlaid shells and emerald beetles only there were two rows of shells and emeralds not one one row she unclasped and clasped it again round his neck breaking the little gold threads that bound the two strands together  take this she said and i will wear the half which is left of it even in my grave as you also shall wear your half in life and death now something comes upon me it is that when the severed parts of this necklace are once more joined together then we two shall meet again upon the earth  what chance is there that i shall return from my northern home if ever i win so far back to this southern land  none she answered in this life we shall kiss no more yet there are other lives to come or so i think and have learned through the wisdom of my people begone begone ere my heart breaks on yours but never let this necklace of mine which was that of those who were long before me lie upon another womans breast for if so it will bring sorrow to the giver and to her to whom it is given no good fortune  how long must i wait before we meet again he asked  i do not know but i think that when all that jewel once more grows warm above my immoral heart this temple which they call eternal will be but a timeeaten ruin hark the priestess calls farewell you man who have come out of the north to be my glory and my shame farewell until the purpose of our lives declares itself and the seed that we have sown in sorrow shall blossom into an everlasting flower farewell farewell  then a woman appeared in the background beckoning and all my dream vanished away yet to my mind came the thought that it was to the lady who gave the necklace that death stood near rather than to him to whom it was given for surely death was written in her sad and longing eyes    so that dream ended when i olaf awoke in the morning it was to find that already everyone was astir for i had overslept myself in the hall were gathered ragnar steinar iduna and freydisa the elders were talking together elsewhere on the subject of the forthcoming marriage i went to iduna to embrace her and she proffered me her cheek speaking all the while over her shoulder to ragnar  where were you last night brother that you came in near the dawn all covered with mud asked ragnar turning his back on iduna without making any answer to her words  digging in the wanderers grave brother as iduna challenged me to do  now all three of them turned on me eagerly save freydisa who stood by the fire listening and with one voice asked if i had found anything  aye i replied i found the wanderer a very noblelooking man and i began to describe him  peace to this dead wanderer broke in iduna did you find the necklace  yes i found the necklace here it is and i laid the splendid thing upon the board  then suddenly i lost my speech since now for the first time i saw that twisted round the chain of it were three broken wires of gold i remembered how in my dream i had seen the beautiful woman break such wires ere she gave half of the jewel to the man in whose breast i had seemed to dwell and for a moment grew so frightened that i could say no more  oh exclaimed iduna it is beautiful beautiful oh olaf i thank you and she flung her arms about me and kissed me this time in earnest  then she seized the necklace and fastened it round her throat  stay i said awaking i think you had best not touch those gems iduna i have dreamed that they will bring no luck to you or to any woman save one  here the darkfaced freydisa looked up at me then dropped her eyes again and stood listening  you have dreamed exclaimed iduna i care little what you have dreamed it is for the necklace i care and not all the illluck in the world shall stay me from the keeping of it  here again freydisa looked up but steinar looked down  did you find aught else asked ragnar interrupting  aye brother this and from under my cloak i produced the wanderers sword  a wondrous weapon said ragnar when he had examined it though somewhat heavy for its length and of bronze after the fashion of those that are buried in the grave mounds it has seen much wear also and i should say has loosed many a spirit look at the gold work of the handle truly a wondrous weapon worth all the necklaces in the world but tell us your story  so i told them and when i came to the images that we had found standing on the coffin iduna who was paying little heed stopped from her fondling of the necklace and asked where they were  freydisa has them i answered show them the wanderers gods freydisa  so freydisa was with you was she said iduna  then she glanced at the gods laughed a little at their fashion and raiment and again fell to fingering the necklace which was more to her than any gods  afterwards freydisa asked me what was the dream of which i had spoken and i told it to her every word  it is a strange story said freydisa what do you make of it olaf  nothing save that it was a dream and yet those three broken wires that are twisted round the chain which i had never noted till i saw the necklace in idunas hand they fit well with my dream  aye olaf and the dream fits well with other things have you ever heard olaf that there are those who say that men live more than once upon this earth  no i answered laughing yet why should they not do so as they live at all if so perhaps i am that wanderer in whose body i seemed to be only then i am sure that the lady with the golden shells was not iduna and again i laughed  no olaf she was not iduna though perchance there was an iduna all the same tell me did you see aught of that priestess who was with the lady  only that she was tall and dark one of middle age but why waste words on this midnight madness yet that royal woman haunts me i would that i could see her again if only in a dream also freydisa i would that iduna had not taken the necklace i fear lest it should bring misfortune where is she now i will tell her again  wandering with steinar i think and wearing the necklace oh olaf like you i fear it will bring woe i cannot read your dreamas yet    it was the day before that of my marriage i see them moving about the shapes of all those longforgotten men and women arrayed in their bravest garments and rude ornaments of gold and silver for a great company had been bidden many of whom came from far i see my uncle leif the darkbrowed priest of odin passing between the hall and the temple where on the morrow he must celebrate the marriage rites in such a fashion as would do honour to the god i see iduna athalbrand and steinar talking together apart i see myself watching all this life and stir like one who is mazed and i know that since i had entered the wanderers grave all things had seemed unreal to me iduna whom i loved was about to become my wife and yet between me and iduna continually was thrust a vision of the woman of my dream at times i thought that the blow from the bears paw had hurt my brain that i must be going mad i prayed to the gods that this might not be so and when my prayers availed me nothing i sought the counsel of freydisa  she listened to my story then said briefly  let be things will go as they are fated you are no madder than the rest of men i can say no more  it was the custom of that time and land that if possible the wife to be should not pass the night before her marriage under the same roof as her future husband therefore athalbrand whose mood had been strange of late went with iduna to sleep in his beached ship at my request steinar went with them in order that he might see that they were brought back in good time in the morning  you will not fail me in this steinar i said clasping his hand  he tried to answer something but the words seemed to choke in his throat and he turned away leaving them unspoken  why i exclaimed one might think you were going to be married not i  aye broke in iduna hurriedly the truth is that steinar is jealous of me how is it that you can make us all love you so much olaf  would that i were more worthy of your love i answered smiling as in years to come i hope to show myself  athalbrand who was watching tugged at his forked beard and muttered something that sounded like an oath then he rode off kicking his horse savagely and not noting my outstretched hand or so it seemed of this however i took little heed for i was engaged in kissing iduna in farewell  be not sad she said as she kissed me back on the lips remember that we part for the last time again she kissed me and went laughing happily  the morning came all was prepared from far and near the guests were gathered waiting to do honour to the marriage feast even some of the men of agger were there who had come to pay homage to their new lord the spring sun shone brightly as it should upon a marriage morn and without the doors the trumpeters blew blasts with their curved horns in the temple the altar of odin was decorated with flowers and by it also decorated with flowers the offering awaited sacrifice my mother in her finest robe the same in truth in which she herself had been wed stood by the door of the hall which was cleared of kine and set with tables giving and returning greetings her arm was round me who as bridegroom was clothed in new garments of woven wool through which ran a purple streak the best that could be made in all the land ragnar came up  they should be here he said the hour is over past  doubtless the fair bride has been long in decking herself answered my father looking at the sun she will come presently  still time went on and the company began to murmur while a strange cold fear seemed to grip my heart at length a man was seen riding towards the hall and one cried  at last here comes the herald  another answered for a messenger of love he rides slowly and sadly and a silence fell on all that heard him  the man a stranger to us arrived and said  i have a message for the lord thorvald from the lord athalbrand which i was charged to deliver at this hour neither before nor after it is that he sailed for lesso at the rising of the moon last night there purposing to celebrate the marriage of his daughter the lady iduna with steinar lord of agger and is therefore grieved that he and the lady iduna cannot be present at your feast this day  now when i heard these words i felt as though a spear had been thrust through me steinar oh surely not with my brother steinar i gasped and staggered against the doorpost where i stood like one who has been struck helpless  ragnar sprang at the messenger and dragging him from his horse would have killed him had not some stayed his hand my father thorvald remained silent but his halfbrother the darkbrowed priest of odin lifted his hands to heaven and called down the curse of odin upon the trothbreakers the company drew swords and shouted for vengeance demanding to be led against the false athalbrand at length my father called for silence  athalbrand is a man without shame he said steinar is a viper whom i have nursed in my breast a viper that has bitten the hand which saved him from death aye you men of agger you have a viper for your lord iduna is a lightoflove upon whom all honest women should spit who has broken her oath and sold herself for steinars wealth and rule i swear by thor that with your help my friends and neighbours i will be avenged upon all three of these but for such vengeance preparations must be made since athalbrand and steinar are strong moreover they lie in an island and can only be attacked by sea further there is no haste since the mischief is done and by now steinar the snake and iduna the lightoflove will have drunk their marriagecup come eat my friends and not too sadly seeing that if my house has suffered shame it has escaped worse shame that of welcoming a false woman as a bride of one of us doubtless when his bitterness is past olaf my son will find a better wife  so they sat down and ate the marriage feast only the seats of the bride and bridegroom were empty for i could not take part in that feast but went alone to my sleepingplace and drew the curtains my mother also was so overcome that she departed to her own chamber alone i sat upon my bed and listened to the sounds of that marriage feast which more resembled such a one as is given at funerals when it was finished i heard my father and ragnar and the head men and chiefs of the company take counsel together after which all departed to their homes  so soon as they were gone freydisa came to me bringing food and drink  i am a shamed man freydisa i said and can no longer stay in this land where i have been made one for children to mock at  it is not you who are shamed answered freydisa hotly it is steinar and that and she used a harsh word of iduna oh i saw it coming and yet i dared not warn you i feared lest i might be wrong and put doubts into your heart against your fosterbrother and your wife without cause may odin destroy them both  speak not so roughly freydisa i said ragnar was right about iduna her beauty never blinded him as it did me and he read her truly well she did but follow her nature and as for steinar she fooled him as she has the power to do by any man save ragnar doubtless he will repent bitterly ere all is done also i think that necklace from the grave is an evil magic  it is like you olaf to find excuse even for sin that cannot be forgiven not but what i hold with you that steinar has been led away against his will for i read it in his face well his life must pay the price of it for surely he shall bleed on odins altar now be a man come out and face your trouble you are not the first that a woman has fooled nor will you be the last forget love and dream of vengeance  i cannot forget love and i do not wish for vengeance especially against steinar who is my fosterbrother i answered wearily    chapter v  the battle on the sea  on the morrow thorvald my father sent messengers to the head men of agger telling them of all that he and his house had suffered at the hands of steinar whereof those of their folk who had been present at the feast could bear witness he added that if they stood by steinar in his wickedness and treachery thenceforward he and the men of the north would be their foes and work them mischief by land and sea  in due course these messengers returned with the tale that the head men of agger had met together and deposed steinar from his lordship over them electing another man a nephew of steinars father also they sent a present of gold rings in atonement for the wrong which had been done to the house of thorvald by one of their blood and prayed that thorvald and the northern men would bear them no ill will for that in which they were blameless  cheered by this answer which halved the number of their foes my father thorvald of aar and those overmen of whom he was the highlord began to make their preparations to attack athalbrand on his island of lesso of all these things athalbrand learned by his spies and later when the warships were being prepared and manned two messengers came from him old men of repute and demanded to see my father this was the substance of his message which was delivered in my hearing  that he athalbrand was little to blame for what had happened which was due to the mad passions of two young people who had blinded and misled him that no marriage had taken place between steinar and his daughter iduna as he was prepared and able to prove since he had refused to allow any such marriage that therefore he was ready to outlaw steinar who only dwelt with him as an unwelcome guest and to return his daughter iduna to me olaf and with her a fine in gold rings as compensation for the wrong done of which the amount was to be ascertained by judges to be agreed upon  my father entertained the messengers but would give them no answer till he had summoned a council of the underlords who stood with him in this business at that council where i was present some said that the insult could only be washed out with blood at length i was called upon to speak as the man most concerned while all listened i rose and said  these are my words after what has chanced not for all the wealth in denmark would i take iduna the fair to be my wife let her stay with steinar whom she has chosen still i do not wish to cause the blood of innocent men to be spent because of my private wrong neither do i wish to wreak vengeance upon steinar who for many years was my brother and who has been led away by a woman as may chance to any one of us and has chanced to many therefore i say that my father should accept athalbrands fine in satisfaction of the insult to our house and let all this matter be forgotten as for myself i purpose to leave my home where i have been put to shame and to seek my fortune in other lands  now the most of those present thought this a wise saying and were ready to abide by it yet unluckily enough it was made of no account by what had slipped from my lips at its end although many held me strange and fey all men loved me because i had a kind heart and gentleness also because of the wrongs that i had suffered and for something which they saw in me which they believed would one day make of me a great skald and a wise leader when she heard me announce thus publicly that i was determined to leave them thora my mother whispered in the ears of thorvald my father and ragnar and others also said to each other that this might not be it was ragnar the headlong who sprang up and spoke the first  is my brother to be driven from us and his home like a thrall caught in theft because a traitor and a false woman have put him to shame he said i say that i ask athalbrands blood to wash away that stain not his gold and that if need be i will seek it alone and die upon his spears also i say that if olaf my brother turns his back upon this vengeance i name him niddering  no man shall name me that i said flushing and least of all ragnar  so amidst shouts for there had been long peace in the land and all the fighting men sighed for battle it was agreed that war should be declared on athalbrand those present pledging themselves and their dependents to follow it to the end  go back to the trothbreaker athalbrand said my father to the messengers tell him that we will not accept his fine of gold who come to take all his wealth and with it his land and his life tell him also that the young lord olaf refuses his daughter iduna since it has not been the fashion of our house to wed with drabs tell steinar the womanthief that he would do well to slay himself or to be sure that he is killed in battle since if we take him living he shall be cast into a pit of vipers or sacrificed to odin the god of honour begone  we go answered the spokesman of the messengers yet before we go thorvald we would say to you that you and your folk are mad some wrong has been done to your son though perhaps not so much as you may think for that wrong full atonement has been offered and with it the hand of friendship on which you spit know then that the mighty lord athalbrand does not fear war since for every man you can gather he numbers two all pledged to him until the death also he has consulted the oracle and its answer is that if you fight with him but one of your house will be left living  begone thundered my father lest presently you should stay here dead  so they went    that day my heart was very heavy and i sought freydisa to take counsel with her  trouble hovers over me like a croaking raven i said i do not like this war for a woman who is worth nothing although she has hurt me sorely i fear the future that it may prove even worse than the past has been  then come to learn it olaf for what is known need no more be feared  i am not so sure of that i said but how can the future be learned  through the voice of the god olaf am i not one of odins virgins who know something of the mysteries yonder in his temple mayhap he will speak through me if you dare to listen  aye i dare i should like to hear the god speak true words or false  then come and hear them olaf  so we went up to the temple and freydisa who had the right of entry unlocked its door we passed in and lit a lamp in front of the seated wooden image of odin that for unnumbered generations had rested there behind the altar i stood by the altar and freydisa crouched herself before the image her forehead laid upon its feet and muttered runes after a while she grew silent and fear took hold of me the place was large and the feeble light of the lamp scarcely reached to the arched roof all about me were great formless shadows i felt that there were two worlds one of the flesh and one of the spirit and that i stood between the two freydisa seemed to go to sleep i could no longer hear her breathing then she sighed heavily and turned her head and by the light of the lamp i noted that her face was white and ghastly  what do you seek her lips asked for i saw them moving yet the voice that issued from them was not her own voice but that of a deepthroated man who spoke with a strange accent  next came the answer in the voice of freydisa  i your virgin seek to know the fate of him who stands by the altar one whom i love  for a while there was quiet then the first voice spoke still through the lips of freydisa of this i was sure for those of the statue remained immovable it was what it had always beena thing of wood  olaf the son of thorvald said the deep voice is an enemy of us the gods as was his forefather whose grave he robbed as his forefathers fate was so shall his be for in both of them dwells the same spirit he shall worship that which is upon the hilt of the sword he stole from the dead and in this sign shall conquer since it prevails against us and makes our curse of none effect great sorrow shall he taste and great joy he shall throw away a sceptre for a womans kiss and yet gain a greater sceptre olaf whom we curse shall be olaf the blessed yet in the end shall we prevail against his flesh and that of those who cling to him preaching that which is upon the sword but not with the sword among whom thou shalt be numbered womanthou and another who hast done him wrong  the voice died away and was followed by a silence so deep that at length i could bear it no more  ask of the war i said and of what shall happen  it is too late answered the voice of freydisa i sought to know of you olaf and you alone and now the spirit has left me  then came another long silence after which freydisa sighed thrice and awoke we went out of the temple i bearing the lamp and she resting on my arm near the door i turned and looked back and it seemed to me that the image of the god glared upon me wrathfully  what has chanced asked freydisa when we stood beneath the light of the friendly stars i know nothing my mind is a blackness  i told her word for word when i had finished she said  give me the wanderers sword  i gave it to her and she held it against the sky by the naked blade  the hilt is a cross she said but how can a man worship a cross and preach it and conquer thereby i cannot interpret this rede yet i do not doubt but that it shall all come true and that you olaf and i are doomed to be joined in the same fate whatever it may be and with us some other who has wronged you steinar perchance or iduna herself well of this at least i am glad for if i have loved the father i think that i love the son still more though otherwise and leaning forward she kissed me solemnly upon the brow    after freydisa and i had sought the oracle of odin three long ships of war sailed by the light of the moon from fladstrand for athalbrands isle of lesso i do not know when we sailed but in my mind i can still see those ships creeping out to sea in command of the first was thorvald my father of the second ragnar my brother and of the third myself olaf and on each of these ships were fifty men all of them stout fighters  the parting with thora my mother had been sad for her heart foreboded ill of this war and her face could not hide what her heart told her indeed she wept bitterly and cursed the name of iduna the fair who had brought this trouble on her house freydisa was sad also yet watching her opportunity she glided up to me just before i embarked and whispered to me  be of good cheer for you will return whoever is left behind  it will give me little comfort to return if certain others are left behind i answered oh that the folk had hearkened to me and made peace  too late to talk of that now said freydisa and we parted  this was our plan to sail for lesso by the moonlight and when the moon went down to creep silently towards the shores of the island then just at the first break of dawn we proposed to beach the ships on a sandy strand we knew and rush to attack athalbrands hall which we hoped to carry before men were well awake it was a bold scheme and one full of dangers yet we trusted that its very boldness would cause it to succeed especially as we had put it about that owing to the unreadiness of our ships no attack would be made until the coming of the next moon  doubtless all might have gone well with us but for a strange chance as it happened athalbrand a brave and skilful captain who from his youth had seen much war by sea and land had a design of his own which brought ours to nothing it was that he and his people should sail to fladstrand burn the ships of thorvald my father that he knew were fitting out upon the beach which he hoped to find unguarded or at most only watched by a few men and then return to lesso before he could be fallen upon by ill luck he had chosen this very night for his enterprise so it came about that just as the moon was sinking our watchmen caught sight of four other ships which by the shields that hung over their bulwarks they knew must be vessels of war gliding towards them over the quiet sea  athalbrand comes to meet us cried one and in a minute every man was looking to his arms there was no time for plans since in that low light and mist the vessels were almost bow to bow before we saw each other my fathers ship ran in between two of athalbrands that were sailing abreast while mine and that of ragnar found themselves almost alongside of the others on both sides the sails were let down for none had any thought of flight some rushed to the oars and got enough of them out to work the ships others ran to the grappling irons and the rest began to shoot with their bows before one could count two hundred from the time of sighting the war cry of valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla broke upon the silence of the night and the battle had begun  it was a very fierce battle and one that the gathering darkness made more grim each ship fought without heed to the others for as the fray went on they drifted apart grappled to their foes my father thorvalds vessel fared the worst since it had an enemy on either bulwark he boarded one and cleared it losing many men then the crew of the other rushed on to him as he regained his own ship the end of it was that my father and all his folk were killed but only after they had slain the most of their foes for they died fighting very bravely  between ragnars ship and that of athalbrand himself the fray was more even ragnar boarded athalbrand and was driven back athalbrand boarded ragnar and was driven back then for the second time ragnar boarded athalbrand with those men who were left to him in the narrow waist of athalbrands ship a mighty battle was fought and here at last ragnar and athalbrand found themselves face to face  they hacked at each other with their axes till at length ragnar with a fearful blow drove in athalbrands helmet and clove his skull in two so that he died but even as he fell a man it may have been friend or foe for the moon was sinking and the darkness grew dense thrust a spear into ragnars back and he was carried dying to his own vessel by those who remained to him  then that fight ceased for all athalbrands people were dead or wounded to the death meanwhile on the right i was fighting the ship that was commanded by steinar for it was fated that we two should be thrown together here also the struggle was desperate steinar and his company boarded at the prow but i and my men charging up both boards drove them back again in that charge it is true that i olaf fighting madly as was my wont when roused killed three of the lesso folk with the wanderers sword still i see them falling one by one followed by six of my people i sprang on to the raised prow of steinars ship just then the grapnels parted and there we were left defending ourselves as best we could my mates got their oars and once more brought our boat alongside grapple they could not because the irons were lost therefore in obedience to the order which i shouted to them from the high prow of the enemys ship they began to hurl their ballast stones into her and thus stove out her bottom so that in the end she filled and sank  even while she was down the fray went on nearly all my people were down indeed but two remained to me when steinar not knowing who i was rushed up and having lost his sword gripped me round the middle we wrestled but steinar who was the stronger forced me back to the bulwarks and so overboard into the sea we went together just as the ship sank drawing us down after her when we rose steinar was senseless but still clinging to me as i caught a rope that was thrown to me with my right hand to which the wanderers sword was hanging by a leathern loop  the end of it was that i and the senseless steinar were both drawn back to my own ship just as the darkness closed in    an hour later came the dawn showing a sad sight my father thorvalds ship and one of athalbrands lay helpless for all or nearly all their crews were dead while the other had drifted off and was now half a mile away  ragnars ship was still grappled to its foe my own was perhaps in the best case for here over twenty men were left unhurt and another ten whose wounds were light the rest were dead or dying  i sat on a bench in the waist of the ship and at my feet lay the man who had been dragged from the sea with me i thought that this man was dead till the first red rays of dawn lit upon his face whereon he sat up and i saw that he was steinar  thus we meet again my brother i said in a quiet voice well steinar look upon your work and i pointed to the dead and dying and to the ships around whence came the sound of groans  steinar stared at me and asked in a thick voice  was it with you olaf that i fell into the sea  even so steinar  i knew it not in the darkness olaf if i had known never would i have lifted sword against you  what did that matter steinar when you had already pierced my heart though not with a sword  at these words steinar moaned aloud then said  for the second time you have saved my life  aye steinar but who knows whether i can do so for a third time yet take comfort for if i may i will for thus shall i be best avenged  a white vengeance said steinar oh this is not to be borne and drawing a knife he wore at his girdle he strove to kill himself  but i who was watching snatched it away then gave an order  bind this man and keep him safe also bring him drink and a cloak to cover him  best kill the dog grumbled the captain to whom i spoke  i kill that one who lays a finger on him i replied  someone whispered into the captains ear whereon he nodded and laughed savagely  ah he exclaimed i am a thickhead i had forgotten odin and his sacrifice yes yes well keep the traitor safe  so they bound steinar to one of the benches and gave him ale and covered him with a bloodstained cloak taken from a dead man  i also drank of the ale and drew a cloak about me for the air was keen then i said  let us go to the other ships and see what has chanced there  they got out the oars and rowed to ragnars vessel where we saw men stirring  how went it with you i asked of one who stood upon the prow  not so ill olaf he answered we won and but now with the new light have finished the game they are all quiet yonder he added nodding at the vessel of athalbrand to which they were still grappled  where is ragnar i asked  come on board and see answered the man  a plank was thrust out and i ran across it fear gripping at my heart resting against the mast sat ragnar dying  good morrow to you olaf he gasped i am glad you live that there may be one left to sit at aar  what do you mean my brother  i mean olaf that our father thorvald is dead they called it to us from yonder and he pointed with his red sword to our fathers ship that lay side by side with one of athalbrands athalbrand is dead for i slew him and ere the sun is well clear of the sea i also shall be dead oh weep not olaf we have won a great fight and i travel to valhalla with a glorious company of friends and foes there to await you i say that had i lived to be old never could i have found a better death who then at last might have died like a cow get the ships to fladstrand olaf and gather more men to put all lesso to the sword give us good burial olaf and build a great mound over us that we may stand thereon at moonrise and mock the men of lesso as they row past till valhalla is full and the world dies is steinar dead tell me that steinar is dead for then ill speak with him presently  no ragnar i have taken steinar captive  captive why captive oh i understand that he may lie on odins altar friends swear to me that steinar shall lie on odins altar steinar the bridethief seiner the traitor swear it for i do not trust this brother of mine who has womans milk in his breasts by thor he might spare him if he had his way swear it or ill haunt your beds o nights and bring the other heroes with me swift now while my ears are open  then from both ships rose the cry of  we swear fear not ragnar we swear  thats well said ragnar kiss me now olaf oh what is it that i see in your eyes a new light a strange light olaf you are not one of us this time is not your time nor this place your place you travel to the end by another road well who knows at that end we may meet again at least i love you  then he burst into a wild war song of blood and vengeance and so singing sank down and died    afterwards with much labour i and the men who were left roped together our vessels and to them those that we had captured and when a favouring wind arose sailed back for fladstrand here a multitude awaited us for a fishingboat had brought tidings of the great sea battle of the hundred and fifty men who had sailed in my father thorvalds ships sixty were dead and many others wounded some of them to death athalbrands people had fared even worse since those of thorvald had slain their wounded only one of his vessels having escaped back to lesso there to tell the people of that island and iduna all that had happened now it was a land of widows and orphans so that no man need go wooing there for long and of aar and the country round the same song was sung indeed for generations the folk of those parts must have told of the battle of lesso when the chiefs thorvald and athalbrand slew each other upon the seas at night because of a quarrel about a woman who was known as iduna the fair  on the sands of fladstrand my mother the lady thora waited with the others for she had moved thither before the sailing of the ships when mine the first of them was beached i leapt from it and running to her knelt down and kissed her hand  i see you my son olaf she said but where are your father and brother  yonder mother i answered pointing to the ships and could say no more  then why do they tarry my son  alas mother because they sleep and will never wake again  now thora wailed aloud and fell down senseless three days later she died for her heart which was weak could not bear this woe once only did she speak before she died and then it was to bless me and pray that we might meet again and to curse iduna folk noted that of steinar she said nothing either good or ill although she knew that he lived and was a prisoner  thus it came about that i olaf was left alone in the world and inherited the lordship of aar and its subject lands no one remained save my darkbrowed uncle leif the priest of odin freydisa the wise woman my nurse and steinar my captive fosterbrother who had been the cause of all this war  the dying words of ragnar had been noised abroad the priest of odin had laid them before the oracle of the gods and this oracle declared that they must be fulfilled without change  so all the folk of that land met together at my biddingyes even the women and the children first we laid the dead in the largest of athalbrands ships his people and athalbrand himself being set undermost then on them we set the dead of thorvald thorvald my father and his son ragnar my brother bound to the mast upon their feet this done with great labour we dragged the ship on to high ground and above it built a mighty mound of earth for twenty days we toiled at the task till at last it was finished and the dead were hidden beneath it for ever then we separated to our homes and mourned a while  but steinar was carried to the temple of odin at aar and there kept in the prison of the temple    chapter vi  how olaf fought with odin  it was the eve of the spring feast of odin it comes back to me that at this feast it was the custom to sacrifice some beast to odin and to lay flowers and other offerings upon the altars of certain other gods that they might be pleased to grant a fruitful season on this day however the sacrifice was to be of no beast but of a mansteinar the traitor  that night i olaf by the help of freydisa the priestess of the god won entrance to the dungeon where steinar lay awaiting his doom this was not easy to do indeed i remember that it was only after i had sworn a great oath to leif and the other priests that i would attempt no rescue of the victim nor aid him to escape from his prison that i was admitted there while armed men stood without to see that i did not break my word for my love of steinar was known and in this matter none trusted me  that dungeon was a dreadful place i see it now in the floor of the temple was a trapdoor which when lifted revealed a flight of steps at the foot of these steps was another massive door of oak bolted and barred it was opened and closed behind me who found myself in a darksome den built of rough stone to which air came only through an opening in the roof so small that not even a child could pass it in the far corner of this hole bound to the wall by an iron chain fastened round his middle steinar lay upon a bed of rushes while on a stool beside him stood food and water when i entered bearing a lamp steinar sat up blinking his eyes for the light feeble as it was hurt them and i saw that his face was white and drawn and the hand he held to shade his eyes was wasted i looked at him and my heart swelled with pity so that i could not speak  why have you come here olaf asked steinar when he knew me is it to take my life if so never were you more welcome  no steinar it is to bid you farewell since tomorrow at the feast you die and i am helpless to save you in all things else men will obey me but not in this  and would you save me if you could  aye steinar why not surely you must suffer enough with so much blood and evil on your hands  yes i suffer enough olaf so much that i shall be glad to die but if you are not come to kill me then it is that you may scourge me with your tongue  not so steinar it is as i have said only to bid you farewell and to ask you a question if it pleases you to answer me why did you do this thing which has brought about such misery and loss which has sent my father my brother and a host of brave men to the grave and with them my mother whose breasts nursed you  is she dead also olaf oh my cup is full he hid his eyes in his thin hands and sobbed then went on why did i do it olaf i did not do it but some spirit that entered into me and made me madmad for the lips of iduna the fair olaf i would speak no ill of her since her sin is mine but yet it is true that when i hung back she drew me on nor could i find the strength to say her nay do you pray the gods olaf that no woman may ever draw you on to such shame as mine hearken now to the great reward that i have won i was never wed to iduna olaf athalbrand would not suffer it till he was sure of the matter of the lordship of agger then when he knew that this was gone from me he would suffer it still less and iduna herself seemed to grow cold in truth i believe he thought of killing me and sending my head as a present to your father thorvald but this iduna forbade whether because she loved me or for other reasons i cannot say olaf you know the rest  aye steinar i know the rest iduna is lost to me and for that perhaps i should thank you although such a thrust as this leaves the heart sore for life my father my mother my brotherall are lost to me and you too who were as my twin are about to be lost night has you all and with you a hundred other men because of the madness that was bred in you by the eyes of iduna the fair who also is lost to both of us steinar i do not blame you for i know yours was a madness which for their own ends the gods send upon men naming it love i forgive you steinar if i have aught to forgive and i tell you so weary am i of this world which i feel holds little that is good that if i might id yield up my life instead of yours and go to seek the others though i doubt whether i should find them since i think that our roads are different hark the priests call me steinar theres no need to bid you to be brave for who of our northern race is not thats our one heritage the courage of a bull yet it seems to me that there are other sorts of courage which we lack to tread the dark ways of death with eyes fixed on things gentler and better than we know pray to our gods steinar since they are the best we have to pray to though dark and bloody in their ways pray that we may meet again where priests and swords are not and women work no ruin where we may love as we once loved in childhood and there is no more sin fare you well my brother steinar yet not for ever for sure i am that here we did not begin and here we shall not end oh steinar steinar who could have dreamed that this would be the last of all our happy fellowship  when i had spoken such words as these to him i flung my arms about him and we embraced each other then that picture fades    it was the hour of sacrifice the victim lay bound upon the stone in the presence of the statue of the god but outside of the doors of the little temple that all who were gathered there might see the offering  the ceremonies were ended leif the head priest in his robe of office had prayed and drunk the cup before the god dedicating to him the blood that was about to fall and narrating in a chant the crimes for which it was offered up and all the tale of woe that these had brought about then in the midst of an utter silence he drew the sacrificial sword and held it to the lips of odin that the god might breathe upon it and make it holy  it would seem that the god did breathe at least that side of the sword which had been bright grew dull leif turned it to the people crying in the ancient words  odin takes who dare deny  all eyes were fixed upon him standing in his black robe and holding aloft the gleaming sword that had grown dull yes even the patient eyes of steinar bound upon the stone  then it was that some spirit stirred in my heart which drove me on to step between the priest and his prey standing in the doorway of the chapel a tall young shape against the gloom behind i said in a steady voice  i dare deny  a gasp of wonderment went up from all who heard and steinar lifting himself a little from the stone stared at me shook his head as if in dissent then let it fall again and listened  hearken friends i said this man my fosterbrother has committed a sin against me and my house my house is deadi alone remain and on behalf of the dead and of myself i forgive him his sin which indeed was less his than anothers is there any man among you who at some time has not been led aside by woman or who has not again and again desired to be so led aside if such a one there be let him say that he has no forgiveness in his heart for steinar the son of hakon let him come forward and say it  none stirred even the women drooped their heads and were silent  then if this is so i went on and you can forgive as i do how much more should a god forgive what is a god is he not one greater than man who must know all the weakness of man which for his own ends he has bred into the flesh of man how then can he do otherwise than be pitiful to what he has created if this be so how can the god refuse that which men are willing to grant and what sacrifice can please him better than the foregoing of his own vengeance would a god wish to be outdone by a man if i olaf the man can forgive who have been wronged how much more can odin the god forgive who has suffered no wrong save that of the breaking of those laws which will ever be broken by men who are as it has pleased him to fashion them on odins behalf therefore and speaking as he would speak could he have voice among us i demand that you set this victim free leaving it to his own heart to punish him  now some whom my simple words had touched i suppose because there was truth in them although in those days and in that land none understood such truths and others because they had known and loved the openhanded steinar who would have given the cloak from his back to the meanest of them cried  aye let him go free there has been enough of death through this iduna  but more stood silent lost in doubt at this new doctrine only leif my uncle did not stand silent his dark face began to work as though a devil possessed him as indeed i think one did his eyes rolled he champed his jaws like an angry hog and screamed  surely the lord olaf is mad for no sane man would talk thus man may forgive while it is within his power but this traitor has been dedicated to odin and can a god forgive can a god spare when his nostrils are opened for the smell of blood if so of what use is it to be a god how is he happier than a man if he must spare moreover would ye bring the curse of odin upon you all i say to yousteal his sacrifice and you yourselves shall be sacrificed you your wives your children aye and even your cattle and the fruit of your fields  when they heard this the people groaned and shouted out  let steinar die kill him kill him that odin may be fed  aye answered leif steinar shall die see he dies  then with a leap like to that of a hungry wolf he sprang upon the bound man and slew him  i see it now the rude temple the glaring statue of the god the gathered crowd open mouthed and eyed the spring sunshine shining quietly over all and running past the place a ewe calling to the lamb that it had lost i see the dying steinar turn his white face and smile a farewell to me with his fading eyes i see leif getting to his horrible rites that he might learn the omen and lastly i see the red sword of the wanderer appear suddenly between me and him and in my hand i think that my purpose was to cut him down only a thought arose within me  this priest was not to blame he did no more than he had been taught who taught him the god he served through whom he gained honour and livelihood so the god was to blame the god that drank the blood of men as a thrall drinks ale to satisfy his filthy appetite could such a monster be a god nay he must be a devil and why should free men serve devils at least i would not i would cast him off and let him avenge himself upon me if he could i olaf would match myself against this godor devil  i strode past leif and the altar to where the statue of odin sat within the temple  hearken i said in such a voice that all lifted their eyes from the scene of butchery to me you believe in odin do you not  they answered aye  then you believe that he can revenge himself upon one who rejects and affronts him  aye they answered again  if this be so i went on will you swear to leave the matter between odin and me olaf to be settled according to the law of single combat and give peace to the victor with promise from all harm save at the hands of his foe  aye they answered yet scarcely understanding what they said  good i cried now god odin i olaf a man challenge you to single combat strike you first you odin whom i name devil and wolf of the skies but no god strike you first bloody murderer and kill me if you can who await your stroke  then i folded my arms and stared at the statues stony eyes which stared back at me while all the people gasped  for a full minute i waited thus but all that happened was that a wren settled on the head of odin and twittered there then flew off to its nest in the thatch  now i cried you have had your turn and mine comes  i drew the wanderers sword and sprang at odin my first stroke sunk up to the hilt in his hollow belly my next cut the sceptre from his hand my thirda great onehewed the head from off him it came rattling down and out of it crawled a viper which reared itself up and hissed i set my heel upon the reptiles head and crushed it and slowly it writhed itself to death  now good folk i cried what say you of your god odin  they answered nothing for all of them were in flight yes even leif fled cursing me over his shoulder as he went  presently i was alone with the dead steinar and the shattered god and in that loneliness strange visions came to me for i felt that i had done a mighty deed one that made me happy round the wall of the temple crept a figure it was that of freydisa whose face was white and scared  you are a great man olaf she said but how will it end  i do not know i answered i have done what my heart told me neither more nor less and i bide the issue odin shall have his chance for here i stay till dark and then if i live i leave this land go get me all the gold that is mine from the hall and bring it here to me by moonrise and with it some garments and my armour bring me also my best horse  you leave this land she said that means that you leave me who love you to go forth as the wanderer wentfollowing a dream to the south well it is best that you should go for whatever they have promised you but now it is sure that the priests will kill you even if you escape the vengeance of the god and she looked askance at the shattered statue which had sat in its place for so many generations that none knew who had set it there or when  i have killed the god i answered pointing to the crushed viper  not quite olaf for see its tail still moves  then she went leaving me alone i sat myself down by the murdered steinar and stared at him could he be really dead i wondered or did he live on elsewhere my faith had taught me of a place called valhalla where brave men went but in that faith and its gods i believed no more this valhalla was but a childs tale invented by a bloodyminded folk who loved slaughter wherever steinar and the others were it was not in valhalla then perhaps they slept like the beasts do after these have been butchered perhaps death was the end of all it might be so and yet i did not believe it there were other gods besides odin and his company for what were those which we had found in the wanderers tomb i longed to know  yes i would go south as the wanderer went and search for them perhaps there in the south i should learn the secret truthand other things  i grew weary of these thoughts of gods who could not be found or who if found were but devils my mind went back to my childhoods days when steinar and i played together on the meads before any woman had come to wreck our lives i remembered how we used to play until we were weary and how at nights i would tell him tales that i had learned or woven until at length we sank to sleep our arms about each others necks my heart grew full of sorrow that in the end broke from my eyes in tears yes i wept over steinar my brother steinar and kissed his cold and gory lips  the evening gathered the twilight grew and one by one the stars sprang out in the quiet sky till the moon appeared and gathered all their radiance to herself i heard the sound of a womans dress and looked up thinking to see freydisa but this woman was not freydisa it was iduna yes idunas self  i rose to my feet and stood still she also stood still on the farther side of the stone of sacrifice whereon that which had been steinar was stretched between us then came a struggle of silence in which she won at last  have you come to save him i asked if so it is too late woman behold your work  she shook her beautiful head and answered almost in a whisper  nay olaf i am come to beg a boon of you that you will slay me here and now  am i a butcheror a priest i muttered  oh slay me slay me olaf she went on throwing herself upon her knees before me and rending open her blue robe that her young breast might take the sword thus perchance i who love life may pay some of the price of sin who if i slew myself would but multiply the debt which in truth i dare not do  still i shook my head and once more she spoke  olaf in this way or in that doubtless my end will find me for if you refuse this office there are others of sterner stuff the knife that smote steinar is not blunted yet before i die who am come here but to die i pray you hear the truth that my memory may be somewhat less vile to you in the after years olaf you think me the falsest of the false yet i am not altogether so hark you now at the time that steinar sought me some madness took him so soon as we were alone together his first words were i am bewitched i love you  olaf ill not deny that his worship stirred my blood for he was goodlywell and different to you with your dreaming eyes and thoughts that are too deep for me and yet by my breath i swear that i meant no harm when we rode together to the ship it was my purpose to return upon the morrow and be made your wife but there upon the ship my father compelled me it was his fancy that i should break with you and be wed to steinar who had become so great a lord and who pleased him better than you did olaf and as for steinarwhy have i not told you that he was mad for me  steinars tale was otherwise iduna he said that you went first and that he followed  were those his words olaf for if so how can i give the dead the lie and one who died through me it seems unholy yet in this matter steinar had no reason left to him and whether you believe me or no i tell the truth oh hear me out for who knows when they will come to take me who have walked into this nest of foes that i may be taken pray as i would the ship was run out and we sailed for lesso there in my fathers hall upon my knees i entreated him to hold his hand i told him what was true that of you twain it was you i loved not steinar i told him that if he forced this marriage war would come of it that might mean all our deaths but these things moved him nothing then i told him that such a deed of shame would mean the loss of steinars lordship so that by it he would gain no profit at last he listened for this touched him near you know the rest thorvald your father and ragnar who ever hated me pressed on the war despite all our offerings of peace so the ships met and hela had her fill  aye iduna whatever else is false this is true that hela had her fill  olaf i have but one thing more to say it is this only once did those dead lips touch mine and then it was against my will aye although it is shameful you must learn the truth my father held me olaf while i took the betrothal kiss because i must but as you know there was no marriage  aye i know that i said because steinar told me so  and save for that one kiss olaf i am still the maid whom once you loved so well  now i stared at her could this woman lie so blackly over dead steinars corpse when all was said and done was it not possible that she spoke the truth and that we had been but playthings in the hands of an evil fate save for some trifling error which might be forgiven to one who as she said loved the worship that was her beautys due what if she were innocent after all  perhaps my face showed the thoughts that were passing through my mind at the least she who knew me well found skill to read them she crept towards me still on her knees she cast her arms about me and resting her weight upon me drew herself to her feet  olaf she whispered i love you i love you well as i have always done though i may have erred a little as women wayward and still unwed are apt to do olaf they told me yonder how you had matched yourself against the god with his priests for judges and smitten him and i thought this the greatest deed that ever i have known i used to think you something of a weakling olaf not in your body but in your mind one lost in music and in runes who feared to put things to the touch of war but you have shown me otherwise you slew the bear you overcame steinar who was so much stronger than you are in the battle of the ships and now you have bearded odin the allfather look his head lies there hewn off by you for the sake of one who after all had done you wrong olaf such a deed as that touches a womans heart and he who does it is the man she would wish to lie upon her breast and be her lord olaf all this evil past may yet be forgotten we might go and live elsewhere for awhile or always for with your wisdom and my beauty joined together what could we not conquer olaf i love you now as i have never loved before cannot you love me again  her arms clung about me her beautiful blue eyes shimmering with moonlit tears held my eyes and my heart melted beneath her breath as winter snows melt in the winds of spring she saw she understood she cast herself upon me shaking her long hair over both of us and seeking my lips almost she had found them when feeling something hard between me and her something that hurt me i looked down her cloak had slipped or been thrown aside and my eye caught the glint of gold and jewels in an instant i rememberedthe wanderers necklace and the dreamand with those memories my heart froze again  nay iduna i said i loved you well theres no man will ever love you more and you are very fair whether you speak true words or false i do not know it is between you and your own spirit but this i do know that betwixt us runs the river of steinars blood aye and the blood of thorvald my father of thora my mother of ragnar my brother and of many another man who clung to us and that is a stream which i cannot cross find you another husband iduna the fair since never will i call you wife  she loosed her arms from round me and lifting them again unclasped the wanderers necklace from about her breast  this it is she said which has brought all these evils on me take it back again and when you find her give it to that one for whom it is meant that one whom you love truly as whatever you may have thought you never have loved me  then she sank upon the ground and resting her golden head upon dead steinars breast she wept    i think it was then that freydisa returned at least i recall her tall form standing near the stone of sacrifice gazing at us both a strange smile on her face  have you withstood she said then truly you are in the way of victory and have less to fear from woman than i thought all things are ready as you commanded my lord olaf and there remains but to say farewell which you had best do quickly for they plot your death yonder  freydisa i answered i go but perchance i shall return again meanwhile all i have is yours with this charge guard you yonder woman and see her safe to her home or wherever she would go and to steinar here give honourable burial    then the darkness of oblivion falls and i remember no more save the white face of iduna her brow stained with steinars lifeblood watching me as i went     book ii  byzantium    chapter i  irene empress of the earth  a gulf of blackness and the curtain lifts again upon a very different olaf from the young northern lord who parted from iduna at the place of sacrifice at aar  i see myself standing upon a terrace that overlooks a stretch of quiet water which i now know was the bosphorus behind me are a great palace and the lights of a vast city in front upon the sea and upon the farther shore are other lights the moon shines bright above me and having naught else to do i study my reflection in my own burnished shield it shows a man of early middle life he may be thirty or fiveandthirty years of age the same olaf yet much changed for now my frame is tall and wellknit though still somewhat slender my face is bronzed by southern suns i wear a short beard there is a scar across my cheek got in some battle my eyes are quiet and have lost the first liveliness of youth i know that i am the captain of the northern guard of the empress irene widow of the dead emperor leo the fourth and joint ruler of the eastern empire with her young son constantine the sixth of that name  how i came to fill this place however i do not know the story of my journey from jutland to byzantium is lost to me doubtless it must have taken years and after these more years of humble service before i rose to be the captain of irenes northern guard that she kept ever about her person because she would not trust her grecian soldiers  my armour was very rich yet i noted about myself two things that were with me in my youth one was the necklace of golden shells divided from each other by beetles of emeralds that i had taken from the wanderers grave at aar and the other the crosshilted bronze sword with which this same wanderer had been girded in his grave i know now that because of this weapon which was of a metal and shape strange to that land i had the byname of olaf redsword and i know also that none wished to feel the weight of this same ancient blade  when i had finished looking at myself in the shield i leaned upon the parapet staring at the sea and wondering how the plains of aar looked that night beneath this selfsame moon and whether freydisa were dead by now and whom iduna had married and if she ever thought of me or if steinar came to haunt her sleep  so i mused till presently i felt a light touch upon my shoulder and swung round to find myself face to face with the empress irene herself  augusta i said saluting for as empress that was her roman title even though she was a greek  you guard me well friend olaf she said with a little laugh why any enemy and christ knows i have plenty could have cut you down before ever you knew that he was there  not so augusta i answered for i could speak their greek tongue well since at the end of the terrace the guards stand night and day men of my own blood who can be trusted nothing which does not fly could gain this place save through your own chambers that are also guarded it is not usual for any watch to be set here still i came myself in case the empress might need me  that is kind of you my captain olaf and i think i do need you at least i cannot sleep in this heat and i am weary of the thoughts of state for many matters trouble me just now come change my mind if you can for if so ill thank you tell me of yourself when you were young why did you leave your northern home where ive heard you were a barbarian chief and wander hither to byzantium  because of a woman i answered  ah she said clapping her hands i knew it tell me of this woman whom you love  the story is short augusta she bewitched my fosterbrother and caused him to be sacrificed to the northern gods as a trothbreaker and i do not love her  youd not admit it if you did olaf was she beautiful well say as i am  i turned and looked at the empress studying her from head to foot she was shorter than iduna by some inches also older and therefore of a thicker build but being a fair greek her colour was much the same save that the eyes were darker the mouth too was more hard for the rest she was a royallooking and lovely woman in the flower of her age and splendidly attired in robes broidered with gold over which she wore long strings of rounded pearls her rippling golden hair was dressed in the old greek fashion tied in a simple knot behind her head and over it was thrown a light veil worked with golden stars  well captain olaf she said have you finished weighing my poor looks against those of this northern girl in the scales of your judgment if so which of us tips the beam  iduna was more beautiful than ever you can have been augusta i replied quietly  she stared at me till her eyes grew quite round then puckered up her mouth as though to say something furious and finally burst out laughing  by every saint in byzantium she said or rather by their relics for of live ones there are none you are the strangest man whom i have known are you weary of life that you dare to say such a thing to me the empress irene  am i weary of life well augusta on the whole i think i am it seems to me that death and after it may interest us more for the rest you asked me a question and after the fashion of my people i answered it as truthfully as i could  by my head you have said it again she exclaimed have you not heard most innocent northman that there are truths which should not be mentioned and much less repeated  i have heard many things in byzantium augusta but i pay no attention to any of themor indeed to little except my duty  now that this thiswhats the girls name  iduna the fair i said  this iduna has thrown you over at which i am sure i do not wonder what mistresses have you in byzantium olaf the dane  none at all i answered women are pleasant but one may buy sweets too dear and all that ever i saw put together were not worth my brother steinar who lost his life through one of them  tell me captain olaf are you a secret member of this new society of hermits of which they talk so much who if they see a woman must hold their faces in the sand for five minutes afterwards  i never heard of them augusta  are you a christian  no i am considering that religionor rather its followers  are you a pagan then  no i fought a duel with the god odin and cut his head off with this sword and that is why i left the north where they worship odin  then what are you she said stamping her foot in exasperation  i am the captain of your imperial majestys private guard a little of a philosopher and a fair poet in my own language not in greek also i can play the harp  you say not in greek for fear lest i should ask you to write verses to me which indeed i shall never do olaf a soldier a poet a philosopher a harpist one who has renounced women now why have you renounced women which is unnatural in a man who is not a monk it must be because you still love this iduna and hope to get her some day  i shook my head and answered  i might have done that long ago augusta  then it must be because there is some other woman whom you wish to gain why do you always wear that strange necklace she added sharply did it belong to this savage girl iduna as from the look of it it might well have done  not so augusta she took it for a while and it brought sorrow on her as it will do on all women save one who may or may not live today  give it me i have taken a fancy to it it is unusual oh fear not you shall receive its value  if you wish the necklace augusta you must take the head as well and my counsel to you is that you do neither since they will bring you no good luck  in truth captain olaf you anger me with your riddles what do you mean about this necklace  i mean augusta that i took it from a very ancient grave  that i can believe for the jeweller who made it worked in old egypt she interrupted  and thereafter i dreamed a dream i went on of the woman who wears the other half of it i have not seen her yet but when i do i shall know her at once  so she exclaimed did i not tell you that east or west or north or south there is some other woman  there was once augusta quite a thousand years ago or more and there may be again now or a thousand years hence that is what i am trying to find out you say the work is egyptian augusta at your convenience will you be pleased to make another captain in my place i would visit egypt  if you leave byzantium without express permission under my own handnot the emperors or anybody elses hand mine i sayand are caught your eyes shall be put out as a deserter she said savagely  as the augusta pleases i answered saluting  olaf she went on in a more gentle voice you are clearly mad but to tell truth you are also a madman who pleases me since i weary of the rogues and lickspittles who call themselves sane in byzantium why theres not a man in all the city who would dare to speak to me as you have spoken tonight and like that breeze from the sea it is refreshing lend me that necklace olaf till tomorrow morning i want to examine it in the lamplight and i swear to you that i will not take it from you or play you any tricks about it  will you promise not to wear it augusta  of course is it likely that i should wish to wear it on my bare breast after it has been rubbing against your soiled armour  without another word i unhooked the necklace and handed it to her she ran to a little distance and with one of those swift movements that were common to her fastened it about her own neck then she returned and threw the great strings of pearls which she had removed to make place for it over my head  now have you found the woman of that dream olaf she asked turning herself about in the moonlight  i shook my head and answered  nay augusta but i fear that you have found misfortune when it comes i pray you to remember that you promised not to wear the necklace also that your soldier olaf thorvalds son would have given his life rather than that you should have done so not for the sake of any dream but for your sake augusta whom it is his business to protect  would then it were your business either to protect me a little more or a little less she exclaimed bitterly  having uttered this dark saying she vanished from the terrace still wearing the string of golden shells    on the following morning the necklace was returned to me by irenes favourite lady who smiled as she gave it to me she was a darkeyed witty and able girl named martina who had been my friend for a long while  the augusta said that you were to examine this jewel to see that it has not been changed  i never suggested that the augusta was a thief i replied therefore it is unnecessary  she said also that i was to tell you in case you should think that it has been befouled by her wearing of it that she has had it carefully cleaned  that is thoughtful of her martina for it needed washing now will you take the augustas pearls which she left with me in error  i have no orders to take any pearls captain olaf although i did notice that two of the finest strings in the empire are missing oh you great northern child she added in a whisper keep the pearls they are a gift and worth a princes ransom and take whatever else you can get and keep that too        i have no further vision concerning these priceless      pearls and do not know what became of them perhaps i was      robbed of them during my imprisonment or perhaps i gave      them to heliodore or to martina where are they now i      wondereditor  then before i could answer her she was gone    for some weeks after this i saw no more of the augusta who appeared to avoid me one day however i was summoned to her presence in her private apartments by the waitinglady martina and went to find her alone save for martina the first thing that i noticed was that she wore about her neck an exact copy of the necklace of golden shells and emerald beetles further that about her waist was a girdle and on her wrist a bracelet of similar design pretending to see nothing i saluted and stood to attention  captain she began yonderand she waved her hand towards the city so that i could not fail to see the shell braceletthe uncles of my son the emperor lie in prison have you heard of the matter and if so what have you heard  i have heard augusta that the emperor having been defeated by the bulgarians some of the legions proposed to set his uncle nicephorushe who has been made a priestupon the throne i have heard further that thereon the emperor caused the cæsar nicephorus to be blinded and the tongues of the two other cæsars and of their two brothers the nobilissimi to be slit  do you think well of such a deed olaf  augusta i answered in this city i make it my business not to think for if i did i should certainly go mad  still on this matter i command you to think and to speak the truth of your thoughts no harm shall come to you whatever they may be  augusta i obey you i think that whoever did this wicked thing must be a devil either returned from that hell of which everyone is so fond of talking here or on the road thither  oh you think that do you so i was right when i told martina that there was only one honest opinion to be had in constantinople and i knew where to get it well most severe and indignant judge suppose i tell you it was i who commanded that this deed should be done then would you change your judgment  not so augusta i should only think much worse of you than ever i did before if these great persons were traitors to the state they should have been executed but to torment them to take away the sight of heaven and to bring them to the level of dumb beasts all that their actual blood may not be on the tormentors handwhy the act is vile so at least it would be held in those northern lands which you are pleased to call barbarian  now irene sprang from her seat and clapped her hands for joy  you hear what he says martina and the emperor shall hear it too aye and so shall my ministers stauracius and aetius who supported him in this matter i alone withstood him i prayed him for his souls sake to be merciful he answered that he would no longer be governed by a woman that he knew how to safeguard his empire and what conscience should allow and what refuse so in spite of all my tears and prayers the vile deed was done as i think for no good cause well it cannot be undone yet olaf i fear that it may be added to and that these royalborn men may be foully murdered therefore i put you in charge of the prison where they lie here is the signed order take with you what men you may think needful and hold that place even should the emperor himself command you to open see also that the prisoners within are cared for and have all they need but do not suffer them to escape  i saluted and turned to go when irene called me back  at that moment too in obedience to some sign which she made martina left the chamber looking at me oddly as she did so i came and stood before the empress who i noted seemed somewhat troubled for her breast heaved and her gaze was fixed upon the floor now it was of mosaic and represented a heathen goddess talking to a young man who stood before her with his arms folded the goddess was angry with the man and held in her left hand a dagger as though she would stab him although her right arm was stretched out to embrace him and her attitude was one of pleading  irene lifted her head and i saw that her fine eyes were filled with tears  olaf she said i am in much trouble and i know not where to find a friend  i smiled and answered  need an empress seek far for friends  aye olaf farther than anyone who breathes an empress can find flatterers and partisans but not a single friend such love her only for what she can give them but if fortune went against her i say that they would fall away like leaves from a tree in a winter frost so that she stood naked to every bitter blast of heaven yes and then would come the foe and root up that tree and burn it to give them warmth and to celebrate their triumph so i think olaf it will be with me before all is done even my son hates me olaf my only child for whose true welfare i strive night and day  i have heard as much augusta i said  you have heard like all the world but what else of ill have you heard of me olaf speak out man im here to learn the truth  i have heard that you are very ambitious augusta and that you hate your son as much as he hates you because he is a rival to your power it is rumoured that you would be glad if he were dead and you left to reign alone  then a lie is rumoured olaf yet it is true that i am ambitious who see far and would build this tottering empire up afresh olaf it is a bitter thing to have begotten a fool  then why do you not marry again and beget others who might be no fools augusta i asked bluntly  ah why she answered flashing a curious glance upon me in truth i do not quite know why but from no lack of suitors since were she but a hideous hag an empress would find these olaf you may have learned that i was not born in the purple i was but a greek girl of good race not even noble to whom god gave a gift of beauty and when i was young i saw a man who took my fancy also of old race yet but a merchant of fruits which they grow in greece and sell here and at rome i wished to marry him but my mother a farseeing woman said that such beauty as minethough less than that of your iduna the fair olafwas worth money or rank so they sent away my merchant of fruits who married the daughter of another merchant of fruits and throve very well in business he came to see me some years ago fat as a tub his face scored all over with the marks of the spotted sickness and we talked about old times i gave him a concession to import dried fruits into byzantiumthat is what he came to see me forand now hes dead well my mother was right for afterwards this poor beauty of mine took the fancy of the late emperor and being very pious he married me so the greek girl by the will of god became augusta and the first woman in the world  by the will of god i repeated  aye i suppose so or else all is raw chance at least i who today might have been bargaining over dried fruits as i should have done had i won my will amwhat you know look at this robe and she spread her glittering dress before me hark to the tramp of those guards before my door why you are their captain go into the antechambers and see the ambassadors waiting there in the hope of a word with the ruler of the earth look at my legions mustered on the drillinggrounds and understand how great the grecian girl has grown by virtue of the face which is less beauteous than that ofiduna the fair  i understand all this augusta i answered yet it would seem that you are not happy did you not tell me just now that you could not find a friend and that you had begotten a fool  happy olaf why i am wretched so wretched that often i think the hell of which the priests preach is here on earth and that i dwell in its hottest fires unless love hides it what happiness is there in this life of ours which must end in blackest death  love has its miseries also augusta that i know for once i loved  aye but then the love was not true for this is the greatest curse of allto love and not to be beloved for the sake of a perfect love if it could be wonwhy id sacrifice even my ambition  then you must keep your ambition augusta since in this world youll find nothing perfect  olaf im not so sure thoughts have come to me olaf i told you that i have no friend in all this glittering court will you be my friend  i am your honest servant augusta and i think that such a one is the best of friends  thats so and yet no man can be true friend to a woman unless he ismore than friend nature has writ it so  i do not understand i answered  you mean that you will not understand and perhaps you are wise why do you stare at that pavement theres a story written on it the old goddess of my people aphrodite loved a certain adonisso runs the fablebut he loved not her and thought only of his sports look she woos him there and he rejects her and in her rage she stabs him  not so i answered of the end of the story i know nothing but if she had meant to kill him the dagger would be in her right hand not in her left  thats true olaf and in the end it was fate which killed him not the goddess whom he had scorned and yet olaf it is not wise to scorn goddesses oh of what do i talk youll befriend me will you not  aye augusta to the last drop of my blood as is my duty do i not take your pay  then thus i seal our friendship and heres an earnest of the pay irene said slowly and bending forward she kissed me on the lips  at this moment the doors of the chamber were thrown open through them preceded by heralds that at once drew back again entered the great minister stauracius a fat oilyfaced man with a cunning eye who announced in a high thin voice  the ambassadors of the persians wait upon you augusta as you appointed at this hour    chapter ii  the blind cÆsar  irene turned upon the eunuch as a shelion turns upon some hunter that disturbs it from its prey noting the anger in her eyes he fell back and prostrated himself thereupon she spoke to me as though his entry had interrupted her words  those are the orders captain olaf see that you forget none of them even if this proud eunuch who dares to appear before me unannounced bids you to do so i shall hold you to account today i leave the city for a while for the baths whither i am sent you must not accompany me because of the duty i have laid upon you here when i return be sure ill summon you and knowing that stauracius could not see her from where he lay for a moment she let her splendid eyes meet my own in them there was a message i could not mistake  the augusta shall be obeyed i answered saluting may the augusta return in health and glory and more beautiful than  iduna the fair she broke in captain you are dismissed  again i saluted retreating from the presence backwards and staying to bow at each third step as was the custom the process was somewhat long and as i reached the door i heard her say to stauracius  hearken you dog if ever you dare to break in upon me thus again you shall lose two thingsyour office and your head what may i not give secret orders to my trusted officer and not be spied upon by you now cease your grovellings and lead in these persians as you have been bribed to do  passing through the silkclad bejewelled persians who waited in an antechamber with their slaves and gifts i gained the great terrace of the palace which looked upon the sea here i found martina leaning on the parapet  have you more of the augustas pearls about you olaf she asked mockingly speaking over her shoulder  not i martina i answered halting beside her  indeed i could have sworn otherwise for they are perfumed and i seemed to catch their odour when did you begin to use the royal scent upon that yellow beard of yours olaf if any of us women did so it would mean blows and exile but perchance a captain of the guard may be forgiven  i use no scents girl as you know well yet it is true that these rooms reek of them and they cling to armour  yes and still more to hair well what gift had my mistress for you today  a commission to guard certain prisoners martina  ah have you read it yet when you do i think youll find that it names you governor of the jail which is a high office carrying much pay and place you are in good favour olaf and i hope that when you come to greatness you will not forget martina it was i who put it into a certain mind to give you this commission as the only man that could be trusted in the court  i do not forget a friend martina i answered  that is your reputation olaf oh what a road is opening to your feet yet i doubt youll not walk it being too honest or if you do that it will lead younot to glory but a grave  mayhap martina and to speak truth a grave is the only quiet place in constantinople mayhap too it hides the only real glory  thats what we christians say it would be strange if you who are not a christian alone should believe and keep the saying oh she went on with passion we are but shams and liars whom god must hate well i go to make ready for this journey to the baths  how long do you stay there i asked  the course of waters takes a month less than that time does not serve to clear the augustas skin and restore her shape to the lines of youth which it begins to need though doubtless you do not think so you were named to come as her officer of the person but olaf this other business rose up of a new governor for the jail in which the cæsars and nobilissimi are confined i saw a chance for you in it who although you have served all these years have had no real advancement and mentioned your name at which the augusta leapt to tell the truth olaf i was not sure that you would wish to be captain of the guard at the baths was i right or was i wrong  i think you were right martina baths are idle places where folk drift into trouble and i follow duty martinamay i say it to youyou are a good woman and a kind i pray that those gods of yours whom you worship may bless you  you pray in vain olaf for that they will never do indeed i think that they have cursed me  then suddenly she burst into tears and turning went away  i too went away somewhat bewildered for much had happened to me that morning which i found it hard to understand why had the augusta kissed me i took it that this was some kind of imperial jest it was known that i kept aloof from women and she may have desired to see what i should do when an augusta kissed me and then to make a mock of me i had heard that she had done as much with others  well let that be since stauracius who always feared lest a new favourite should slip between him and power had settled the matter for me for which i blessed stauracius although at the moment being but a man i had cursed him and now why did martinathe little dark martina with the kind face and the watchful beady eyes like to those of a robin in our northern landsspeak as she had done and then burst into tears  a doubt struck me but i who was never vain pushed it aside i did not understand and of what use was it to try to interpret the meaning of the moods of women my business was war or at the moment the service that has to do with war not women wars had brought me to the rank i held though strangely enough of those wars i can recall nothing now they have vanished from my vision to wars also i looked to advance me in the future who was no courtier but a soldier whom circumstances had brought to court well thanks to martina as she said or to some caprice of the empress i had a new commission that was of more worth to me than her random kisses and i would go to read it  read it i did in the little private room upon the palace wall which was mine as captain of the augustas guard though being written in greek i found this difficult martina had spoken truly i was made the governor of the state prison with all authority including that of life and death should emergency arise moreover this governorship gave me the rank of a general with a generals pay also such pickings as i chose to take in short from captain of the guard suddenly i had become a great man in constantinople one with whom even stauracius and others like him would have to reckon especially as his signature appeared upon the commission beneath that of the empress  whilst i was wondering what i should do next a trumpet blew upon the ramparts and a northman of my company entered saluted and said that i was summoned i went out and there before me stood a dazzling band that bowed humbly to me whom yesterday they would have passed without notice their captain a smoothfaced greek came forward and addressing me as general said the imperial orders were that he was to escort me to the state jail  for what purpose i asked since it came to my mind that irene might have changed her fancy and issued another kind of commission  as its general and governor illustrious he replied  then i will lead i answered do you follow behind me  thus that vision ends    in the next i see myself dwelling in some stately apartments that formed the antechambers to the great prison this prison which was situated not far from the forum of constantine covered a large area of ground which included a garden where the prisoners were allowed to walk it was surrounded by a double wall with an outer and an inner moat the outer dry and the inner filled with water there were double gates also and by them guardtowers moreover i see a little yard with posts in it where prisoners were scourged and a small and horrible room furnished with a kind of wooden bed to which they were bound for the punishment of the putting out of their eyes and the slitting of their tongues in front of this room was a block where those condemned to death were sometimes executed  there were many prisoners not common felons but people who had been taken for reasons of state or sometimes of religion perhaps in all they numbered a hundred men and with them a few women who had a quarter to themselves besides the jailers threescore guards were stationed there night and day and of all of these i was in command  before i had held my office three days i found that irene had appointed me to it with good reason it happened thus the most of the prisoners were allowed to receive presents of food and other things sent to them by their friends all these presents were supposed to be inspected by the officer in charge of the prison this rule which had been much neglected i enforced again with the result that i made some strange discoveries  thus on the third day there came a magnificent offering of figs for the cæsars and nobilissimi the brothersinlaw of irene and the uncles of the young emperor constantine her son these figs were being carried past me formally when something about the appearance of one of them excited my suspicion i took it and offered it to the jailer who carried the basket he looked frightened shook his head and said  general i touch no fruit  indeed i answered that is strange since i thought that i saw you eating of it yesterday  aye general he replied the truth is that i ate too much  making no answer i went to the window and threw the fig to a longtailed tame monkey which was chained to a post in the yard without it caught it and ate greedily  do not go away friend i said to the jailer who was trying to depart while my back was turned i have questions that i would ask you  so i spoke to him about other matters and all the while watched the monkey  soon i saw that it was ill at ease it began to tear at its stomach and to whimper like a child then it foamed at the mouth was seized with convulsions and within a quarter of an hour by the waterclock was dead  it would seem that those figs are poisoned friend i said and therefore it is fortunate for you that you ate too much fruit yesterday now man what do you know of this matter  nothing sir he answered falling on his knees i swear to you by christ nothing only i doubted the fruits were brought by a woman whom i thought that once i had seen in the household of the augustus constantine and i knew and he paused  well what did you know man it would be best to tell me quickly who have power here  i knew sir what all the world knows that constantine would be rid of his uncles whom he fears though they are maimed no more i swear it no more  perhaps before the augusta returns you may remember something more i said therefore i will not judge your case at present ho guard come hither  as he heard the soldiers stirring without in answer to my summons the man who was unarmed looked about his desperately then he sprang at the fruit and seizing a fig strove to thrust it into his mouth but i was too quick for him and within a few seconds the soldiers had him fast  shut this man in a safe dungeon i said treat and feed him well but search him see also that he does himself no harm and that none speak with him then forget all this business  what charge must be entered in the book general asked the officer saluting  a charge of stealing figs that belonged to the cæsar nicephorus and his royal brethren i answered and looked through the window  he followed my glance saw the poor monkey lying dead and started  all shall be done he said and the man was led away  when he had gone i sent for the physician of the jail whom i knew to be trustworthy since i had appointed him myself without telling him anything i bade him examine and preserve the figs and also dissect the body of the monkey to discover why it died  he bowed and went away with the fruit a while later he returned and showed me an open fig in the heart of it was a pinch of white powder  what is it i asked  the deadliest poison that is known general see the stalk has been drawn out the powder blown in through a straw and then the stalk replaced  ah i said that is clever but not quite clever enough they have mixed the stalks i noted that the purple fig had the stalk of a green fig and that is why i tried it on the monkey  you observe well general  yes physician i observe i learned that when as a lad i hunted game in the far north also i learned to keep silent since noise frightens game do you as much  have no fear he answered and went about his business with the dead monkey  when he had gone i thought a while then i rose and went to the chapel of the prison or rather to a place whence i could see those in the chapel without being seen this chapel was situated in a gloomy crypt lighted only with oil lamps that hung from the massive pillars and arches the day was the sabbath of the christians and when i entered the little secret hollow in the walls the sacrament was being administered to certain of the prisoners  truly it was a sad sight for the ministering priest was none other than the cæsar nicephorus the eldest of the emperors uncles who had been first ordained in order that he might be unfit to sit upon the throne and afterwards blinded as i have told he was a tall pale man with an uncertain mouth and a little pointed chin apparently between forty and fifty years of age and his face was made dreadful by two red hollows where the eyes should have been yet notwithstanding this disfigurement and his tonsured crown and the broidered priests robes which hung upon him awkwardly as he stumbled through the words of his office to this poor victim there still seemed to cling some air of royal birth and bearing being blind he could not see to administer the element and therefore his hand was guided by one of his imperial brethren who also had been made a priest the tongue of this priest had been slit but now and again he gibbered some direction into the ear of nicephorus by the altar watching all sat a sternfaced monk the confessor of the cæsars and of the nobilissimi who was put there to spy upon them  i followed the rite to its end observing these unhappy prisoners seeking from the mystery of their faith the only consolation that remained to them many of them were men innocent of any crime save that of adherence to some fallen cause political or religious victims were they not sinners to be released by death alone i remember that as the meaning of the scene came home to me i recalled the words of irene who had said that she believed this world to be a hell and found weight in them at length able to bear no more i left my hidingplace and went into the garden behind the chapel here at least were natural things here flowers tended by the prisoners bloomed as they might have done in some less accursed spot here the free birds sang and nested in the trees for what to them were the high surrounding walls  i sat myself down upon a seat in the shade presently as i had expected nicephorus the priestcæsar and his four brethren came into the garden two of them led the blind man by the hand and the other two clung close to him for all these unfortunates loved each other dearly the four with the split tongues gabbled in his ears now and again when he could catch or guess at the meaning of a word he answered the speaker gently or the others seeing that he had not understood them aright painfully tried to explain the error oh it was a piteous thing to see and hear my gorge rose against the young brute of an emperor and his councillors who for ambitions sake had wrought this horrible crime little did i know then that ere long their fate would be his own and that a mothers hand would deal it out to him  they caught sight of me seated beneath the tree and chattered like startled starlings till at length nicephorus understood  what say you dear brothers he asked that the new governor of the prison is seated yonder well why should we fear him he has been here but a little while yet he has shown himself very kind to us moreover he is a man of the north no treacherous greek and the men of the north are brave and upright once when i was a free prince i had some of them in my service and i loved them well our nephew the emperor offered a large sum to a northman to blind or murder me but he would not do it and was dismissed from the service of the empire because he spoke his mind and prayed his heathen gods to bring a like fate upon constantine himself lead me to this governor i would talk with him  so they brought nicephorus to me though doubtfully and when he was near i rose from my seat and saluted him thereon they all gabbled again with their split tongues till at length he understood and flushed with pleasure  general olaf he said to me i thank you for your courtesy to a poor prisoner forgotten by god and cruelly oppressed by man general olaf the promise is of little worth but if ever it should be in my power i will remember this kindness which pleases me more than did the shouting of the legions in the short day of my prosperity  sir i answered whatever happens i shall remember your words which are more to me than any honours kings can bestow now sir i will ask your royal brethren to fall back as i wish to speak with you  nicephorus made a sign with his hand and the four halfdumb men all of whom resembled him strangely especially in the weakness of their mouths and chins obeyed bowing to me in a stately fashion they withdrew leaving us alone  sir i said i would warn you that you have enemies whom you may not suspect for my duty here wherewith i was charged by the augusta is not to oppress but to protect you and your imperial brothers  then i told him the story of the poisoned figs  when he had heard it the tears welled from his hollow eyes and ran down his pale cheeks  constantine my brother leos son has done this he said for never will he rest until all of us are in the grave  he is cruel because he fears you o nicephorus and it is said that your ambition has given him cause to fear  once general that was true the prince replied once foolishly i did aspire to rule but it is long ago now they have made a priest of me and i seek peace only can i and my brethren help it if mutilated though we are some still wish to use us against the emperor i tell you that irene herself is at the back of them she would set us on high that afterwards she may throw us down and crush us  i am her servant prince and may not listen to such talk who know only that she seeks to protect you from your enemies and for that reason has placed me here it seems not in vain if you would continue to live i warn you and your brethren to fly from plots and to be careful of what you eat and drink  i do not desire to live general he answered oh that i might die would that i might die  death is not difficult to find prince i replied and left him  these may seem hard words but be it remembered i was no christian then but a heathen man to see one who had been great and fallen from his greatness one whom fortune had deserted utterly whining at fate like a fretful child and yet afraid to seek his freedom moved me to contempt as well as to pity therefore i spoke the words  yet all the rest of that day they weighed upon my mind for i knew well how i should have interpreted them were i in this poor cæsars place so heavily did they weigh that during the following night an impulse drew me from my bed and caused me to visit the cells in which these princes were imprisoned four of them were dark and silent but in that of nicephorus burned a light i listened at the door and through the keyplace heard that the prisoner within was praying and sobbing as he prayed  then i went away but when i reached the end of the long passage something drew me back again it was as though a hand i could not see were guiding me i returned to the door of the cell and now through it heard choking sounds quickly i shot the bolts and unlocked it with my masterkey this was what i saw within  to a bar of the windowplace was fastened such a rope as monks wear for a girdle at the end of the rope was a noose and in that noose the head of nicephorus there he hung struggling his hands had gripped the rope above his head for though he had sought death at the last he tried to escape him of such stuff was nicephorus made yet it was too late or would have been for as i entered the place his hands slipped from the thin cord which tightened round his throat choking him  my sword was at my side drawing it with a blow i cut the rope and caught him in my arms already he was swooning but i poured water over his face and as his neck remained unbroken he recovered his breath and senses  what play is this prince i asked  one that you taught me general he answered painfully you said that death could be found i went to seek him but at the last i feared oh i tell you that when i thrust away that stool my blind eyes were opened and i saw the fires of hell and the hands of devils grasping at my soul to plunge it into them blessings be on you who have saved me from those fires and seizing my hand he kissed it  do not thank me i said but thank the god you worship for i think that he must have put it into my mind to visit you tonight now swear to me by that god that you will attempt such a deed no more for if you will not swear then you must be fettered  then he swore so fervently by his christ that i was sure he would never break the oath after he had sworn i told him how i could not rest because of the strange fears which oppressed me  oh he said without doubt it was god who sent his angel to you that i might be saved from the most dreadful of all sins without doubt it was god who knows you although you do not know him  after this he fell upon his knees and having untied the cut rope from the window bars i left him    now i tell this story because it has to do with my own for it was these words of the prince that first turned me to the study of the christian faith indeed had they never been spoken i believe that i should have lived and died a heathen man hitherto i had judged of that faith by the works of those who practised it in constantinople and found it wanting now however i was sure that some power from above us had guided me to the chamber of nicephorus in time to save his life me who had he died in a sense would have been guilty of his blood for had he not been driven to the deed by my bitter mocking words it may be said that this would have mattered little that he might as well have died by his own hand as be taken to athens there to perish with his brethren whether naturally or by murder i do not know but who can judge of such secret things without doubt the sufferings of nicephorus had a purpose as have all our sufferings he was kept alive for reasons known to his maker though not to man  here i will add that of this unhappy cæsar and his brethren i remember little more dimly i seem to recollect that during my period of office some attack was made upon the prison by those who would have put the prince to death but that i discovered the plot through the jailer who had introduced the poisoned figs and defeated it with ease thereby gaining much credit with irene and her ministers if so of this plot history says nothing all it tells of these princes is that afterwards a mob haled them to the cathedral of st sophia and there proclaimed nicephorus emperor but they were taken again and at last shipped to athens where they vanished from the sight of men  god rest their tortured souls for they were more sinned against than sinning    chapter iii  mother and son  the next vision of this byzantine life of mine that rises before me is that of a great round building crowned with men clad in bishops robes at least they wore mitres and each of them had a crooked pastoral staff which in most cases was carried by an attendant monk  some debate was in progress or rather raging its subject seemed to be as to whether images should or should not be worshipped in churches it was a furious thing that debate one party to it were called iconoclasts that was the party which did not like images and i think the other party were called orthodox but of this i am not sure so furious was it that i the general and governor of the prison had been commanded by those in authority to attend in order to prevent violence the beginnings of what happened i do not remember what i do remember is that the antiiconoclasts the party to which the empress irene belonged that was therefore the fashionable sect being as it seemed to me worsted in argument fell back on violence  there followed a great tumult in which the spectators took part and the strange sight was seen of priests and their partisans and even of bishops themselves falling upon their adversaries and beating them with whatever weapon was to hand yes even with their pastoral staves it was a wonderful thing to behold these ministers of the christ of peace belabouring each other with pastoral staves  the party that advocated the worship of images was the more numerous and had the greater number of adherents and therefore those who thought otherwise were defeated a few of them were dragged out into the street and killed by the mob which waited there and more were wounded notwithstanding all that i and the guards could do to protect them among the iconoclasts was a gentlefaced old man with a long beard one of the bishops from egypt who was named barnabas he had said little in the debate which lasted for several days and when he spoke his words were full of charity and kindness still the image faction hated him and when the final tumult began some of them set upon him indeed one brawny darkfaced bishopi think it was he of antiochrushed at barnabas and before i could thrust him back broke a jewelled staff upon his head while other priests tore his robe from neck to shoulder and spat in his face  at last the riot was quelled the dead were borne away and orders came to me that i was to convey barnabas to the state prison if he still lived together with some others of whom i remember nothing so thither i took barnabas and there with the help of the prison physicianhe to whom i had given the poisoned figs and the dead monkey to be examinedi nursed him back to life and health  his illness was long for one of the blows which he had received crippled him and during it we talked much together he was a very sweetnatured man and holy a native of britain whose father or grandfather had been a dane and therefore there was a tie between us in his youth he was a soldier having been taken prisoner in some war he came to italy where he was ordained a priest at rome afterwards he was sent as a missionary to egypt where he was appointed the head of a monastery and in the end elected to a bishopric but he had never forgotten the danish tongue which his parents taught him as a child and so we were able to talk together in that language  now it would seem that since that night when the cæsar nicephorus strove to hang himself i had obtained and studied a copy of the christian scriptureshow i do not knowand therefore was able to discuss these matters with barnabas the bishop of our arguments i remember nothing save that i pointed out to him that whereas the tree seemed to me to be very good its fruits were vile beyond imagination and i instanced the horrible tumult when he had been wounded almost to death not by common men but by the very leaders of the christians  he answered that these things must happen that christ himself had said he came to bring not peace but a sword and that only through war and struggle would the last truth be reached the spirit was always good he added but the flesh was always vile these deeds were those of the flesh which passed away but the spirit remained pure and immortal  the end of it was that under the teaching of the holy barnabas saint and martyr for afterwards he was murdered by the followers of the false prophet mahomet i became a christian and a new man now at length i understood what grace it was that had given me courage to offer battle to the heathen god odin and to smite him down now i saw also where shone the light which i had been seeking these many years aye and i clasped that light to my bosom to be my lamp in life and death  so a day came when my beloved master barnabas who would allow no delay in this matter baptised me in his cell with water taken from his drinking vessel charging me to make public profession before the church when opportunity should arise  it was just at this time that irene returned from the baths and i sent to her a written report of all that had happened at the prison since i had been appointed its governor also i prayed that if it were her will i might be relieved of my office as it was one which did not please me  a few days later while i sat in my chamber at the prison writing a paper concerning a prisoner who had died the porter at the gate announced that a messenger from the augusta wished to see me i bade him show in the messenger and presently there entered no chamberlain or eunuch but a woman wrapped in a dark cloak when the man had gone and the door was shut she threw off the cloak and i saw that my visitor was martina the favourite waitinglady of the empress we greeted each other warmly who were always friends and i asked her tidings  my tidings are olaf that the waters have suited the augusta very well she has lost several pounds in weight and her skin is now like that of a young child  all health to the augusta i said laughing but you have not come here to tell me of the state of the royal skin what next martina  this olaf the empress has read your report with her own eyes which is a rare thing for her to do she said she wished to see whether or no you could write greek she is much pleased with the report and told stauracius in my presence that she had done well in choosing you for your office while she was absent from the city since thereby she had saved the lives of the cæsars and nobilissimi desiring as she does that these princes should be kept alive at any rate for the present she accedes also to your prayer and will relieve you of your office as soon as a new governor can be chosen you are to return to guard her person but with your rank of general confirmed  that is all good news martina so good that i wonder what sting is hidden in all this honey  that you will find out presently olaf one i can warn you of howeverthe sting of jealousy advancement such as yours draws eyes to you not all of them in love  i nodded and she went on  meantime your star seems to shine very bright indeed one might almost say that the augusta worshipped it at least she talks of you to me continually and once or twice was in half a mind to send for you to the baths indeed had it not been for reasons of state connected with your prisoners i think she would have done so  ah i said now i think i begin to feel another sting in the honey  another sting in the honey nay nay you mean a divine perfume an essence of added sweetness a flavour of the flowers on mount ida why olaf if i were your enemy as i dare say i shall be some day for often we learn to hate those whom we haverather liked your head and your shoulders might bid goodbye to each other for such words as those  perhaps martina and if they did i do not know that it would greatly matternow  not greatly matter when you are driving at full gallop along fortunes road to fames temple with an empress for your charioteer are you blind or mad olaf or both and what do you mean by your now olaf something has happened to you since last we met have you fallen in love with some fair prisoner in this hateful place and been repulsed such a fool as you are might take refusal even from a captive in his own hands at least you are different  yes martina something has happened to me i have become a christian  oh olaf now i see that you are not a fool as i thought but very clever why only yesterday the augusta said to meit was after she had read that report of yoursthat if you were but a christian she would be minded to lift you high indeed but as you remained the most obstinate of heathens she did not see how it could be done without causing great trouble  now i wish one could be a christian within and remain a pagan without i answered grimly though alas that may not be martina do you not understand that it was for no such reasons as these that i kissed the cross that in so doing i sought not fortune but to be its servant  by the saints youll be tonsured next and ill enough it would suit you she exclaimed remember if things grow toodifficult you can always be tonsured olaf only then you will have to give up the hope of that lady who wears the other half of the necklace somewhere i dont mean irenes sham half but the real one oh stop blushing and stammering i know the story and all about iduna the fair also an exalted person told it me and so did you although you were not aware that you had done so for you are not one who can keep a secret to himself may all the guardian angels help that necklacelady if ever she should meet another lady whom i will not name and now why do you talk so much are you learning to preach or what if you really do mean to become a monk olaf there is another thing you must give up and that is war except of the kind which you saw at the council the other day god above us what a sight it would be to see you battering another bishop with a hookshaped staff over a question of images or the two natures i should be sorry for that bishop but you havent told me who converted you  barnabas of egypt i said  oh i hoped that it had been a lady saint the story would have been so much more interesting to the court well our imperial mistress does not like barnabas because he does not like images and that may be a sting in her honey but perhaps she will forgive him for your sake youll have to worship images  what do i care about images it is the spirit that i seek martina and all these things are nothing  you are thorough as usual olaf and jump farther than you can see well be advised and say naught for or against images as they have no meaning for you what can it matter if they are or are not there leave them to the blind eyes and little minds and now i must be gone who can listen to your gossip no longer oh i had forgotten my message the augusta commands that you shall wait on her this evening immediately after she has supped hear and obey  having delivered this formal mandate to neglect which meant imprisonment or worse she threw her cloak about her and with a wondering glance at my face opened the door and went  at the hour appointed or rather somewhat before it i attended at the private apartments of the palace evidently i was expected for one of the chamberlains on seeing me bowed and bade me be seated then left the anteroom presently the door opened again and through it came martina clad in her white official robe  you are early olaf she said like a lover who keeps a tryst well it is always wise to meet good fortune half way but why do you come clad in full armour it is not the custom to wait thus upon the empress at this hour when you are off duty  i thought that i was on duty martina  then as usual you thought wrong take off that armour she says that the sight of it always makes her feel cold after supper i say take it off or if you cannot i will help you  so the mail was removed leaving me clad in my plain blue tunic and hose  would you have me come before the empress thus i asked  by way of answer she clapped her hands and bade the eunuch who answered the signal to bring a certain robe he went and presently reappeared with a wondrous garment of silk broidered with gold such as nobles of high rank wore at festivals this robe which fitted as though it had been made for me i put on though i liked the look of it little martina would have had me even remove my sword but i refused saying  except at the express order of the empress i and my sword are not parted  well she said nothing about the sword olaf so let it be all she said was that i must be careful that the robe matched the colour of the necklace you wear she cannot bear colours which jar upon each other especially by lamplight  am i a man i asked angrily or a beast being decked for sacrifice  fie olaf have you not yet forgotten your heathen talk remember i pray you that you are now a christian in a christian land  i thank you for reminding me of it i replied and that moment a chamberlain entering hurriedly commanded my presence  good luck to you olaf said martina as i followed him be sure to tell me the news lateror tomorrow  then the chamberlain led me not into the audience hall as i had expected but to the private imperial dining chamber here reclining upon couches in the old roman fashion one on either side of a narrow table on which stood fruits and flagons of richhued greek wine were the two greatest people in the world the augusta irene and the augustus constantine her son  she was wonderfully apparelled in a lowcut garment of white silk over which fell a mantle of the imperial purple and i noted that on her dazzling bosom hung that necklace of emerald beetles separated by golden shells which she had caused to be copied from my own on her fair hair that grew low upon her forehead and was parted in the middle she wore a diadem of gold in which were set emeralds to match the beetles of the necklace the augustus was arrayed in the festal garments of a cæsar also covered with a purple cloak he was a heavyfaced and somewhat stupidlooking youth darkhaired like his father and uncles but having large blue and not unkindly eyes from his flushed face i gathered that he had drunk well of the strong greek wine and from the sullen look about his mouth that as was common he had been quarrelling with his mother  i stood at the end of the table and saluted first the empress and then the emperor  whos this he asked glancing at me  general olaf of my guard she answered governor of the state prison you remember you wished me to send for him to settle the point as to which we were arguing  oh yes well general olaf of my mothers guard have you not been told that you should salute the augustus before the augusta  sire i answered humbly i have heard nothing of that matter but in the land where i was bred i was taught that if a man and a woman were together i must always bow first to the woman and then to the man  well said exclaimed the empress clapping her hands but the emperor answered doubtless your mother taught you that not your father next time you enter the imperial chamber be pleased to forget the lesson and to remember that emperors and empresses are not men and women  sire i answered as you command i will remember that emperors and empresses are not men and women but emperors and empresses  at these words the augustus began to scowl but changing his mind laughed as did his mother he filled a gold cup with wine and pushed it towards me saying  drink to us soldier for after you have done so our wits may be better matched  i took the cup and holding it said  i pledge your imperial majesties who shine upon the world like twin stars in the sky all hail to your majesties and i drank but not too deep  you are clever growled the augustus well keep the cup youve earned it yet drain it first man you have scarce wet your lips do you fear that it is poisoned as you say yonder fruits are and he pointed to a sidetable where stood a jar of glass in which were those very figs that had been sent to the princes in the prison  the cup you give is mine interrupted irene still my servant is welcome to the gift it shall be sent to your quarters general  a soldier has no need of such gauds your majesties i began when constantine who while we spoke had swallowed another draught of the strong wine broke in angrily  may i not give a cup of gold but you must claim it i to whom the empire and all its wealth belong  snatching up the beaker he dashed it to the floor spilling the wine of which i who wished to keep my head cool was glad  have done he went on in his drunken rage shall the cæsars huckster over a piece of worked gold like jews in a market give me those figs man ill settle the matter of this poison  i brought the jar of figs and bowing set them down before him that they were the same i knew for the glass was labelled in my own writing and in that of the physician he cut away the sealed parchment which was stretched over the mouth of the jar  now hearken you olaf he said it is true that i ordered fruit to be sent to that foolcæsar my uncle because the last time i saw him nicephorus prayed me for it and i was willing to do him a pleasure but that i ordered the fruit to be poisoned as my mother says is a lie and may god curse the tongue that spoke it i will show you that it was a lie and plunging his hand into the spirit of the jar he drew out two of the figs now he went on waving them about in a halfdrunken fashion this general olaf of yours says that these are the same figs which were sent to the cæsar i mean the blind priest father nicephorus dont you olaf  yes sire i answered they were placed in that bottle in my presence and sealed with my seal  well those figs were sent by me and this olaf tells us they are poisoned ill show him and you too mother that they are not poisoned for i will eat one of them  now i looked at the augusta but she sat silent her arms folded on her white bosom her handsome face turned as it were to stone  constantine lifted the fig towards his loose mouth again i looked at the augusta still she sat there like a statue and it came into my mind that it was her purpose to allow this winebemused man to eat the fig then i acted  augustus i said you must not touch that fruit and stepping forward i took it from his hand  he sprang to his feet and began to revile me  you watchdog of the north he shouted do you dare to say to the emperor that he shall not do this or that by all the images my mother worships ill have you whipped through the circus  that you will never do i answered for my free blood boiled at the insult i tell you sire i went on leaving out certain words which i meant to speak that the fig is poisoned  and i tell you that you lie you heathen savage see here either you eat that fig or i do so that we may know who speaks the truth if you wont i will now obey or by christ tomorrow you shall be shorter by a head  the augustus is pleased to threaten which is unnecessary i remarked if i eat the fig will the augustus swear to leave the rest of them uneaten  aye he answered with a hiccough for then i shall know the truth and for the truth i live though he added i havent found it yet  and if i do not eat it will the augustus do so  by the holy blood yes ill eat a dozen of them am i one to be hectored by a woman and a barbarian eat or i eat  good sire it is better that a barbarian should die than that the world should lose its glorious emperor i eat and when you are as i soon shall be as will happen even to an emperor may my blood lie heavy on your soul the blood which i give to save your life  then i lifted the fig to my lips  before ever it touched them with a motion swift as that of a panther springing on its prey irene had leapt from her couch and dashed the fruit from my hand she turned upon her son  what kind of a thing are you she asked who would suffer a brave man to poison himself that he may save your worthless life oh god what have i done that i should have given birth to such a hound whoever poisoned them these fruits are poisoned as has been proved and can be proved again yes and shall be i tell you that if olaf had tasted one of them by now he would have been dead or dying  constantine drank another cup of wine which oddly enough seemed to sober him for the moment  i find all this strange he said heavily you my mother would have suffered me to eat the fig which you declare is poisoned a matter whereof you may know something but when the general olaf offers to eat it in my place with your own royal hand you dash it from his lips as he dashed it from mine and there is another thing which is still more strange this olaf who also says the figs are poisoned offered to eat one of them if i promised i would not do so which means if he is right that he offered to give his life for mine yet i have done nothing for him except call him hard names and as he is your servant he has nothing to look for from me if i should win the fight with you at last now i have heard much talk of miracles but this is the only one i have ever seen either olaf is a liar or he is a great man and a saint he says i am told that the monkey which ate one of those figs died well i never thought of it before but there are more monkeys in the palace indeed one lives on the terrace near by for i fed it this afternoon well put the matter to the proof and learn of what stuff this olaf is really made  on the table stood a silver bell and as he spoke he struck it a chamberlain entered and was ordered to bring in the monkey he departed and with incredible swiftness the beast and its keeper arrived it was a large animal of the baboon tribe famous throughout the palace for its tricks indeed on entering at a word from the man who led it it bowed to all of us  give your beast these said the emperor handing the keeper several of the figs  the baboon took the fruits and having sniffed at them put them aside then the keeper fed it with some sweetmeats which it caught and devoured and presently when its fears were allayed threw it one of the figs which it swallowed doubtless thinking it a sweetmeat a minute or two later it began to show signs of distress and shortly afterwards died in convulsions  now said irene now do you believe my son  yes he answered i believe that there is a saint in constantinople sir saint i salute you you have saved my life and if it should come my way by your brother saints ill save yours although you are my mothers servant  so speaking he drank off yet another cup of wine and reeled from the room  the keeper at a sign from irene lifted up the body of the dead ape and also left the chamber weeping as he went for he had loved this beast    chapter iv  olaf offers his sword  the emperor had gone drunk the ape had gone dead and its keeper had gone weeping irene and i alone were left in that beautiful place with the winestained table on which stood the jar of poisoned figs and the bent golden cup lying on the marble floor  she sat upon the couch looking at me with a kind of amazement in her eyes and i stood before her at attention as does a soldier on duty  i wonder why he did not send for one of my servants to eat those figsstauracius for instance she mused adding with a little laugh well if he had there are some whom i could have spared better than that poor ape which at times i used to feed it was an honest creature that ape the only creature in the palace that would not rub its head in the dust before the augusta ah now i remember it always hated constantine for when he was a child he used to tease it with a stick getting beyond the length of its chain and striking it but one day as he passed too near it caught him and buffeted him on the cheek and tore out some of his hair he wanted to kill it then but i forbade him yet he has never forgotten it he who never does forget anything he hates and that is why he sent for the poor beast  the augusta will remember that the augustus did not know that the figs were poisoned  the augusta is sure that the augustus knew well enough that those figs were poisoned at any rate from the moment that i dashed one of them from your lips olaf well i have made a bitterer enemy than before thats all they say that by natures rule mother and child must love each other but it is a lie i tell you its a lie from the time he was tiny i hated that boy though not half as much as he has hated me you are thinking to yourself that this is because our ambitions clash like meeting swords and that from them spring these fires of hate it is not so the hate is native to our hearts and will only end when one of us lies dead at the others hand  terrible words augusta  yes but true truth is always terriblein byzantium olaf take those drugged fruits and set them in the drawer of yonder table lock it and guard the key lest they should poison other honest animals  i obeyed and returned to my station  she looked at me and said  i grow weary of the sight of you standing there like a statue of the roman mars with your sword half hid beneath your cloak and whats more i hate this hall it reeks of constantine and his drink and lies oh hes vile and for my sins god has made me his mother unless indeed he was changed at birth as ive been told though i could never prove it give me your hand and help me to rise so i thank you now follow me well sit a while in my private chamber where alone i can be happy since the emperor never comes there nay talk not of duty you have no guards to set or change tonight follow me i have secret business of which i would talk with you  so she went and i followed through doors that opened mysteriously at our approach and shut mysteriously behind us till i found myself in a little room halflighted only that i had never seen before it was a scented and a beautiful place in one corner of which a white statue gleamed that of a venus kissing cupid who folded one wing about her head and through the open windowplace the moonlight shone and floated the murmur of the sea  the double doors were shut for aught i knew locked and with her own hands irene drew the curtains over them near the open window to which there was no balcony stood a couch  sit yonder olaf she said for here there is no ceremony here we are but man and woman  i obeyed while she busied herself with the curtains then she came and sat herself down on the couch also leaning against the end of it in such a fashion that she could watch me in the moonlight  olaf she said after she had looked at me a while rather strangely as i thought for the colour came and went upon her face which in that light seemed quite young again and wonderfully beautiful olaf you are a very brave man  there are hundreds in your service braver empress cowards do not take to soldiering  i could tell you a different story olaf but it was not of this kind of courage that i talked it was of that which made you offer to eat the poisoned fig in place of constantine why did you do so it is true that as things have happened hell remember it in your favour for ill say this of him he never forgets one who has saved him from harm any more than he forgets one who has harmed him but if you had eaten you would have died and then how could he have rewarded you  empress when i took my oath of office i swore to protect both the augustus and the augusta even with my life i was fulfilling my oath that is all  you are a strange man as well as a brave man to interpret oaths so strictly if you will do as much as this for one who is nothing to you and who has never paid you a gold piece how much i wonder would you do for one whom you love  i could offer no more than my life for such a one empress could i  someone told meit may have been you olaf or anotherthat once you did more challenging a heathen god for the sake of one you loved and defeating him it was added that this was for a man but that i do not believe doubtless it was for the sake of iduna the fair of whom you have spoken to me whom it seems you cannot forget although she was faithless to you it is said that the best way to hold love is to be faithless to him who loves and in truth i believe it she added bitterly  you are mistaken empress it was to be avenged on him for the life of steinar my fosterbrother which he had taken in sacrifice that i dared odin and hewed his holy statue to pieces with this sword of steinar whom iduna betrayed as she betrayed me bringing one to death and the other to shame  at least had it not been for this iduna you would never have given battle to the great god of the north and thus brought his curse upon you for olaf those gods live they are devils  whether odin is or is not i do not fear his curse empress  yet it will find you out before all is done or so i think look you pagan blood still runs in me and christian though i am i would not dare one of the great gods of greece and rome id leave that to the priests do you fear nothing olaf  i think nothing at all since i hewed off odins head and came away unscathed  then you are a man to my liking olaf  she paused looking at me even more strangely than before till i turned my eyes indeed and stared out at the sea wishing that i were in it or anywhere away from this lovely and imperious woman whom i was sworn to obey in all things  olaf she said presently you have served me well of late is there any reward that you would ask and if so what anything that i can give is yours unless she added hastily the gift will take you away from constantinople and fromme  yes augusta i answered still staring out at the sea in the prison yonder is an old bishop named barnabas of egypt who was set upon by other bishops at the council while you were away and wellnigh beaten to death i ask that he may be freed and restored to his diocese with honour  barnabas she replied sharply i know the man he is an iconoclast and therefore my enemy only this morning i signed an order that he should be kept in confinement till he died here or elsewhere still she went on though i would sooner give you a province have your gift for i can refuse you nothing barnabas shall be freed and restored to his see with honour i have said  now i began to thank her but she stopped me saying  have done another time you can talk to me of heretics with whom you have made friends but i who hear enough of such would have no more of them tonight  so i grew silent and still stared out at the sea indeed i was wondering in my mind whether i dared ask leave to depart for i felt her eyes burning on me and grew much afraid suddenly i heard a sound a gentle sound of rustling silk and in another instant i felt irenes arms clasped about me and irenes head laid upon my knee yes she was kneeling before me sobbing and her proud head was resting on my knee the diadem she wore had fallen from it and her tresses breaking loose flowed to the ground and lay there gleaming like gold in the moonlight  she looked up and her face was that of a weeping saint  dost understand she whispered  now despair took me which i knew full well would soon be followed by madness then came a thought  yes i said hoarsely i understand that you grieve over that matter of the augustus and the poisoned figs and would pray me to keep silence have no fear my lips are sealed but for his i cannot answer though perhaps as he had drunk so much  fool she whispered is it thus that an empress pleads with her captain to keep silence then she drew herself up a wonderful look upon her face that had grown suddenly white a fire in her upturned eyes and for the second time kissed me upon the lips  i took her in my arms and kissed her back for an instant my mind swam then in my soul i cried for help and strength came to me rising i lifted her as though she were a child and stood her on her feet i said  hearken empress before destruction falls i do understand now though a moment ago i did not who never thought it possible that the queen of the world could look with favour upon one so humble  love takes no account of rank she murmured and that kiss of yours upon my lips is more to me than the empire of the world  yet hearken i answered there is another wall between us which may not be climbed  man what is this wall is it named woman are you sworn to the memory of that iduna who is more fair than i or is it perchance her of the necklace  neither iduna is dead to me she of the necklace is but a dream the wall is that of your own faith on this night seven days ago i was baptised a christian  well what of it this draws us nearer  study the sayings of your sacred book empress and you will find that it thrusts us apart  now she coloured to her hair and a kind of madness took her  am i to be preached to by you she asked  i preach to myself augusta who need it greatly not to you who mayhap do not need it  hating me as you do why should you need it you are the worst of hypocrites who would veil your hate under a priests robe  have you no pity irene when did i say that i hated you moreover if i had hated you should i and i ceased  i do not know what you would or would not have done she answered coldly i think that constantine is right and that you must be what is called a saint and if so saints are best in heaven especially when they know too much on earth give me that sword of yours  i drew the sword saluted with it and gave it to her  it is a heavy weapon she said whence came it  from the same grave as the necklace augusta  ah the necklace that your dreamwoman wore well go to seek her in the land of dreams and she lifted the sword  your pardon augusta but you are about to strike with the blunt edge which may wound but will not kill  she laughed a little very nervously and turning the sword round in her hand said  truly you are the strangest of men ah i thank you now i have it right do you understand olaf i mean sir saint what sort of a story i must tell of you after i have struck do you understand that not only are you about to die but that infamy will be poured upon your name and that your body will be dragged through the streets and thrown to the dogs with the city offal answer i say answer  i understand that you must cause these things to be done for your own sake augusta and i do not complain lies matter nothing to me who journey to the land of truth where there are some whom i would meet again be advised by me strike here where the neck joins the shoulder holding the sword slantwise for there even a womans blow will serve to sever the great artery  i cannot kill yourself olaf  a week ago id have fallen on the sword but now by the rule of our faith in such a cause i may not my blood must be upon your hands for which i grieve knowing that no other road is open to you augusta if it is worth anything to you take my full forgiveness for the deed and with it my thanks for all the goodness you have shown to me but most for your womans favour in after years perhaps when death draws near to you also if ever you remember olaf your faithful servant you will understand much it is not fitting that i should say give me one moment to make my peace with heaven as to certain kisses then strike hard and swiftly and as you strike scream for your guards and women your wit will do the rest  she lifted the sword while after a moments prayer i bared my neck of the silk robe then she let it fall again gasping and said  tell me first for i am curious are you no man or have you forsworn woman as do the monks  not i augusta had i lived some day i might have married who would have wished to leave children behind me since in our law marriage is allowed forget not your promise as to the bishop barnabas who i fear will weep over this seeming fall of mine  so you would marry would you she said as one who speaks to herself then thought awhile and handed me back the sword  olaf she went on you have made me feel as i never felt beforeashamed utterly ashamed and though i learn to hate you as it well may hap i shall know that i shall always honour you  then she sank down upon the couch and hiding her face in her hands wept bitterly  it was at this moment that i went very near to loving irene  i think she must have felt something of what was passing in my mind for suddenly she looked up and said give me that jewel and she pointed to the diadem on the floor and help me to order my hair my hands shake  nay i said as i gave her the crown of that wine i drink no more i dare not touch you you grow too dear  for those words she whispered go in safety and remember that from irene you have naught to fear as i know well i have naught to fear from you o prince among men  so presently i went    on the following morning as i sat in my office at the prison setting all things in order for whoever should succeed me martina entered as she had done before  how came you here unannounced i asked when she was seated  by virtue of this she answered holding up her hand and showing on it a ring i knew it was the signet of the empress i saluted the seal saying  and for what purpose martina to order me to bonds or death  to bonds or death she exclaimed innocently what can our good olaf have done worthy of such woes nay i come to free one from bonds and perhaps from death namely a certain heretic bishop who is named barnabas here is the order for his release signed by the augustas hand and sealed with her seal under which he is at liberty to bide in constantinople while he will and to return to his bishopric in egypt when it pleases him also if he holds that any have harmed him he may make complaint and it shall be considered without delay  i took the parchment read it and laid it on the table saying  the commands of the empress shall be done is there aught else martina  yes tomorrow morning you will be relieved of your office and another governorstauracius and aetius are quarrelling as to his namewill take your place  and i  you will resume your post as captain of the private guard only with the rank of a full general of the army but that i told you yesterday it is now confirmed  i said nothing but a groan i could not choke broke from my lips  you do not seem as pleased as you might be olaf tell me now at what hour did you leave the palace last night while waiting for my mistress to summon me i fell asleep in the vestibule of the anteroom and when i awoke and went into that room i found there the goldbroidered silk robe you wore cast upon the ground and your armour gone  i know not what was the hour martina and speak no more to me i pray of that accursed womanish robe  which you treated but ill olaf for it is spotted as though with blood  the augustus spilt some wine over it  aye my mistress told me the story also that of how you would have eaten the poisoned fig which you snatched from the lips of constantine  and what else did your mistress tell you martina  not much olaf she was in a very strange mood last night and while i combed her hair which olaf was as tangled as though a man had handled it and she looked at me till i coloured to the eyes and undid her diadem that was set on it all awry she spoke to me of marriage  of marriage i gasped  certainlydid i not speak the word with clearnessof marriage  with whom martina  oh grow not jealous before there is need olaf she made no mention of the name of our future divine master for whosoever can rule irene if such a one lives will certainly rule us also all she said was that she wished she could find some man to guide guard and comfort her who grew lonely amidst many troubles and hoped for more sons than constantine  what sort of a man martina this emperor charlemagne or some other king  no she vowed that she had seen enough of princes who were murderers and liars all of them and that what she desired was one of good birth no more brave honest and not a fool i asked her too what she would have him like to look upon  and what did she say to that martina  oh she said that he must be tall and under forty fairhaired and bearded since she loved not these shaven effeminates who look half woman and half priest one who had known war and yet was no ruffler a person of open mind who had learnt and could learn more well now that i think of it by all the saintsyes much such a man as you are olaf  then she may find them in plenty i said with an uneasy laugh  do you think so well she did not neither did i indeed she pointed out that this was her trouble among the great of the earth she knew no such man and if she sought lower then would come jealousies and war  indeed they would doubtless you showed her that this was so martina  not at all olaf i asked her of what use it was to be an empress if she could not please her own heart in this matter of a husband which is one important to a woman i said also as for such fears that a secret marriage might be thought of which is an honest business that could be declared when occasion came  and what did she answer to that martina  she fell into high good humour called me a faithful and a clever friend gave me a handsome jewel told me that she would have a mission for me on the morrowdoubtless that which i now fulfil for i have heard of no othersaid notwithstanding all the trouble as to the augustus and his threats that she was sure she would sleep better than she had done for nights kissed me on both cheeks and flung herself upon her knees at her prayingstool where i left her but why are you looking so sad olaf  oh i know not save that i find life difficult and full of pitfalls which it is hard to escape  martina rested her elbows on the table and her chin upon her little hand staring me full in the face with her quick eyes that pierced like nails  olaf she said your star shines bright above you keep your eyes fixed thereon and follow it and never think about the pitfalls it may lead you i know not where  to heaven perhaps i suggested  well you did not fear to go thither when you would have eaten the poisoned fig last night to heaven perchance but by a royal road whatever you may think of some others marriage is an honourable estate my christian friend especially if a man marries well and now goodbye we shall meet again at the palace whither you will repair tomorrow morning not before since i am engaged in directing the furnishment of your new quarters in the right wing and though the workmen labour all night they will not be finished until then goodbye general olaf your servant martina salutes you and your star and she curtsied before me until her knees almost touched the ground    chapter v  ave post secula  it comes back to me that on the following day my successor in the governorship of the jail who he was i know not now arrived and that to him in due form i handed over my offices and duties before i did so however i made it my care to release barnabas i think on the previous evening in his cell i read the augustas warrant to the old bishop  how was it obtained son he asked for know that having so many enemies on this small matter of image worship i expected to die in this place now it seems that i am free and may even return to my charge in egypt  the empress granted it to me as a favour father i answered i told her that you were from the north like myself  he studied me with his shrewd blue eyes and said  it seems strange to me that so great and unusual a boon should be granted for such a reason seeing that better men than i am have suffered banishment and worse woes for less cause than i have given what did you pay the empress for this favour son olaf  nothing father  is it so olaf a dream has come to me about you and in that dream i saw you walk through a great fire and emerge unscathed save for the singeing of your lips and hair  perhaps they were singed father otherwise i am unburned though what will happen to me in the future i do not know for my dangers seem great  in my dream you triumphed over all of them olaf and also met with some reward even in this life though now i know not what it was yes and triumph you shall my son in christ fear nothing even when the stormclouds sweep about your head and the lightnings blind your eyes i say fear nothing for you have friends whom you cannot see i ask no more even under the seal of confession since there are secrets which it is not well to learn who knows i might go mad or torture might draw from me words i would not speak therefore keep your own counsel son and confess to god alone  what will you do now father i asked return to egypt  nay not yet awhile it comes to me that i must bide here for a space which under this pardon i have liberty to do but to what end i cannot say later on i shall return if god so wills i go to dwell with good folk who are known to me and from time to time will let you hear where i may be found if you should need my help or counsel  then i led him to the gates and having given him a witnessed copy of his warrant of release bade him farewell for that time making it known to the guards and certain priests who lingered there that any who molested him must answer for it to the augusta  thus we parted  having handed over the keys of the prison i walked to the palace unattended being minded to take up my duties there unnoticed but this was not to be as i entered the palace gate a sentry called out something and a messenger who seemed to be in waiting departed at full speed then the sentry saluting told me that his orders were that i must stand awhile he knew not why presently i discovered for across the square within the gates marched a full generals guard whereof the officer also saluted and prayed me to come with him i went wondering if i was to be given in charge and by him surrounded with this pompous guard was led to my new quarters which were more splendid than i could have dreamed here the guard left me and presently other officers appeared some of them old comrades of my own asking for orders of which of course i had none to give also within an hour i was summoned to a council of generals to discuss some matter of a war in which the empire was engaged by such means as these it was conveyed to me that i had become a great man or at any rate one in the way of growing great  that afternoon when according to my old custom i was making my round of the guards i met the augusta upon the main terrace surrounded by a number of ministers and courtiers i saluted and would have passed on but she bade one of her eunuchs call me to her so i came and stood before her  we greet you general olaf she said where have you been all this long while oh i remember at the state prison as its governor of which office you are now relieved at your own request well the palace welcomes you again for when you are here all within know themselves safe  thus she spoke her great eyes searching my face the while then bowed her head in token of dismissal i saluted again and began to step backwards according to the rule whereon she motioned to me to stand then she began to make a laugh of me to the painted throng about her  say nobles and ladies she said did any of you ever see such a man we address him as best we mayand we have reason to believe that he understands our languageyet not one word does he vouchsafe to us in answer there he stands like a soldier cut in iron who moves by springs with never an i thank you or a good day on his lips doubtless he would reprove us all who he holds talk too much being as we all have heard a man of stern morality who has no tenderness for human foibles by the way general olaf a rumour has reached us that you have forsaken doubt and become a christian is this true  it is true augusta  then if as a pagan you were a man of iron what will you be as a christian we wonder one hard as diamond no less yet we are glad of this tidings as all good servants of the church must be since henceforth our friendship will be closer and we value you general you must be received publicly into the bosom of the faith it will be an encouragement to others to follow your example perhaps as you have served us so well in many wars and as an officer of our guard we ourselves will be your godmother the matter shall be considered by us what have you to answer to it  nothing i replied save that when the augusta has considered of the matter i will consider of my answer  at this the courtiers tittered and instead of growing angry as i thought she might irene burst out laughing  truly we were wrong she said to provoke you to open your mouth general for when you do so like that red sword you wear your tongue is sharp if somewhat heavy tell us general are your new quarters to your taste and before you reply know that we inspected them ourselves and having a liking for such tasks attended to their furnishment tis done you will see in the northern style which we think somewhat cold and heavylike your sword and tongue  if the augusta asks me i said the quarters are too fine for a single soldier the two rooms where i dwelt before were sufficient  a single soldier well that is a fault which can be remedied you should marry general olaf  when i find any woman who wishes to marry me and whom i wish to marry i will obey the augustas commands  so be it general only remember that first we must approve the lady venture not general to share those new quarters of yours with any lady whom we do not approve  then followed by the court she turned and walked away and i went about my business wondering what was the meaning of all this guarded and halfbitter talk  the next event that returns to me clearly is that of my public acceptance as a christian in the great cathedral of st sophia which must have taken place not very long after this meeting upon the terrace i know that by every means in my power i had striven though without avail to escape this ceremony pointing out that i could be publicly received into the body of the church at any chapel where there was a priest and a congregation of a dozen humble folk but this the empress would not allow the reason she gave was her desire that my conversion should be proclaimed throughout the city that other pagans of whom there were thousands might follow my example yet i think she had another which she did not avow it was that i might be made known in public as a man of importance whom it pleased her to honour  on the morning of this rite martina came to acquaint me with its details and told me that the empress would be present at the cathedral in state making her progress thither in her golden chariot drawn by the famed milkwhite steeds i it seemed was to ride after the chariot in my generals uniform which was splendid enough followed by a company of guards and surrounded by chanting priests the patriarch himself no less a person was to receive me and some other converts and the cathedral would be filled with all the great ones of constantinople  i asked whether irene intended to be my godmother as she had threatened  not so replied martina on that point she has changed her mind  so much the better i said but why  there is a canon of the church olaf which forbids intermarriage between a godparent and his or her godchild she replied dryly whether this canon has come to the augustas memory or not i cannot say it may be so  who then is to be my godmother i asked hurriedly leaving the problem of irenes motives undiscussed  i am by the written imperial decree delivered to me not an hour ago  you martina you who are younger than myself by many years  yes i the augusta has just explained to me that as we seem to be such very good friends and to talk together so much alone doubtless she supposed upon matters of religion there could be no person more suitable than such a good christian as myself to fill that holy office  what do you mean martina i asked bluntly  i mean olaf she replied turning away her head and speaking in a strained voice that where you are concerned the augusta of late has done me the honour to be somewhat jealous of me well of a godmother no one need be jealous the augusta is a clever woman olaf  i do not quite understand i said why should the augusta be jealous of you  there is no reason at all olaf except that as it happens she is jealous of every woman who comes near to you and she knows that we are intimate and that you trust mewell more perhaps than you trust her oh i assure you that of late you have not spoken to any woman under fifty unnoted and unreported many eyes watch you olaf  then they might find better employment but tell me outright martina what is the meaning of all this  surely even a woodenheaded northman can guess olaf  she glanced round her to make sure that we were alone in the great apartment of my quarters and that the doors were shut then went on almost in a whisper my mistress is wondering whether or no she will marry again and if so whether she will choose a certain somewhat overvirtuous christian soldier as a second husband as yet she has not made up her mind moreover even if she had nothing could be done at present or until the question of the struggle between her and her son for power is settled in this way or in that therefore at worst or at best that soldier has yet a while of single life left to him say a month or two  then during that month or two perhaps he would be wise to travel i suggested  perhaps if he were a fool who would run away from fortune and if he could get leave of absence which in his case is impossible to attempt such a journey without it would mean his death no if he is wise that soldier will bide where he is and await events possessing his soul in patience as a good christian should do now as your godmother i must instruct you in this service look not so troubled it is really most simple you know stauracius the eunuch is to be your godfather which is very fortunate for you since although he looks on you with doubt and jealousy to blind or murder his own godson would cause too much scandal even in constantinople as a special mark of grace also the bishop barnabas of egypt will be allowed to assist in the ceremony because it was he who snatched your soul from the burning moreover since the sacrament is to be administered afterwards he has been commanded to attend here to receive your confession in the chapel of the palace and within an hour you know that this day being the feast of st michael and all angels you will be received in the name of michael a high one well fitted to a warlike saint though i think that i shall still call you olaf so farewell my godson to be until we meet at the cathedral where i shall shine in the reflected light of all your virtues  then she sighed laughed a little and glided away  in due course a priest of the chapel came to summon me there saying that the bishop barnabas awaited me i went and made my confession though in truth i had little to tell him that he did not already know afterwards the good old man who by now was quite recovered from his hurts and imprisonment accompanied me to my quarters where we ate together he told me that before he attended in the chapel he had been received by the empress who had spoken to him very kindly making light of their difference of opinion as to images and with her own mouth confirmed him in his bishopric even hinting at his possible promotion  this my son he added i am well aware i owe to your good offices  i asked him if he would return at once to upper egypt where he had his bishopric  no my son he answered not yet awhile the truth is that there have arrived here the chief man in my diocese and his daughter he is a descendant of the old pharaohs of the egyptians who lives near the second cataract of the nile almost on the borders of ethiopia whither the accursed children of mahomet have not yet forced their way he is still a great man among the egyptians who look upon him as their lawful prince his mission here is to try to plan a new war upon the followers of the prophet who he holds might be assailed by the empire at the mouths of the nile while he attacked them with his egyptians from the south  now i grew interested who had always grieved over the loss of egypt to the empire and asked what was this princes name  magas my son and his daughter is named heliodore ah she is such a woman as i would see you wed beautiful indeed and good and true as she is beautiful with a high spirit also such as befits her ancient blood mayhap you will note her in the cathedral nay i forgot not there but afterwards in this palace since it is the command of the empress to whom i have been speaking of their matters that these two should come to dwell here for a while after that i hope we shall all return to egypt together though magas being on a secret mission does not travel under his own name but as a merchant  suddenly he paused and began to stare at my throat  is aught wrong with my armour father i asked  no son i was looking at that trinket which you wear of course i have noted it before but never closely it is strange very strange  what is strange father  only that i have seen another like it  i dare say you have i answered laughing for when i would not give this to the augusta it pleased her to have it copied  no no i mean in egypt and what is more a story hung to the jewel  on whom where what story i asked eagerly  oh i cannot stay to tell you now moreover your mind should be fixed upon immortal crowns and not on earthly necklaces i must be gone nay stay me not i am already late do you get you to your knees and pray till your godparents come to fetch you  then in spite of all i could do to keep him he went muttering strange exceeding strange and leaving me quite unfit for prayer    an hour later i was riding through the streets of the mighty city clad in shining armour as the season was that of october in which the feast of st michael falls we wore cloaks although the day being warm they were little needed mine was of some fine white stuff with a red cross broidered on the right shoulder stauracius the eunuch and great minister who had been ordered to act as my godfather rode alongside of me on a mule because he dared not mount a horse sweating beneath his thick robe of office and as i heard from time to time cursing me his godson and all this ceremony beneath his breath on my other hand was my godmother martina riding an arab mare which she did well enough having been brought up to horsemanship on the plains of greece her mood was varied for now she laughed at the humour of the scene and now she was sad almost to tears  the streets were lined with thousands of the pleasureloving people of the city who had come out to see the show of the empress going in state to the cathedral they were gathered even on the flat housetops and in the entrances to the public buildings and open places but the glory of the sight was centred not about me with my escort of guards and chanting priests but in irenes self preceded and followed by glittering regiments of soldiers she drove in her famous golden chariot drawn by eight milkwhite steeds each of which was led by a bejewelled noble her dress was splendid and covered with sparkling gems and on her yellow hair she wore a crown as she went the multitudes shouted their welcome and she bowed to right and left in answer to the shouts now and again however bands of armed men clad in a dress of a peculiar colour emerged from side streets and hooted crying  where is the augustus give us the augustus we will not be ruled by a woman and her eunuchs  these men were of the party of constantine and set on by him once indeed there was a tumult for some of them tried to bar the road till they were driven away leaving a few dead or wounded behind them but still the crowds shouted and the empress bowed as though nothing had happened and thus by a somewhat winding route we came to st sophia  the augusta entered and presently i and those with me followed her into the wonderful cathedral i see it now not in particular but as a whole with its endless columns its aisles and apses and its glittering mosaics shining through the holy gloom across which shot bars of light from the high windowplaces all the great place was full of the noblest in the city rank upon rank of them come thither to see the empress in her glory at the great feast of st michael which year by year she attended thus  at the altar waited the patriarch in his splendid robes attended by many bishops and priests among them barnabas of egypt the service began i and some other converts standing together near to the altar rail the details of it do not return to me sweet voices sang censers gave forth their incense banners waved and images of the saints standing everywhere smiled upon us fixedly some of us were baptised and some who had already been baptised were received publicly into the fellowship of the church i among them my godfather stauracius a deacon prompting him and my godmother martina spoke certain words on my behalf and i also spoke certain words which i had learned  the splendid patriarch a sourfaced man with a slight squint gave me his especial blessing the bishop barnabas upon whom as i noted the patriarch was always careful to turn his back offered up a prayer my godfather and godmother embraced me stauracius smacking the air at a distance for which i was grateful and martina touching me gently with her lips upon the brow the empress smiled upon me and as i passed her patted me on the shoulder then the sacrament was celebrated whereof the empress partook first next we converts with our godparents and afterwards a number of the congregation  it was over at last the augusta and her attendants marched down the cathedral towards the great western doors priests followed and among them we converts whom the people applauded openly  looking to right and left of me for i was weary of keeping my gaze fixed upon the floor presently i caught sight of a face whilst as yet it was far away it seemed to draw me i knew not why the face was that of a woman she stood by an old and statelylooking man with a white beard the last of a line of worshippers next to the aisle along which the procession passed and i saw that she was young and fair  down the long resounding aisle the procession marched slowly now i was nearer to the face and perceived that it was lovely as some richhued flower the large eyes were dark and soft as a deers the complexion too was somewhat dark as though the sun had kissed it the lips were red and curving and about them played a little smile that was full of mystery as the eyes were full of thought and tenderness the figure was delicate and rounded but not so very tall all these things and others i noted yet it was not by them that i was drawn and held but rather because i knew this lady  she was the woman of whom years ago i had dreamed on the night on which i broke into the wanderers tomb at aar  never for one moment did i doubt me of this truth i was sure i was sure it did not even need while she turned to whisper something to her companion that the cloak she wore should open a little revealing on her breast a necklace of emerald beetles separated by inlaid shells of pale and ancient gold  she was watching the procession with interest yet somewhat idly when she caught sight of me whom from where she stood she could scarcely have seen before of a sudden her face grew doubtful and troubled like to that of one who has just received some hurt she saw the ornament about my neck she turned pale and had she not gripped the arm of the man beside her would i think have fallen then her eyes caught mine and fate had us in its net  she leaned forward gazing gazing all her soul in those dark eyes and i too gazed and gazed the great cathedral vanished with its glittering crowds the sound of chanting and of feet that marched died from my ears in place of these i saw a mighty columned temple and two stone figures taller than pines seated on a plain and through the moonlit silence heard a sweet voice murmuring  farewell for this life farewell  now we were near to each other now i was passing her i who might not stay my hand brushed hers and oh it was as though i had drunk a cup of wine a spirit entered into me and bending i whispered in her ear speaking in the latin tongue since greek which all knew i did not dare to use ave post secula greeting after the ages  i saw her bosom heave yes and heard her whisper back  ave  so she knew me also    chapter vi  heliodore  that night there was feasting at the palace and i olaf now known as michael as a convert was one of the chief guests so that for me there was no escape i sat very silent so silent that the augusta frowned though she was too far off to speak to me the banquet came to an end at last and before midnight i was free to go still without word from the empress who withdrew herself as i thought in an illhumour  i sought my bed but in it knew little of sleep i had found her for whom during all the long years i had been searching though i did not understand that i was searching after the ages i had found her and she had found me her eyes said it and unless i dreamed her sweet voice said it also  who was she doubtless that heliodore daughter of magas the prince of whom the bishop barnabas had spoken to me oh now i understood what he meant when he spoke of another necklace like to that i wore and yet would explain nothing it lay upon the breast of heliodore heliodore who was such a one as he wished that i might wed well certainly i wished it too but alas how could i wed who was in irenes power a toy for her to play with or to break and how would it fare with any woman whom it was known that i wished to wed i must be secret until she was gone from constantinople and in this way or in that i could follow her i who had ever been openminded must learn to keep my own counsel  now too i remembered how barnabas had said the augusta commanded that this prince magas and his daughter should come to the palace as her guests well the place was vast a town in itself and likely enough i should not see them there yet i longed to see one of them as never i had longed for anything before i was sure also that no fears could keep us apart even though i knew the road before me to be full of dangers and of trials knew that i went with my life in my hand the life of which i had been quite careless but that now had become so dear to me for did not the world hold another to whom it belonged  the night passed away i rose and went about my morning duties scarcely were these finished when a messenger summoned me to the presence of the augusta i followed him with a sinking heart certain that those woes which i had foreseen were about to begin also now there was no woman in the whole world whom i less wished to see than irene empress of the earth  i was led to the small audience chamber whereof i have already spoken that on the floor of which was the mosaic of the goddess venus making pretence to kill her lover there i found the augusta seated in a chair of state the minister stauracius my godfather who glowered at me as i entered some secretaries and martina my godmother who was the lady in attendance  i saluted the empress who bowed graciously and said  general olafnay i forgot general michael your godfather stauracius has something to say which i trust will please you as much as it does him and me speak stauracius  beloved godson began stauracius in a voice of sullen rage it has pleased the augusta to appoint you  on the prayer and advice of me stauracius interrupted the empress  on the prayer and advice of me stauracius repeated the eunuch like a talking bird to be one of her chamberlains and master of the palace at a salary of i forget the sum but it was a great one with all the power and perquisites to that office pertaining in reward of the services which you have rendered to her and the empire thank the empress for her gracious favour  nay interrupted irene again thank your beloved godfather stauracius who has given me no peace until i offered you this preferment which has suddenly become vacant stauracius alone knows why for i do not oh you were wise olafi mean michaelto choose stauracius for a godfather though i warn him she added archly that in his natural love he must not push you forward too fast lest others should begin to show that jealousy which is a stranger to his noble nature come hither michael and kiss my hand upon your appointment  so i advanced and kneeling kissed the augustas hand according to custom on such occasions noting as doubtless stauracius did also that she pressed it hard enough against my lips then i rose and said  i thank the augusta  and my godfather stauracius she interrupted  and my godfather stauracius i echoed for her and his goodness towards me yet with humility i venture to say that i am a soldier who knows nothing whatsoever of the duties of a chamberlain and of a master of the palace and therefore i beg that someone else more competent may be chosen to fill these high offices  on hearing these words stauracius stared at me with his round and owllike eyes never before had he known an officer in constantinople who wished to decline power and more pay scarcely indeed could he believe his ears but the augusta only laughed  baptism has not changed you olaf she said who ever were simple as i believe your duties will be at any rate your godfather and godmother will instruct you in themespecially your godmother so no more of such foolish talk stauracius you may be gone to attend to the affairs of which we have been speaking as i see you burn to do and take those secretaries with you for the scratching of their pens sets my teeth on edge bide here a moment general for as master of the palace it will be your duty to receive certain guests today of whom i wish to speak with you bide you also martina that you may remember my words in case this unpractised officer should forget them  stauracius and his secretaries bowed themselves out leaving the three of us alone  now olaf or michaelwhich do you wish to be called  it is more easy for a man to alter his nature than his name i answered  have you altered your nature if so your manners remain much what they were well then be olaf in private and michael in public for often an alias is convenient enough hark i would read you a lesson as the wise king solomon said everything has its place and time it is good to repent you of your sins and to think about your soul but i pray you do so no more at my feasts especially when they are given in your honour last night you sat at the board like a mummy at an egyptian banquet had your skull stood on it filled with wine it could scarce have looked grimmer than did your face be more cheerful i pray you or i will have you tonsured and promoted to be a bishop like that old heretic barnabas of whom you are so fond ah you smile at last and i am glad to see it now hearken again this afternoon there comes to the palace a certain old egyptian named magas whom i place in your especial charge and with him his wifeat least i think she is his wife  nay mistress his daughter interrupted martina  oh his daughter said the augusta suspiciously i did not know she was his daughter what is she like martina  i have not seen her empress but someone said that she is a blacklooking woman such as the nile breeds  is it so then i charge you olaf keep her far from me for i love not these ugly black women whose woolly hair always smells of grease yes i give you leave to court her if you will since thereby you may learn some secrets and she laughed merrily  i bowed saying that i would obey the augustas orders to the best of my power and she went on  olaf i would discover the truth concerning this magas and his schemes which as a soldier you are well fitted to find out it seems he has a plan for the recovery of egypt out of the hands of the followers of that accursed false prophet whose soul dwells with satan now i would win back egypt if i may and thereby add glory to my name and the empire hear all that he proposes study it well and make report to me afterwards i will see him alone who for the present will send him a letter by the hand of martina here bidding him open all his heart to you for a week or more i shall have no time to spend upon this magas who must give myself to business upon which hangs my power and perchance my life  these words she spoke heavily then fell into a fit of brooding rousing herself she went on  did you note yesterday olaf if you had any mind left for the things of earth that as i drove in state through the streets many met me with sullen silence while others cursed me openly and shouted where is the augustus give us constantine we will have no womans rule  i saw and heard something of these things augusta also that certain of the soldiers on guard in the city had a mutinous air  aye but what you did not see and hear was that a plot had been laid to murder me in the cathedral i got wind of it in time and if you were still governor of yonder prison youd know where the murderers are today yet theyre but tools it is their captains whom i want well torture may make them speak stauracius has gone to see to it oh the strife is fierce and doubtful i walk blindfold along a precipice above are fortunes heights and beneath black ruin perhaps youd be wise to get you to constantine olaf and become his man as many are doing since hed be glad of you no need to shake your head for thats not your way you are no hound to bite the hand that feeds you like these streetbred dogs would that i could keep you nearer to me where hour by hour you might help me with your counsel and your quiet strength but it may not beas yet i raise you as high as i dare but it must be done step by step for even now some grow jealous take heed to what you eat olaf see that your guards are northmen and beneath your doublet wear mail especially at night moreover unless i send for you do not come near me too often and when we meet be my humble servant like others aye learn to crawl and kiss the ground above all keep secret as the grave  now she went on after a pause during which i stood silent what is there more oh with your new offices youll retain that of captain of my guard for i would be well watched during these next few weeks follow up the matter of the egyptian you may find advancement in it perchance one day you will be the general i send against the moslemsif i can spare you on all this matter be secret also for once rumour buzzes over it that peach rots the egyptian and his swarthy girl come to the palace today when he will receive my letter meet him and see them well housed though not too near me martina will help you now be gone and leave me to my battles  so i went and she watched me to the door with eyes that were full of tenderness    again there is a blank in my memory or my vision i suppose that magas and his daughter heliodore arrived at the palace on the day of my interview with irene of which i have told i suppose that i welcomed them and conducted them to the guest house that had been made ready for them in the gardens doubtless i listened eagerly to the first words which heliodore spoke to me save that one in the cathedral the word of greeting doubtless i asked her many things and she gave me many answers but of all this nothing remains  what comes back to me is a picture of the egyptian prince magas and myself seated at some meal in a chamber overlooking the moonlit palace garden we were alone and this noble whitebearded man hooknosed and hawkeyed was telling me of the troubles of his countrymen the christian copts of egypt  look on me sir he said as i could prove to you were it worth while and as many could bear witness for the records have been kept i am a descendant in the true line from the ancient pharaohs of my country moreover my daughter through her grecian mother is sprung from the ptolemies our race is christian and has been for these three hundred years although it was among the last to be converted yet noble as we are we suffer every wrong at the hands of the moslems our goods and lands are doubly taxed and if we should go into the towns of lower egypt we must wear garments on which the cross is broidered as a badge of shame yet where i livenear to the first cataract of the nile and not so very far from the city of old thebesthe prophetworshippers have no real power i am still the true ruler of that district as the bishop barnabas will tell you and at any moment were my standard to be lifted i could call three thousand coptic spears to fight for christ and egypt moreover if money were forthcoming the hosts of nubia could be raised and together we might sweep down on the moslems like the nile in flood and drive them back to alexandria  then he went on to set out his plans which in sum were that a roman fleet and army should appear at the mouths of the nile to besiege and capture alexandria and with his help massacre or drive out every moslem in egypt the scheme which he set forth with much detail seemed feasible enough and when i had mastered its particulars i promised to report it to the empress and afterwards to speak with him further  i left the chamber and presently stood in the garden although it was autumn time the night in this mild climate was very warm and pleasant and the moonlight threw black shadows of the trees across the paths under one of these trees an ancient greenleaved oak the largest of a little grove i saw a woman sitting perchance i knew who she was perchance i had come thither to meet her i cannot say at least this was not our first meeting by many for as i came she rose lifting her flowerlike face towards my own and next moment was in my arms  when we had kissed our full we began to talk seated hand in hand beneath the oak  what have you been doing this day beloved she asked  much what i do every day heliodore i have attended to my duties which are threefold as chamberlain as master of the palace and as captain of the guard also for a little while i saw the augusta to whom i had to report various matters the interview was brief since a rumour had reached her that the armenian regiments refuse to take the oath of fidelity to her alone as she has commanded should be done and demand that the name of the emperor her son should be coupled with hers as before this report disturbed her much so that she had little time for other business  did you speak of my fathers matter olaf  aye shortly she listened and asked whether i were sure that i had got the truth from him she added that i had best test it by what i could win from you by any arts that a man may use for heliodore because of something that my godmother martina said to her it is fixed in her mind that you are blackskinned and very ugly therefore the augusta who does not like any man about her to care for other women thinks i may make love to you with safety so i prayed for leave from my duties on the guard this evening that i might sup with your father in the guesthouse and see what i could learn from one or both of you  love makes you clever olaf but hearken i do not believe that the empress thinks me black and ugly any longer as it chanced while i walked in the inner garden this afternoon where you said i might go when i wished to be quite alone dreaming of our love and you i looked up and saw an imperial woman of middle age who was gorgeous as a peacock watching me from a little distance i went on my way pretending to see no one and heard the lady say  has all this trouble driven me mad martina or did i behold a woman beautiful as one of the nymphs of my peoples fables wandering yonder among those bushes  i repeat her very words olaf not because they are truefor remember she saw me at a distance and against a background of rocks and autumn flowersbut because they were her words which i think you ought to hear with those that followed them  irene has said many false things in her life i said smiling but by all the saints these were not among them  then we embraced again and after that was finished heliodore her head resting on my shoulder continued her story  what was she like mistress asked the lady martina for by this time i had passed behind some little trees i have seen no one who is beautiful in this garden except yourself  she was clad in a clinging white robe martina that left her arms and bosom barebeing alone olaf i wore my egyptian dress beneath my cloak which i had laid down because of the heat of the sun she was not so very tall yet rounded and most graceful her eyes seemed large and dark martina like her hair her face was tinted like a richhued rose oh were i a man she seemed such a one as i should love who like all my people have ever worshipped beauty yet what did i say that she put me in mind of a nymph of greece nay that was not so it was of a goddess of old egypt that she put me in mind for on her face was the dreaming smile which i have seen on that of a statue of mother isis whom the egyptians worshipped moreover she wore just such a headdress as i have noted upon those statues  now the lady martina answered surely you must have dreamed mistress the only egyptian woman in the palace is the daughter of the old coptic noble magas who is in olafs charge and though i am told that she is not so ugly as i heard at first olaf has never said to me that she was like a goddess what you saw was doubtless some image of fortune conjured up by your mind this i take to be the best of omens who in these doubtful days grow superstitious  would olaf tell one woman that another was like a goddess martina even though she to whom he spoke was his godmother and a dozen years younger than himself come she added and let us see if we can find this egyptian  then heliodore went on not knowing what to do i stood still there against the rockwork and the flowers till presently round the bushes appeared the splendid lady and martina  now when i olaf heard all this i groaned and said  oh heliodore it was the augusta herself  yes it was the augusta as i learned presently well they came and i curtsied to them  are you the daughter of magas the egyptian asked the lady eyeing me from head to foot  yes madam i answered i am heliodore the daughter of magas i pray that i have done no wrong in walking in this garden but the general olaf the master of the palace gave me leave to come here  and did the general olaf whom we know as michael give you that necklace which you wear also o daughter of magas nay you must needs answer me for i am the augusta  now i curtsied again and said  not so o augusta the necklace is from old egypt and was found upon the body of a royal lady in a tomb i have worn it for many years  indeed and that which the general michael wears came also from a tomb  yes he told me so augusta i said  it would seem that the two must once have been one daughter of magas  it may be so augusta i do not know  now the empress looked about her and the lady martina dropping behind began to fan herself  are you married girl she asked  no i answered  are you affianced  now i hesitated a little then answered no again  you seem to be somewhat doubtful on the point farewell for this while when you walk abroad in our garden which is open to you be pleased to array yourself in the dress of our country and not in that of a courtesan of egypt  what did you answer to that saying i asked  that which was not wise i fear olaf for my temper stirred me i answered madam i thank you for your permission to walk in your garden if ever i should do so again as your guest be sure that i will not wear garments which before byzantium was a village were sacred to the gods of my country and those of my ancestors the queens of egypt  and then i asked  the empress answered well spoken such would have been my own words had i been in your place moreover they are true and the robe becomes you well yet presume not too far girl seeing that byzantium is no longer a village and egypt has some fanatic moslem for a pharaoh who thinks little of your ancient blood  so i bowed and went and as i walked away heard the empress rating the lady martina about i know not what save that your name came into the matter and my own why does this empress talk so much about you olaf seeing that she has many officers who are higher in her service and why was she so moved about this matter of the necklace of golden shells  heliodore i answered i must tell now what i have hidden from you the augusta has been pleasedwhy i cannot say but chiefly i suppose because of late years it has been my fancy to keep myself apart from women which is rare in this landto show me certain favour i gather even that whether she means it or means it not she has thought of me as a husband  oh interrupted heliodore starting away from me now i understand everything and pray have you thought as a wife of her who has been a widow these ten years and has a son of twenty  god above us alone knows what i have or have not thought but it is certain that at present i think of her only as one who has been most kind to me but who is more to be feared than my worst foe if i have any  hush she said raising her finger i fancied i heard someone stir behind us  fear nothing i answered we are alone here for i set guards of my own company around the place with command to admit no one and my order runs against all save the empress in person  then we are safe olaf since this damp would disarrange her hair which i noted is curled with irons not by nature like my own oh olaf olaf how wonderful is the fate that has brought us together i say that when i saw you yonder in the cathedral for the first time since i was born i knew you again as you knew me that is why when you whispered to me greeting after the ages i gave you back your welcome i know nothing of the past if we lived and loved before that tale is lost to me but theres your dream and theres the necklace when i was a child olaf it was taken from the embalmed body of some royal woman who by tradition was of my own race yes and by records of which my father can tell you for he is among the last who can still read the writing of the old egyptians moreover she was very like me olaf for i remember her well as she lay in her coffin preserved by arts which the egyptians had she was young not much older than i am today and her story tells that she died in giving birth to a son who grew up a strong and vigorous man and although he was but half royal founded a new dynasty in egypt and became my forefather this necklace lay upon her breast and beneath it a writing on papyrus which said that when the half of it which was lost should be joined again to that half then those who had worn them would meet once more as mortals now the two halves of the necklace have met and we have met as god decreed and it is one and we are one for ever and for ever let every empress of the earth do what they will to part us  aye i answered embracing her again we are one for ever and for ever though perchance for a while we may be separated from time to time    chapter vii  victory or valhalla  a minute later i heard a rustle as of branches being moved by people thrusting their way through them a choked voice commanded  take him living or dead  armed men appeared about us four of them and one cried yield  i sprang up and drew the wanderers sword  who orders the general michael to yield in his own command i asked  i do answered the man yield or die  now thinking that these were robbers or murderers hired by some enemy i sprang at him nor was that battle long for at my first stroke he fell dead then the other three set on me but i wore mail beneath my doublet as irene had bade me do and their swords glanced moreover the old northern rage entered into me and these easterners were no match for my skill and strength first one and then another of them went down whereon the third fled away taking with him a grizzly wound behind for i struck him as he fled  now it seems there is an end of that i gasped to heliodore who was crouched upon the seat come let me take you to your father and summon my guards ere we meet more of these murderers  as i spoke a cloaked and hooded woman glided from the shelter of the trees behind and stood before us she threw back the hood from her head and the moonlight fell upon her face it was that of the empress but oh so changed by jealous rage that i should scarce have known her the large eyes seemed to flash fire the cheeks were white save where they had been touched with paint the lips trembled twice she tried to speak and failed but at the third effort words came  nay all is but begun she said in a voice that was full of hate know that i have heard your every word so traitor you would tell my secrets to this egyptian slut and then murder my own servants and she pointed to the dead and wounded men well you shall pay for it both of you that i swear  is it murder augusta i asked saluting when four assail one man and thinking them assassins he fights for his life and wins the fray  what are four such curs against you i should have brought a dozen yet it was at me you struck whateer they did i ordered them to do  had i known it augusta i would never have drawn sword who am your officer and obedient to the end  nay youd stab me with your tongue not with your sword she answered with something like a sob you say you are my obedient officer well now we will see smite me that boldfaced baggage dead or smite me dead i care not which then fall upon your sword  the first i cannot do augusta for it would be murder against one who has done no wrong and i will not stain my soul with murder  done no wrong has she not mocked me my years my widowhood yes and even my hair in the pride of herher youth me the empress of the world  now heliodore spoke for the first time  and has not the empress of the world called a poor maid of blood as noble as her own by shameful names she asked  for the second i went on before irene could answer i cannot do that either for it would be foul treason as well as murder to lift my sword against your anointed majesty but as for the third as is my duty that i will door rather suffer your servants to doif it pleases you to repeat the order later when you are calm  what cried heliodore would you go and leave me here then olaf by the gods my forefathers worshipped for ten thousand years and by the gods i worship ill find a means to follow you within an hour oh empress of the world there is another world you do not rule and there well call you to account  now irene stared at heliodore and heliodore stared back at her and the sight was very strange  at least you have spirit girl but think not that shall save you for theres no room for both of us on earth  if i go it may prove wide enough augusta i broke in  nay you shall not go olaf at least not yet my orders are that you do not fall upon your sword as for this egyptian witch well presently my people will be here then we will see  now i drew heliodore to the trunk of the great tree which stood near by and set myself in front of her  what are you about to do asked the empress  i am about to fight your eastern curs until i fall for no northern man will lift a sword against me even on your orders augusta when i am down this lady must play her own part as god shall guide her  have no fear olaf heliodore said gently i wear a dagger  scarcely had she spoken when there was a sound of many feet the man whom i had wounded had run shouting towards the palace rousing the soldiers both those on watch and those in their quarters now these began to arrive and to gather in the glade before the clump of trees for some guards who had heard the clash of arms guided them to the place they were of all races and sundry regiments greeks byzantines bulgars armenians socalled romans and with them a number of britons and northern men  seeing the empress and near by myself standing with drawn sword against the tree sheltering the lady heliodore also on the ground those whom i had cut down they halted one of their officers asked what they must do  kill me that man who has slain my servants or staytake him living screamed the augusta  now among those who had gathered was a certain lieutenant of my own a blueeyed flaxenhaired norwegian giant of the name of jodd this man loved me like a brother i believe because once it had been my fortune to save his life also often i had proved his friend when he was in trouble for in those days jodd got drunk at times and when he was drunk lost money which he could not pay  now when he saw my case i noted that this jodd who if sober was no fool at all although he seemed so slow and stupid whispered something to a comrade who was with him whereon the man turned and fled away like an arrow from the direction in which he went i guessed at once that he was running to the barracks close at hand where were stationed quite three hundred northmen all of whom were under my command  the soldiers prepared to obey the augustas orders as they were bound to do they drew their swords and a number of them advanced towards me slowly then it was that jodd with a few northmen moved between them and me and saluting the empress said in his bad greek  your pardon augusta but why are we asked to kill our own general  obey my orders fellow she answered  your pardon augusta said the stolid jodd but before we kill our own general whom you commanded us to obey in all things we would know why we must kill him it is a custom of our country that no man shall be killed until he has been heard general olaf and drawing his short sword for the first time he saluted me in form be pleased to explain to us why you are to be killed or taken prisoner  now a tumult arose and a eunuch in the background shouted to the soldiers to obey the empresss orders whereon again some of them began to advance  if no answer is given to my question went on jodd in his slow bulllike voice i fear that others must be killed besides the general olaf ho northmen to me northmen ho britons to me britons ho saxons to me saxons ho all who are not accursed greeks to me all who are not accursed greeks  now at each cry of jodds men leapt forward from the gathering crowd and to the number of fifty or more in all marshalled themselves behind him those of each nation standing shoulder to shoulder in little groups before me  is my question to be answered asked jodd because if not although we be but one against ten i think that ere the general olaf is cut down or taken there will be good fighting this night  then i spoke saying  captain jodd and comrades i will answer your question and if i speak wrongly let the augusta correct me this is the trouble the lady heliodore here is my affianced wife we were speaking together in this garden as the affianced do the empress who unseen by us was hidden behind those trees overheard our talk which for reasons best known to herself for in it there was naught of treason or any matter of the state made her so angry that she set her servants on to kill me thinking them murderers or robbers i defended myself and there they lie save one who fled away wounded then the empress appeared and ordered me to kill the lady heliodore comrades look on her whom the empress ordered me to kill and say whether were she your affianced you would kill her even to please the empress and stepping to one side i showed them heliodore in all her loveliness standing against the tree the drawn dagger in her hand  now from those that jodd had summoned there went up a roar of no while even the rest were silent irene sprang forward and cried  are my orders to be canvassed and debated obey cut this man down or take him living i care not which and with him all who cling to him or tomorrow you hang every one of you  now the soldiers who had gathered also began to form up under their officers for they saw that before them was war and death by this time they were many and as the alarm spread minute by minute more arrived  yield or we attack said he who had taken command of them  i do not think that we yield answered jodd and just then there came a sound of men running in ordered companies from the direction of the northmens barracks were jodds messenger had told his tale  i am sure that we do not yield continued jodd and suddenly raised the wild northern warcry valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla  instantly from three hundred throats above the sound of the running feet that drew ever nearer came the answering shout of valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla then out of the gloom up dashed the northmen  now other shouts arose of olaf olaf olaf where is our general olaf where is redsword  here comrades roared jodd and up they came those fierce bearded men glad with the lust of battle and ranged themselves by companies before us again the great voice of jodd was heard calling  empress do you give us olaf and his girl and swear by your christ that no harm shall come to them or must we take them for ourselves  never she cried back the only thing i give to you is death on to these rebels soldiers  now seeing what must come i strove to speak but jodd shouted again  be silent olaf for this hour you are not our general you are a prisoner whom it pleases us to rescue ring him round northmen ring him round bring the empress too she will serve as hostage  now some of them drew behind us then they began to advance taking us along with them and i who was skilled in war saw their purpose they were drawing out into the open glade where they could see to fight and where their flanks would be protected by a stream of water on the one hand and a dense belt of trees on the other  in her rage the empress threw herself upon the ground but two great fellows lifted her up by the arms and thrust her along with us marching thus we reached the point that they had chosen for the greeks were in confusion and not ready to attack there we halted just on the crest of a little rise of ground  augusta i said in the name of god i pray you to give way these northmen hate your byzantines and will take this chance to pay off their scores moreover they love me and will die to a man ere they see me harmed and then how shall i protect you in the fray  she only glared at me and made no answer  the attack began by this time fifteen hundred or so of the imperial troops had collected and against them stood perhaps four hundred men in all so that the odds were great still they had no horsemen or archers and our position was very good also we were northmen and they were grecian scum  on came the byzantines screaming irene irene in a formation of companies ranged one behind the other for their object was to break in our centre by their weight jodd saw and gave some orders very good orders i thought them then he sheathed his shortsword seized the great battleaxe which was his favourite weapon and placed himself in front of our triple line that waited in dead silence  up the slope surged the charge and on the crest of it the battle met at first the weight of the greeks pressed us back but oh they went down before the northmens steel like corn before the sickle and soon that rush was stayed breast to breast they hewed and thrust and so fearful was the fray that irene forgetting her rage clung to me to protect her  the fight hung doubtful as in a dream i watched the giant jodd cut down a gorgeous captain the axe shearing through his golden armour as though it were but silk i watched a comrade of my own fall beneath a spearthrust i gazed at the face of heliodore who stared wideeyed at the red scene and at the whitelipped irene who was clinging to my arm now we were being pressed back again we who at this point had at most two hundred men some of whom were down to bear the onslaught of twice that number and do what i would my fingers strayed to my swordhilt  our triple line bent in like a bow and began to break the scales of war hung on the turn when from the dense belt of trees upon our left suddenly rose the cry of valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla for which i who had overheard jodds orders was waiting these were his ordersthat half of the northmen should creep down behind the belt of trees in their dense shadow and thus outflank the foe  forth they sprang by companies of fifty the moonlight gleaming on their mail and there three hundred yards away a new battle was begun now the greeks in front of us fearing for their rear wavered a moment and fell back perhaps ten paces i saw the opportunity and could bear no more who before all things was a soldier  shouting to some of our wounded to watch the women i drew my sword and leapt forward  i come northmen i cried and was greeted with a roar of  olaf redsword follow olaf redsword for so the soldiers named me  steady northmen shoulder to shoulder northmen i cried back now at them charge valhalla victory or valhalla  down the slope they went before our rush in thirty paces they were but a huddled mob on which our swords played like lightnings we rolled them back on to their supports and those supports outflanked began to flee we swept through and through them we slew them by hundreds we trod them beneath our victorious feet andoh in that battle a strange thing happened to me i thought i saw my dead brother ragnar fighting at my side aye and i thought i heard him cry to me in that lost remembered voice  the old blood runs in you yet you christian man oh you fight well you christian man we of valhalla give you greetings olaf redsword valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla  it was done some were fled but more were dead for once at grips the northman showed no mercy to the greek back we came those who were left of us for many perhaps a hundred were not and formed a ring round the women and the wounded  well done olaf said heliodore but irene only looked at me with a kind of wonder in her eyes  now the leaders of the northmen began to talk among themselves but although from time to time they glanced at me they did not ask me to join in their talk presently jodd came forward and said in his slow voice  olaf redsword we love you who have always loved us your comrades as we have shown you tonight you have led us well olaf and considering our small numbers we have just won a victory of which we are proud but our necks are in the noose as yours is and we think that in this case our best course is to be bold therefore we name you cæsar having defeated the greeks we propose now to take the palace and to talk with the regiments without many of whom are disloyal and shout for constantine whom after all they hate only a little less than they do irene yonder we know not what will be the end of the matter and do not greatly care who set our fortunes upon a throw of the dice but we think there is a good chance of victory do you accept and will you throw in your sword with ours  how can i i answered when there stands the empress whose bread i have eaten and to whom i have sworn fealty  an empress it seems who desires to slay you over some matter that has to do with a woman olaf the daggers of her assassins have cut this thread of fealty moreover as it chances she is in our power and as we cannot make our crime against her blacker than it is we propose to rid you and ourselves of this empress who is our enemy and who for her great wickedness well deserves to die such is our offer to take or to leave as time is short should you refuse it we abandon you to your fate and go to make our terms with constantine who also hates this empress and even now is plotting her downfall  as he spoke i saw certain men draw near to irene for a purpose which i could guess and stepped between her and them  the augusta is my mistress i said and although i attacked some of her troops but now and she has wronged me much still i defend her to the last  little use in that olaf seeing that you are but one and we are many answered jodd come will you be cæsar or will you not  now irene crept up behind me and whispered in my ear  accept she said it pleases me well be cæsar as my husband so you will save my life and my throne of which i vow to you an equal share with the help of your northmen and the legions i command and who cling to me we can defeat constantine and rule the world together this petty fray is nothing what matters it if some lives have been lost in a palace tumult the world lies in your grasp take it olaf and with it me  i heard and understood now had come the great moment of my life something told me that on the one hand were majesty and empire on the other much pain and sorrow yet with these a certain holy joy and peace it was the latter that i chose as doubtless fate or god had decreed that i should do  i thank you augusta i said but while i can protect her i will not seize a throne over the body of one who has been kind to me nor will i buy it at the price you offer there stands my predestined wife and i can marry no other woman  now irene turned to heliodore and said in a swift low voice  do you understand this matter lady let us have done with jealousies and be plain for the lives of all of us hang upon threads that for some must break within a day or two and with them those of a thousand thousand others aye the destiny of the world is at stake you say you love this man whom i will tell you i love also well if you win him and he lives which he scarce can hope to do he gets your kisses in whatever corner of the earth will shelter him and you if i win him the empire of the earth is his moreover girl she added with meaning empresses are not always jealous sometimes even they can look the other way there would be high place for you within our court and who knows your turn might come at length also your fathers plans would be forwarded to the last pound of gold in our treasury and the last soldier in our service within five years mayhap he might rule egypt as our governor what say you  heliodore looked at the empress with that strange slow smile of hers then she looked at me and answered  i say what olaf says there are two empires in the case one which you can give augusta is of the world the other which i can give him here is only a womans heart yet as i think of another eternal world that you do not know i say what olaf says let olaf speak augusta  empress i said slowly again i thank you but it may not be my fate lies here and i laid my hand upon the heart of heliodore  you are mistaken olaf answered the empress in a cold and quiet voice but seemingly without anger your fate lies there and she pointed to the ground then added believe me i am sorry for you are a man of whom any woman might be proudyes even an empress i have always thought it and i thought it again just now when i saw you lead that charge against those curs in armour and she pointed towards the bodies of the greeks so it is finished as perchance i am if i must die let it be on your sword olaf  your answer olaf redsword called jodd you have talked enough  your answer yes your answer the northmen echoed  the empress has offered to share her crown with me jodd but friends it cannot be because of this lady to whom i am affianced  marry them both shouted a rude voice but jodd replied  then that is soon settled out of our path olaf and look the other way when you turn your head again there will be no empress to trouble you except one of your own choosing  on hearing these words and seeing the swords draw near irene clutched hold of me for always she feared death above everything  you will not see me butchered she gasped  not while i live i answered hearken friends i am the general of the augustas guard and if she dies for honours sake i must die first strike then if you will but through my body  tear her away called a voice  comrades i went on be not so mad tonight we have done that which has earned us death but while the empress lives you have a hostage in your hands with whom you can buy pardon as a lump of clay what worth is she to you hark the regiments from the city  as i spoke from the direction of the palace came a sound of many voices and of the tread of five thousand feet  true enough said jodd with composure they are on us and now it is too late to storm the palace olaf like many another man you have lost your chance of glory for a woman or who knows perhaps youve won it well comrades as i take it you are not minded to fly and be hunted down like rats only one thing remainsto die in a fashion they will remember in byzantium olaf youd best mind the women i will take command ring round comrades ring round tis a good place for it set the wounded in the middle keep that empress living for the present but when all is done kill her well be her escort to the gates of hell for there shes bound if ever woman was  then without murmur or complaint almost in silence indeed they formed odins ring that triple circle of the northmen doomed to die the terrible circle that on many a battlefield has been hidden at last beneath the heap of fallen foes  the regiments moved up there were three of them of full strength irene stared about her seeking some loophole of escape and finding none heliodore and i talked together in low tones making our tryst beyond the grave the regiments halted within fifty paces of us they liked not the look of odins ring and the ground over which they had marched and the fugitives with whom they had spoken told them that many of them looked their last upon the moon  some mounted generals rode towards us and asked who was in command of the northmen when they learned that it was jodd they invited him to a parley the end of it was that jodd and two others stepped twenty paces from our ranks and met a councillorit was stauraciusand two of the generals in the open where no treachery could well be practised especially as stauracius was not a man of war here they talked together for a long while then jodd and his companions returned and jodd said so that all might hear him  hearken these are the terms offered that we return to our barracks in peace bearing our weapons that nothing be laid to our charge under any law military or civil by the state or private persons for this nights slaying and tumult and that in guarantee thereof twelve hostages of high rank upon whose names we have agreed be given into our keeping that we retain our separate stations in the service of the empire or have leave to quit that service within three months with the gratuity of a quarters pay and go where we will unmolested but that in return for these boons we surrender the person of the empress unharmed and with her that of the general olaf to whom a fair trial is promised before a military court that with her own voice the augusta shall confirm all these undertakings before she leaves our ranks such is the offer comrades  and if we refuse it what asked a voice  this that we shall be ringed round and either starved out or shot down by archers or if we try to escape that we shall be overwhelmed by numbers and any of us who chance to be taken living shall be hanged sound and wounded together  now the leaders of the northmen consulted irene watched them for awhile then turned to me and asked  what will they do olaf  i cannot say augusta i answered but i think that they will offer to surrender you and not myself since they may doubt them of that fair trial which is promised to me  which means she said that whether i live or die all these brave men will be sacrificed to you olaf who after all must perish with them as will this egyptian are you prepared to accept that bloodoffering olaf if so you must have changed from the man i loved  no augusta i answered i am not prepared rather would i trust myself into your power augusta  the conference of the officers had come to an end their leader advanced and said  we accept the terms except as to the matter of olaf redsword the empress may go free but olaf redsword our general whom we love we will not surrender first will we die  good said jodd i looked for such words from you  then he marched out with his companions and again met stauracius and the two generals of the greeks after they had talked a little while he returned and said  those two officers being men would have agreed but stauracius the eunuch who seems in command will not agree he says that olaf redsword must be surrendered with the empress we answered that in this case soon there would be no empress to surrender except one ready for burial he replied that was as god might decree either both must be surrendered or both be held  do you know why the dog said that whispered irene to me it was because those northmen have let slip the offer i made to you but now and he is jealous of you and fears you may take his power well if i live one day he shall pay for this who cares so little for my life  so she spoke but i made no answer instead i turned to heliodore saying  you see how matters stand beloved either i must surrender myself or all these brave men must perish and we with them for myself i am ready to die but i am not willing that you and they should die also if i yield i can do no worse than die whereas perchance after all things will take another turn now what say you  i say follow your heart olaf she replied steadily honour comes first of all the rest is with god wherever you go there i soon shall be  i thank you i answered your mind is mine  then i stepped forward and said  comrades it is my turn to throw in this great game i have heard and considered all and i think it best that i should be surrendered with the augusta to the greeks  we will not surrender you they shouted  comrades i am still your general and my order is that you surrender me also i have other orders to give to you that you guard this lady heliodore to the last and that while one of you remains alive she shall be to you as though she were that mans daughter or mother or sister to help and protect as best he may in every circumstance seen or unforeseen further that with her you guard her father the noble egyptian magas will you promise this to me  aye they roared in answer  you hear them heliodore i said know that henceforth you are one of a large family and however great your enemies that you will never lack a friend comrades i went on this is my second order and perchance the last that i shall ever give to you unless you hear that i am evilly treated in the palace yonder stay quiet but if that tidings should reach you then all oaths are broken do what you can and will  aye they roared again    afterwards what happened it comes back to me but dimly i think they swore the empress on the blood of christ that i should go unharmed i think i embraced heliodore before them all and gave her into their keeping i think i whispered into the ear of jodd to seek out the bishop barnabas and pray him to get her and her father away to egypt without delayyes even by force if it were needful then i think i left their lines and that as i went leading the augusta by the hand they gave to me the generals salute that i turned and saluted them in answer ere i yielded myself into the power of my godfather stauracius who greeted me with a false and sickly smile    chapter viii  the trial of olaf  i know not what time went by before i was put upon my trial but that trial i can still see as clearly as though it were happening before my eyes it took place in a long low room of the vast palace buildings that was lighted only by windowplaces set high up in the wall these walls were frescoed and at the end of the room above the seat of the judges was a rude picture in bright colours of the condemnation of christ by pilate pilate i remember was represented with a black face to signify his wickedness i suppose and in the air above him hung a redeyed imp shaped like a bat who gripped his robe with one claw and whispered into his ear  there were seven judges he who presided being a lawofficer and the other six captains of different grades chosen mostly from among the survivors of those troops whom the northmen had defeated on the night of the battle in the palace gardens as this was a military trial i was allowed no advocate to defend me nor indeed did i ask for any the court however was open and crowded with spectators among whom i saw most of the great officers of the palace stauracius with them also some ladies one of whom was martina my godmother the back of the long room was packed with soldiers and others not all of whom were my enemies  into this place i was brought guarded by four negroes great fellows armed with swords whom i knew to be chosen out of the number of the executioners of the palace and the city indeed one of them had served under me when i was governor of the state prison and been dismissed by me because of some cruelty which he had practised  noting all these things and the pity in martinas eyes i knew that i was already doomed but as i had expected nothing else this did not trouble me over much  i stood before the judges and they stared at me  why do you not salute us fellow asked one of them a mincing greek captain whom i had seen running like a hare upon the night of the fray  because captain i am of senior rank to any whom i see before me and as yet uncondemned therefore if salutes are in the question it is you who should salute me  at this speech they stared at me still harder than before but among the soldiers at the end of the hall there arose something like a murmur of applause  waste no time in listening to his insolence said the president of the court clerk set out the case  then a blackrobed man who sat beneath the judges rose and read the charge to me from a parchment it was brief and to the effect that i michael formerly known as olaf or olaf redsword a northman in the service of the empress irene a general in her armies a chamberlain and master of the palace had conspired against the empress had killed her servants had detained her person threatening to murder her had made war upon her troops and slain some hundreds of them by the help of other northmen and wounded many more  i was asked what i pleaded to this charge and replied  i am not guilty  then witnesses were called the first of these was the fourth man whom irene had set upon me who alone escaped with a wound behind this fellow having been carried into court for he could not walk leaned over a bar for he could not sit down and told his story when he had finished i was allowed to examine him  why did the empress order you and your companions to attack me i asked  i think because she saw you kiss the egyptian lady general at which answer many laughed  you tried to kill me did you not  yes general for the empress ordered us so to do  then what happened  you killed or cut down three of us one after the other general being too skilful and strong for us as i turned to fly me you wounded here and dragging himself round with difficulty he showed how my sword had fallen on a part where no soldier should receive a wound at this sight those in the court laughed again  did i provoke you in any way before you attacked me  no indeed general it was the empress you provoked by kissing the beautiful egyptian lady at least i think so since every time you kissed each other she seemed to become more mad and at last ordered us to kill both of you  now the laughter grew very loud for even the court officers could no longer restrain themselves and the ladies hid their faces in their hands and tittered  away with that fool shouted the president of the court and the poor fellow was hustled out what became of him afterwards i do not know though i can guess  now appeared witness after witness who told of the fray which i have described already though for the most part they tried to put another colour on the matter of many of these men i asked no questions indeed growing weary of their tales i said at length to the judges  sirs what need is there for all this evidence seeing that among you i perceive three gallant officers whom i saw running before the northmen that night when with some four hundred swords we routed about two thousand of you you yourselves therefore are the best witnesses of what befell moreover i acknowledge that being moved by the sight of war in the end i led the charge against you before which charge some died and many fled you among them  now these captains glowered at me and the president said  the prisoner is right what need is there of more evidence  i think much sir i answered since but one side of the story has been heard now i will call witnesses of whom the first should be the augusta if she is willing to appear and tell you what happened within the circle of the northmen on that night  call the augusta gasped the president perchance prisoner michael you will wish next to call god himself on your behalf  that sir i answered i have already done and do moreover i added slowly of this i am sure that in a time to come although it be not tomorrow or the next day you and everyone who has to do with this case will find that i have not called him in vain  at these words for a few moments a solemn silence fell upon the court it was as though they had gone home to the heart of everyone who was present there also i saw the curtains that draped a gallery high up in the wall shake a little it came into my mind that irene herself was hidden behind those curtains as afterwards i learned was the case and that she had made some movement which caused them to tremble  well said the president after this pause as god does not appear to be your witness and as you have no other seeing that you cannot give evidence yourself under the law we will now proceed to judgment  who says that the general olaf olaf redsword has no witness exclaimed a deep voice at the end of the hall i am here to be his witness  who speaks asked the president let him come forward  there was a disturbance at the end of the hall and through the crowd that he seemed to throw before him to right and left appeared the mighty form of jodd he was clad in full armour and bore his famous battleaxe in his hand  one whom some of you know well enough as others of your company who will never know anything again have done in the past one named jodd the northman second in command of the guard to the general olaf he answered and marched to the spot where witnesses were accustomed to stand  take away that barbarians axe exclaimed an officer who sat among the judges  aye said jodd come hither mannikin and take it away if you can i promise you that along with it something else shall be taken away to wit your fools head who are you that would dare to disarm an officer of the imperial guard  after this there was no more talk of removing jodds axe and he proceeded to give his evidence which as it only detailed what has been written already need not be repeated what effect it produced upon the judges i cannot say but that it moved those present in the court was clear enough  have you done asked the president at length when the story was finished  not altogether said jodd olaf redsword was promised an open trial and that he has since otherwise i and some friends of mine could not be in this court to tell the truth where perhaps the truth has seldom been heard before also he was promised a fair trial and that he has not seeing that the most of his judges are men with whom he fought the other day and who only escaped his sword by flight tomorrow i propose to ask the people of byzantium whether it is right that a man should be tried by his conquered enemies now i perceive that you will find a verdict of guilty against olaf redsword and perhaps condemn him to death well find what verdict you will and pass what sentence you will but do not dare to attempt to execute that sentence  dare dare shouted the president who are you man who would dictate to a court appointed by the empress what it shall or shall not do be careful lest we pass sentence on you as well as on your fellowtraitor remember where you stand and that if i lift my finger you will be taken and bound  aye lawyer i remember this and other things for instance that i have the safeconduct of the empress under an oath sworn on the cross of the christ she worships for instance also that i have three hundred comrades waiting my safe return  three hundred snarled the president the empress has three thousand within these walls who will soon make an end of your three hundred  i have been told lawyer answered jodd that once there lived another monarch one called xerxes who thought that he would make an end of a certain three hundred greeks when greeks were different from what you are today at a place called thermopylæ he made an end of them but they cost him more than he cared to pay and now it is those greeks who live for ever and xerxes who is dead but thats not all since that fray the other night we northmen have found friends have you heard of the armenian legions president those who favour constantine well kill olaf redsword or kill me jodd and you have to deal first with the northmen and next with the armenian legions now here i am waiting to be taken by any who can pass this axe  at these words a great silence fell upon the court jodd glared about him and seeing that none ventured to draw near stepped from the witnessplace advanced to where i was gave me the full salute of ceremony then marched away to the back of the court the crowd opening a path for him  when he had gone the judges began to consult together and as i expected very soon agreed upon their verdict the president said or rather gabbled  prisoner we find you guilty have you any reason to offer why sentence of death should not be passed upon you  sir i answered i am not here to plead for my life which already i have risked a score of times in the service of your people yet i would say this on the night of the outbreak i was set on four to one for no crime as you have heard and did but protect myself afterwards when i was about to be slain the northmen my comrades protected me unasked then i did my best to save the life of the empress and in fact succeeded my only offence is that when the great charge took place and your regiments were defeated remembering only that i was a soldier i led that charge if this is a crime worthy of death i am ready to die yet i hold that both god and man will give more honour to me the criminal than to you the judges and to those who before ever you sat in this court instructed you whom i know to be but tools as to the verdict that you should give  the applause which my words called forth from those gathered at the end of the court died away in the midst of a great silence the president who like his companions i could see well was growing somewhat fearful read the sentence in a low voice from a parchment after setting out the order by which the court was constituted and other matters it ran  we condemn you michael otherwise called olaf or olaf redsword to death this sentence will be executed with or without torture at such time and in such manner as it may please the augusta to decree  now the voice of jodd was heard crying through the gathering gloom for night was near  what sort of judgment is this that the judges bring already written down into the court hearken you lawyer and you streetcurs his companions who call yourselves soldiers if olaf redsword dies those hostages whom we hold die also if he is tortured those hostages will be tortured also moreover ere long we will sack this fine place and what has befallen olaf shall befall you also you false judges neither less nor more remember it all you who shall have charge of olaf in his bonds and if she be within hearing let the augusta irene remember it also lest another time there should be no olaf to save her life  now i could see that the judges were terrified hastily with white faces they consulted together as to whether they should order jodd to be seized presently i heard the president say to his companions  nay best let him go if he is touched our hostages will die moreover doubtless constantine and the armenians are at the back of him or he would not dare to speak thus would that we were clear of this business which has been thrust upon us  then he called aloud let the prisoner be removed  down the long court i was marched only now guards who had been called in went in front of and behind me and with them the four executioners by whom i was surrounded  farewell godmother i whispered to martina as i passed  nay not farewell she whispered back looking up at me with eyes that were full of tears though what she meant i did not know  at the end of the court where those who dared to sympathise with me openly were gathered rough voices called blessings on me and rough hands patted me on the shoulder to one of these men whose voice i recognised in the gloom i turned to speak a word thereon the black executioner who was between us he whom i had dismissed from the jail for cruelty struck me on the mouth with the back of his hand next instant i heard a sound that reminded me of the growl the white bear gave when it gripped steinar two arms shot out and caught that black savage by the head there was a noise as of something breaking and down went the mana corpse  then they hurried me away for now it was not only the judges who were afraid    it comes to me that for some days three or four i sat in my cell at the palace for here i was kept because as i learned afterwards it was feared that if i were removed to that state prison of which i had been governor some attempt would be made to rescue me  this cell was one of several situated beneath that broad terrace which looked out on to the sea where irene had first questioned me as to the shell necklace and against my prayer had set it upon her own breast it had a little barred window out of which i could watch the sea and through this window came the sound of sentries tramping overhead and of the voice of the officer who at stated hours arrived to turn out the guard as for some years it had been my duty to do  i wondered who that officer might be and wondered also how many of such men since byzantium became the capital of the empire had filled his office and mine and what had become of them all as i knew if that terrace had been able to speak it could have told many bloody histories whereof doubtless mine would be another doubtless too there were more to follow until the end came whatever that might be  in that strait place i reflected on many things all my youth came back to me i marvelled what had happened at aar since i left it such long years ago once or twice rumours had reached me from men in my company who were danishborn that iduna was a great lady there and still unmarried but of freydisa i had heard nothing probably she was dead and if so i felt sure that her fierce and faithful spirit must be near me now as that of ragnar had seemed to be in the battle of the garden  how strange it was that after all my vision had been fulfilled and it had been my lot to meet her of whom i had dreamed wearing that necklace of which i had found onehalf upon the wanderer in his gravemound were i and the wanderer the same spirit i asked of myself and she of the dream and heliodore the same woman  who could tell at least this was sure from the moment that first we saw one another we knew we belonged each to each for the present and the future therefore as it was with these we had to do the past might sleep and all its secrets  now we had met but to be parted again by death which seemed hard indeed yet since we had met for my part fate had my forgiveness for i knew that we should meet again i looked back on what i had done and left undone and could not blame myself overmuch true it would have been wiser if i had stayed by irene and heliodore and not led that charge against the greeks only then as a soldier i should never have forgiven myself for how could i stand still while my comrades fought for me no no i was glad i had led the charge and led it well though my life must pay its price nor was this so i must die not because i had lifted sword against irenes troops but for the sin of loving heliodore  after all what was life as we knew it a passing breath well as the body breathes many million times between the cradle and the grave so i believed the soul must breathe out its countless lives each ending in a form of death and beyond these what i did not know yet my newfound faith gave me much comfort  in such meditations and in sleep i passed my hours waiting always until the door of my cell should open and through it appear not the jailer with my food which i noted was plentiful and delicate but the executioners or mayhap the tormentors  at length it did open somewhat late at night just as i was about to lay myself down to rest and through it came a veiled woman i bowed and motioned to my visitor to be seated on the stool that was in the cell then waited in silence presently she threw off her veil and in the light of the lamp showed that i stood before the empress irene  olaf she said hoarsely i am come here to save you from yourself if it may be so i was hidden in yonder court and heard all that passed at your trial  i guessed as much augusta i said but what of it  for one thing this the coward and fool who now is deadof his woundswho gave evidence as to the killing of the three other cowards by you has caused my name to become a mock throughout constantinople aye the vilest make songs upon me in the streets such songs as i cannot repeat  i am grieved augusta i said  it is i who should grieve not you who are told of as a man who grew weary of the love of an empress and cast her off as though she were a tavern wench that is the first matter the second is that under the finding of the court of justice  oh augusta i interrupted why stain your lips with those words of justice  under the finding of the court she went on your fate is left in my hands i may kill you or torment your body or i may spare you and raise your head higher than any other in the empire aye and adorn it with a crown  doubtless you may do any of these things augusta but which of them do you wish to do  olaf notwithstanding all that has gone i would still do the last i speak to you no more of love or tenderness nor do i pretend that this is for your sake alone it is for mine also my name is smirched and only marriage can cover up the stain upon it moreover i am beset by troubles and by dangers those accursed northmen who love you so well and who fight not like men but like devils are in league with the armenian legions and with constantine my generals and my troops fall away from me if it were assailed i am not sure that i could hold this palace strong though it be theres but one man who can make me safe again and that man is yourself the northmen will do your bidding and with you in command of them i fear no attack you have the honesty the wit and the soldiers skill and courage you must command or none only this time it must not be as irenes lover for that is what they name you but as her husband a priest is waiting within call and one of high degree within an hour olaf you may be my consort and within a year the emperor of the world oh she went on with passion cannot you forgive what seem to be my sins when you remember that they were wrought for love of you  augusta i said i have small ambition i am not minded to be an emperor but hearken put aside this thought of marriage with one so far beneath you and let me marry her whom i have chosen and who has chosen me then once more ill take command of the northmen and defend you and your cause to the last drop of my blood  her face hardened  it may not be she said not only for those reasons i have told you but for another which i grieve to have to tell heliodore daughter of magas the egyptian is dead  dead i gasped dead  aye olaf dead you did not see and she being a brave woman hid it from you but one of those spears that were flung in the fight struck her in the side for a while the wound went well but two days ago it mortified last night she died and this morning i myself saw her buried with honour  how did you see her buried you who are not welcome among the northmen i asked  by my order as her blood was high she was laid in the palace graveyard olaf  did she leave me no word or token augusta she swore to me that if she died she would send to me the other half of that necklace which i wear  i have heard of none said irene but you will know olaf that i have other business to attend to just now than such deathbed gossip these things do not come to my ears  i looked at irene and irene looked at me  augusta i said i do not believe your story no spear wounded heliodore while i was near her and when i was not near her your greeks were too far away for any spears to be thrown indeed unless you stabbed her secretly she was not wounded and i am sure that however much you have hated her this you would not have dared to do for your own lifes sake augusta for your own purposes you are trying to deceive me i will not marry you do your worst you have lied to me about the woman whom i love and though i forgive you all the rest this i do not forgive you know well that heliodore still lives beneath the sun  if so answered the empress you have looked your last upon the sun andher never again shall you behold the beauty of heliodore have you aught to say there is still time  nothing augusta at present except this of late i have learned to believe in a god i summon you to meet me before that god there we will argue out our case and abide his judgment if there is no god there will be no judgment and i salute you empress who triumph if as i believe and as you say you believe there is a god think whom you will be called upon to salute when that god has heard the truth meanwhile i repeat that heliodore the egyptian still lives beneath the sun  irene rose from the stool on which she sat and thought a moment i gazed through the bars of the windowplace in my cell out at the night above a young moon was floating in the sky and near to it hung a star a little passing cloud with a dented edge drifted over the star and the lower horn of the moon it went by and they shone out again upon the background of the blue heavens also an owl flitted across the windowplace of my cell it had a mouse in its beak and the shadow of it and of the writhing mouse for a moment lay upon irenes breast for i turned my head and saw them it came into my mind that here was an allegory irene was the nighthawk and i was the writhing mouse that fed its appetite doubtless it was decreed that the owl must be and the mouse must be but beyond them both hidden in those blue heavens stood that justice which we call god  these were the last things that i saw in this life of mine and therefore i remember them well or rather almost the last the very last of which i took note was irenes face it had grown like to that of a devil the great eyes in it stared out between the puffed and purple eyelids the painted cheeks had sunk in and were pallid beneath and round the paint the teeth showed in two white lines the chin worked she was no longer a beautiful woman she was a fiend  irene knocked thrice upon the door bolts were thrown back and men entered  blind him she said    chapter ix  the hall of the pit  the days and the nights went by but which was day and which was night i knew not save for the visits of the jailers with my mealsi who was blind i who should never see the light again at first i suffered much but by degrees the pain died away also a physician came to tend my hurts a skilful man soon i discovered however that he had another object he pitied my state so much indeed he said that he offered to supply me with a drug that if i were willing to take it would make an end of me painlessly now i understood at once that irene desired my death and fearing to cause it set the means of selfmurder within my reach  i thanked the man and begged him to give me the drug which he did whereon i hid it away in my garments when it was seen that i still lived although i had asked for the medicine i think that irene believed this was because it had failed to work or that such a means of death did not please me so she found another one evening when a jailer brought my supper he pressed something heavy into my hand which i felt to be a sword  what weapon is this i asked and why do you give it to me  it is your own sword answered the man which i was commanded to return to you i know no more  then he went away leaving the sword with me  i drew the familiar blade from its sheath the red blade that the wanderer had worn and touching its keen edge with my fingers wept from my blinded eyes to think that never again could i hold it aloft in war or see the light flash from it as i smote yes i wept in my weakness till i remembered that i had no longer any wish to be the death of men so i sheathed the good sword and hid it beneath my mattress lest some jailer should steal it which as i could not see him he might do easily also i desired to put away temptation  i think that this hour after the bringing of the sword which stirred up so many memories was the most fearful of all my hours so fearful that had it been prolonged death would have come to me of its own accord i had sunk to miserys lowest deep who did not know that even then its tide was turning who could not dream of all the blessed years that lay before me the years of love and of such peaceful joy as even the blind may win  that night martina camemartina who was hopes harbinger i heard the door of my prison open and close softly and sat still wondering whether the murderers had entered at last wondering too whether i should snatch the sword and strike blindly till i fell next i heard another sound that of a woman weeping yes and felt my hand lifted and pressed to a womans lips which kissed it again and yet again a thought struck me and i began to draw it back a soft voice spoke between its sobs  have no fear olaf i am martina oh now i understand why yonder tigress sent me on that distant mission  how did you come here martina i asked  i still have the signet olaf which irene who begins to mistrust me forgets only this morning i learned the truth on my return to the palace yet i have not been idle within an hour jodd and the northmen knew it also within three they had blinded every hostage whom they held aye and caught two of the brutes who did the deed on you and crucified them upon their barrack walls  oh martina i broke in i did not desire that others who are innocent should share my woes  nor did i olaf but these northmen are ill to play with moreover in a sense it was needful you do not know what i have learnedthat tomorrow irene proposed to slit your tongue also because you can tell too much and afterwards to cut off your right hand lest you who are learned should write down what you know i told the northmennever mind how they sent a herald a greek whom they had captured and covering him with arrows made him call out that if your tongue was slit they would know of it and slit the tongues of all the hostages also and that if your hand was cut off they could cut off their hands and take another vengeance which for the present they keep secret  at least they are faithful i said but oh tell me martina what of heliodore  this she whispered into my ear heliodore and her father sailed an hour after sunset and are now safe upon the sea bound for egypt  then i was right when irene told me she was dead she lied  aye if she said that she lied though thrice she has striven to murder her i have no time to tell you how but was always baffled by those who watched yet she might have succeeded at last so although heliodore fought against it it was best that she should go those who are parted may meet again but how can we meet one who is dead until we too are dead  how did she go  smuggled from the city disguised as a boy attending on a priest and that priest her father shorn of his beard and tonsured the bishop barnabas passed them out in his following  then blessings on the bishop barnabas i said  aye blessings on him since without his help it could never have been done the secret agents at the port stared hard at those two although the good bishop vouched for them and gave their names and offices still when they saw some roughlooking fellows dressed like sailors approach playing with the handles of their knives the agents thought well to ask no more questions moreover now that the ship has sailed for their own sakes theyll swear that no such priest and boy went aboard of her so your heliodore is away unharmed as is her father though his mission has come to naught still his life is left in him for which he may be thankful who on such a business should have brought no woman if he had come alone olaf your eyes would have been left to you and set by now upon the orb of empire that your hand had grasped  yet i am glad that he did not come alone martina  truly you have a high and faithful heart and that woman should be honoured whom you love what is the secret there must be more in it than the mere desire for a womans beauty though i know that at times this can make men mad in such a business the soul must play its part  i think so martina indeed i believe so since otherwise we suffer much in vain now tell me how and when do i die  i hope you will not die at all olaf certain plans are laid which even here i dare not whisper tomorrow i hear they will lead you again before the judges who by irenes clemency will change your sentence to one of banishment with secret orders to kill you on the voyage but you will never make that voyage other schemes are afoot youll learn of them afterwards  yet martina if you know these plots the augusta knows them also since you and she are one  when those dagger points were thrust into your eyes olaf they cut the thread that bound us and now irene and i are more far apart than hell and heaven i tell you that for your sake i hate her and work her downfall am i not your godmother olaf  then again she kissed my hand and presently was gone    on the following morning as i supposed it to be my jailers came and said to me that i must appear before the judges to hear some revision of my sentence they dressed me in my soldiers gear and even allowed me to gird my sword about me knowing doubtless that save to himself a blind man could do no mischief with a sword then they led me i know not whither by passages which turned now here now there at length we entered some place for doors were closed behind us  this is the hall of judgment said one of them but the judges have not yet come it is a great room and bare there is nothing in it against which you can hurt yourself therefore if it pleases you after being cramped so long in that narrow cell you may walk to and fro keeping your hands in front of you so that you will know when you touch the further wall and must turn  i thanked them and glad enough to avail myself of this grace for my limbs were stiff with want of exercise began to walk joyfully i thought that the room must be one of those numberless apartments which opened on to the terrace since distinctly i could hear the wash of the sea coming from far beneath doubtless through the open windowplaces  forward i stepped boldly but at a certain point in my march this curious thing happened a hand seemed to seize my own and draw me to the left wondering i followed the guidance of the hand which presently left hold of mine thereon i continued my march and as i did so thought that i heard another sound like to that of a suppressed murmur of human voices twenty steps more and i reached the end of the chamber for my outstretched fingers touched its marble wall i turned and marched back and lo at the twentieth step that hand took mine again and led me to the right whereon once more the murmur of voices reached me  thrice this happened and every time the murmur grew more loud indeed i thought i heard one say  the mans not blind at all and another some spirit guides him  as i made my fourth journey i caught the sound of a distant tumult the shouts of war the screams of agony and above them all the wellremembered cry of valhalla valhalla victory or valhalla  i halted where i was and felt the blood rush into my wasted cheeks the northmen my northmen were in the palace it was at this that martina had hinted yet in so vast a place what chance was there that they would ever find me and how being blind could i find them well at least my voice was left to me and i would lift it  so with all my strength i cried aloud olaf redsword is here to olaf men of the north  thrice i cried i heard folk running not to me but from me doubtless those whose whispers had reached my ears  i thought of trying to follow them but the soft and gentle hand which was like to that of a woman once more clasped mine and held me where i was suffering me to move no single inch so there i stood even after the hand had loosed me again for it seemed to me that there was something most strange in this business  presently another sound arose the sound of the northmen pouring towards the hall for feet clanged louder and louder down the marble corridors more they had met those who were running from the hall for now these fled back before them they were in the hall for a cry of horror mingled with rage broke from their lips  tis olaf said one olaf blinded and by thor see where he stands  then jodds voice roared out  move not olaf move not or you die  another voice that of martina broke in silence you fool or youll frighten him and make him fall silence all and leave him to me  then quiet fell upon the place it seemed that even the pursued grew quiet and i heard the rustle of a womans dress drawing towards me next instant a soft hand took my own just such a hand as not long ago had seemed to guide and hold me and martinas voice said  follow where i lead olaf  so i followed eight or ten paces then martina threw her arms about me and burst into wild laughter someone caught her away next moment two hairclad lips kissed me on the brow and the mighty voice of jodd shouted  thanks be to all the gods dwell they in the north or in the south we have saved you know you where you stood olaf on the brink of a pit the very brink and beneath is a fall of a hundred feet to where the waters of the bosphorus wash among the rocks oh understand this pretty grecian game they good christian folk would not have your blood upon their souls and therefore they caused you to walk to your own death well they shall be dosed with the draught they brewed  bring them hither comrades bring them one by one these devils who could sit to watch a blind man walk to his doom to make their sport ah whom have we here why by thor tis the lawyer knave he who was president of the court that tried you and was angry because you did not salute him well lawyer the wheel has gone round we northmen are in possession of the palace and the armenian legions are gathered at its gates and do but wait for constantine the emperor to enter and take the empire and its crown theyll be here anon lawyer but you understand having a certain life to save for word had been brought to us of your pretty doings that we were forced to strike before the signal and struck not in vain now well fill in the tedious time with a trial of our own see here i am president of the court seated in this fine chair and these six to right and left are my companion judges while you seven who were judges are now prisoners you know the crime with which you are charged so theres no need to set it out your defence lawyer and be swift with it  oh sir said the man in a trembling voice what we did to the general olaf we were ordered to do by one who may not be named  youd best find the name lawyer for were it that of a god we northmen would hear it  well then by the augusta herself she wished the death of the noble michael or olaf but having become superstitious about the matter would not have his blood directly on her hands therefore she bethought her of this plan he was ordered to be brought into the place you see which is known as the hall of the pit that in old days was used by certain bloodyminded emperors to rid them of their enemies the central pavement swings upon a hinge at a touch it opens and he who has thought it sound and walked thereon when darkness comes is lost since he falls upon the rocks far below and at high tide the water takes him  yes yes we understand the game lawyer for there yawns the open pit but have you aught more to say  nothing sir nothing save that we only did what we were driven to do moreover no harm has come of it since whenever the noble general came to the edge of the opened pit although he was blind he halted and went off to right or left as though someone drew him out of danger  well then cruel and unjust judges who could gather to mock at the murder of a blinded man that you had trapped to his doom  sir broke in one of them it was not we who tried to trap him it was those jailers who stand there they told the general that he might exercise himself by walking up and down the hall  is that true olaf asked jodd  yes i answered it is true that the two jailers who brought me here did tell me this though whether those men are present i cannot say  very good said jodd add them to the other prisoners who by their own showing heard them set the snare and did not warn the victim now murderers all this is the sentence of the court upon you that you salute the general olaf and confess your wickedness to him  so they saluted me kneeling and kissing my feet and one and all made confession of their crime  enough i said i pardon them who are but tools pray to god that he may do as much  you may pardon here olaf said jodd and your god may pardon hereafter but we the northmen do not pardon blindfold those men and bind their arms now went on jodd after a pause their turn has come to show us sport run friends run for swords are behind you can you not feel them  the rest may be guessed within a few minutes the seven judges and the two jailers had vanished from the world no hand came to save them from the cruel rocks and the waters that seethed a hundred feet below that dreadful chamber  this fantastic savage vengeance was a thing dreadful to hear what it must have been to see i can only guess i know that i wished i might have fled from it and that i pleaded with jodd for mercy on these men but neither he nor his companions would listen to me  what mercy had they on you he cried let them drink from their own cup  let them drink from their own cup roared his companions and then broke into a roar of laughter as one of the false judges feeling space before him leapt leapt short and with a shriek departed for ever    it was over i heard someone enter the hall and whisper in jodds ear heard his answer also  let her be brought hither he said for the rest bid the captains hold stauracius and the others fast if there is any sign of stir against us cut their throats advising them that this will be done should they allow trouble to arise do not fire the palace unless i give the word for it would be a pity to burn so fine a building it is those who dwell in it who should be burned but doubtless constantine will see to that collect the richest of the booty that which is most portable and let it be carried to our quarters in the baggage carts see that these things are done quickly before the armenians get their hands into the bag ill be with you soon but if the emperor constantine should arrive first tell him that all has gone well better than he hoped indeed and pray him to come hither where we may take counsel  the messenger went jodd and some of the northmen began to consult together and martina led me aside  tell me what has chanced martina i asked for i am bewildered  a revolution that is all olaf jodd and the northmen are the point of the spear its handle is constantine and the hands that hold it are the armenians it has been very well done some of the guards who remained were bribed others frightened away only a few fought and of them the northmen made short work irene and her ministers were fooled they thought the blow would not fall for a week or more if at all since the empress believed that she had appeased constantine by her promises ill tell you more later  how did you find me martina and in time  oh olaf it is a terrible story almost i swoon again to think of it it was thus irene discovered that i had visited you in your cell she grew suspicious of me this morning i was seized and ordered to surrender the signet but first i had heard that they planned your death today not a sentence of banishment and murder afar off as i told you my last act before i was taken was to dispatch a trusted messenger to jodd and the northmen telling them that if they would save you alive they must strike at once and not tonight as had been arranged within thirty seconds after he had left my side the eunuchs had me and took me to my chamber where they barred me in a while later the augusta came raging like a lioness she accused me of treachery and when i denied it struck me in the face look here are the marks of the jewels on her hands oh alas what said i you cannot see she had learned that the lady heliodore had escaped her and that i had some hand in her escape she vowed that i your godmother was your lover and as this is a crime against the church promised me that after other sufferings i should be burned alive in the hippodrome before all the people lastly she said this know that your olaf of whom you are so fond dies within an hour and thus he will be taken to the hall of the pit and there given leave to walk till the judges come being blind you may guess where he will walk before this door is unlocked again i tell you hell be but a heap of splintered bones aye you may start and weep but save your tears for yourself and she called me a foul name i have got you fast at length you nightprowling cat and god himself cannot give you strength to stretch out your hand and guide this accursed olaf from the edge of the pit of death  god alone knows what he can do augusta i answered for the words seemed to be put into my lips  then she cursed and struck me again and so left me barred in my chamber  when she had gone i flung myself upon my knees and prayed to god to save you olaf since i was helpless prayed as i had never prayed before praying thus i think that i fell into a swoon for my agony was more than i could bear and in the swoon i dreamed i dreamed that i stood in this place where till now i have never been before i saw the judges the jailers and a few others watching from that gallery i saw you walk along the hall towards the great open pit then i seemed to glide to you and take your hand and guide you round the pit and olaf this happened thrice afterwards came a tumult while you were on the very edge of the pit and i held you not suffering you to stir then in rushed the northmen and i with them yes standing there with you upon the edge of the pit i saw myself and the northmen rush into the hall  martina i whispered a hand that seemed to be a womans did guide me thrice round the edge of the pit and did hold me almost until you and the northmen rushed in  oh god is great she gasped god is very great and to him i give thanks but hearken to the end of the tale i awoke from my swoon and heard noise without and above it the northmens cry of victory they had scaled the palace walls or broken in the gatesas yet i know not whichthey were on the terrace driving the greek guards before them i ran to the windowplace and there below me saw jodd i screamed till he heard me  save me if you would save olaf i cried i am prisoned here  they brought one of their scaling ladders and drew me through the window i told them all i knew they caught a palace eunuch and beat him till he promised to lead us to this hall he led but in the labyrinth of passages fell down senseless for they had struck him too hard we knew not which way to turn till suddenly we heard your voice and ran towards it  that is all the story olaf    chapter x  olaf gives judgment  as martina finished speaking i heard the sound of tramping guards and of a womans dress upon the pavement then a voice that of irene spoke and though her words were quiet i caught in them the tremble of smothered rage  be pleased to tell me captain jodd she said what is happening in my palace and why i the empress am haled from my apartment hither by soldiers under your command  lady answered jodd you are mistaken yesterday you were an empress today you arewell whatever your son the emperor chooses to name you as to what has been and is happening in this palace i scarcely know where to begin the tale first of all your general and chamberlain olafin case you should not recognise him i mean that blind man who stands yonderwas being tricked to death by certain servants of yours who called themselves judges and who stated that they were acting by your orders  confront me with them said irene that i may prove to you that they lie  certainly ho you bring the lady irene here now hold her over that hole nay struggle not lady lest you should slip from their hands look down steadily and you will see by the light that flows in from the cave beneath certain heaps lying on the rocks round which the rising waters seethe there are your judges whom you say you wish to meet if you desire to ask them any questions we can satisfy your will nay why should you turn pale at the mere sight of the place that you thought good enough to be the bed of a faithful soldier of your own one high in your service whom it has pleased you to blind why did it please you to blind him lady  who are you that dare to ask me questions she replied gathering up her courage  ill tell you lady now that the general olaf yonder is blinded i am the officer in command of the northmen who until you tried to murder the said general olaf a while ago were your faithful guard i am also as it chances the officer in command of this palace which we took this morning by assault and by arrangement with most of your greek soldiers having learned from your confidential lady martina of the vile deed you were about to work on the general olaf  so it was you who betrayed me martina gasped irene and i had you in my power oh i had you in my power  i did not betray you augusta i saved my godson yonder from torture and butchery as by my oath i was bound to do answered martina  have done with this talk of betrayals went on jodd for who can betray a devil now lady with your state quarrels we have nothing to do you can settle them presently with your son that is if you still live but with this matter of olaf we have much to do and we will settle that at once the first part of the business we all know so let us get to the next by whose order were you blinded general olaf  by that of the augusta i answered  for what reason general olaf  for one that i will not state i answered  good you were blinded by the augusta for a reason you will not state but which is well known to all of us now we have a law in the north which says that an eye should be given for an eye and a life for a life would it not then be right comrades that this woman should be blinded also  what screamed irene blinded i blinded i the empress  tell me lady are the eyes of one who was an empress different from other eyes why should you complain of that darkness into which you were so ready to plunge one better than yourself still olaf shall judge is it your will general that we blind this woman who put out your eyes and afterwards tried to murder you  now i felt that all in that place were watching me and hanging on the words that i should speak so intently that they never heard others entering it as i did for a while i paused for why should not irene suffer a little of that agony of suspense which she had inflicted upon me and others  then i said see what i have lost friends through no grave fault of my own i was in the way of greatness i was a soldier whom you trusted and liked well one of unstained honour and of unstained name also i loved a woman by whom i was beloved and whom i hoped to make my wife and now what am i my trade is gone for how can a maimed man lead in war or even do the meanest service of the camp the rest of my days should any be granted to me must be spent in darkness blacker than that of midnight i must live on charity when the little store i have is spent for i have taken no bribe and heaped up no riches how can i earn a living the woman whom i love has been carried away after this empress tried thrice to murder her whether i shall ever find her again in this world i know not for she has gone to a far country that is full of enemies to christian men nor do i know whether she would be willing to take one who is blind and beggared for a husband though i think this may be so  shame on her if she does not muttered martina as i paused  well friends that is my case i went on let the augusta deny it if she can  speak lady do you deny it said jodd  i do not deny that this man was blinded by my order in payment of crimes for which he might well have suffered death answered irene but i do deny that i commanded him to be trapped in yonder pit if those dead men said so then they lied  and if the lady martina says so what then asked jodd  then she lies also answered the empress sullenly  be it so replied jodd yet it is strange that acting on this lie of the lady martinas we found the general olaf upon the very edge of yonder hole yes with not the breadth of a barleycorn between him and death now general both parties have been heard and you shall pass sentence if you say that yonder woman is to be blinded this moment she looks her last upon the light if you say that she is to die this moment she bids farewell to life  again i thought a while it came into my mind that irene who had fallen from power might rise once more and bring fresh evil upon heliodore now she was in my hand but if i opened that hand and let her free  someone moved towards me and i heard irenes voice whispering in my ear  olaf she said if i sinned against you it was because i loved you would you be avenged upon one who has burned her soul with so much evil because she loved too well oh if so you are no longer olaf for christs sake have pity on me since i am not fit to meet him give me time to repent nay hear me out let not those men drag me away as they threaten to do i am fallen now but who knows i may grow great again indeed i think i shall then olaf may my soul shrivel everlastingly in hell if i try to harm you or the egyptian morejesus be my witness that i ask no lesser doom upon my head keep the men back martina for what i swear to him and the egyptian i swear to you as well moreover olaf i have great wealth you spoke of poverty it shall be far from you martina knows where my gold is hid and she still holds my keys let her take it i say leave me alone but one word more if ever it is in my power ill forget everything and advance you all to great honour your brain is not blinded olaf you can still rule i swear i swear i swear upon the holy blood ah now drag me away if you will i have spoken  then perchance lady you will allow olaf to speak since we who have much to do must finish this business quickly before the emperor comes with the armenians said jodd  captain jodd and his comrades i said the empress irene has been pleased to make certain solemn vows to me which perchance some of you may have overheard at least god heard them and whether she keeps them or no is a matter between her and the god in whom we both believe therefore i set these vows aside they draw me neither one way nor the other now you have made me judge in my own matter and have promised to abide by my judgment which you will do hear it then and let it be remembered for long i have been the augustas officer and of late her general and chamberlain as such i have bound myself by great oaths to protect her from harm in all cases and those oaths heretofore i have kept when i might have broken them and not been blamed by men whatever has chanced it seems that she is still empress and i am still her officer seeing that my sword has been returned to me although it is true she sent it that i might use it on myself it pleased the empress to put out my eyes under our soldiers law the monarch who rules the empire has a right to put out the eyes of an officer who has lifted sword against her forces or even to kill him whether this is done justly or unjustly again is a matter between that monarch and god above to whom answer must be made at last therefore it would seem that i have no right to pronounce any sentence against the augusta irene and whatever may have been my private wrongs i pronounce none yet as i am still your general until another is named i order you to free the augusta irene and to work no vengeance on her person for aught that may have befallen me at her hands were her deeds just or unjust  when i had finished speaking in the silence that followed i heard irene utter something that was half a sob and half a gasp of wonderment then above the murmuring of the northmen to whom this rede was strange rose the great voice of jodd  general olaf he said while you were talking it came into my mind that one of those knife points which pierced your eyes had pricked the brain behind them but when you had finished talking it came into my mind that you are a great man who putting aside your private rights and wrongs and the glory of revenge which lay to your hand have taught us soldiers a lesson in duty which i at least never shall forget general if as i trust we are together in the future as in the past i shall ask you to instruct me in this christian faith of yours which can make a man not only forgive but hide his forgiveness under the mask of duty for that as we know well is what you have done general your order shall be obeyed be she empress or nothing this ladys person is safe from us more we will protect her to the best of our power as you did in the battle of the garden yet i tell her to her face that had it not been for those orders had you for example said that you left judgment to us she who has spoilt such a man should have died a death of shame  i heard a sound as of a woman throwing herself upon her knees before me i heard irenes voice whisper through her tears  olaf olaf for the second time in my life you make me feel ashamed oh if only you could have loved me then i should have grown good like you  there was a stir of feet and another voice spoke a voice that should have been clear and youthful but sounded as though it were thick with wine it did not need martinas whisper to tell me that it was that of constantine  greeting friends he said and at once there came a rattle of saluting swords and an answering cry of  greeting augustus  you struck before the time went on the thick boyish voice yet as things seem to have gone rather well for us i cannot blame you especially as i see that you hold fast her who has usurped my birthright  now i heard irene turn with a swift and furious movement  your birthright boy she cried what birthright have you save that which my body gave  i thought that my father had more to do with this matter of imperial right than the grecian girl whom it pleased him to marry for her fair face answered constantine insolently adding learn your station mother learn that you are but the lamp which once held the holy oil and that lamps can be shattered  aye she answered and oil can be spilt for the dogs to lap if their gorge does not rise at such rancid stuff the holy oil forsooth nay the sour dregs of wine jars the outscourings of the stews the filth of the stables of such is the holy oil that burns in constantine the drunkard and the liar  it would seem that before this torrent of coarse invective constantine quailed who at heart always feared his mother and i think never more so than when he appeared to triumph over her or perhaps he scorned to answer it at least addressing jodd he said  captain i and my officers standing yonder unseen have heard something of what passed in this place by what warrant do you and your company take upon yourselves to pass judgment upon this mother of mine that is the emperors right  by the warrant of capture augustus answered jodd we northmen took the palace and opened the gates to you and your armenians also we took her who ruled in the palace with whom we had a private score to settle that has to do with our general who stands yonder blinded well it is settled in his own fashion and now we do not yield up this woman our prisoner save on your royal promise that no harm shall come to her in body as for the rest it is your business make a cookmaid of her if you will only then i think her tongue would clear the kitchen but swear to keep her sound in life and limb till hell calls her since otherwise we must add her to our company which will make no man merrier  no answered constantine in a week she would corrupt you every one and breed a war well he added with a boisterous laugh im master now at last and ill swear by any saint that you may name or all of them no harm shall come to this empress whose rule is done and who being without friends need not be feared still lest she should spawn more mischief or murder she must be kept close till we and our councillors decide where she shall dwell in future ho guards take my royal fathers widow to the dowerpalace and there watch her well if she escapes you shall die beneath the rods away with the snake before it begins to hiss again  ill hiss no more said irene as the soldiers formed up round her yet perchance constantine you may live to find that the snake still has strength to strike and poison in its fangs you and others do you come with me martina  nay lady since here stands one whom god and you together have given me to guard for his sake i would keep my life in me and she touched me on the shoulder  that whelp who is called my son spoke truly when he said that the fallen have no friends exclaimed irene well you should thank me martina who made olaf blind since being without eyes he cannot see how ugly is your face in his darkness he may perchance mistake you for the beauteous egyptian heliodore as i know you who love him madly would have him do  with this vile taunt she went  i think im crazed said the emperor as the doors swung to behind her i should have struck that snake while the stick is in my hand i tell you i fear her fangs why if she could shed make me as that poor man is blind or even butcher me well shes my mother and ive sworn so theres an end now you olaf you are that same captain are you not who dashed the poisoned fig from my lips that this tender mother of mine would have let me eat when i was in liquor yes and would have swallowed it yourself to save me from my folly  i am that man augustus  aye you are that man and one of whom all the city has been talking they say so poor is your taste that you turned your back upon the favours of an empress because of some young girl you dared to love they say also that she paid you back with a dagger in the eyes she who was ready to set you in my place  rumour has many tongues augustus i answered at least i fell from the empresss favour and she rewarded me as she held that i deserved  so it seems christ what a dreadful pit is that is this another of her gifts nay answer not i heard the tale well olaf you saved my life and your northmen have set me on the throne since without them we could scarcely have won the palace now what payment would you have  leave to go hence augustus i answered  a small boon that you might have taken without asking if you can find a dog to lead you like other blind wretches and you captain jodd and your men what do you ask  such donation as it may please the augustus to bestow and after that permission to follow wherever our general olaf goes since he is our care here we have made so many enemies that we cannot sleep at night  the empress of the world falls from her throne mused constantine and not even a waitingmaid attends her to her prison but a blinded captain finds a regiment to escort him hence in love and honour as though he were a newcrowned king truly fortune is a jester if ever fate should rob me of my eyes i wonder when i had nothing more to give them if three hundred faithful swords would follow me to ruin and to exile  thus he thought aloud afterwards he jodd and some others martina among them went aside leaving me seated on a bench presently they returned and constantine said  general olaf i and your companions have taken counsel listen but today messengers have come from lesbos whom we met outside the gates it seems that the governor there is dead and that the accursed moslems threaten to storm the isle as soon as summer comes and add it to their empire our christian subjects there pray that a new governor may be appointed one who knows war and that with him may be sent troops sufficient to repel the prophetworshippers who not having many ships cannot attack in great force now captain jodd thinks this task will be to the liking of the northmen and though you are blind i think that you would serve me well as governor of lesbos is it your pleasure to accept this office  aye with thankfulness augustus i answered only after the moslems are beaten back if it pleases god that it should so befall i ask leave of absence for a while since there is one for whom i must search  i grant it who name captain jodd your deputy stay theres one more thing in lesbos my mother has large vineyards and estates as part payment of her debt these shall be conveyed to you nay no thanks it is i who owe them whatever his faults constantine is not ungrateful moreover enough time has been spent upon this matter what say you officer that the armenians are marshalled and that you have stauracius safe good i come to lead them then to the hippodrome to be proclaimed     book iii  egypt    chapter i  tidings from egypt  that curtain of oblivion without rent or seam sinks again upon the visions of this past of mine it falls as it were on the last of the scenes in the dreadful chamber of the pit to rise once more far from byzantium  i am blind and can see nothing for the power which enables me to disinter what lies buried beneath the weight and wreck of so many ages tells me no more than those things that once my senses knew what i did not hear then i do not hear now what i did not see then i do not see now thus it comes about that of lesbos itself of the shape of its mountains or the colour of its seas i can tell nothing more than i was told because my sight never dwelt on them in any life that i can remember    it was evening the heat of the sun had passed and the night breeze blew through the wide cool chamber in which i sat with martina whom the soldiers in their rude fashion called olafs brown dog for brown was her colouring and she led me from place to place as dogs are trained to lead blind men yet against her the roughest of them never said an evil word not from fear but because they knew that none could be said  martina was talking she who always loved to talk if not of one thing then of another  godson she said although you are a great grumbler i tell you that in my judgment you were born under a lucky star or saint call it which you will for instance when you were walking up and down that hall of the pit in the palace at constantinople which i always dream of now if i sup too late  and your spirit or double or whatever you call it was kindly leading me round the edge of the deathtrap i interrupted  and my spirit or double making itself useful for once was doing what you say well who would have thought that before so very long you would be the governor much beloved of the rich and prosperous island of lesbos still the commander much beloved of troops many of them your own countrymen and although you are blind the imperial general who has dealt the moslems one of the worst defeats they have suffered for a long while  jodd and the others did that i answered i only sat here and made the plans  jodd she exclaimed with contempt jodd has no more head for plans than a doorpost although it is true she added with a softening of the voice that he is a good man to lean on at a pinch and a very terrible fighter also one who can keep such brain as god gave him cool in the hour of terror as irene knows well enough yet it was you olaf not even i but you who remembered that the northmen are seafolk born and turned all those trading vessels into wargalleys and hid them in the little bays with a few of your people in command of each it was you who suffered the moslem fleet to sail unmolested into the mitylene harbours pretending and giving notice that the only defence would be by land then after they were at anchor and beginning to disembark it was you who fell on them at the dawn and sank and slew till none remained save those of their army who were taken prisoners or spared for ransom yes and you commanded our ships in person and at night who is a better captain than a blind man oh you did well very well and you are rich with irenes lands and sit here in comfort and in honour with the best of health save for your blindness and i repeat that you were born under a lucky staror saint  not altogether so martina i answered with a sigh  ah she replied man can never be content as usual you are thinking of that egyptian i mean of the lady heliodore of whom of course it is quite right that you should think well it is true that we have heard nothing of her still that does not mean that we may not hear perhaps jodd has learned something from those prisoners hark he comes  as she spoke i heard the guards salute without and jodds heavy step at the door of the chamber  greeting general he said presently i bring you good news the messengers to the sultan harun have returned with the ransom also this caliph sends a writing signed by himself and his ministers in which he swears by god and his prophet that in consideration of our giving up our prisoners among whom it seems are some great men neither he nor his successors will attempt any new attack upon lesbos for thirty years the interpreter will read it to you tomorrow and you can send your answering letters with the prisoners  seeing that these heathen are so many and we are so few we could scarcely look for better terms i said as i hope they will think at constantinople at least the prisoners shall sail when all is in order now for another matter have you inquired as to the bishop barnabas and the egyptian prince magas and his daughter  aye general this very day i found that among the prisoners were three of the commoner sort who have served in egypt and left that land not three months ago of these men two have never heard of the bishop or the others the third however who was wounded in the fight had some tidings  what tidings jodd  none that are good general the bishop he says was killed by moslems a while ago or so he had been told  god rest him but the others jodd what of the others  this it seems that the copt as he called him magas returned from a long journey as we know he did and raised an insurrection somewhere in the south of egypt far up the nile an expedition was sent against him under one musa the governor of egypt and there was much fighting in which this prisoner took part the end of it was that the copts who fought with magas were conquered with slaughter magas himself was slain for he would not fly and his daughter the lady heliodore was taken prisoner with some other coptic women  and then i gasped  then general she was brought before the emir musa who noting her beauty proposed to make her his slave at her prayer however being as the prisoner said a merciful man he gave her a week to mourn her father before she entered his harem still the worst he went on hurriedly did not happen before that week was done as the moslem force was marching down the nile she stabbed the eunuch who was in charge of her and escaped  i thank god i said but jodd how is the man sure that she was heliodore  thus all knew her to be the daughter of magas one whom the egyptians held in honour moreover among the moslem soldiers she was named the lady of the shells because of a certain necklace she wore which you will remember  what more i asked  only that the emir musa was very angry at her loss and because of it caused certain soldiers to be beaten on the feet moreover he halted his army and offered a reward for her for two days they hunted even searching some tombs where it was thought she might have hidden but there found nothing but the dead then the emir returned down the nile and that is the end of the story  send this prisoner to me at once jodd with an interpreter i would question him myself  i fear he is not fit to come general  then i will go to him lead me martina  if so you must go far general for he died an hour ago and his companions are making him ready for burial  jodd i said angrily those men have been in our hands for weeks how comes it that you did not discover these things before you had my orders  because general until they knew that they were to go free none of these prisoners would tell us anything however closely they were questioned they said that it was against their oath and that first they would die a long while ago i asked this very man of egypt and he vowed that he had never been there  be comforted olaf broke in martina for what more could he have told you  nothing perchance i answered yet i should have gained many days of time know that i go to egypt to search for heliodore  be comforted again said martina this you could not have done until the peace was signed it would have been against your oath and duty  that is so i answered heavily    olaf said martina to me that night after jodd had left us you say that you will go to egypt how will you go will the blind christian general of the empire who has just dealt so great a defeat to the mighty caliph of the east be welcome in egypt above all will he be welcomed by the emir musa who rules there when it is known that he comes to seek a woman who has escaped from that emirs harem why within an hour hed offer you the choice between death and the koran olaf this thing is madness  it may be martina still i go to seek heliodore  if heliodore still lives you will not help her by dying and if she is dead time will be little to her and she can wait for you a while  yet i go martina  you being blind go to egypt to seek one whom those who rule there have searched for in vain so be it but how will you go it cannot be as an open enemy since then you would need a fleet and ten thousand swords to back you which you have not to take a few brave men unless they were moslems which is impossible would be but to give them to death how do you go olaf  i do not know martina your brain is more nimble than mine think think and tell me  i heard martina rise and walk up and down the room for a long time at length she returned and sat herself by me again  olaf she said you always had a taste for music you have told me that as a boy in your northern home you used to play upon the harp and sing songs to it of your own making and now since you have been blind you have practised at this art till you are its master also my voice is good indeed it is my only gift it was my voice that first brought me to irenes notice when i was but the daughter of a poor greek gentleman who had been her fathers friend and therefore was given a small place about the court of late we have sung many songs together have we not certain of them in that northern tongue of which you have taught me something  yes martina but what of it  you are dull olaf i have heard that these easterns love music especially if it be of a sort they do not know why therefore should not a blind man and his daughterno his orphaned nieceearn an honest living as travelling musicians in egypt these prophet worshippers i am told think it a great sin to harm one who is maimeda poor northern trader in amber who has been robbed by christian thieves rendered sightless also that he might not be able to swear to them before the judges and now with his sisters child winning his bread as best he may like you olaf i have skill in languages and even know enough of arabic to beg in it for my mother who was a syrian taught it to me as a child and since we have been here i have practised what say you  i say that we might travel as safely thus as in any other way yet martina how can i ask you to tie such a burden on your back  oh no need to ask olaf since fate bound it there when it made me yourgodmother where you go i needs must go also until you are married she added with a laugh afterwards perhaps you will need me no more well theres a plan for what it is worth and now well sleep on it hoping to find a better pray to st michael tonight olaf  as it chanced st michael gave me no light so the end of it was that i determined to play this part of a blind harper in those days there was a trade between lesbos and egypt in cedar wood wool wine for the copts for the moslems drank none and other goods peace having been declared between the island and the caliph a small vessel was laden with such merchandise at my cost and a greek of lesbos menas by name put in command of it as the owner with a crew of sailors whom i could trust to the death  to these men who were christians i told my business swearing them to secrecy by the most holy of all oaths but alas as i shall show although i could trust these sailors when they were masters of themselves i could not trust them or rather one of them when wine was his master in our northern land we had a saying that ale is another man and now its truth was to be proved to me not for the first time  when all was ready i made known my plans to jodd alone in whose hands i left a writing to say what must be done if i returned no more to the other officers and the soldiers i said only that i proposed to make a journey in this trading ship disguised as a merchant both for my healths sake and to discover for myself the state of the surrounding countries and especially of the christians in egypt  when he had heard all jodd although he was a hopefulminded man grew sad over this journey which i could see he thought would be my last  i expected no less he said and yet general i trusted that your saint might keep your feet on some safer path doubtless this lady heliodore is dead or fled or wed at least you will never find her  still i must search for her jodd  you are a blind man how can you search  then an idea came to him and he added  listen general i and the rest of us swore to protect the lady heliodore and to be as her father or her brothers do you bide here i will go to search for her either with a vessel full of armed men or alone disguised  now i laughed outright and asked  what disguise is there that would hide the giant jodd whose fame the moslem spies have spread throughout the east why on the darkest night your voice would betray you to all within a hundred paces and what use would one shipload of armed men be against the forces of the emir of egypt no no jodd whatever the danger i must go and i alone if i am killed or do not return within eight months i have named you to be governor of lesbos as already you have been named my deputy by constantine which appointment will probably be confirmed  i do not want to be governor of lesbos said jodd moreover olaf he added slowly a blind beggar must have his dog to lead him his brown dog you cannot go alone olaf those dangers of which you speak must be shared by another  that is so and it troubles me much indeed it is in my mind to seek some other guide for i think this one would be safest here in your charge you must reason with her jodd one can ask too much even of a godmother  of a godmother why not say of a grandmother by thor olaf you are blind indeed still ill try hush here she comes to say that our supper is ready  at our meal several others were present besides the serving folk and the talk was general after it was done i had an interview with some officers these left and i sat myself down upon a cushioned couch and being tired there fell asleep till i was awakened or rather half awakened by voices talking in the garden without they were those of jodd and martina and martina was saying  cease your words i and no one else will go on this egyptian quest with olaf if we die as i dare say we shall what does it matter at least he shall not die alone  and if the quest should fail martina i mean if he should not find the lady heliodore and you should happen both to return safe what then  why thennothing except that as it has been so it will be i shall continue to play my part as is my duty and my wish do you not remember that i am olafs godmother  yes i remember still i have heard somewhere that the christian church never ties a knot which it cannot unloosefor a proper fee and for my part i do not know why a man should not marry one of different blood because she has been named his godmother before a stone vessel by a man in a broidered robe you say i do not understand such matters perhaps so let them be but martina let us suppose that this strange search were to succeed and olaf has a way of succeeding where others would fail for instance who else could have escaped alive out of the hand of irene and become governor of lesbos and being blind yet have planned a great victory well supposing that by the help of gods or menor womenhe should find this beautiful heliodore unwed and still willing and that they should marry what then martina  then captain jodd she answered slowly if you are yet of the same mind we may talk again only remember that i ask no promises and make none  so you go to egypt with olaf  aye certainly unless i should die first and perhaps even then you do not understand oh of course you do not understand nor can i stop to explain to you captain jodd i am going to egypt with a certain blind beggar whose name i forget at the moment but who is my uncle where no doubt i shall see many strange things if ever i come back i will tell you about them and meanwhile good night    chapter ii  the statues by the nile  the first thing that i remember of this journey to egypt is that i was sitting in the warm morning sunshine on the deck of our little trading vessel that went by the name of the heathen goddess diana we were in the port of alexandria martina who now went by the name of hilda stood by my side describing to me the great city that lay before us  she told me of the famous pharos still rising from its rock although in it the warning light no longer burned for since the moslems took egypt they had let it die as some said because they feared lest it should guide a christian fleet to attack them she described also the splendid palaces that the greeks had built many of them now empty or burned out the christian churches the mosques the broad streets and the grassgrown quays  as we were thus engaged she talking and i listening and asking questions she said  the boat is coming with the saracen officers of the port who must inspect and pass the ship before she is allowed to discharge her cargo now olaf remember that henceforth you are called hodur i had taken this name after that of the blind god of the northern peoples play your part well and above all be humble if you are reviled or even struck show no anger and be sure to keep that red sword of yours close hidden beneath your robe if you do these things we shall be safe for i tell you that we are well disguised  the boat came alongside and i heard men climbing the ships ladder then someone kicked me it was our captain menas who also had his part to play  out of the road you blind beggar he said the noble officers of the caliph board our ship and you block their path  touch not one whom god has afflicted said a grave voice speaking in bad greek it is easy for us to walk round the man but who is he captain and why does he come to egypt by their looks he and the woman with him might well have seen happier days  i know not lord answered the captain who after they paid their passage money took no more note of them still they play and sing well and served to keep the sailors in good humour when we were becalmed  sir i broke in i am a northman named hodur and this woman is my niece i was a trader in amber but thieves robbed me and my companions of all we had as we journeyed to byzantium me who was the leader of our band they held to ransom blinding me lest i should be able to swear to them again but the others they killed this is the only child of my sister who married a greek and now we get our living by our skill in music  truly you christians love each other well said the officer accept the koran and you will not be treated thus but why do you come to egypt  sir we heard that it is a rich land where the people love music and have come hoping to earn some money here that we may put by to live on send us not away sir we have a little offering to make niece hilda where is the gold piece i gave you offer it to this lord  nay nay said the officer shall i take bread out of the mouth of the poor clerk he added in arabic to a man who was with him make out a writing giving leave to these two to land and to ply their business anywhere in egypt without question or hindrance and bring it to me to seal farewell musicians i fear you will find money scarce in egypt for the land has been stricken with a famine yet go and prosper in the name of god and may he turn your hearts to the true faith  thus it came about that through the good mind of this moslem whose name as i learned when we met again was yusuf our feet were lifted over many stumblingblocks thus it seems that by virtue of his office he had power to prevent the entry into the land of such folk as we seemed to be which power if they were christians was almost always put in force yet because he had seen the captain appear to illtreat me or because being a soldier himself he guessed that i was of the same trade whatever tale it might please me to tell this rule was not enforced moreover the writing which he gave me enabled me to go where we wished in egypt without let or hindrance whenever we were stopped or threatened which happened to us several times it was enough if we presented it to the nearest person in authority who could read after which we were allowed to pass upon our way unhindered  before we left the ship i had a last conversation with the captain menas telling him that he was to lie in the harbour always pretending that he waited for some cargo not yet forthcoming such as unharvested corn or whatever was convenient until we appeared again if after a certain while we did not appear then he was to make a trading journey to neighbouring ports and return to alexandria these artifices he must continue to practise until orders to the contrary reached him under my own hand or until he had sure evidence that we were dead all this the man promised that he would do  yes said martina who was with me you promise captain and we believe you but the question is can you answer for the others for instance for the sailor cosmas there who i see is already drunken and talking loudly about many things  henceforth lady cosmas shall drink water only when not in his cups he is an honest fellow and i do answer for him  yet alas as the end showed cosmas was not to be answered for by anyone    we went ashore and took up our abode in a certain house where we were safe whether the christian owners of that house did or did not know who we were i am not certain at any rate through them we were introduced at night into the palace of politian the melchite patriarch of alexandria he was a sternfaced blackbearded man of honest heart but narrow views of whom the bishop barnabas had often spoken to me as his closest friend to this politian i told all under the seal of our faith asking his aid in my quest when i had finished my tale he thought a while then he said  you are a bold man general olaf so bold that i think god must be leading you to his own ends now you have heard aright barnabas my beloved brother and your father in christ has been taken hence he was murdered by some fanatic moslems soon after his return from byzantium also it is true that the prince magas was killed in war by the emir musa and that the lady heliodore escaped out of his clutches what became of her afterwards no man knows but for my part i believe that she is dead  and i believe that she is alive i answered and therefore i go to seek her  seek and ye shall find mused the patriarch at least i hope so though my advice to you is to bide here and send others to seek  that i will not do i answered again  then go and god be with you ill warn certain of the faithful of your coming so that you may not lack a friend at need when you return if you should ever return come to me for i have more influence with these moslems than most and may be able to serve you i can say no more and it is not safe that you should tarry here too long stay i forget there are two things you should know the first is that the emir musa he who seized the lady heliodore is about to be deposed i have the news from the caliph harun himself for with him i am on friendly terms because of a service i did him through my skill in medicine the second is that irene has beguiled constantine or bewitched him i know not which at least by his own proclamation once more she rules the empire jointly with himself and that i think will be his death warrant and perhaps yours also  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof i said now if i live i shall learn whether any oaths are sacred to irene as will constantine  then we parted    leaving alexandria we wandered first to the town of misra which stood near to the mighty pyramids beneath whose shadow we slept one night in an empty tomb thence by slow marches we made our way up the banks of the nile earning our daily bread by the exercise of our art once or twice we were stopped as spies but always released again when i produced the writing that the officer yusuf had given me upon the ship for the rest none molested us in a land where wandering beggars were so common of money it is true we earned little but as we had gold in plenty sewn into our garments this did not matter food was all we needed and that as i have said was never lacking  so we went on our strange journey day by day learning more of the tongues spoken in egypt and especially of arabic which the moslems used whither did we journey we know not for certain what i sought to find were those two huge statues of which i had dreamed at aar on the night of the robbing of the wanderers tomb we heard that there were such figures of stone which were said to sing at daybreak and that they sat upon a plain on the western bank of the nile near to the ruins of the great city of thebes now but a village called by the arabs eluksor or the palaces so far as we could discover it was in the neighbourhood of this city that heliodore had escaped from musa and there if anywhere i hoped to gain tidings of her fate also something within my heart drew me to those images of forgotten gods or men  at length two months or more after we left alexandria from the deck of the boat in which we had hired a passage for the last hundred miles of our journey martina saw to the east the ruins of thebes to the west she saw other ruins and seated in front of them two mighty figures of stone  this is the place she said and my heart leapt at her words now let us land and follow our fortune  so when the boat was tied up at sunset to the west bank of the river as it happened we bade farewell to the owner and went ashore  whither now asked martina  to the figures of stone i answered  so she led me through fields in which the corn was growing to the edge of the desert meeting no man all the way then for a mile or more we tramped through sand till at length late at night martina halted  we stand beneath the statues she said and they are awesome to look on mighty seated kings higher than a tall tree  what lies behind them i asked  the ruins of a great temple  lead me to that temple  so we passed through a gateway into a court and there we halted  now tell me what you see i said  we stand in what has been a hall of many columns she answered but the most of them are broken at our feet is a pool in which there is a little water before us lies the plain on which the statues sit stretching some miles to the nile that is fringed with palms across the broad nile are the ruins of old thebes behind us are more ruins and a line of rugged hills of stone and in them a little to the north the mouth of a valley the scene is very beautiful beneath the moon but very sad and desolate  it is the place that i saw in my dream many years ago at aar i said  it may be she answered but if so it must have changed since save for a jackal creeping among the columns and a dog that barks in some distant village i neither see nor hear a living thing what now olaf  now we will eat and sleep i said perhaps light will come to us in our sleep  so we ate of the food we had brought with us and afterwards lay down to rest in a little chamber painted round with gods that martina found in the ruins of the temple  during that night no dreams came to me nor did anything happen to disturb us even in this old temple of which the very pavingstones were worn through by the feet of the dead  before the dawn martina led me back to the colossal statues and we waited there hoping that we should hear them sing as tradition said they did when the sun rose yet the sun came up as it had done from the beginning of the world and struck upon those giant effigies as it had done for some two thousand years or so i was told and they remained quite silent i do not think that ever i grieved more over my blindness than on this day when i must depend upon martina to tell me of the glory of that sunrise over the egyptian desert and those mighty ruins reared by the hands of forgotten men  well the sun rose and since the statues would not speak i took my harp and played upon it and martina sang a wild eastern song to my playing it seemed that our music was heard at any rate a few folk going out to labour came to see by whom it was caused and finding only two wandering musicians presently went away again still one remained a woman coptic by her dress with whom i heard martina talk she asked who we were and why we had come to such a place whereon martina repeated to her the story which we had told a hundred times the woman answered that we should earn little money in those parts as the famine had been sore there owing to the low nile of the previous season until the crops were ripe again which in the case of most of them would not be for some weeks even food she added must be scarce though few were left to eat it since the moslems had killed out most of those who dwelt in that district of upper egypt  martina replied that she knew this was so and therefore we had proposed either to travel on to nubia or to return north still as i her blind uncle was not well we had landed from a boat hoping that we might find some place where we could rest for a week or two until i grew stronger  yet she continued meaningly being poor christian folk we know not where to look for such a place since cross worshippers are not welcome among those who follow the prophet  now when the woman heard that we were christians her voice changed i also am a christian she said but give me the sign  so we made the sign of the cross on our breasts which a moslem will die rather than do  my husband and i went on the woman live yonder at the village of kurna which is situated near to the mouth of the valley that is called bibanelmeluk or gate of the kings for there the monarchs of old days who were the forefathers or rulers of us copts lie buried it is but a very small village for the moslems have killed most of us in a war that was raised a while ago between them and our hereditary prince magas yet my husband and i have a good house there and being poor shall be glad to give you food and shelter if you can pay us something  the end of it was that after some chaffering for we dared not show that we had much money a bargain was struck between us and this good woman who was named palka having paid her a weeks charges in advance she led us to the village of kurna which was nearly an hours walk away and here made us known to her husband a middleaged man named marcus who took little note of anything save his farming  this he carried on upon a patch of fertile ground that was irrigated by a spring which flowed from the mountains also he had other lands near to the nile where he grew corn and fodder for his beasts in his house that once had been part of some great stone building of the ancients and still remained far larger than he could use for this pair had no children we were given two good rooms here we dwelt in comfort since notwithstanding the scarcity of the times marcus was richer than he seemed and lived well as for the village of kurna its people all told did not amount to more than thirty souls christians every one of them who were visited from time to time by a coptic priest from some distant monastery in the mountains  by degrees we grew friendly with palka a pleasant bustling woman of good birth who loved to hear of the outside world moreover she was very shrewd and soon began to suspect that we were more than mere wandering players  pretending to be weak and ill i did not go out much but followed her about the house while she was working talking to her on many matters  thus i led up the subject of prince magas and his rebellion and learned that he had been killed at a place about fifty miles south from kurna then i asked if it were true that his daughter had been killed with him  what do you know of the lady heliodore she asked sharply  only that my niece who for a while was a servant in the palace at byzantium before she was driven away with others after the empress fell saw her there indeed it was her business to wait upon her and her father the prince therefore she is interested in her fate  it seems that you are more interested than your niece who has never spoken a word to me concerning her answered palka well since you are a man i should not have thought this strange had you not been blind for they say she was the most beautiful woman in egypt as for her fate you must ask god since none know it when the army of musa was encamped yonder by the nile my husband marcus who had taken two donkeyloads of forage for sale to the camp and was returning by moonlight saw her run past him a red knife in her hand her face set towards the gateway of the kings after that he saw her no more nor did anyone else although they hunted long enough even in the tombs which the moslems like our people fear to visit doubtless she fell or threw herself into some hole in the rocks or perhaps the wild beasts ate her better so than that a child of the old pharaohs should become the woman of an infidel  yes i answered better so but why do folk fear to visit those tombs of which you speak palka  why because they are haunted that is all and even the bravest dread the sight of a ghost how could they be otherwise than haunted seeing that yonder valley is sown with the mighty dead like a field with corn  yet the dead sleep quietly enough palka  aye the common dead hodur but not these kings and queens and princes who being gods of a kind cannot die it is said that they hold their revels yonder at night with songs and wild laughter and that those who look upon them come to an evil end within a year whether this be so i cannot say since for many years none have dared to visit that place at night yet that they eat i know well enough  how do you know palka  for a good reason with the others in this village i supply the offerings of their food the story runs that once the great building of which this house is a part was a college of heathen priests whose duty it was to make offerings to the dead in the royal tombs when the christians came those priests were driven away but we of kurna who live in their house still make the offerings if we did not misfortune would overtake us as indeed has always happened if they were forgotten or neglected it is the rent that we pay to the ghosts of the kings twice a week we pay it setting food and milk and water upon a certain stone near to the mouth of the valley  then what happens palka  nothing except that the offering is taken  by beggar folk or perchance by wild creatures  would beggar folk dare to enter that place of death she answered with contempt or would wild beasts take the food and pile the dishes neatly together and replace the flat stones on the mouths of the jars of milk and water as a housewife might oh do not laugh of late this has always been done as i who often fetch the vessels know well  have you ever seen these ghosts palka  yes once i saw one of them it was about two months ago that i passed the mouth of the valley after moonrise for i had been kept out late searching for a kid which was lost thinking that it might be in the valley i peered up it as i was looking from round a great rock glided a ghost she stood still with the moonlight shining on her and gazed towards the nile i too stood still in the shadow thirty or forty paces away then she threw up her arms as though in despair turned and vanished  she i said then checked myself and asked indifferently well what was the fashion of this ghost  so far as i could see that of a young and beautiful woman wearing such clothes as we find upon the ancient dead only wrapped more loosely about her  had she aught upon her head palka  yes a band of gold or a crown set upon her hair and about her neck what seemed to be a necklace of green and gold for the moonlight flashed upon it it was much such a necklace as you wear beneath your robe hodur  and pray how do you know what i wear palka i asked  by means of what you lack poor man the eyes in my head one night when you were asleep i had need to pass through your chamber to reach another beyond you had thrown off your outer garment because of the heat and i saw the necklace also i saw a great red sword lying by your side and noted on your bare breast sundry scars such as hunters and soldiers come by all of these things hodur i thought strange seeing that i know you to be nothing but a poor blind beggar who gains his bread by his skill upon the harp  there are beggars who were not always beggars palka i said slowly  quite so hodur and there are great men and rich who sometimes appear to be beggars andmany other things still have no fear that we shall steal your necklace or talk about the red sword or the gold with which your niece hilda weights her garments poor girl she has all the ways of a fine lady one who has known courts as i think you said was the case it must be sad for her to have fallen so low still have no fear hodur and she took my hand and pressed it in a certain secret fashion which was practised among the persecuted christians in the east when they would reveal themselves to each other then she went away laughing  as for me i sought martina who had been sleeping through the heat and told her everything  well she said when i had finished you should give thanks to god olaf since without doubt this ghost is the lady heliodore so should jodd i heard her add beneath her breath for in my blindness my ears had grown very quick    chapter iii  the valley of the dead kings  martina and i had made a plan palka after much coaxing took us with her one evening when she went to place the accustomed offerings in the valley of the dead indeed at first she refused outright to allow us to accompany her because she said only those who were born in the village of kurna had made such offerings since the days when the pharaohs ruled and that if strangers shared in this duty it might bring misfortune we answered however that if so the misfortune would fall on us the intruders also we pointed out that the jars of water and milk were heavy and as it happened there was no one from the hamlet to help to carry them this night having weighed these facts palka changed her mind  well she said it is true that i grow fat and after labouring all day at this and that have no desire to bear burdens like an ass so come if you will and if you die or evil spirits carry you away do not add yourselves to the number of the ghosts of whom there are too many hereabouts and blame me afterwards  on the contrary i said we will make you our heirs and i laid a bag containing some pieces of money upon the table  palka who was a saving woman took the money for i heard it rattle in her hand hung the jars about my shoulders and gave martina the meat and corn in a basket the flat cakes however she carried herself on a wooden trencher because as she said she feared lest we should break them and anger the ghosts who liked their food to be well served so we started and presently entered the mouth of that awful valley which martina told me looked as though it had been riven through the mountain by lightning strokes and then blasted with a curse  up this dry and desolate place which she said was bordered on either side by walls of grey and jagged rock we walked in silence only i noted that the dog which had followed us from the house clung close to our heels and now and again whimpered uneasily  the beast sees what we cannot see whispered palka in explanation  at last we halted and i set down the jars at her bidding upon a flat rock which she called the table of offerings  see she exclaimed to martina those that were placed here three days ago are all emptied and neatly piled together by the ghosts i told hodur that they did this but he would not believe me now let us pack them up in the baskets and begone for the sun sets and the moon rises within the half of an hour i would not be here in the dark for ten pieces of pure gold  then go swiftly palka i said for we bide here this night  are you mad she asked  not at all i answered a wise man once told me that if one who is blind can but come face to face with a spirit he sees it and thereby regains his sight if you would know the truth that is why i have wandered so far from my own country to find some land where ghosts may be met  now i am sure that you are mad exclaimed palka come hilda and leave this fool to make trial of his cure for blindness  nay answered martina i must stay with my uncle although i am very much afraid if i did not he would beat me afterwards  beat you hodur beat a woman oh you are both mad or perhaps you are ghosts also i have thought it once or twice who at least am sure that you are other than you seem holy jesus this place grows dark and i tell you it is full of dead kings may the saints guard you at the least youll keep high company at your death farewell whateer befalls blame me not who warned you and she departed at a run the empty vessels rattling on her back and the dog yapping behind her  when she had gone the silence grew deep  now martina i whispered find some place where we may hide whence you can see this table of offerings  she led me to where a fallen rock lay within a few paces and behind it we sat ourselves down in such a position that martina could watch the table of offerings by the light of the moon  here we waited for a long while it may have been two hours or three or four at least i knew that although i could see nothing the solemnity of that place sank into my soul i felt as though the dead were moving about me in the silence i think it was the same with martina for although the night was very hot in that stifling airless valley she shivered at my side at last i felt her start and heard her whisper  i see a figure it creeps from the shadow of the cliff towards the table of offerings  what is it like i asked  it is a womans figure draped in white cloths she looks about her she takes up the offerings and places them in a basket she carries it is a womanno ghostfor she drinks from one of the jars oh now the moonlight shines upon her face it is that of heliodore  i heard and could restrain myself no longer leaping up i ran towards where i knew the table of offerings to be i tried to speak but my voice choked in my throat the woman saw or heard me coming through the shadows at least uttering a low cry she fled away for i caught the sound of her feet on the rocks and sand then i tripped over a stone and fell down  in a moment martina was at my side  truly you are foolish olaf she said did you think that the lady heliodore would know you at night changed as you are and in this garb that you must rush at her like an angry bull now she has gone and perchance we shall never find her more why did you not speak to her  because my voice choked within me oh blame me not martina if you knew what it is to love as i do and after so many fears and sorrows  i trust that i should know also how to control my love broke in martina sharply come waste no more time in talk let us search  then she took me by the hand and led me to where she had last seen heliodore  she has vanished away she said here is nothing but rock  it cannot be i answered oh that i had my eyes again if for an hour i who was the best tracker in jutland see if no stone has been stirred martina the sand will be damper where it has lain  she left me and presently returned  i have found something she said when heliodore fled she still held her basket which from the look of it was last used by the pharaohs at least one of the cakes has fallen from or through it come  she led me to the cliff and up it to perhaps twice the height of a man then round a projecting rock  here is a hole she said such as jackals might make perchance it leads into one of the old tombs whereof the mouth is sealed it was on the edge of the hole that i found the cake therefore doubtless heliodore went down it now what shall we do  follow i think where is it  nay i go first give me your hand olaf and lie upon your breast  i did so and presently felt the weight of martina swinging on my arm  leave go she said faintly like one who is afraid  i obeyed though with doubt and heard her feet strike upon some floor  thanks be the saints all is well she said for aught i knew this hole might have been as deep as that in the chamber of the pit let yourself down it feet first and drop tis but shallow  i did so and found myself beside martina  now in the darkness you are the better guide she whispered lead on ill follow holding to your robe  so i crept forward warily and safely as the blind can do till presently she exclaimed  halt here is light again i think that the roof of the tomb for by the paintings on the walls such it must be has fallen in it seems to be a kind of central chamber out of which run great galleries that slope downwards and are full of bats ah one of them is caught in my hair olaf i will go no farther i fear bats more than ghosts or anything in the world  now i considered a while till a thought struck me on my back was my beggars harp i unslung it and swept its chords and wild and sad they sounded in that solemn place then i began to sing an old song that twice or thrice i had sung with heliodore in byzantium this song told of a lover seeking his mistress it was for two voices since in the song the mistress answered verse for verse here are those of the lines that i remember or rather the spirit of them rendered into english i sang the first verse and waited       dear maid of mine         i bid my strings      beat on thy shrine         with musics wings      palace or cell         a shrine i see      if there thou dwell         and answer me  there was no answer so i sang the second verse and once more waited       on thy loves fire         my passion breathes      wind of desire         thy incense wreathes      greeting to thee         or soon or late      i bond or free         am dedicate  and from somewhere far away in the recesses of that great cave came the answering strophe       o love sublime         and undismayed      no touch of time         upon thee laid      that that is thine         ended the quest      i seek my shrine         upon thy breast  then i laid down the harp  at last a voice the voice of heliodore speaking whence i knew not asked  do the dead sing or is it a living man and if so how is that man named  a living man i replied and he is named olaf son of thorvald or otherwise michael that name was given him in the cathedral at byzantium where first his eyes fell on a certain heliodore daughter of magas the egyptian whom now he seeks  i heard the sound of footsteps creeping towards me and heliodores voice say  let me see your face you who name yourself olaf for know that in these haunted tombs ghosts and visions and mocking voices play strange tricks why do you hide your face you who call yourself olaf  because the eyes are gone from it heliodore irene robbed it of the eyes from jealousy of you swearing that never more should they behold your beauty perchance you would not wish to come too near to an eyeless man wrapped in a beggars robe  she lookedi felt her look she sobbedi heard her sob and then her arms were about me and her lips were pressed upon my own  so at length came joy such as i cannot tell the joy of lost love found again    a while went by how long i know not and at last i said  where is martina it is time we left this place  martina she exclaimed do you mean irenes lady and is she here if so how comes she to be travelling with you olaf  as the best friend man ever had heliodore as one who clung to him in his ruin and saved him from a cruel death as one who has risked her life to help him in his desperate search and without whom that search had failed  then may god reward her olaf for i did not know there were such women in the world lady martina where are you lady martina  thrice she cried the words and at the third time an answer came from the shadows at a distance  i am here said martinas voice with a little yawn i was weary and have slept while you two greeted each other well met at last lady heliodore see i have brought you back your olaf blind it is true but otherwise lacking nothing of health and strength and station  then heliodore ran to her and kissed first her hand and next her lips in after days she told me that for those of one who had been sleeping the eyes of martina seemed to be strangely wet and red but if this were so her voice trembled not at all  truly you two should give thanks to god she said who has brought you together again in so wondrous a fashion as i do on your behalf from the bottom of my heart yet you are still hemmed round by dangers many and great what now olaf will you become a ghost also and dwell here in the tomb with heliodore and if so what tale shall i tell to palka and the rest  not so i answered i think it will be best that we should return to kurna heliodore must play her part as the spirit of a queen till we can hire some boat and escape with her down the nile  never she cried i cannot i cannot having come together we must separate no more oh olaf you do not know what a life has been mine during all these dreadful months when i escaped from musa by stabbing the eunuch who was in charge of me for which hideous deed may i be forgiven and i felt her shudder at my side i fled i knew not whither till i found myself in this valley where i hid till the night was gone then at daybreak i peeped out from the mouth of the valley and saw the moslems searching for me but as yet a long way off also now i knew this valley it was that to which my father had brought me as a child when he came to search for the buryingplace of his ancestor the pharaoh which records he had read told him was here i remembered everything where the tomb should be how we had entered it through a hole how we had found the mummy of a royal lady whose face was covered with a gilded mask and on her breast the necklace which i wear  i ran along the valley searching the left side of it with my eyes till i saw a flat stone which i knew again it was called the table of offerings i was sure that the hole by which we had entered the tomb was quite near to this stone and a little above it in the face of the cliff i climbed i found what seemed to be the hole though of this i could not be certain i crept down it till it came to an end and then in my terror hung by my hands and dropped into the darkness not knowing whither i fell or caring over much if i were killed as it chanced it was but a little way and finding myself unhurt i crawled along the cavern till i reached this place where there is light for here the roof of the cave has fallen in while i crouched amid the rocks i heard the voices of the soldiers above me heard their officer also bidding them bring ropes and torches to the left of where you stand there is a sloping passage that runs down to the great central chamber where sleeps some mighty king and out of this passage open other chambers into the first of these the light of the morning sun struggles feebly i entered it seeking somewhere to hide myself and saw a painted coffin lying on the floor near to the marble sarcophagus from which it had been dragged it was that in which we had found the body of my ancestress but since then thieves had been in this place we had left the coffin in the sarcophagus and the mummy in the coffin and replaced their lids now the mummy lay on the floor half unwrapped and broken in two beneath the breast moreover the face which i remembered as being so like my own was gone to dust so that there remained of it nothing but a skull to which hung tresses of long black hair as indeed you may see for yourself  by the side of the body was the gilded mask with black and staring eyes and the painted breastpiece of stiff linen neither of which the thieves had found worth stealing  i looked and a thought came to me lifting the mummy i thrust it into the sarcophagus all of it save the gilded mask and the painted breastpiece of stiff linen then i laid myself down in the coffin of which the lid still lying crosswise hid me to the waist and drew the gilded mask and painted breastpiece over my head and bosom scarcely was it done when the soldiers entered by now the reflected sunlight had faded from the place leaving it in deep shadow but some of the men held burning torches made from splinters of old coffins that were full of pitch  feet have passed here i saw the marks of them in the dust said the officer she may have hidden in this place search search it will go hard with us if we return to musa to tell him that he has lost his toy  they looked into the sarcophagus and saw the broken mummy indeed one of them lifted it unwillingly enough and let it fall again saying grimly  musa would scarce care for this companion though in her day she may have been fair enough  then they came to the coffin  heres another exclaimed the soldier and one with a gold face allah how its eyes stare  pull it out said the officer  let that be your task answered the man ill defile myself with no more corpses  the officer came and looked what a haunted hole is this full of the ghosts of idol worshippers or so i think he said those eyes stare curses at us well the christian maid is not here on before the torches fail  then they went leaving me the painted linen creaked upon my breast as i breathed again  till nightfall i lay in that coffin fearing lest they should return and i tell you olaf that strange dreams came to me there for i think i swooned or slept in that narrow bed yes dreams of the past which you shall hear one day if we live for they seem to have to do with you and me aye i thought that the dead woman in the sarcophagus at my side awoke and told them to me at length i rose and crept back to this place where we stand for here i could see the friendly light and being outworn laid me down and slept  at the first break of day i crawled from the tomb followed that same road by which i had entered though i found it hard to climb up through the entrance hole  no living thing was to be seen in the valley except a great night bird flitting to its haunt i was parched with thirst and knowing that in this dry place i soon must perish i glided from rock to rock towards the mouth of the valley thinking to find some other grave or cranny where i might lie hid till night came again and i could descend to the plain and drink but olaf before i had gone many steps i discovered fresh food milk and water laid upon a rock and though i feared lest they might be poisoned ate and drank of them when i knew that they were wholesome i thought that some friend must have set them there to satisfy my wants though i knew not who the friend could be afterwards i learned that this food was an offering to the ghosts of the dead among our forefathers in forgotten generations it was i know the custom to make such offerings since in their blindness they believed that the spirts of their beloved needed sustenance as their bodies once had done doubtless the memory of the rite still survives at least to this day the offerings are made indeed when it was found that they were not made in vain more and more of them were brought so that i have lacked nothing  here then i have dwelt for many moons among the dust of men departed only now and again wandering out at night once or twice folk have seen me when i ventured to the plains and i have been tempted to speak to them and ask their help but always they fled away believing me to be the ghost of some bygone queen indeed to speak truth olaf this companionship with spirits for spirits do dwell in these tombsi have seen them i tell you i have seen themhas so worked upon my soul that at times i feel as though i were already of their company moreover i knew that i could not live long the loneliness was sucking up my life as the dry sand sucks water had you not come olaf within some few days or weeks i should have died  now i spoke for the first time saying  and did you wish to die heliodore  no before the war between musa and my father magas news came to us from byzantium that irene had killed you all believed it save i who did not believe  why not heliodore  because i could not feel that you were dead therefore i fought for my life who otherwise after we were conquered and ruined and my father was slain fighting nobly should have stabbed not that eunuch but myself then later in this tomb i came to know that you were not dead the other lost ones i could feel about me from time to time but you never you who would have been the first to seek me when my soul was open to such whisperings so i lived on when all else would have died because hope burned in me like a lamp unquenchable and at last you came oh at last you came    chapter iv  the caliph harun  here there is an absolute blank in my story one of those walls of oblivion of which i have spoken seems to be built across its path it is as though a stream had plunged suddenly from some bright valley into the bosom of a mountain side and there vanished from the ken of man what happened in the tomb after heliodore had ended her tale whether we departed thence together or left her there a while how we escaped from kurna and by what good fortune or artifice we came safely to alexandria i know not as to all these matters my vision fails me utterly so far as i am concerned they are buried beneath the dust of time i know as little of them as i know of where and how i slept between my life as olaf and this present life of mine that is nothing at all yet in this way or in that the stream did win through the mountain since beyond all grows clear again  once more i stood upon the deck of the diana in the harbour of alexandria with me were martina and heliodore heliodores face was stained and she was dressed as a boy such a harlequin lad as singers and mountebanks often take in their company the ship was ready to start and the wind served yet we could not sail because of the lack of some permission a moslem galley patrolled the harbour and threatened to sink us if we dared to weigh without this paper the mate had gone ashore with a bribe we waited and waited at length the captain menas who stood by me whispered into my ear  be calm he comes all is well  then i heard the mate shout i have the writing under seal and menas gave the order to cast off the ropes that held the ship to the quay one of the sailors came up and reported to menas that their companion cosmas was missing it seemed that he had slipped ashore without leave and had not returned  there let him bide said menas with an oath doubtless the hog lies drunk in some den when he awakes he may tell what tale he pleases and find his own way back to lesbos cast off cast off i say  at this moment that same cosmas appeared i could not see him but i could hear him plainly enough evidently he had become involved in some brawl for an angry woman and others were demanding money of him and he was shouting back drunken threats a man struck him and the woman got him by the beard then his reason left him altogether  am i a christian to be treated thus by you heathen dogs he screamed oh you think i am dirt beneath your feet i have friends i tell you i have friends you know not whom i serve i say that i am a soldier of olaf the northman olaf the blind olaf redsword he who made you prophetworshippers sing so small at mitylene as he will do again ere long  indeed friend said a quiet voice it was that of the moslem captain yusuf he who befriended us when we arrived at alexandria who had been watching all this scene then you serve a great general as some of us have cause to know tell me where is he now for i hear that he has left lesbos  where is he why aboard yonder ship of course oh he has fooled you finely another time youll search beggars rags more closely  cast off cast off roared menas  nay said the officer cast not off soldiers drive away those men i must have words with the captain of this ship come bring that drunken fellow with you  now all is finished i said  yes answered heliodore all is finished after we have endured so much it is hard well at least death remains to us  hold your hand exclaimed martina god still lives and can save us yet  black bitterness took hold of me in some few days i had hoped to reach lesbos and there be wed to heliodore and now and now  cut the ropes menas i cried and out with the oars well risk the galley you martina set me at the mouth of the gangway and tell me when to strike though i be blind i may yet hold them back till we clear the quay  she obeyed and i drew the red sword from beneath my rags then amidst the confusion which followed i heard the grave voice of yusuf speaking to me  sir he said for your own sake i pray you put up that sword which we think is one whereof tales have been told to fight is useless for i have bowmen who can shoot you down and spears that can outreach you general olaf a brave man should know when to surrender especially if he be blind  aye sir i answered and a brave man should know when to die  why should you die general went on the voice i do not know that for a christian to visit egypt disguised as a beggar will be held a crime worthy of death unless indeed you came hither to spy out the land  can the blind spy asked martina indignantly  who can say lady but certainly it seems that your eyes are bright and quick enough also there is another matter a while ago when this ship came to alexandria i signed a paper giving leave to a certain eyeless musician and his niece to ply their trade in egypt then there were two of you now i behold a third who is that comely lad with a stained face that stands beside you  heliodore began some story saying that she was the orphan son of i forget whom and while she told it certain of the moslems slipped past me  truly you should do well in the singing trade interrupted the officer with a laugh seeing that for a boy your voice is wondrous sweet are you quite sure that you remember your sex aright well it can easily be proved bare that lads bosom soldiers nay tis needless snatch off that headdress  a man obeyed and heliodores beautiful black hair which i would not suffer her to cut fell tumbling to her knees  let me be she said i admit that i am a woman  that is generous of you lady the officer answered in the midst of the laughter which followed now will you add to your goodness by telling me your name you refuse then shall i help you in the late coptic war it was my happy fortune twice to see a certain noble maiden the daughter of magas the prince whom the emir musa afterwards took for himself but who fled from him tell me lady have you a twin sister  cease your mockings sir said heliodore despairingly i am she you seek  tis musa seeks you not i lady  then sir he seeks in vain for know that ere he finds i die oh sir i know you have a noble heart be pitiful and let us go ill tell you all the truth olaf redsword yonder and i have long been affianced blind though he is he sought me through great dangers aye and found me would you part us at the last in the name of the god we both worship and of your mother i pray you let us go  by the prophet that i would do lady only then i fear me that i should let my head go from its shoulders also there are too many in this secret for it to bide there long if i did as you desire nay you must to the emir all three of younot musa but to his rival obaidallah who loves him little and by the decree of the caliph once again rules egypt be sure that in a matter between you and musa you will meet with justice from obaidallah come now fearing nothing to where we may find you all garments more befitting to your station than those mummers robes  so a guard was formed round us and we went as my feet touched the quay i heard a sound of angry voices followed by groans and a splash in the water  what is that i asked of yusuf  i think general that your servants from the diana have settled some account that they had with the drunken dog who was so good as to bark out your name to me but with your leave i will not look to make sure  god pardon him as yet i cannot i muttered and marched on    we stood whether on that day or another i do not know in some hall of judgment martina whispered to me that a small dark man was seated in the chair of state and about him priests and others this was the emir obaidallah musa that had been emir who she said was fat and sullen was there also and whenever his glance fell upon heliodore i felt her shiver at my side so was the patriarch politian who pleaded our cause the case was long so long that being courteous as ever they gave us cushions to sit on also in an interval food and sherbet  musa claimed heliodore as his slave an officer who prosecuted claimed that allah having given me their enemy and a wellknown general who had done them much damage into their hands i should be put to death politian answered on behalf of all of us saying that we had harmed no man he added that as there was a truce between the christians and the moslems i could not be made to suffer the penalties of war in a time of peace who had come to egypt but to seek a maid to whom i was affianced moreover that even if it were so the murder of prisoners was not one of those penalties  the emir listened to all but said little at length however he asked whether we were willing to become moslems since if so he thought that we might go free we answered that we were not willing  then it would seem he said that the lady heliodore having been taken in war must be treated as a prisoner of war the only question being to whom she belongs  now musa interrupted angrily shouting out that as to this there was no doubt since she belonged to him who had captured her during his tenure of office  the emir thought a while and we waited trembling at last he gave judgment saying  the general olaf the blind who in byzantium was known as olaf redsword or as michael and who while in the service of the empress irene often made war against the followers of the prophet but who afterwards lost his eyes at the hands of this same evil woman is a man of whom all the world has heard particularly have we moslems heard of him seeing that as governor of lesbos in recent days he inflicted a great defeat upon our navy slaying many thousands and taking others prisoner but as it chances god who bides his time to work justice set a bait for him in the shape of a fair woman on this bait he has been hooked notwithstanding all his skill and cunning and delivered into our hands having come into egypt disguised as a beggar in order to seek out that woman still as he is so famous a man and as at present there is a truce between us and the empire of the east which truce raises certain doubtful points of high policy i decree that his case be remitted to the caliph harunalrashid my master and that he be conveyed to baghdad there to await judgment with him will go the woman whom he alleges to be his niece but who as we are informed was one of the waitingladies of the empress irene against her there is nothing to be said save that she may be a byzantine spy  now i come to the matter of the lady heliodore who is reported to be the wife or the lover or the affianced of this general olaf a question of which god alone knows the truth this lady heliodore is a person of high descent and ancient race she is the only child of the late prince magas who claimed to have the blood of the old pharaohs in his veins and who within this year was defeated and slain by my predecessor in office the emir musa the said emir having captured the lady heliodore purposed to place her in his harem as he had a right to do seeing that she refused the blessings of the faith as it chanced however she escaped from him as it is told by stabbing the eunuch in charge of her at least it is certain that this eunuch was found dead though by whom he was killed is not certain now that she has been taken again the lord musa claims the woman as his spoil and demands that i should hand her over to him yet it seems to me that if she is the spoil of anyone she belongs to the emir governing egypt at the date of her recapture it was only by virtue of his office as emir and not by gift purchase or marriage contract that the lord musa came into possession of her which possession was voided by her flight before she was added to his household and he acquired any natural rights over her in accordance with our law now for my part i as emir make no claim to this woman holding it a hateful thing before god to force one into my household who has no wish to dwell there especially when i know her to be married or affianced to another man still as here also are involved high questions of law i command that the lady heliodore daughter of the late prince magas shall also be conveyed with all courtesy and honour to the caliph harun at baghdad there to abide his judgment of her case the matter is finished let the officers concerned carry out my decree and answer for the safety of these prisoners with their lives  the matter is not finished shouted the exemir musa you obaidallah have uttered this false judgment because your heart is black towards me whom you have displaced  then appeal against it said obaidallah but know that if you attempt to lay hands upon this lady my orders are that you be cut down as an enemy to the law patriarch of the christians you sail for baghdad to visit the caliph at his request in a ship that he has sent for you into your hands i give these prisoners under guard knowing that you will deal well with them who are of your false faith to you also who have the caliphs ear allah knows why i will entrust letters making true report of all this matter let proper provision be made for the comfort of the general olaf and of those with him musa may your greetings at the court of baghdad be such as you deserve meanwhile cease to trouble me  at the door of that hall i was separated from heliodore and martina and led to some house or prison where i was given a large room with servants to wait upon me here i slept that night and on the morrow asked when we sailed for beirut on our way to baghdad the chief of the servants answered that he did not know during that day i was visited by yusuf the officer who had captured us on board the diana he also told me that he did not know when we sailed but certainly it would not be for some days further he said that i need have no fear for the lady heliodore and martina as they were well treated in some other place then he led me into a great garden where he said i was at liberty to walk whenever i pleased  thus began perhaps the most dreadful time of waiting and suspense in all this life of mine seeing that it was the longest every few days the officer yusuf would visit me and talk of many matters for we became friends only of heliodore and martina he could or would tell me nothing nor of when we were to set out on our journey to baghdad i asked to be allowed to speak with the patriarch politian but he answered that this was impossible as he had been called away from alexandria for a little while nor could i have audience with the emir obaidallah for he too had been called away  now my heart was filled with terrors for i feared lest in this way or in that heliodore had fallen into the hands of the accursed musa i prayed yusuf to tell me the truth of the matter whereon he swore by the prophet that she was safe but would say no more nor did this comfort me much since for aught i knew he might mean she was safe in death i was aware further that the moslems held it no crime to deceive an infidel week was added to week and still i languished in this rich prison the best of garments and food were brought to me i was even given wine kind hands tended me and led me from place to place i lacked nothing except freedom and the truth doubt and fear preyed upon my heart till at length i fell ill and scarcely cared to walk in the garden one day when yusuf visited me i told him that he would not need to come many more times since i felt that i was going to die  do not die he answered since then perchance you will find you have done so in vain and he left me  on the following evening he returned and told me that he had brought a physician to see me a certain mahommed who was standing before me although i had no hope from any physician i prayed this mahommed to be seated whereon yusuf left us closing the door behind him  be pleased to set out your case general olaf said mahommed in a grave quiet voice for know that i am sent by the caliph himself to minister to you  how can that be seeing that he is in baghdad i answered still i told him my ailments  when i had finished he said  i perceive that you suffer more from your mind than from your body be so good now as to repeat to me the tale of your life of which i have already heard something tell me especially of those parts of it which have to do with the lady heliodore daughter of magas of your blinding by irene for her sake and of your discovery of her in egypt where you sought her disguised as a beggar  why should i tell you all my story sir  that i may know how to heal you of your sickness also general olaf i will be frank with you i am more than a mere physician i have certain powers under the caliphs seal and it will be wise on your part to open all your heart to me  now i reflected that there could be little harm in repeating to this strange doctor what so many already knew so i told him everything and the tale was long  wondrous most wondrous said the gravevoiced physician when i had finished yet to me the strangest part of your history is that played therein by the lady martina had she been your lover now one might have understoodperhaps and he paused  sir physician i answered the lady martina has been and is no more than my friend  ah now i see new virtues in your religion since we moslems do not find such friends among those women who are neither our mothers nor our sisters evidently the christian faith must have power to change the nature of women which i thought to be impossible well general olaf i will consider of your case and i may tell you that i have good hopes of finding a medicine by which it can be cured all save your sight which in this world god himself cannot give back to you now i have a favour to ask i see that in this room of yours there is a curtain hiding the bed of the servant who sleeps with you i desire to see another patient here and that this patient should not see you of your goodness will you sit upon the bed behind that curtain and will you swear to me on your honour as a soldier that whatever you may hear you will in no way reveal yourself  surely that is if it is nothing which will bring disgrace upon my head or name  it will be nothing to bring disgrace on your head or name general olaf though perhaps it may bring some sorrow to your heart as yet i cannot say  my heart is too full of sorrow to hold more i answered  then he led me down to the guards bed on which i sat myself down being strangely interested in this play he drew the curtain in front of me and i heard him return to the centre of the room and clap his hands someone entered saying  high lord your will  silence he exclaimed and began to whisper orders while i wondered what kind of a physician this might be who was addressed as high lord  the servant went and after a while of waiting that seemed long once more the door was opened and i heard the sweep of a womans dress upon the carpet  be seated lady said the grave voice of the physician for i have words to say to you  sir i obey answered another voice at the sound of which my heart stood still it was that of heliodore  lady went on the physician as my robe will tell you i am a doctor of medicine also as it chances i am something more namely an envoy appointed by the caliph harunalrashid having full powers to deal with your case here are my credentials if you care to read them and i heard a crackling as of parchment being unfolded  sir answered heliodore i will read the letters later for the present i accept your word only i would ask one question if it pleases you to answer why have not i and the general olaf been conveyed to the presence of the caliph himself as was commanded by the emir obaidallah  lady because it was not convenient to the caliph to receive you since as it chances at present he is moving from place to place upon the business of the state therefore as you will find in the writing he has appointed me to deal with your matter now lady the caliph and i his servant know all your story from lips which even you would trust you are betrothed to a certain enemy of his a northman named olaf redsword or michael who was blinded by the empress irene for some offence against her but was afterwards appointed by her son constantine to be governor of the isle of lesbos this olaf by the will of god inflicted a heavy defeat upon the forces of the caliph which he had sent to take lesbos then by the goodness of god he wandered to egypt in search of you with the result that both of you were taken prisoner lady it will be clear to you that having this wild hawk olaf in his hands the caliph would scarcely let him go again to prey upon the moslems though whether he will kill him or make of him a slave as yet i do not know nay hear me out before you speak the caliph has been told of your wondrous beauty and as i see even less than the truth also he has heard of the high spirit which you showed in the coptic rising when your father the prince magas was slain and of how you escaped out of the hand of the emir musa the fat and were not afraid to dwell for months alone in the tombs of the ancient dead now the caliph being moved in his heart by your sad plight and all that he has heard concerning you commands me to make you an offer  the offer is that you should come to his court and there be instructed for a while by his learned men in the truths of religion then if it pleases you to adopt islam he will take you as one of his wives and if it does not please you will add you to his harem since it is not lawful for him to marry a woman who remains a christian in either case he will make on you a settlement of property to the value of that which belonged to your father the prince magas reflect well before you answer your choice lies between the memory of a blind man whom i think you will never see again and the high place of one of the wives of the greatest sovereign of the earth  sir before i answer i would put a question to you why do you say the memory of a blind man  because lady a rumour has reached me which i desired to hold back from you but which now you force me to repeat it is that this general olaf has in truth already passed the gate of death  then sir she answered with a little sob it behoves me to follow him through that gate  that will happen when it pleases god meanwhile what is your answer  sir my answer is that i a poor christian prisoner a victim of war and fate thank the caliph harunalrashid for the honours and the benefits he would shower on me and with humility decline them  so be it lady the caliph is not a man who would wish to force your inclination still this being so i am charged to say he bids you remember that you were taken prisoner in war by the emir musa he holds that subject to his own prior right which he waives you are the property of the emir musa under a just interpretation of the law yet he would be merciful as god is merciful and therefore he gives you the choice of three things the first of these is that you adopt islam with a faithful heart and go free  that i refuse as i have refused it before said heliodore  the second is he continued that you enter the harem of the emir musa  that i refuse also  and the third and last is that having thrust aside his mercy you suffer the common fate of a captured christian who persists in error and die  that i accept said heliodore  you accept death in the splendour of your youth and beauty you accept death he said with a note of wonder in his voice truly you are greathearted and the caliph will grieve when he learns his loss as i do now yet i have my orders for which my head must answer lady if you die it must be here and now do you still choose death  yes she said in a low voice  behold this cup he went on and this draught which i pour into it and i heard the sound of liquid flowing presently i shall ask you to drink of it and then after a little while say the half of an hour you will fall asleep to wake in whatever world god has appointed to the idol worshippers of the cross you will suffer no pain and no fear indeed maybe the draught will bring you joy  then give it me said heliodore faintly i will drink at once and have done  then it was that i came out from behind my curtain and groped my way towards them  sir physician or sir envoy of the caliph harun i said but for the moment went no further since with a low cry heliodore cast herself upon my breast and stopped my lips with hers  hush till i have spoken i whispered placing my arm about her then continued i swore to you just now that i would not reveal myself unless i heard aught which would bring disgrace on my head or name to stand still behind yonder curtain while my betrothed is poisoned at your hands would bring disgrace upon my head and name so black that not all the seas of all the world could wash it away say physician does yonder cup hold enough of death for both of us  yes general olaf and if you choose to share it i think the caliph will be glad since he loves not the killing of brave men only it must be now and without more words you can talk for a little afterwards before the sleep takes you  so be it i said since i must die as i heard you decree but now it is no crime to die thus or at least ill risk it who have one to guard upon that road drink beloved a little less than half since i am the stronger then give me the cup  husband i pledge you she said and drank thrusting the cup into my hand  i too lifted it to my lips lo it was empty  oh most cruel of thieves i cried you have stolen all  aye she answered shall i see you swallow poison before my eyes i die but perchance god may save you yet  not so heliodore i cried again and turning began to grope my way to the windowplace which i knew was far from the ground since i had no weapon that would serve my turn  in an instant as i thrust the lattice open i felt two strong arms cast about me and heard the physician exclaim  come lady help me with this madman lest he do himself a mischief  she seized me also and we struggled together all three of us the doors burst open and i was dragged back into the centre of the room  olaf redsword the blind general of the christians said the physician in a new voice one that was full of majesty and command i who speak to you am no doctor of medicine and no envoy i am harunalrashid caliph of the faithful is it not so my servants  it is so caliph pealed the answer from many throats  hearken then to the decree of harunalrashid learn both of you that all which has passed between us was but a play that i have played to test the love and faithfulness of you twain lady heliodore be at ease you have drunk nothing save water distilled with roses and no sleep shall fall on you save that which nature brings to happiness lady i tell you that having seen what i have seen and heard what i have heard rather would i stand in the place of that blind man tonight than be sovereign of the east truly i knew not that love such as yours was to be met with in the world i say that when i saw you drain the cup in a last poor struggle to drive back the death that threatened this olaf my own heart went out in love for you yet have no fear since my love is of a kind that would not rob you of your love but rather would bring it to a rich and glorious blossom in the sunshine of my favour wondrous is the tale of the wooing of you twain and happy shall be its end general olaf you conquered me in war and dealt with those of my servants who fell into your hands according to the nobleness of your heart shall i then be outdone in generosity by one whom a while ago i should have named a christian dog not so let the high priest of the christians politian be brought hither he stands without and with him the lady named martina who was the empress irenes waitingwoman  the messengers went and there followed a silence there are times when the heart is too full for words at least heliodore and i found nothing to say to each other we only clasped each others hand and waited  at length the door opened and i heard the eager bustling step of politian also another gliding step which i knew for that of martina she came to me she kissed me on the brow and whispered into my ear  so all is well at last as i knew it would be and now olafand now olaf you are about to be married yes at once andi wish you joy  her words were simple enough yet they kindled in my heart a light by which it saw many things  martina i said if i have lived to reach this hour under god it is through you martina they say that each of us has a guardian angel in heaven and if that be so mine has come to earth yet in heaven alone shall i learn to thank her as i ought  then suddenly martina was sobbing on my breast after which i remember only that heliodore helped me to wipe away her tears while in the background i heard the caliph say to himself in his deep voice  wondrous wondrous by allah these christians are a strange folk how far wiser is our law for then he could have married both of them and all three would have been happy truly he who decreed that it should be so knew the heart of man and woman and was a prophet sent by god nay answer me not friend politian since on matters of religion we have agreed that we will never argue do your office according to your unholy rites and i and my servants will watch praying that the evil one may be absent from the service oh silence silence have i not said that we will not argue on subjects of religion to your business man  so politian drew us together to the other end of the chamber and there wed us as best he might with martina for witness and the solemn moslems for congregation  when it was over harun commanded my wife to lead me before him  here is a marriage gift for you general olaf he said one i think that you will value more than any other and he handed me something sharp and heavy  i felt it hilt and blade and knew it for the wanderers sword yes my own red sword from which i took my name that the commander of the faithful now restored to me and with it my place and freedom i took it and saying no word with that same sword gave to him the triple salute due to a sovereign  instantly i heard haruns scimitar the scimitar that was famous throughout the east rattle as it left its scabbard as did the scimitars of all those who attended on him and knew that there was being returned to me the salute which a sovereign gives to a general in high command then the caliph spoke again  a wedding gift to you lady heliodore child of an ancient and mighty race and newmade wife of a gallant man for the second time tonight take this cup of gold but let that which lies within it adorn your breast in memory of harun queens of old have worn those jewels but never have they hung above a nobler heart  heliodore took the cup and in her trembling hand i heard the priceless gems that filled it clink against its sides once more the caliph spoke  a gift for you also lady martina take this ring from my hand and place it on your own it seems a small thing does it not yet something lies within its circle in this city i saw today a very beauteous house built by one of your grecian folk and behind it lands that a swift horse could scarcely circle twice within an hour most fruitful lands fed by the waters that house and those lands are yours together with rule over all who dwell upon them there you may live content with whomever you may please even if he be a christian free of tax or tribute provided only that neither you nor he shall plot against my power now to all three of you farewell perchance for ever unless some of us should meet again in war general olaf your ship lies in the harbour use it when you will i pray that you will think kindly of harunalrashid as he does of you olaf redsword come let us leave these two lady martina i pray you to be my guest this night  so they all went leaving heliodore and myself alone in the great room yes alone at last and safe    chapter v  irenes prayer  years had gone by i know not how many but only that much had happened in them for a while irene and young constantine were joint rulers of the empire then they quarrelled again and constantine afraid of treachery fled with his friends in a ship after an attempt had been made to seize his person he purposed to join his legions in asia or so it was said and make war upon his mother but those friends of his upon the ship were traitors who fearing irenes vengeance or perhaps his own since she threatened to tell him all the truth concerning them seized constantine and delivered him up to irene she the mother who bore him caused him to be taken to the purple porphyry chamber in the palace that chamber in which as the firstborn of an emperor he saw the light and there robbed him of light for ever  yes stauracius and his butchers blinded constantine as i had been blinded only it was told that they drove their knives deeper so that he died but others say that he lived on a prisoner unknown unheeded as those uncles of his whom he had blinded and who once were in my charge had lived till in greece the assassins daggers found their hearts if so oh what a fate was his  afterwards for five years irene reigned alone in glory while stauracius my godfather and his brother eunuch aetius strove against each other to be first minister of the crown aetius won and not content with all he had plotted that his relative nicetas who held the place of captain of the guard which once i filled should be named successor to the throne then at last the nobles rebelled and electing one of their number nicephorus as emperor seized irene in her private house of eleutherius where she lay sick and crowned nicephorus in st sophia next day he visited irene when fearing the worst and broken by illness she bought a promise of safety by revealing to him all her hoarded treasure  thus fell irene the mighty empress of the eastern empire  now during all these years heliodore and i were left in peace at lesbos i was not deposed from my governorship of that isle which prospered greatly under my rule even irenes estates which constantine had given me were not taken away at the appointed times i remitted the tribute due yes and added to the sum and received back the official acknowledgment signed by the empress and with it the official thanks but with these never came either letter or message yet it is evident she knew that i was married for to heliodore did come a message and with it a gift the gift was that necklace and those other ornaments which irene had caused to be made in an exact likeness of the string of golden shells separated by emerald beetles one half of which i had taken from the grave of the wanderer at aar and the other half of which was worn by heliodore  so much of the gift the message was that she who owned the necklace might wish to have the rest of the set to it were added the words that a certain general had been wrong when he prophesied that the wearing of this necklace by any woman save one would bring ill fortune to the wearer since from the day it hung about irenes neck even that which seemed to be bad fortune had turned to good thus she had escaped the most evil thing in the world namely another husband and had become the first woman in the world  these words which were written on a piece of sheepskin sealed up and addressed to the lady heliodore but unsigned i thought of the most evil omen since boastfulness always seems to be hateful to the power that decrees our fates so indeed they proved to be    on a certain day in early summerit was the anniversary of my marriage in egyptheliodore and i had dined with but two guests those guests were jodd the great northman my lieutenant and his wife martina for within a year of our return to lesbos jodd and martina had married it comes back to me that there was trouble about the business but that when jodd gave out that either she must marry him or that he would sail back to his northern land bidding goodbye to us all for ever martina gave way i think that heliodore managed the matter in some fashion of her own after the birth of our firstborn son how i held it best never to inquire at least it was managed and the marriage turned out well enough in the end although at first martina was moody at times and somewhat sharp of tongue with jodd then they had a baby which died and this dead child drew them closer together than it might have done had it lived at any rate from that time forward martina grew more gentle with jodd and when other children were born they seemed happy together  well we four had dined and it comes to me that our talk turned upon the caliph harun and his wonderful goodness to us whom as christians he was bound to despise and hate heliodore told me then for the first time how she was glad he had made it clear so soon that what she drank from the gold cup which now stood upon our table was no more than rose water  so strong is the working of the mind that already she had begun to feel as though poison were numbing her heart and clouding her brain and was sure that soon she would have fallen into the sleep which harun had warned her would end in death  had he been a true physician he would have known that this might be so and that such grim jests are very dangerous i said then i added for i did not wish to dwell longer upon a scene the memory of which was dreadful to me although it had ended well  tell us martina is it true that those rich possessions of yours in alexandria which the caliph gave you are sold  yes olaf she answered to a company of greek merchants and not so ill the contract was signed but yesterday it was my wish that we should leave lesbos and go to live in this place as we might have done with safety under haruns signed firman but jodd here refused  aye said jodd in his big voice am i one to dwell among moslems and make money out of trade and gardens in however fine a house why i should have been fighting with these prophetworshippers within a month and had my throat cut moreover how could i bear to be separated from my general and whatever she may think how could martina bear to lose sight of her godson why olaf i tell you that although you are married and she is married she still thinks twice as much of you as she does of me oh blind mans dog once blind mans dog always look not so angry martina why i wonder does the truth always make women angry and he burst into one of his great laughs  at this moment heliodore rose from the table and walked to the open windowplace to speak to our children and martinas a merry company who were playing together in the garden here she stood a while studying the beautiful view of the bay beneath then of a sudden called out  a ship a ship sailing into the harbour and it flies the imperial standard  then pray god she brings no bad news i said who feared that imperial standard and felt that we had all been somewhat too happy of late moreover i knew that no royal ship was looked for from byzantium at this time and dreaded lest this one should bear letters from the new emperor dismissing me from my office or even worse tidings  what bad news should she bring growled jodd oh i know what is in your mind general but if this upstart nicephorus is wise hell leave you alone since lesbos does not want another governor and will tell him so if there be need yes it will take more than one ship of war aye and more than three to set up another governor in lesbos nay rebuke me not general for i at least have sworn no oath of homage to this nicephorus nor have the other northmen or the men of lesbos  you are like a watchdog jodd barking at you know not what just because it is strange go now i pray you to the quay and bring back to us news of this ship  so he went and for the next two hours or more i sat in my private room dictating letters to heliodore on matters connected with the duties of my office the work came to an end at last and i was preparing to take my evening ride on a led mule when martina entered the room  do you ride with us tonight martina i asked recognising her step  no olaf she said quickly nor i think can you here are letters for you from byzantium jodd has brought them from the ship  where is jodd i said  without in the company of the captain of the ship some guards and a prisoner  what prisoner  perchance the letters will tell you she replied evasively have i your command to open and read they are marked most secret  i nodded since martina often acted as my secretary in high matters being from her training skilled in such things so she broke the seals and read to myself and to heliodore who also was present in the room as follows  to the excellent michael a general of our armies and governor of the isle of lesbos greetings from nicephorus by the will of god emperor  know o michael that we the emperor reposing especial faith in you our trusted servant with these letters deliver into your keeping a certain prisoner of state this prisoner is none other than irene who aforetime was empress  because of her many wickednesses in the sight of god and man we by the decree of the people of the army of the senate and of the high officers of state amidst general rejoicing deposed the said irene widow of the emperor leo and mother of the late emperor constantine and placed ourselves upon the throne the said irene at her own request we consigned to the place called the island of princes setting her in charge of certain holy monks whilst there abusing our mercy and confidence she set on foot plots to murder our person and repossess herself of the throne  now our councillors with one voice urged that she should be put to death in punishment of her crimes but we being mindful of the teaching of our lord and saviour and of his saying that we should turn the other cheek to those who smite us out of our gentle pity have taken another counsel  learn now most excellent michael the blind who once were known as olaf redsword that we hand over to your keeping the person of irene aforetime empress charging you to deal with her as she dealt with you and as she dealt also with the late emperor constantine the son of her body for thus shall her evil plottings be brought to naught  by gods name he means that i must blind her i exclaimed  making no answer martina went on with the letter  should the said irene survive her just punishment we command you to make sufficient provision for her daily wants but no more and to charge the same against the sum due us from the revenues of lesbos should she die at once or at any future time give to her decent private burial and report to us the circumstances of her death duly attested  keep these presents secret and do not act upon them until the ship which brings them and the prisoner to you has sailed for byzantium which it is ordered to do as soon as it has been revictualled on your head be it to carry out these our commands for which you shall answer with your life and those of your wife and children this signed and sealed at our court of byzantium on the twelfth day of the sixth month of the first year of our reign and countersigned by the high officers whose names appear beneath    such was this awful letter that having read martina thrust into my hand as though she would be rid of it then followed a silence which at length martina broke  your commands excellency she said in a dry voice i understand that thetheprisoner is in the anteroom in charge of the captain jodd  then let her remain in the charge of the captain jodd i exclaimed angrily and in your charge martina who are accustomed to attending upon her and know that you are both answerable for her safety with your lives send the captain of the ship to me and prepare a discharge for him i will not see this woman till he has sailed since until then i am commanded to keep all secret send also the head officer of the guard    three days went by the imperial ship had sailed taking with her my formal acknowledgment of the emperors letter and the time had come when once more i must meet irene face to face  i sat in the audience chamber of my great house and there was present with me only jodd my lieutenant in office being blind i dared not receive a desperate woman alone fearing lest she might stab me or do herself some mischief at the door of the chamber jodd took her from the guards whom he bade remain within call and conducted her to where i sat he told me afterwards that she was dressed as a nun a white hood half hiding her still beautiful face and a silver crucifix hanging upon her breast  as i heard her come i rose and bowed to her and my first words to her were to pray her to be seated  nay she answered in that rich wellremembered voice of hers a prisoner stands before the judge i greet you general olaf i pray your pardonmichaelafter long years of separation you have changed but little and i rejoice to see that your health is good and that the rank and prosperity which i gave have not been taken from you  i greet you madam almost had i said augusta i answered then continued hurriedly lady irene i have received certain commands concerning you from the emperor nicephorus which it is best that you should hear so that you shall hold me quit of blame in aught that it may be my duty to inflict upon you read them captain jodd nay i forgot you cannot give the copy of the letter to the lady irene the original she can see afterwards if she wills  so the paper was given to her by jodd and she read it aloud weighing each word carefully  oh what a dog is this she said when it was finished know olaf that of my free will i surrendered the throne to him yes and all my private treasure he swearing upon the gospels that i should live in peace and honour till my lifes end and now he sends me to you to be blinded and then done to death for that is what he means oh may god avenge me upon him may he become a byword and a scorn and may his own end be even worse than that which he has prepared for me may shame wrap his memory as in a garment may his bones be dishonoured and his buryingplace forgotten aye and so it shall be        the skull of this nicephorus is said to have been used      as a drinking cup by his victorious enemy the king krum      editor  she paused in her fearful curse then said in a new voice that voice in which she was wont to plead  you will not blind me olaf youll not take from me my last blessing the light of day think what it means  the general olaf should know well enough interrupted jodd but i waved him to be silent and answered  tell me madam how can i do otherwise it seems to me that my life and that of my wife and children hang upon this deed moreover why should i do otherwise now that by gods justice the wheel has come round at last i added pointing to the hollows beneath my brows where the eyes once had been  oh olaf she said if i harmed you you know well it was because i loved you  then god send that no woman ever loves me in such a fashion broke in jodd  olaf she continued taking no note of him once you went very near to loving me also on that night when you would have eaten the poisoned figs to save my son the emperor at least you kissed me if you forget i cannot olaf can you blind a woman whom you have kissed  kissing takes two and i know that you blinded him muttered jodd for i crucified the brutes you commanded to do the deed to which they confessed  olaf i admit that i treated you ill i admit that i would have killed you but believe me it was jealousy and naught but jealousy which drove me on almost as soon would i have killed myself indeed i thought of it  and there the matter ended said jodd it was olaf who walked the hall of the pit not you we found him on the brink of the hole  olaf after i regained my power  by blinding your own son said jodd for which you will have an account to settle one day  i dealt well with you knowing that you had married my rival for i kept myself informed of all you did still i lifted no hand against you  what good was a maimed man to you when you were courting the emperor charlemagne asked jodd  now at last she turned on him saying  well is it for you barbarian that if only for a while fate has reft power from my hands oh this is the bitterest drop in all my cup that i who for a score of years ruled the world must live to suffer the insults of such as you  then why not die and have done asked the imperturbable jodd or if you lack the courage why not submit to the decree of the emperor as so many have submitted to your decree instead of troubling the general here with prayers for mercy it would serve as well  jodd i said i command you to be silent this lady is in trouble attack those in power if you will not those who have fallen  there speaks the man i loved said irene what perverse fate kept us apart olaf had you taken what i offered by now you and i would have ruled the world  perhaps madam yet it is right i should say that i do not regret my choice although because of it i can no longerlook upon the world  i know i know she of that accursed necklace which i see you still wear came between us and spoiled everything now im ruined for lack of you and you are nobody for lack of me a soldier who will run his petty course and depart into the universal darkness leaving never a name behind him in the ages to be what man will take count of one of a score of governors of the little isle of lesbos who might yet have held the earth in the hollow of his hand and shone a second cæsar in its annals oh what marplot of a devil rules our destinies he who fashioned those golden shells upon your breast or so i think well well it is so and cannot be altered the augusta of the empire of the east must plead with the man who rejected her for sight or rather for her life you understand do you not olaf that letter is a command to you to murder me  just such a command as you gave to those who blinded your son constantine muttered jodd beneath his breath  that is what is meant you are to murder me and olaf im not fit to die great place brings great temptations and i admit that i have greatly sinned i need time upon the earth to make my peace with heaven and if you slay my body now you will slay my soul as well oh be pitiful be pitiful olaf you cannot kill the woman who has lain upon your breast it is against nature if you did such a thing youd never sleep again you would shudder yourself over the edge of the world being what you are no pomp or power would ever pay you for the deed be true to your own high heart and spare me see i who for so long was the ruler of many kingdoms kneel to you and pray you to spare me and casting herself down upon her knees she laid her head upon my feet and wept  all that scene comes back to me with a strange and terrible vividness although i had no sight to aid me in its details save the sight of my soul i remember that the wonder and horror of it pierced me through and through the stab of the dagger in my eyes was not more sharp there was i olaf a mere gentleman of the north seated in my chair of office and there before me her mighty head bowed upon my feet knelt the empress of the earth pleading for her life in truth all history could show few stranger scenes what was i to do if i yielded to her piteous prayers it was probable that my own life and those of my wife and children would pay the price yet how could i clap my hands in their eastern fashion and summon the executioners to pierce those streaming eyes of hers rise augusta i said for in this extremity of her shame i gave her back her title and tell me you who are accustomed to such matters how i can spare you who deal with the lives of others as well as with my own  i thank you for that name she said as she struggled to her feet ive heard it shouted by tens of thousands in the circus and from the throats of armies but never yet has it been half so sweet to me as now from lips that have no need to utter it in times bygone id have paid you for this service with a province but now irene is so poor that like some humble beggarwoman she can but give her thanks still repeat it no more for next time it will sound bitter what did you ask how you could save me was it not well the thing seems simple in all that letter from nicephorus there is no direct command that you should blind me the fellow says that you are to treat me as i treated you and as i treated constantine the emperorbecause i must well i imprisoned both of you imprison me and you fulfil the mandate he says that if i die you are to report it which shows that he does not mean that i must die oh the road of escape is easy should you desire to travel it if you do not so desire then olaf i pray you as a last favour not to hand me over to common men i see that by your side still hangs that red sword of yours wherewith once i threatened you when you refused me at byzantium draw it olaf and this time ill guide its edge across my throat so you will please nicephorus and win the rewards that irene can no longer give baptised in her blood what earthly glory is there to which you might not yet attain you who had dared to lay hands upon the anointed flesh that even her worst foes have feared to touch lest gods sudden curse should strike them dead  so she went on pouring out words with the strange eloquence that she could command at times till i grew bewildered she who had lived in light and luxury who had loved the vision of all bright and glorious things was pleading for her sight to the man whom she had robbed of sight that he might never more behold the young beauty of her rival she who had imagination to know the greatness of her sins was pleading to be spared the death she dared not face she was pleading to me who for years had been her faithful soldier the captain of her own guard sworn to protect her from the slightest ill me upon whom for a while it had pleased her to lavish the wild passion of her imperial heart who once had almost lovedwho indeed had kissed her on the lips  my orders were definite i was commanded to blind this woman and to kill her in the blinding which in truth i who had power of life and death i who ruled over this island like a king by virtue of the royal commission could do without question asked if i failed to fulfil those orders i must be prepared to pay the price as if i did fulfil them i might expect a high reward probably the governorship of some great province of the empire this was no common prisoner she was the exempress a mighty woman to whom tens of thousands or perhaps millions still looked for help and leadership it was necessary to those who had seized her place and power that she should be rendered incapable of rule it was desirable to them that she should die yet so delicately were the scales poised between them and the adherents of irene among whom were numbered all the great princes of the church that they themselves did not dare to inflict mutilation or death upon her they feared lest it should be followed by a storm of wrath that would shake nicephorus from his throne and involve them in his ruin  so they sent her to me the governor of a distant dependency the man whom they knew she had wickedly wronged being certain that her tongue which it was said could turn the hearts of all men would never soften mine then afterwards they would declare that the warrant was a forgery that i had but wreaked a private vengeance upon an ancient foe and to still the scandal degrade me from my governorshipinto some place of greater power and profit  oh while irene pleaded before me and heedless of the presence of jodd even cast her arms about me and laid her head upon my breast all these things passed through my mind in its scales i weighed the matter out and the beam rose against me for i knew well that if i spared irene i condemned myself and those who were more to me than myself my wife my children and all the northmen who clung to me and who would not see me die without blow struck i understood it all and understanding of a sudden made up my mindto spare irene come what might i would be no butcher i would follow my heart whithersoever it might lead me  cease madam i said i have decided jodd bid the messenger summon hither heliodore and martina my wife and yours  oh exclaimed irene if these women are to be called in counsel on my case all is finished seeing that both of them love you and are my enemies moreover i have some pride left to you i could plead but not to them though they blind me with their bodkins after they have stabbed me with their tongues excellency a last boon call in your guard and kill me  madam i said that i had decided and all the women in the world will not change my mind in this way or in that jodd do my bidding  jodd struck a bell once only which was the signal for the messenger he came and received his orders then followed a pause since heliodore and martina were in a place close by and must be sent for during this time irene began to talk to me of sundry general matters she compared the view that might be seen from this house in lesbos to that from the terrace of her palace on the bosphorus and described its differences to me she asked me as to the caliph harunalrashid whom she understood i had seen inquiring as to the estimate i had formed of his character lastly with a laugh she dwelt upon the strange vicissitudes of life  look at me she said i began my days as the daughter of a greek gentleman with no dower save my wit and beauty then i rose to be a ruler of the world and knew all that it has to give of pomp and power nations trembled at my nod at my smile men grew great at my frown they faded into nothingness save you olaf none ever really conquered me until i fell in the appointed hour and now of this splendour there is left but a nuns robe of this countless wealth but one silver crucifix of this powernaught  so she spoke on still not knowing to what decision i had come whether she were to be blinded or to live or die to myself i thought it was a proof of her greatness that she could thus turn her mind to such things while fate hovered over her its hand upon a sword but it may be that she thought thus to impress me and to enmesh me in memories which would tie my hands or even from the character of my answers to draw some augury of her doom  the women came at length heliodore entered first and to her irene bowed  greeting lady of egypt she said ah had you taken my counsel in the past that title might have been yours in very truth and there you and your husband could have founded a new line of kings independent of the empire which totters to its fall  i remember no such counsel madam said heliodore it seems to me that the course i took was right and one pleasing to god since it has given me my husband for myself although it is true wickedly robbed of his eyes  for yourself can you say so while martina is always at his side she asked in a musing voice well it may be for in this world strange things happen  she paused and i heard both heliodore and jodd move as though in anger for her bitter shaft had gone home then she went on softly  lady may i tell you that in my judgment your beauty is even greater than it was though it is true it has grown from bud to flower few bear their years and a mothers burdens so lightly in these hot lands  heliodore did not answer for at that moment martina entered seeing irene for the first time she forgot everything that had passed and curtseyed to her in the old fashion murmuring the familiar words  thy servant greets thee augusta  nay use not that title martina to one who has done with the world and its vanities call me mother if you will for that is the only name of honour by which those of my religious order may be known in truth as your mother in god i welcome you and bless you from my heart forgiving you those ills which you have worked against me being as i know well driven by a love that is greater than any woman bears to woman but that eating fire of passion scorned is the heritage of both of us and of it we will talk afterwards i must not waste the time of the general olaf whom destiny in return for many griefs has appointed to be my jailer oh olaf she added with a little laugh some foresight of the future must have taught me to train you for the post let us then be silent ladies and listen to the judgment which this jailer of mine is about to pass upon me do you know it is no less than whether these eyes of mine which you were wont to praise martina which in his lighter moments even this stern olaf was wont to praise should be torn from beneath my brow and if so whether it should be done in such a fashion that i die of the deed that and no less is the matter which his lips must settle now speak excellency  madam i said slowly to the best of my wit i have considered the letter sent to me under the seal and sign of the emperor nicephorus although it might be so interpreted by some i cannot find in that letter any direct command that i should cause you to be blinded but only one that i should keep you under strict guard giving you such things as are necessary to your sustenance this then i shall do and by the first ship make report of my action to the emperor at byzantium  now when she heard these words at length the proud spirit of irene broke  god reward you for i cannot olaf she cried god reward you saint among men who can pay back cruel injuries with the gentlest mercy  so saying she burst into tears and fell senseless to the ground  martina ran to aid her but heliodore turned to me and said in her tender voice  this is worthy of you olaf and i would not have you do otherwise yet husband i fear that this pity of yours has signed the deathwarrant of us all    so it proved to be though as it chanced that warrant was never executed i made my report to byzantium and in course of time the answer came in a letter from the emperor this letter coldly approved of my act in set and formal phrases it added that the truth had been conveyed publicly to those slanderers of the emperor who announced that he had caused irene to be first blinded and then put to death in lesbos whereby their evil tongues had been silenced  then came this pregnant sentence  we command you with your wife and children and your lieutenant the captain jodd with his wife and children to lay down your offices and report yourselves with all speed to us at our court of byzantium that we may confer with you on certain matters if it is not convenient to you or you can find no fitting ship in which to sail at once know that within a month of your receipt of this letter our fleet will call at lesbos and bring you and the others herein mentioned to our presence  that is a death sentence said martina when she had finished reading out this passage i have seen several such sent in my day when i was irenes confidential lady it is the common form we shall never reach byzantium olaf or if we do we shall never leave it more  i nodded for i knew that this was so then at some whispered word from martina heliodore spoke  husband she said foreseeing this issue martina jodd and most of the northmen and i have made a plan which we now submit to you praying that for our sakes if not for yours you will not thrust it aside we have bought two good ships armed them and furnished them with all things needful moreover during the past two months we have sold much of our property turning it into gold this is our planthat we pretend to obey the order of the emperor but instead of heading for byzantium sail away north to the land in which you were born where having rank and possessions you may still become a mighty chief if we go at once we shall miss the imperial fleet and i think that none will follow us  now i bowed my head for a while and thought then i lifted it and said  so let it be no other road is open  for my own sake i would not have stirred an inch i would have gone to the court of the emperor at byzantium and there argued out the thing in a gamblers spirit prepared to win or prepared to lose there at least i should have had all the imageworshippers who adored irene that is the full half of the empire upon my side and if i perished i should perish as a saint but a wife and children are the most terrible gifts of god if the most blessed for they turn our hearts to water so for the first time in my life i grew afraid and for their sakes fled  as might be expected having martinas brains heliodores love and the northmens loyalty at the back of it our plan went well a letter was sent to the emperor saying that we would await the arrival of the fleet to obey his commands having some private matters to arrange before we left lesbos then on a certain evening we embarked on two great ships about four hundred souls in all  before we went i bade farewell to irene she was seated outside the house that had been given to her employed in spinning for it was her fancy to earn the bread she ate by the labour of her hands round her were playing jodds children and my own whom in order to escape suspicion we had sent thither till the time came for us to embark since the people of lesbos only knew of our scheme by rumour  whither do you go olaf she asked  back to the north whence i came madam i answered to save the lives of these and i waved my hand towards the children if i bide here all must die we have been sent for to byzantium as i think you were wont to send for officers who had ceased to please you  i understand olaf moreover i know it is i who have brought this trouble upon you because you spared me whom it was meant that you should kill also i know through friends of mine that henceforth for reasons of policy my little end of life is safe and perhaps with it my sight all this i owe to you though now at times i regret that i asked the boon from the lot of an empress to that of a spinningwife is a great change and one which i find it heard to bear still i have my peace to make with god and towards that peace i strive yet will you not take me with you olaf i should like to found a nunnery in that cold north of yours  no augusta i have done my best by you and now you must guard yourself we part for ever i go hence to finish where i began my birthplace calls me  for ever is a long word olaf are you sure that we part for ever perchance we shall meet again in death or in other lives such at least was the belief of some of the wisest of my people before we became christian and mayhap the christians do not know everything since the world had learnt much before they came i hope that it may be so olaf for i owe you a great debt and would repay it to you full measure pressed down and running over farewell take with you the blessing of a sinful and a broken heart and rising she kissed me on the brow    here ends the story of this life of mine as olaf redsword since of it i can recover no more the darkness drops of what befell me and the others after my parting with irene i know nothing or very little doubtless we sailed away north and i think came safely to aar since i have faint visions of iduna the fair grown old but still unwed for the stain of steinars blood as it were still marked her brow in all mens eyes and even of freydisa whitehaired and noblelooking how did we meet and how did we separate at last i wonder and what were the fates of heliodore and of our children of martina and of jodd also was the prophecy of odin spoken through the lips of freydisa in the temple at aar that he and his fellow gods or demons would prevail against my flesh and that of those who clung to me fulfilled at last in the fires of martyrdom for the faith as his promise of my happiness was fulfilled  i cannot tell i cannot tell darkness entombs us all and history is dumb    at aar there are many graves standing among them not so long ago much of this history came back to me
