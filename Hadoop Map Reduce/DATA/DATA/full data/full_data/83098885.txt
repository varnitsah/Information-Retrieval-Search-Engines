83098885	the admirable crichton  from the plays of j m barrie  a comedy  by j m barrie     act i at loam house mayfair   a moment before the curtain rises the hon ernest woolley drives up to the door of loam house in mayfair there is a happy smile on his pleasant insignificant face and this presumably means that he is thinking of himself he is too busy over nothing this man about town to be always thinking of himself but on the other hand he almost never thinks of any other person probably ernests great moment is when he wakes of a morning and realises that he really is ernest for we must all wish to be that which is our ideal we can conceive him springing out of bed lightheartedly and waiting for his man to do the rest he is dressed in excellent taste with just the little bit more which shows that he is not without a sense of humour the dandiacal are often saved by carrying a smile at the whole thing in their spats let us say ernest left cambridge the other day a member of the athenaeum which he would be sorry to have you confound with a club in london of the same name he is a bachelor but not of arts no mean epigrammatist as you shall see and a favourite of the ladies he is almost a celebrity in restaurants where he dines frequently returning to sup and during this last year he has probably paid as much in them for the privilege of handing his hat to an attendant as the rent of a workingmans flat he complains brightly that he is hard up and that if somebody or other at westminster does not look out the country will go to the dogs he is no fool he has the shrewdness to float with the current because it is a laboursaving process but he has sufficient pluck to fight if fight he must a brief contest for he would soon be toppled over he has a light nature which would enable him to bob up cheerily in new conditions and return unaltered to the old ones his selfishness is his most endearing quality if he has his way he will spend his life like a cat in pushing his betters out of the soft places and until he is old he will be fondled in the process  he gives his hat to one footman and his cane to another and mounts the great staircase unassisted and undirected as a nephew of the house he need show no credentials even to crichton who is guarding a door above  it would not be good taste to describe crichton who is only a servant if to the scandal of all good houses he is to stand out as a figure in the play he must do it on his own as they say in the pantry and the boudoir  we are not going to help him we have had misgivings ever since we found his name in the title and we shall keep him out of his rights as long as we can even though we softened to him he would not be a hero in these clothes of servitude and he loves his clothes how to get him out of them it would require a cataclysm to be an indoor servant at all is to crichton a badge of honour to be a butler at thirty is the realisation of his proudest ambitions he is devotedly attached to his master who in his opinion has but one fault he is not sufficiently contemptuous of his inferiors we are immediately to be introduced to this solitary failing of a great english peer  this perfect butler then opens a door and ushers ernest into a certain room at the same moment the curtain rises on this room and the play begins  it is one of several receptionrooms in loam house not the most magnificent but quite the softest and of a warm afternoon all that those who are anybody crave for is the softest the larger rooms are magnificent and bare carpetless so that it is an accomplishment to keep ones feet on them they are sometimes lent for charitable purposes they are also all in use on the night of a dinnerparty when you may find yourself alone in one having taken a wrong turning or alone save for two others who are within hailing distance  this room however is comparatively small and very soft there are so many cushions in it that you wonder why if you are an outsider and dont know that it needs six cushions to make one fair head comfy the couches themselves are cushions as large as beds and there is an art of sinking into them and of waiting to be helped out of them there are several famous paintings on the walls of which you may say jolly thing that without losing caste as knowing too much and in cases there are glorious miniatures but the daughters of the house cannot tell you of whom there is a catalogue somewhere there are a thousand or so of roses in basins several library novels and a row of weekly illustrated newspapers lying against each other like fallen soldiers if any one disturbs this row crichton seems to know of it from afar and appears noiselessly and replaces the wanderer one thing unexpected in such a room is a great array of tea things ernest spots them with a twinkle and has his epigram at once unsheathed he dallies however before delivering the thrust  ernest i perceive from the tea cups crichton that the great function is to take place here  crichton with a respectful sigh yes sir  ernest chuckling heartlessly the servants hall coming up to have tea in the drawingroom with terrible sarcasm no wonder you look happy crichton  crichton under the knife no sir  ernest do you know crichton i think that with an effort you might look even happier crichton smiles wanly you dont approve of his lordships compelling his servants to be his equalsonce a month  crichton it is not for me sir to disapprove of his lordships radical views  ernest certainly not and after all it is only once a month that he is affable to you  crichton on all other days of the month sir his lordships treatment of us is everything that could be desired  ernest this is the epigram tea cups life crichton is like a cup of tea the more heartily we drink the sooner we reach the dregs  crichton obediently thank you sir  ernest becoming confidential as we do when we have need of an ally crichton in case i should be asked to say a few words to the servants i have strung together a little speech his hand strays to his pocket i was wondering where i should stand  he tries various places and postures and comes to rest leaning over a high chair whence in dumb show he addresses a gathering crichton with the best intentions gives him a footstool to stand on and departs happily unconscious that ernest in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room  ernest addressing an imaginary audience and desirous of startling them at once suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea  he is not quite satisfied with his position though sure that the fault must lie with the chair for being too high not with him for being too short crichtons suggestion was not perhaps a bad one after all he lifts the stool but hastily conceals it behind him on the entrance of the ladies catherine and agatha two daughters of the house catherine is twenty and agatha two years younger they are very fashionable young women indeed who might wake up for a dance but they are very lazy catherine being two years lazier than agatha  ernest uneasily jocular because he is concealing the footstool and how are my little friends today  agatha contriving to reach a settee dont be silly ernest if you want to know how we are we are dead even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting  catherine subsiding nearer the door besides which we have had to decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht and that is such a mental strain  ernest you poor overworked things evidently agatha is his favourite for he helps her to put her feet on the settee while catherine has to dispose of her own feet rest your weary limbs  catherine perhaps in revenge but why have you a footstool in your hand  agatha yes  ernest why brilliantly but to be sure he has had time to think it out you see as the servants are to be the guests i must be butler i was practising this is a tray observe  holding the footstool as a tray he minces across the room like an accomplished footman the gods favour him for just here lady mary enters and he holds out the footstool to her  tea my lady  lady mary is a beautiful creature of twentytwo and is of a natural hauteur which is at once the fury and the envy of her sisters if she chooses she can make you seem so insignificant that you feel you might be swept away with the crumbbrush she seldom chooses because of the trouble of preening herself as she does it she is usually content to show that you merely tire her eyes she often seems to be about to go to sleep in the middle of a remark there is quite a long and anxious pause and then she continues like a clock that hesitates bored in the middle of its strike  lady mary arching her brows it is only you ernest i thought there was some one here and she also bestows herself on cushions  ernest a little piqued and deserting the footstool had a very tiring day also mary  lady mary yawning dreadfully been trying on engagementrings all the morning  ernest who is as fond of gossip as the oldest club member whats that to agatha is it brocklehurst  the energetic agatha nods  you have given your warm young heart to brocky  lady mary is impervious to his humour but he continues bravely  i dont wish to fatigue you mary by insisting on a verbal answer but if without straining yourself you can signify yes or no wont you make the effort  she indolently flashes a ring on her most important finger and he starts back melodramatically  the ring then i am too late too late fixing lady mary sternly like a prosecuting counsel may i ask mary does brocky know of course it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through mother does everything for brocky still in the eyes of the law you will be not her wife but his and therefore i hold that brocky ought to be informed now  he discovers that their languorous eyes have closed  if you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that i shall awaken you in the manner beloved of ladies abandon all such hopes  catherine and agatha look up without speaking  lady mary speaking without looking up you impertinent boy  ernest eagerly plucking another epigram from his quiver i knew that was it though i dont know everything agatha im not young enough to know everything  he looks hopefully from one to another but though they try to grasp this his brilliance baffles them  agatha his secret admirer young enough  ernest encouragingly dont you see im not young enough to know everything  agatha im sure its awfully clever but its so puzzling  here crichton ushers in an athletic pleasantfaced young clergyman mr treherne who greets the company  catherine ernest say it to mr treherne  ernest look here treherne im not young enough to know everything  treherne how do you mean ernest  ernest a little nettled i mean what i say  lady mary say it again say it more slowly  ernest imnotyoungenoughtoknoweverything  treherne i see what you really mean my boy is that you are not old enough to know everything  ernest no i dont  treherne i assure you thats it  lady mary of course it is  catherine yes ernest thats it  ernest in desperation appeals to crichton  ernest i am not young enough crichton to know everything  it is an anxious moment but a smile is at length extorted from crichton as with a corkscrew  crichton thank you sir he goes  ernest relieved ah if you had that fellows head treherne you would find something better to do with it than play cricket i hear you bowl with your head  treherne with proper humility im afraid cricket is all im good for ernest  catherine who thinks he has a heavenly nose indeed it isnt you are sure to get on mr treherne  treherne thank you lady catherine  catherine but it was the bishop who told me so he said a clergyman who breaks both ways is sure to get on in england  treherne im jolly glad  the master of the house comes in accompanied by lord brocklehurst the earl of loam is a widower a philanthropist and a peer of advanced ideas as a widower he is at least able to interfere in the domestic concerns of his houseto rummage in the drawers so to speak for which he has felt an itching all his blameless life his philanthropy has opened quite a number of other drawers to him and his advanced ideas have blown out his figure he takes in all the weightiest monthly reviews and prefers those that are uncut because he perhaps never looks better than when cutting them but he does not read them and save for the cutting it would suit him as well merely to take in the covers he writes letters to the papers which are printed in a type to scale with himself and he is very jealous of those other correspondents who get his type let laws and learning art and commerce die but leave the big type to an intellectual aristocracy he is really the reformed house of lords which will come some day  young lord brocklehurst is nothing save for his rank you could pick him up by the handful any day in piccadilly or holborn buying socksor selling them  lord loam expansively you are here ernest feeling fit for the voyage treherne  treherne looking forward to it enormously  lord loam thats right he chases his children about as if they were chickens now then mary up and doing up and doing time we had the servants in they enjoy it so much  lady mary they hate it  lord loam mary to your duties and he points severely to the teatable  ernest twinkling congratulations brocky  lord brocklehurst who detests humour thanks  ernest mother pleased  lord brocklehurst with dignity mother is very pleased  ernest thats good do you go on the yacht with us  lord brocklehurst sorry i cant and look here ernest i will not be called brocky  ernest mother dont like it  lord brocklehurst she does not he leaves ernest who forgives him and begins to think about his speech crichton enters  lord loam speaking as one man to another we are quite ready crichton crichton is distressed  lady mary sarcastically how crichton enjoys it  lord loam frowning he is the only one who doesnt pitiful creature  crichton shuddering under his lords displeasure i cant help being a conservative my lord  lord loam be a man crichton you are the same flesh and blood as myself  crichton in pain oh my lord  lord loam sharply show them in and by the way they were not all here last time  crichton all my lord except the merest trifles  lord loam it must be every one lowering and remember this crichton for the time being you are my equal testily i shall soon show you whether you are not my equal do as you are told  crichton departs to obey and his lordship is now a general he has no pity for his daughters and uses a terrible threat  and girls remember no condescension the first who condescends recites this sends them skurrying to their labours  by the way brocklehurst can you do anything  lord brocklehurst how do you mean  lord loam can you do anythingwith a penny or a handkerchief make them disappear for instance  lord brocklehurst good heavens no  lord loam its a pity every one in our position ought to be able to do something ernest i shall probably ask you to say a few words something bright and sparkling  ernest but my dear uncle i have prepared nothing  lord loam anything impromptu will do  ernest ohwellif anything strikes me on the spur of the moment  he unostentatiously gets the footstool into position behind the chair crichton reappears to announce the guests of whom the first is the housekeeper  crichton reluctantly mrs perkins  lord loam shaking hands very delighted mrs perkins mary our friend mrs perkins  lady mary how do you do mrs perkins wont you sit here  lord loam threateningly agatha  agatha hastily how do you do wont you sit down  lord loam introducing lord brocklehurstmy valued friend mrs perkins  lord brocklehurst bows and escapes he has to fall back on ernest  lord brocklehurst for heavens sake ernest dont leave me for a moment this sort of thing is utterly opposed to all my principles  ernest airily you stick to me brocky and ill pull you through  crichton monsieur fleury  ernest the chef  lord loam shaking hands with the chef very charmed to see you monsieur fleury  fleury thank you very much  fleury bows to agatha who is not effusive  lord loam warningly agatharecitation  she tosses her head but immediately finds a seat and tea for m fleury treherne and ernest move about making themselves amiable lady mary is presiding at the teatray  crichton mr rolleston  lord loam shaking hands with his valet how do you do rolleston  catherine looks after the wants of rolleston  crichton mr tompsett  tompsett the coachman is received with honours from which he shrinks  crichton miss fisher  this superb creature is no less than lady marys maid and even lord loam is a little nervous  lord loam this is a pleasure miss fisher  ernest unabashed if i might venture miss fisher and he takes her unto himself  crichton miss simmons  lord loam to catherines maid you are always welcome miss simmons  ernest perhaps to kindle jealousy in miss fisher at last we meet wont you sit down  crichton mademoiselle jeanne  lord loam charmed to see you mademoiselle jeanne  a place is found for agathas maid and the scene is now an animated one but still our host thinks his girls are not sufficiently sociable he frowns on lady mary  lady mary in alarm mr treherne this is fisher my maid  lord loam sharply your what mary  lady mary my friend  crichton thomas  lord loam how do you do thomas  the first footman gives him a reluctant hand  crichton john  lord loam how do you do john  ernest signs to lord brocklehurst who hastens to him  ernest introducing brocklehurst this is john i think you have already met

loam your hand gladys  he bestows her on agatha  crichton tweeny  she is a very humble and frightened kitchenmaid of whom we are to see more  lord loam so happy to see you  fisher john i saw you talking to lord brocklehurst just now introduce me  lord brocklehurst at the same moment to ernest thats an uncommon pretty girl if i must feed one of them ernest thats the one  but ernest tries to part him and fisher as they are about to shake hands  ernest no you dont it wont do brocky to miss fisher you are too pretty my dear mother wouldnt like it discovering tweeny heres something safer charming girl brocky dying to know you let me introduce you tweeny lord brocklehurstlord brocklehurst tweeny  brocklehurst accepts his fate but he still has an eye for fisher and something may come of this  lord loam severely they are not all here crichton  crichton with a sigh odds and ends  a stableboy and a page are shown in and for a moment no daughter of the house advances to them  lord loam with a roving eye on his children which is to recite  the last of the company are so to say embraced  lord loam to tompsett as they partake of tea together and how are all at home  tompsett fairish my lord if tis the horses you are inquiring for  lord loam no no the family hows the baby  tompsett blooming your lordship  lord loam a very fine boy i remember saying so when i saw him nice little fellow  tompsett not quite knowing whether to let it pass beg pardon my lord its a girl  lord loam a girl aha ha ha exactly what i said i distinctly remember saying if its spared it will be a girl  crichton now comes down  lord loam very delighted to see you crichton  crichton has to shake hands  mary you know mr crichton  he wanders off in search of other prey  lady mary milk and sugar crichton  crichton im ashamed to be seen talking to you my lady  lady mary to such a perfect servant as you all this must be most distasteful crichton is too respectful to answer oh please do speak or i shall have to recite you do hate it dont you  crichton it pains me your ladyship it disturbs the etiquette of the servants hall after last months meeting the pageboy in a burst of equality called me crichton he was dismissed  lady mary i wonderi really dohow you can remain with us  crichton i should have felt compelled to give notice my lady if the master had not had a seat in the upper house i cling to that  lady mary do go on speaking tell me what did mr ernest mean by saying he was not young enough to know everything  crichton i have no idea my lady  lady mary but you laughed  crichton my lady he is the second son of a peer  lady mary very proper sentiments you are a good soul crichton  lord brocklehurst desperately to tweeny and now tell me have you been to the opera what sort of weather have you been having in the kitchen tweeny gurgles for heavens sake woman be articulate  crichton still talking to lady mary no my lady his lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs but there will never be equality in the servants hall  lord loam overhearing this whats that no equality cant you see crichton that our divisions into classes are artificial that if we were to return to nature which is the aspiration of my life all would be equal  crichton if i may make so bold as to contradict your lordship  lord loam with an effort go on  crichton the divisions into classes my lord are not artificial they are the natural outcome of a civilised society to lady mary there must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities my lady for it is natural and whatever is natural is right  lord loam wincing it is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow you to talk such nonsense  crichton eagerly yes my lord it is that is what i have been striving to point out to your lordship  agatha to catherine what is the matter with fisher she is looking daggers  catherine the tedious creature some question of etiquette i suppose  she sails across to fisher  how are you fisher  fisher with a toss of her head i am nothing my lady i am nothing at all  agatha oh dear who says so  fisher affronted his lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a second cup of tea  catherine but why not  fisher if it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it to me  agatha so that is it do you want another cup of tea fisher  fisher no my ladybut my positioni should have been asked first  agatha oh dear  all this has taken some time and by now the feeble appetites of the uncomfortable guests have been satiated but they know there is still another ordeal to facehis lordships monthly speech every one awaits it with misgivingthe servants lest they should applaud as last time in the wrong place and the daughters because he may be personal about them as the time before ernest is annoyed that there should be this speech at all when there is such a much better one coming and brocklehurst foresees the degradation of the peerage all are thinking of themselves alone save crichton who knows his masters weakness and fears he may stick in the middle lord loam however advances cheerfully to his doom he sees ernests stool and artfully stands on it to his nephews natural indignation the three ladies knit their lips the servants look down their noses and the address begins  lord loam my friends i am glad to see you all looking so happy it used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove distasteful to you are they distasteful i hear you laughing at the question  he has not heard them but he hears them now the watchful crichton giving them a lead  no harm in saying that among us today is one who was formerly hostile to the movement but who today has been won over i refer to lord brocklehurst who i am sure will presently say to me that if the charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his company as he has derived from hers he will be more than satisfied  all look at tweeny who trembles  for the time being the artificial and unnaturali say unnatural glaring at crichton who bows slightlybarriers of society are swept away would that they could be swept away for ever  the pageboy cheers and has the one moment of prominence in his life he grows up marries and has children but is never really heard of again  but that is entirely and utterly out of the question and now for a few months we are to be separated as you know my daughters and mr ernest and mr treherne are to accompany me on my yacht on a voyage to distant parts of the earth in less than fortyeight hours we shall be under weigh  but for crichtons eye the reckless pageboy would repeat his success  do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday my views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known and what i preach i am resolved to practise i have therefore decided that my daughters instead of having one maid each as at present shall on this voyage have but one maid between them  three maids rise also three mistresses  crichton my lord  lord loam my mind is made up  ernest i cordially agree  lord loam and now my friends i should like to think that there is some piece of advice i might give you some thought some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence in this connection i remember a proverb which has had a great effect on my own life i first heard it many years ago i have never forgotten it it constantly cheers and guides me that proverb isthat proverb wasthe proverb i speak of  he grows pale and taps his forehead  lady mary oh dear i believe he has forgotten it  lord loam desperately the proverbthat proverb to which i refer  alas it has gone the distress is general he has not even the sense to sit down he gropes for the proverb in the air they try applause but it is no help  i have it nownot he  lady mary with confidence crichton  he does not fail her as quietly as if he were in goloshes mind as well as feet he dismisses the domestics they go according to precedence as they entered yet in a moment they are gone then he signs to mr treherne and they conduct lord loam with dignity from the room his hands are still catching flies he still mutters the proverbthat proverb but he continues owing to crichtons skilful treatment to look every inch a peer the ladies have now an opportunity to air their indignation  lady mary one maid among three grown women  lord brocklehurst mary i think i had better go that dreadful kitchenmaid  lady mary i cant blame you george  he salutes her  lord brocklehurst your fathers views are shocking to me and i am glad i am not to be one of the party on the yacht my respect for myself mary my natural anxiety as to what mother will say i shall see you darling before you sail  he bows to the others and goes  ernest selfish brute only thinking of himself what about my speech  lady mary one maid among three of us whats to be done  ernest pooh you must do for yourselves thats all  lady mary do for ourselves how can we know where our things are kept  agatha are you aware that dresses button up the back  catherine how are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the carriage  lady mary who is to put us to bed and who is to get us up and how shall we ever know its morning if there is no one to pull up the blinds  crichton crosses on his way out  ernest how is his lordship now  crichton a little easier sir  lady mary crichton send fisher to me  he goes  ernest i have no pity for you girls i  lady mary ernest go away and dont insult the brokenhearted  ernest and uncommon glad i am to go tata all of you he asked me to say a few words i came here to say a few words and im not at all sure that i couldnt bring an action against him  he departs feeling that he has left a dart behind him the girls are alone with their tragic thoughts  lady mary becomes a mother to the younger ones at last my poor sisters come here they go to her doubtfully we must make this draw us closer together i shall do my best to help you in every way just now i cannot think of myself at all  agatha but how unlike you mary  lady mary it is my duty to protect my sisters  catherine i never knew her so sweet before agatha cautiously what do you propose to do mary  lady mary i propose when we are on the yacht to lend fisher to you when i dont need her myself  agatha fisher  lady mary who has the most character of the three of course as the eldest i have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us  catherine speaking also for agatha mary you toad  agatha nothing on earth would induce fisher to lift her hand for either me or catherine  lady mary i was afraid of it agatha that is why i am so sorry for you  the further exchange of pleasantries is interrupted by the arrival of fisher  lady mary fisher you heard what his lordship said  fisher yes my lady  lady mary coldly though the others would have tried blandishment you have given me some satisfaction of late fisher and to mark my approval i have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us  fisher acidly i thank you my lady  lady mary that is all you may go  fisher rapping it out if you please my lady i wish to give notice  catherine and agatha gleam but lady mary is of sterner stuff  lady mary taking up a book oh certainlyyou may go  catherine but why fisher  fisher i could not undertake my lady to wait upon three we dont do it in an indignant outburst to lady mary oh my lady to think that this affront  lady mary looking up i thought i told you to go fisher  fisher stands for a moment irresolute then goes as soon as she has gone lady mary puts down her book and weeps she is a pretty woman but this is the only pretty thing we have seen her do yet  agatha succinctly serves you right  crichton comes  catherine it will be simmons after all send simmons to me  crichton after hesitating my lady might i venture to speak  catherine what is it  crichton i happen to know your ladyship that simmons desires to give notice for the same reason as fisher  catherine oh  agatha triumphant then catherine we take jeanne  crichton and jeanne also my lady  lady mary is reading indifferent though the heavens fall but her sisters are not ashamed to show their despair to crichton  agatha we cant blame them could any maid who respected herself be got to wait upon three  lady mary with languid interest i suppose there are such persons crichton  crichton guardedly i have heard my lady that there are such  lady mary a little desperate crichton whats to be done we sail in two days could one be discovered in the time  agatha frankly a supplicant surely you can think of some one  crichton after hesitating there is in this establishment your ladyship a young woman  lady mary yes  crichton a young woman on whom i have for some time cast an eye  catherine eagerly do you mean as a possible ladysmaid  crichton i had thought of her my lady in another connection  lady mary ah  crichton but i believe she is quite the young person you require perhaps if you could see her my lady  lady mary i shall certainly see her bring her to me he goes you two neednt wait  catherine neednt we we see your little game mary  agatha we shall certainly remain and have our twothirds of her  they sit there doggedly until crichton returns with tweeny who looks scared  crichton this my lady is the young person  catherine frankly oh dear  it is evident that all three consider her quite unsuitable  lady mary come here girl dont be afraid  tweeny looks imploringly at her idol  crichton her appearance my lady is homely and her manners as you may have observed deplorable but she has a heart of gold  lady mary what is your position downstairs  tweeny bobbing im a tweeny your ladyship  catherine a what  crichton a tweeny that is to say my lady she is not at present strictly speaking anything a between maid she helps the vegetable maid it is she my lady who conveys the dishes from the one end of the kitchen table where they are placed by the cook to the other end where they enter into the charge of thomas and john  lady mary i see and you and crichton areahkeeping company  crichton draws himself up  tweeny aghast a butler dont keep company my lady  lady mary indifferently does he not  crichton no your ladyship we butlers mayhe makes a gesture with his armsbut we do not keep company  agatha i know what it is you are engaged  tweeny looks longingly at crichton  crichton certainly not my lady the utmost i can say at present is that i have cast a favourable eye  even this is much to tweeny  lady mary as you choose but i am afraid crichton she will not suit us  crichton my lady beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very sweet nature and rare womanly gifts  agatha unfortunately that is not what we want  crichton and it is she my lady who dresses the hair of the ladiesmaids for our evening meals  the ladies are interested at last  lady mary she dresses fishers hair  tweeny yes my lady and i does them up when they goes to parties  crichton pained but not scolding does  tweeny doos and its me what alters your gowns to fit them  crichton what alters  tweeny which alters  agatha mary  lady mary i shall certainly have her  catherine we shall certainly have her tweeny we have decided to make a ladysmaid of you  tweeny oh lawks  agatha we are doing this for you so that your position socially may be more nearly akin to that of crichton  crichton gravely it will undoubtedly increase the young persons chances  lady mary then if i get a good character for you from mrs perkins she will make the necessary arrangements  she resumes reading  tweeny elated my lady  lady mary by the way i hope you are a good sailor  tweeny startled you dont mean my lady im to go on the ship  lady mary certainly  tweeny butto crichton you aint going sir  crichton no  tweeny firm at last then neither aint i  agatha you must  tweeny leave him not me  lady mary girl dont be silly crichton will beconsidered in your wages  tweeny i aint going  crichton i feared this my lady  tweeny nothingll budge me  lady mary leave the room  crichton shows tweeny out with marked politeness  agatha crichton i think you might have shown more displeasure with her  crichton contrite i was touched my lady i see my lady that to part from her would be a wrench to me though i could not well say so in her presence not having yet decided how far i shall go with her  he is about to go when lord loam returns fuming  lord loam the ingrate the smug the fop  catherine what is it now father  lord loam that man of mine rolleston refuses to accompany us because you are to have but one maid  agatha hurrah  lady mary in better taste darling father rather than you should lose rolleston we will consent to take all the three of them  lord loam pooh nonsense crichton find me a valet who can do without three maids  crichton yes my lord troubled in the timethe more suitable the party my lord the less willing will he be to come without thethe usual perquisites  lord loam any one will do  crichton shocked my lord  lord loam the ingrate the puppy  agatha has an idea and whispers to lady mary  lady mary i ask a favour of a servantnever  agatha then i will crichton would it not be very distressing to you to let his lordship go attended by a valet who might prove unworthy it is only for three months dont you think that youyou yourselfyou  as crichton sees what she wants he pulls himself up with noble offended dignity and she is appalled  i beg your pardon  he bows stiffly  catherine to crichton but think of the joy to tweeny  crichton is moved but he shakes his head  lady mary so much the cleverest crichton do you think it safe to let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these dangerous views about equality  crichton is profoundly stirred after a struggle he goes to his master who has been pacing the room  crichton my lord i have found a man  lord loam already who is he  crichton presents himself with a gesture  yourself  catherine father how good of him  lord loam pleased but thinking it a small thing uncommon good thank you crichton this helps me nicely out of a hole and how it will annoy rolleston come with me and we shall tell him not that i think you have lowered yourself in any way come along  he goes and crichton is to follow him but is stopped by agatha impulsively offering him her hand  crichton who is much shaken my ladya valets hand  agatha i had no idea you would feel it so deeply why did you do it  crichton is too respectful to reply  lady mary regarding him crichton i am curious i insist upon an answer  crichton my lady i am the son of a butler and a ladysmaidperhaps the happiest of all combinations and to me the most beautiful thing in the world is a haughty aristocratic english house with every one kept in his place though i were equal to your ladyship where would be the pleasure to me it would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that thomas and john were equal to me  catherine but father says if we were to return to nature  crichton if we did my lady the first thing we should do would be to elect a head circumstances might alter cases the same person might not be master the same persons might not be servants i cant say as to that nor should we have the deciding of it nature would decide for us  lady mary you seem to have thought it all out carefully crichton  crichton yes my lady  catherine and you have done this for us crichton because you thought thatthat father needed to be kept in his place  crichton i should prefer you to say my lady that i have done it for the house  agatha thank you crichton mary be nicer to him but lady mary has begun to read again if there was any way in which we could show our gratitude  crichton if i might venture my lady would you kindly show it by becoming more like lady mary that disdain is what we like from our superiors even so do we the upper servants disdain the lower servants while they take it out of the odds and ends  he goes and they bury themselves in cushions  agatha oh dear what a tiring day  catherine i feel dead tuck in your feet you selfish thing  lady mary is lying reading on another couch  lady mary i wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases  agatha yawning dont talk mary i was nearly asleep  lady mary i wonder what he meant by the same person might not be master and the same persons might not be servants  catherine do be quiet mary and leave it to nature he said nature would decide  lady mary i wonder  but she does not wonder very much she would wonder more if she knew what was coming her book slips unregarded to the floor the ladies are at rest until it is time to dress  end of act i     act ii the island   two months have elapsed and the scene is a desert island in the pacific on which our adventurers have been wrecked  the curtain rises on a sea of bamboo which shuts out all view save the foliage of palm trees and some gaunt rocks occasionally crichton and treherne come momentarily into sight hacking and hewing the bamboo through which they are making a clearing between the ladies and the shore and by and by owing to their efforts we shall have an unrestricted outlook on to a sullen sea that is at present hidden then we shall also be able to note a mast standing out of the waterall that is left saving floating wreckage of the illfated yacht the bluebell the beginnings of a hut will also be seen with crichton driving its walls into the ground or astride its roof of saplings for at present he is doing more than one thing at a time in a red shirt with the ends of his sailors breeches thrust into wadingboots he looks a man for the moment we suddenly remember some ones sayingperhaps it was ourselvesthat a cataclysm would be needed to get him out of his servants clothes and apparently it has been forthcoming it is no longer beneath our dignity to cast an inquiring eye on his appearance his features are not distinguished but he has a strong jaw and green eyes in which a yellow light burns that we have not seen before his dark hair hitherto so decorously sleek has been ruffled this way and that by wind and weather as if they were part of the cataclysm and wanted to help his chance his muscles must be soft and flabby still but though they shriek aloud to him to desist he rains lusty blows with his axe like one who has come upon the open for the first time in his life and likes it he is as yet far from being an expert woodsmanmark the blood on his hands at places where he has hit them instead of the tree but note also that he does not waste time in bandaging themhe rubs them in the earth and goes on his face is still of the discreet pallor that befits a butler and he carries the smaller logs as if they were a salver not in a day or a month will he shake off the badge of servitude but without knowing it he has begun  but for the hatchets at work and an occasional something horrible falling from a tree into the ladies laps they hear nothing save the mournful surf breaking on a coral shore  they sit or recline huddled together against a rock and they are farther from home in every sense of the word than ever before thirtysix hours ago they were given three minutes in which to dress without a maid and reach the boats and they have not made the best of that valuable time none of them has boots and had they known this prickly island they would have thought first of boots they have a sufficiency of garments but some of them were gifts dropped into the boatlady marys tarpaulin coat and hat for instance and catherines blue jersey and red cap which certify that the two ladies were lately before the mast agatha is too gay in ernests dressinggown and clutches it to her person with both hands as if afraid that it may be claimed by its rightful owner there are two pairs of bath slippers between the three of them and their hair cries aloud and in vain for hairpins  by their side on an inverted bucket sits ernest clothed neatly in the garments of day and night but alas barefooted he is the only cheerful member of this company of four but his brightness is due less to a manly desire to succour the helpless than to his having been lately in the throes of composition and to his modest satisfaction with the result he reads to the ladies and they listen each with one scared eye to the things that fall from trees  ernest who has written on the flyleaf of the only book saved from the wreck this is what i have written wrecked wrecked wrecked on an island in the tropics the following the hon ernest woolley the rev john treherne the ladies mary catherine and agatha lasenby with two servants we are the sole survivors of lord loams steam yacht bluebell which encountered a fearful gale in these seas and soon became a total wreck the crew behaved gallantly putting us all into the first boat what became of them i cannot tell but we after dreadful sufferings and insufficiently clad in whatever garments we could lay hold of in the dark  lady mary please dont describe our garments  ernestsucceeded in reaching this island with the loss of only one of our party namely lord loam who flung away his life in a gallant attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard the ladies have wept long and sore for their father but there is something in this last utterance that makes them look up  agatha but ernest it was crichton who jumped overboard trying to save father  ernest with the candour that is one of his most engaging qualities well you know it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by trying to get into the boat first and as this document may be printed in the english papers it struck me an english peer you know  lady mary every inch an english peers daughter ernest that is very thoughtful of you  ernest continuing well pleasedby night the cries of wild cats and the hissing of snakes terrify us extremelythis does not satisfy him so well and he makes a correctionterrify the ladies extremely against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet a bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat  lady mary with some spirit and ernest is sitting on it  ernest hsh oh do be quietto add to our horrors night falls suddenly in these parts and it is then that savage animals begin to prowl and roar  lady mary have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes as we sleep  ernest no thats all i end up rescue us or we perish rich reward signed ernest woolley in command of our little party this is written on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that crichton found in his pocket fancy crichton being a reader of poetry now i shall put it into the bottle and fling it into the sea  he pushes the precious document into a sodawater bottle and rams the cork home at the same moment and without effort he gives birth to one of his most characteristic epigrams  the tide is going out we mustnt miss the post  they are so unhappy that they fail to grasp it and a little petulantly he calls for crichton ever his standby in the hour of epigram crichton breaks through the undergrowth quickly thinking the ladies are in danger  crichton anything wrong sir  ernest with fine confidence the tide crichton is a postman who calls at our island twice a day for letters  crichton after a pause thank you sir  he returns to his labours however without giving the smile which is the epigrammatists right and ernest is a little disappointed in him  ernest poor crichton i sometimes think he is losing his sense of humour come along agatha  he helps his favourite up the rocks and they disappear gingerly from view  catherine how horribly still it is  lady mary remembering some recent sounds it is best when it is still  catherine drawing closer to her mary i have heard that they are always very still just before they jump  lady mary dont a distinct chapping is heard and they are startled  lady mary controlling herself it is only crichton knocking down trees  catherine almost imploringly mary let us go and stand beside him  lady mary coldly let a servant see that i am afraid  catherine dont then but remember this dear they often drop on one from above  she moves away nearer to the friendly sound of the axe and lady mary is left alone she is the most courageous of them as well as the haughtiest but when something she had thought to be a stick glides toward her she forgets her dignity and screams  lady mary calling crichton crichton  it must have been treherne who was treefelling for crichton comes to her from the hut drawing his cutlass  crichton anxious did you call my lady  lady mary herself again now that he is there i why should i  crichton i made a mistake your ladyship hesitating if you are afraid of being alone my lady  lady mary afraid certainly not doggedly you may go  but she does not complain when he remains within eyesight cutting the bamboo it is heavy work and she watches him silently  lady mary i wish crichton you could work without getting so hot  crichton mopping his face i wish i could my lady  he continues his labours  lady mary taking off her oilskins it makes me hot to look at you  crichton it almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship  lady mary who perhaps thinks he is presuming anything i can do for you in that way crichton i shall do with pleasure  crichton quite humbly thank you my lady  by this time most of the bamboo has been cut and the shore and sea are visible except where they are hidden by the half completed hut the mast rising solitary from the water adds to the desolation of the scene and at last tears run down lady marys face  crichton dont give way my lady things might be worse  lady mary my poor father  crichton if i could have given my life for his  lady mary you did all a man could do indeed i thank you crichton with some admiration and more wonder you are a man  crichton thank you my lady  lady mary but it is all so awful crichton is there any hope of a ship coming  crichton after hesitation of course there is my lady  lady mary facing him bravely dont treat me as a child i have got to know the worst and to face it crichton the truth  crichton reluctantly we were driven out of our course my lady i fear far from the track of commerce  lady mary thank you i understand  for a moment however she breaks down then she clenches her hands and stands erect  crichton watching her and forgetting perhaps for the moment that they are not just a man and woman youre a good pluckt un my lady  lady mary falling into the same error i shall try to be extricating herself crichton how dare you  crichton i beg your ladyships pardon but you are  she smiles as if it were a comfort to be told this even by crichton  and until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for you ladies  lady mary with a curl of the lip mr ernest does no work  crichton cheerily but he will my lady  lady mary i doubt it  crichton confidently but perhaps thoughtlessly no workno dinnerwill make a great change in mr ernest  lady mary no workno dinner when did you invent that rule crichton  crichton loaded with bamboo i didnt invent it my lady i seem to see it growing all over the island  lady mary disquieted crichton your manner strikes me as curious  crichton pained i hope not your ladyship  lady mary determined to have it out with him you are not implying anything so unnatural i presume as that if i and my sisters dont work there will be no dinner for us  crichton brightly if it is unnatural my lady that is the end of it  lady mary if now i understand the perfect servant at home holds that we are all equal now i see  crichton wounded to the quick my lady can you think me so inconsistent  lady mary that is it  crichton earnestly my lady i disbelieved in equality at home because it was against nature and for that same reason i as utterly disbelieve in it on an island  lady mary relieved by his obvious sincerity i apologise  crichton continuing unfortunately there must always my lady be one to command and others to obey  lady mary satisfied one to command others to obey yes then suddenly she realises that there may be a dire meaning in his confident words crichton  crichton who has intended no dire meaning what is it my lady  but she only stares into his face and then hurries from him left alone he is puzzled but being a practical man he busies himself gathering firewood until tweeny appears excitedly carrying cocoanuts in her skirt she has made better use than the ladies of her three minutes grace for dressing  tweeny who can be happy even on an island if crichton is with her look what i found  crichton cocoanuts bravo  tweeny they grows on trees  crichton where did you think they grew  tweeny i thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks  crichton wrinkling his brows oh tweeny tweeny  tweeny anxiously have i offended of your feelings again sir  crichton a little  tweeny in a despairing outburst im full o vulgar words and ways and though i may keep them in their holes when you are by as soon as im by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is dark i says them gloatinglike in my headblooming i says and all my eye and ginger and nothink and all the time we was being wrecked i was praying to myself please the lord it may be an island as its natural to be vulgar on  a shudder passes through crichton and she is abject  thats the kind i am sir im opeless youd better give me up  she is a pathetic forlorn creature and his manhood is stirred  crichton wondering a little at himself for saying it i wont give you up it is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious but so it is thoughtfully there is something about you tweeny there is a je ne sais quoi about you  tweeny knowing only that he has found something in her to commend is there is there oh i am glad  crichton putting his hand on her shoulder like a protector we shall fight your vulgarity together all this time he has been arranging sticks for his fire now get some dry grass she brings him grass and he puts it under the sticks he produces an odd lens from his pocket and tries to focus the suns rays  tweeny why whats that  crichton the ingenious creature thats the glass from my watch and one from mr trehernes with a little water between them im hoping to kindle a fire with it  tweeny properly impressed oh sir  after one failure the grass takes fire and they are blowing on it when excited cries near by bring them sharply to their feet agatha runs to them white of face followed by ernest  ernest danger crichton a tigercat  crichton getting his cutlass where  agatha it is at our heels  ernest look out crichton  crichton hsh  treherne comes to his assistance while lady mary and catherine join agatha in the hut ernest it will be on us in a moment he seizes the hatchet and guards the hut it is pleasing to see that ernest is no coward  treherne listen  ernest the grass is moving its coming  it comes but it is no tigercat it is lord loam crawling on his hands and knees a very exhausted and dishevelled peer wondrously attired in rags the girls see him and with glad cries rush into his arms  lady mary father  lord loam marycatherineagatha oh dear my dears my dears oh dear  lady mary darling  agatha sweetest  catherine love  treherne glad to see you sir  ernest uncle uncle dear old uncle  for a time such happy cries fill the air but presently treherne is thoughtless  treherne ernest thought you were a tigercat  lord loam stung somehow to the quick oh did you i knew you at once ernest i knew you by the way you ran  ernest smiles forgivingly  crichton venturing forward at last my lord i am glad  ernest with upraised finger but you are also idling crichton making himself comfortable on the ground we mustnt waste time to work to work  crichton after contemplating him without rancour yes sir  he gets a pot from the hut and hangs it on a tripod over the fire which is now burning brightly  treherne ernest you be a little more civil crichton let me help  he is soon busy helping crichton to add to the strength of the hut  lord loam gazing at the pot as ladies are said to gaze on precious stones is thatbut i suppose im dreaming again timidly it isnt by any chance a pot on top of a fire is it  lady mary indeed it is dearest it is our supper  lord loam i have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days quivering there s nothing in it is there  ernest sniff uncle lord loam sniffs  lord loam reverently it smells of onions  there is a sudden diversion  catherine father you have boots  lady mary so he has  lord loam of course i have  ernest with greedy cunning you are actually wearing boots uncle its very unsafe you know in this climate  lord loam is it  ernest we have all abandoned them you observe the blood the arteries you know  lord loam i hadnt a notion  he holds out his feet and ernest kneels  ernest o lord yes  in another moment those boots will be his  lady mary quickly father he is trying to get your boots from you there is nothing in the world we wouldnt give for boots  ernest rising haughtily a proud spirit misunderstood i only wanted the loan of them  agatha running her fingers along them lovingly if you lend them to any one it will be to us wont it father  lord loam certainly my child  ernest oh very well he is leaving these selfish ones i dont want your old boots he gives his uncle a last chance you dont think you could spare me one boot  lord loam tartly i do not  ernest quite so well all i can say is im sorry for you  he departs to recline elsewhere  lady mary father we thought we should never see you again  lord loam i was washed ashore my dear clinging to a hencoop how awful that first night was  lady mary poor father  lord loam when i woke i wept then i began to feel extremely hungry there was a large turtle on the beach i remembered from the swiss family robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless my dears i crawled towards him i flung myself upon himhere he pauses to rub his legthe nasty spiteful brute  lady mary you didnt turn him over  lord loam vindictively though he is a kindly man mary the senseless thing wouldnt wait i found that none of them would wait  catherine we should have been as badly off if crichton hadnt  lady mary quickly dont praise crichton  lord loam and then those beastly monkeys i always understood that if you flung stones at them they would retaliate by flinging cocoanuts at you would you believe it i flung a hundred stones and not one monkey had sufficient intelligence to grasp my meaning how i longed for crichton  lady mary wincing for us also father  lord loam for you also i tried for hours to make a fire the authors say that when wrecked on an island you can obtain a light by rubbing two pieces of stick together with feeling the liars  lady mary and all this time you thought there was no one on the island but yourself  lord loam i thought so until this morning i was searching the pools for little fishes which i caught in my hat when suddenly i saw before meon the sand  catherine what  lord loam a hairpin  lady mary a hairpin it must be one of ours give it me father  agatha no its mine  lord loam i didnt keep it  lady mary speaking for all three didnt keep it found a hairpin on an island and didnt keep it  lord loam humbly my dears  agatha scarcely to be placated oh father we have returned to nature more than you bargained for  lady mary for shame agatha she has something on her mind father there is something i want you to do at oncei mean to assert your position as the chief person on the island  they are all surprised  lord loam but who would presume to question it  catherine she must mean ernest  lady mary must i  agatha its cruel to say anything against ernest  lord loam firmly if any one presumes to challenge my position i shall make short work of him  agatha here comes ernest now see if you can say these horrid things to his face  lord loam i shall teach him his place at once  lady mary anxiously but how  lord loam chuckling i have just thought of an extremely amusing way of doing it as ernest approaches ernest  ernest loftily excuse me uncle im thinking im planning out the building of this hut  lord loam i also have been thinking  ernest that dont matter  lord loam eh  ernest please please this is important  lord loam i have been thinking that i ought to give you my boots  ernest what  lady mary father  lord loam genially take them my boy with a rapidity we had not thought him capable of ernest becomes the wearer of the boots and now i dare say you want to know why i give them to you ernest  ernest moving up and down in them deliciously not at all the great thing is ive got em ive got em  lord loam majestically but with a knowing look at his daughters my reason is that as head of our little party you ernest shall be our hunter you shall clear the forests of those savage beasts that make them so dangerous pleasantly and now you know my dear nephew why i have given you my boots  ernest this is my answer  he kicks off the boots  lady mary still anxious father assert yourself  lord loam i shall now assert myself but how to do it he has a happy thought call crichton  lady mary oh father  crichton comes in answer to a summons and is followed by treherne  ernest wondering a little at lady marys grave face crichton look here  lord loam sturdily silence crichton i want your advice as to what i ought to do with mr ernest he has defied me  ernest pooh  crichton after considering may i speak openly my lord  lady mary keeping her eyes fixed on him that is what we desire  crichton quite humbly then i may say your lordship that i have been considering mr ernests case at odd moments ever since we were wrecked  ernest my case  lord loam sternly hush  crichton since we landed on the island my lord it seems to me that mr ernests epigrams have been particularly brilliant  ernest gratified thank you crichton  crichton but i findi seem to find it growing wild my lord in the woods that sayings which would be justly admired in england are not much use on an island i would therefore most respectfully propose that henceforth every time mr ernest favours us with an epigram his head should be immersed in a bucket of cold spring water  there is a terrible silence  lord loam uneasily serve him right  ernest i should like to see you try to do it uncle  crichton ever ready to come to the succour of his lordship my feeling my lord is that at the next offence i should convey him to a retired spot where i shall carry out the undertaking in as respectful a manner as is consistent with a thorough immersion  though his manner is most respectful he is firm he evidently means what he says  lady mary a ramrod father you must not permit this ernest is your nephew  lord loam with his hand to his brow after all he is my nephew crichton and as i am sure he now sees that i am a strong man  ernest foolishly in the circumstances a strong man you mean a stout man you are one of mind to two of matter he looks round in the old way for approval no one has smiled and to his consternation he sees that crichton is quietly turning up his sleeves ernest makes an appealing gesture to his uncle then he turns defiantly to crichton  crichton is it to be before the ladies mr ernest or in the privacy of the wood he fixes ernest with his eye ernest is cowed come  ernest affecting bravado oh all right  crichton succinctly bring the bucket  ernest hesitates he then lifts the bucket and follows crichton to the nearest spring  lord loam rather white im sorry for him but i had to be firm  lady mary oh father it wasnt you who was firm crichton did it himself  lord loam bless me so he did  lady mary father be strong  lord loam bewildered you cant mean that my faithful crichton  lady mary yes i do  treherne lady mary i stake my word that crichton is incapable of acting dishonourably  lady mary i know that i know it as well as you dont you see that that is what makes him so dangerous  treherne by jove ii believe i catch your meaning  catherine he is coming back  lord loam who has always known himself to be a man of ideas let us all go into the hut just to show him at once that it is our hut  lady mary as they go father i implore you assert yourself now and for ever  lord loam i will  lady mary and please dont ask him how you are to do it  crichton returns with sticks to mend the fire  lord loam loftily from the door of the hut have you carried out my instructions crichton  crichton deferentially yes my lord  ernest appears mopping his hair which has become very wet since we last saw him he is not bearing malice he is too busy drying but agatha is specially his champion  agatha its infamous infamous  lord loam strongly my orders agatha  lady mary now father please  lord loam striking an attitude before i give you any further orders crichton  crichton yes my lord  lord loam delighted pooh its all right  lady mary no please go on  lord loam well well this question of the leadership what do you think now crichton  crichton my lord i feel it is a matter with which i have nothing to do  lord loam excellent ha mary that settles it i think  lady mary it seems to butim not sure  crichton it will settle itself naturally my lord without any interference from us  the reference to nature gives general dissatisfaction  lady mary father  lord loam a little severely it settled itself long ago crichton when i was born a peer and you for instance were born a servant  crichton acquiescing yes my lord that was how it all came about quite naturally in england we had nothing to do with it there and we shall have as little to do with it here  treherne relieved thats all right  lady mary determined to clinch the matter one moment in short crichton his lordship will continue to be our natural head  crichton i dare say my lady i dare say  catherine but you must know  crichton asking your pardon my lady one cant be sureon an island  they look at each other uneasily  lord loam warningly crichton i dont like this  crichton harassed the more i think of it your lordship the more uneasy i become myself when i heard my lord that you had left that hairpin behindhe is pained  lord loam feebly one hairpin among so many would only have caused dissension  crichton very sorry to have to contradict him not so my lord from that hairpin we could have made a needle with that needle we could out of skins have sewn trousers of which your lordship is in need indeed we are all in need of them  lady mary suddenly selfconscious all  crichton on an island my lady  lady mary father  crichton really more distressed by the prospect than she my lady if nature does not think them necessary you may be sure she will not ask you to wear them shaking his head but among all this undergrowth  lady mary now you see this man in his true colours  lord loam violently crichton you will either this moment say down with nature  crichton scandalised my lord  lord loam loftily then this is my last word to you take a months notice  if the hut had a door he would now shut it to indicate that the interview is closed  crichton in great distress your lordship the disgrace  lord loam swelling not another word you may go  lady mary adamant and dont come to me crichton for a character  ernest whose immersion has cleared his brain arent you all forgetting that this is an island  this brings them to earth with a bump lord loam looks to his eldest daughter for the fitting response  lady mary equal to the occasion it makes only this differencethat you may go at once crichton to some other part of the island  the faithful servant has been true to his superiors ever since he was created and never more true than at this moment but his fidelity is founded on trust in nature and to be untrue to it would be to be untrue to them he lets the wood he has been gathering slip to the ground and bows his sorrowful head he turns to obey then affection for these great ones wells up in him  crichton my lady let me work for you  lady mary go  crichton you need me so sorely i cant desert you i wont  lady mary in alarm lest the others may yield then father there is but one alternative we must leave him  lord loam is looking yearningly at crichton  treherne it seems a pity  catherine forlornly you will work for us  treherne most willingly but i must warn you all that so far crichton has done ninetenths of the scoring  lady mary the question is are we to leave this man  lord loam wrapping himself in his dignity come my dears  crichton my lord  lord loam treherneernestget our things  ernest we dont have any uncle they all belong to crichton  treherne everything we have he brought from the wreckhe went back to it before it sank he risked his life  crichton my lord anything you would care to take is yours  lady mary quickly nothing  ernest rot if i could have your socks crichton  lady mary come father we are ready  followed by the others she and lord loam pick their way up the rocks in their indignation they scarcely notice that daylight is coming to a sudden end  crichton my lord i implore youi am not desirous of being head do you have a try at it my lord  lord loam outraged a try at it  crichton eagerly it may be that you will prove to be the best man  lord loam may be my children come  they disappear proudly in single file  treherne crichton im sorry but of course i must go with them  crichton certainly sir  he calls to tweeny and she comes from behind the hut where she has been watching breathlessly  will you be so kind sir as to take her to the others  treherne assuredly  tweeny but what do it all mean  crichton does tweeny does he passes her up the rocks to treherne we shall meet again soon tweeny good night sir  treherne good night i dare say they are not far away  crichton thoughtfully they went westward sir and the wind is blowing in that direction that may mean sir that nature is already taking the matter into her own hands they are all hungry sir and the pot has come aboil he takes off the lid the smell will be borne westward that pot is full of nature mr treherne good night sir  treherne good night  he mounts the rocks with tweeny and they are heard for a little time after their figures are swallowed up in the fast growing darkness crichton stands motionless the lid in his hand though he has forgotten it and his reason for taking it off the pot he is deeply stirred but presently is ashamed of his dejection for it is as if he doubted his principles bravely true to his faith that nature will decide now as ever before he proceeds manfully with his preparations for the night he lights a ships lantern one of several treasures he has brought ashore and is filling his pipe with crumbs of tobacco from various pockets when the stealthy movements of some animal in the grass startles him with the lantern in one hand and his cutlass in the other he searches the ground around the hut he returns lights his pipe and sits down by the fire which casts weird moving shadows there is a red gleam on his face in the darkness he is a strong and perhaps rather sinister figure in the great stillness that has fallen over the land the wash of the surf seems to have increased in volume the sound is indescribably mournful except where the fire is desolation has fallen on the island like a pall  once or twice as nature dictates crichton leans forward to stir the pot and the smell is borne westward he then resumes his silent vigil  shadows other than those cast by the fire begin to descend the rocks they are the adventurers returning one by one they steal nearer to the pot until they are squatted round it with their hands out to the blaze lady mary only is absent presently she comes within sight of the others then stands against a tree with her teeth clenched one wonders perhaps what nature is to make of her   end of act ii     act iii the happy home   the scene is the hall of their island home two years later this sturdy loghouse is no mere extension of the hut we have seen in process of erection but has been built a mile or less to the west of it on higher ground and near a stream when the master chose this site the others thought that all he expected from the stream was a sufficiency of drinking water they know better now every time they go down to the mill or turn on the electric light  this hall is the livingroom of the house and walls and roof are of stout logs across the joists supporting the roof are laid many homemade implements such as spades saws fishingrods and from hooks in the joists are suspended cured foods of which hams are specially in evidence deep recesses half way up the walls contain various provender in barrels and sacks there are some skins trophies of the chase on the floor which is otherwise bare the chairs and tables are in some cases hewn out of the solid wood and in others the result of rough but efficient carpentering various pieces of wreckage from the yacht have been turned to novel uses thus the steeringwheel now hangs from the centre of the roof with electric lights attached to it encased in bladders a lifebuoy has become the back of a chair two barrels have been halved and turn coyly from each other as a settee  the farther end of the room is more strictly the kitchen and is a great recess which can be shut off from the hall by folding doors there is a large open fire in it the chimney is half of one of the boats of the yacht on the walls of the kitchen proper are many plateracks containing shells there are rows of these of one size and shape which mark them off as dinner plates or bowls others are as obviously tureens they are arranged primly as in a wellconducted kitchen indeed neatness and cleanliness are the note struck everywhere yet the effect of the whole is romantic and barbaric  the outer door into this hall is a little peculiar on an island it is covered with skins and is in four leaves like the swing doors of fashionable restaurants which allow you to enter without allowing the hot air to escape during the winter season our castaways have found the contrivance useful but crichtons brain was perhaps a little lordly when he conceived it another door leads by a passage to the sleepingrooms of the house which are all on the groundfloor and to crichtons workroom where he is at this moment and whither we should like to follow him but in a play we may not as it is out of sight there is a large window space without a window which however can be shuttered and through this we have a view of cattlesheds fowlpens and a field of grain it is a fine summer evening  tweeny is sitting there very busy plucking the feathers off a bird and dropping them on a sheet placed for that purpose on the floor she is trilling to herself in the lightness of her heart we may remember that tweeny alone among the women had dressed wisely for an island when they fled the yacht and her goingaway gown still adheres to her though in fragments a score of pieces have been added here and there as necessity compelled and these have been patched and repatched in incongruous colours but when all is said and done it can still be maintained that tweeny wears a skirt she is deservedly proud of her skirt and sometimes lends it on important occasions when approached in the proper spirit  some one outside has been whistling to tweeny the guarded whistle which on a less savage island is sometimes assumed to be an indication to cook that the constable is willing if the coast be clear tweeny however is engrossed or perhaps she is not in the mood for a follower so he climbs in at the window undaunted to take her willy nilly he is a jollylooking labouring man who answers to the name of daddy andbut though that may be his island name we recognise him at once he is lord loam settled down to the new conditions and enjoying life heartily as handyman about the happy home he is comfortably attired in skins he is still stout but all the flabbiness has dropped from him gone too is his pomposity his eye is clear brown his skin he could leap a gate  in his hands he carries an islandmade concertina and such is the exuberance of his spirits that as he lights on the floor he bursts into music and song something about his being a chickety chickety chick chick and will tweeny please to tell him whose chickety chick is she retribution follows sharp we hear a whir as if from insufficiently oiled machinery and over the passage door appears a placard showing the one word silence his lordship stops and steals to tweeny on his tiptoes  lord loam i thought the gov was out  tweeny well you see he aint and if he were to catch you here idling  lord loam pales he lays aside his musical instrument and hurriedly dons an apron tweeny gives him the bird to pluck and busies herself laying the table for dinner  lord loam softly what is he doing now  tweeny i think hes working out that plan for laying on hot and cold  lord loam proud of his master and hell manage it too the man who could build a blacksmiths forge without tools  tweeny not less proud he made the tools  lord loam out of half a dozen rusty nails the sawmill tweeny the speakingtube the electric lighting and look at the use he has made of the bits of the yacht that were washed ashore and all in two years hes a master im proud to pluck for  he chirps happily at his work and she regards him curiously  tweeny daddy youre of little use but youre a bright cheerful creature to have about the house he beams at this commendation do you ever think of old times now we was a bit different  lord loam pausing circumstances alter cases he resumes his plucking contentedly  tweeny but daddy if the chance was to come of getting back  lord loam i have given up bothering about it  tweeny you bothered that day long ago when we saw a ship passing the island how we all ran like crazy folk into the water daddy and screamed and held out our arms they are both a little agitated but it sailed away and weve never seen another  lord loam if we had had the electrical contrivance we have now we could have attracted that ships notice their eyes rest on a mysterious apparatus that fills a corner of the hall a touch on that lever tweeny and in a few moments bonfires would be blazing all round the shore  tweeny backing from the lever as if it might spring at her its the most wonderful thing he has done  lord loam in a reverie and thenenglandhome  tweeny also seeing visions london of a saturday night  lord loam my lords in rising once more to address this historic chamber  tweeny there was a little ham and beef shop off the edgware roadthe visions fade they return to the practical  lord loam tweeny do you think i could have an egg to my tea at this moment a wiry athletic figure in skins darkens the window he is carrying two pails which are suspended from a pole on his shoulder and he is ernest we should say that he is ernest completely changed if we were of those who hold that people change as he enters by the window he has heard lord loams appeal and is perhaps justifiably indignant  ernest what is that about an egg why should you have an egg  lord loam with hauteur that is my affair sir with a parthian shot as he withdraws stiffly from the room the gov has never put my head in a bucket  ernest coming to rest on one of his buckets and speaking with excusable pride to tweeny nor mine for nearly three months it was only last week tweeny that he said to me ernest the water cure has worked marvels in you and i question whether i shall require to dip you any more complacently of course that sort of thing encourages a fellow  tweeny who has now arranged the dinner table to her satisfaction i will say erny i never seen a young chap more improved  ernest gratified thank you tweeny thats very precious to me  she retires to the fire to work the great bellows with her foot and ernest turns to treherne who has come in looking more like a cowboy than a clergyman he has a small box in his hand which he tries to conceal what have you got there john  treherne dont tell anybody it is a little present for the gov a set of razors one for each day in the week  ernest opening the box and examining its contents shells hell like that he likes sets of things  treherne in a guarded voice have you noticed that  ernest rather  treherne hes becoming a bit magnificent in his ideas  ernest huskily john it sometimes gives me the creeps  treherne making sure that tweeny is out of hearing what do you think of that brilliant robe he got the girls to make for him  ernest uncomfortably i think he looks too regal in it  treherne regal i sometimes fancy that thats why hes so fond of wearing it practically well i must take these down to the grindstone and put an edge on them  ernest buttonholing him i say john i want a word with you  treherne well  ernest become suddenly diffident dash it all you know youre a clergyman  treherne one of the best things the gov has done is to insist that none of you forget it  ernest taking his courage in his hands thenwould you john  treherne what  ernest wistfully officiate at a marriage ceremony john  treherne slowly now thats really odd  ernest odd seems to me its natural and whatever is natural john is right  treherne i mean that same question has been put to me today already  ernest eagerly by one of the women  treherne oh no they all put it to me long ago this was by the gov himself  ernest by jove admiringly i say john what an observant beggar he is  treherne ah you fancy he was thinking of you  ernest i do not hesitate to affirm john that he has seen the lovelight in my eyes you answered  treherne i said yes i thought it would be my duty to officiate if called upon  ernest youre a brick  treherne still pondering but i wonder whether he was thinking of you  ernest make your mind easy about that  treherne well my best wishes agatha is a very fine girl  ernest agatha what made you think it was agatha  treherne man alive you told me all about it soon after we were wrecked  ernest pooh agathas all very well in her way john but im flying at bigger game  treherne ernest which is it  ernest tweeny of course  treherne tweeny reprovingly ernest i hope her cooking has nothing to do with this  ernest with dignity her cooking has very little to do with it  treherne but does she return your affection  ernest simply yes john i believe i may say so i am unworthy of her but i think i have touched her heart  treherne with a sigh some people seem to have all the luck as you know catherine wont look at me  ernest im sorry john  treherne its my deserts im a second eleven sort of chap well my heartiest good wishes ernest  ernest thank you john hows the little black pig today  treherne departing he has begun to eat again  after a moments reflection ernest calls to tweeny  ernest are you very busy tweeny  tweeny coming to him goodnaturedly theres always work to do but if you want me ernest  ernest theres something i should like to say to you if you could spare me a moment  tweeny willingly what is it  ernest what an ass i used to be tweeny  tweeny tolerantly oh let bygones be bygones  ernest sincerely and at his very best im no great shakes even now but listen to this tweeny i have known many women but until i knew you i never knew any woman  tweeny to whose uneducated ears this sounds dangerously like an epigram take carethe bucket  ernest hurriedly i didnt mean it in that way he goes chivalrously on his knees ah tweeny i dont undervalue the bucket but what i want to say now is that the sweet refinement of a dear girl has done more for me than any bucket could do  tweeny with large eyes are you offering to walk out with me erny  ernest passionately more than that i want to build a little house for youin the sunny glade down by porcupine creek i want to make chairs for you and tables and knives and forks and a sideboard for you  tweeny who is fond of language i like to hear you eyeing him would there be any one in the house except myself ernest  ernest humbly not often but just occasionally there would be your adoring husband  tweeny decisively it wont do ernest  ernest pleading it isnt as if i should be much there  tweeny i know i know but i dont love you ernest im that sorry  ernest putting his case cleverly twice a week i should be away altogetherat the dam on the other days you would never see me from breakfast time to supper with the selfabnegation of the true lover if you like ill even go fishing on sundays  tweeny its no use erny  ernest rising manfully thank you tweeny it cant be helped then he remembers tweeny we shall be disappointing the gov  tweeny with a sinking whats that  ernest he wanted us to marry  tweeny blankly you and me the gov her head droops woefully from without is heard the whistling of a happier spirit and tweeny draws herself up fiercely thats her thats the thing what has stole his heart from me a stalwart youth appears at the window so handsome and tingling with vitality that glad to depose crichton we cry thankfully the hero at last but it is not the hero it is the heroine this splendid boy clad in skins is what nature has done for lady mary she carries bow and arrows and a blowpipe and over her shoulder is a fat buck which she drops with a cry of triumph forgetting to enter demurely she leaps through the window sourly drat you polly why dont you wipe your feet  lady mary goodnaturedly come tweeny be nice to me its a splendid buck but tweeny shakes her off and retires to the kitchen fire  ernest where did you get it  lady mary gaily i sighted a herd near penguins creek but had to creep round silver lake to get to windward of them however they spotted me and then the fun began there was nothing for it but to try and run them down so i singled out a fat buck and away we went down the shore of the lake up the valley of rolling stones he doubled into brawling river and took to the water but i swam after him the river is only half a mile broad there but it runs strong he went spinning down the rapids down i went in pursuit he clambered ashore i clambered ashore away we tore helterskelter up the hill and down again i lost him in the marshes got on his track again near bread fruit wood and brought him down with an arrow in firefly grove  tweeny staring at her arent you tired  lady mary tired it was gorgeous she runs up a ladder and deposits her weapons on the joists she is whistling again  tweeny snapping i cant abide a woman whistling  lady mary indifferently i like it  tweeny stamping her foot drop it polly i tell you  lady mary stung i wont im as good as you are they are facing each other defiantly  ernest shocked is this necessary think how it would pain him lady marys eyes take a new expression we see them soft for the first time  lady mary contritely tweeny i beg your pardon if my whistling annoys you i shall try to cure myself of it instead of calming tweeny this floods her face in tears why how can that hurt you tweeny dear  tweeny because i cant make you lose your temper  lady mary divinely indeed i often do would that i were nicer to everybody  tweeny there you are again wistfully what makes you want to be so nice polly  lady mary with fervour only thankfulness tweeny she exults it is such fun to be alive so also seem to think catherine and agatha who bounce in with fishingrods and creel they too are in manly attire  catherine weve got some ripping fish for the govs dinner are we in time we ran all the way  tweeny tartly youll please to cook them yourself kitty and look sharp about it she retires to her hearth where agatha follows her  agatha yearning has the gov decided who is to wait upon him today  catherine who is cleaning her fish its my turn  agatha hotly i dont see that  tweeny with bitterness its to be neither of you aggy he wants polly again  lady mary is unable to resist a joyous whistle  agatha jealously polly you toad but they cannot make lady mary angry  tweeny storming how dare you look so happy  lady mary willing to embrace her i wish tweeny there was anything i could do to make you happy also  tweeny me oh im happy she remembers ernest whom it is easy to forget on an island ive just had a proposal i tell you  lady mary is shaken at last and her sisters with her  agatha a proposal  catherine going white notnotshe dare not say his name  ernest with singular modesty you neednt be alarmed its only me  lady mary relieved oh you  agatha happy again ernest you dear i got such a shock  catherine it was only ernest showing him her fish in thankfulness they are beautifully fresh come and help me to cook them  ernest with simple dignity do you mind if i dont cook fish tonight she does not mind in the least they have all forgotten him a lark is singing in three hearts i think you might all be a little sorry for a chap but they are not even sorry and he addresses agatha in these winged words im particularly disappointed in you aggy seeing that i was half engaged to you i think you might have had the good feeling to be a little more hurt  agatha oh bother  ernest summing up the situation in so far as it affects himself i shall now go and lie down for a bit he retires coldly but unregretted lady mary approaches tweeny with her most insinuating smile  lady mary tweeny as the gov has chosen me to wait on him please may i have the loan of it again the reference made with such charming delicacy is evidently to tweenys skirt  tweeny doggedly no you maynt  agatha supporting tweeny dont you give it to her  lady mary still trying sweet persuasion you know quite well that he prefers to be waited on in a skirt  tweeny i dont care get one for yourself  lady mary it is the only one on the island  tweeny and its mine  lady mary an aristocrat after all tweeny give me that skirt directly  catherine dont  tweeny i wont  lady mary clearing for action i shall make you  tweeny i should like to see you try  an unseemly fracas appears to be inevitable but something happens the whir is again heard and the notice is displayed dogs delight to bark and bite its effect is instantaneous and cheering the ladies look at each other guiltily and immediately proceed on tiptoe to their duties these are all concerned with the masters dinner catherine attends to his fish agatha fills a quaint toastrack and brings the menu which is written on a shell lady mary twists a wreath of green leaves around her head and places a flower beside the masters plate tweeny signs that all is ready and she and the younger sisters retire into the kitchen drawing the screen that separates it from the rest of the room lady mary beats a tomtom which is the dinner bell she then gently works a punkah which we have not hitherto observed and stands at attention no doubt she is in hopes that the gov will enter into conversation with her but she is too good a parlourmaid to let her hopes appear in her face we may watch her manner with complete approval there is not one of us who would not give her £26 a year  the master comes in quietly a book in his hand still the only book on the island for he has not thought it worth while to build a printingpress his dress is not noticeably different from that of the others the skins are similar but perhaps these are a trifle more carefully cut or he carries them better one sees somehow that he has changed for his evening meal there is an odd suggestion of a dinner jacket about his doeskin coat it is perhaps too grave a face for a man of thirtytwo as if he were over much immersed in affairs yet there is a sunny smile left to lighten it at times and bring back its youth perhaps too intellectual a face to pass as strictly handsome not sufficiently suggestive of oats his tall figure is very straight slight rather than thickset but nobly muscular his big hands firm and hard with labour though they be are finely shapednote the fingers so much more tapered the nails better tended than those of his domestics they are one of many indications that he is of a superior breed such signs as has often been pointed out are infallible a romantic figure too one can easily see why the womenfolks of this strong mans house both adore and fear him  he does not seem to notice who is waiting on him tonight but inclines his head slightly to whoever it is as she takes her place at the back of his chair lady mary respectfully places the menushell before him and he glances at it  crichton clear please  lady mary knocks on the screen and a serving hutch in it opens through which tweeny offers two soup plates lady mary selects the clear and the aperture is closed she works the punkah while the master partakes of the soup  crichton who always gives praise where it is due an excellent soup polly but still a trifle too rich  lady mary thank you  the next course is the fish and while it is being passed through the hutch we have a glimpse of three jealous women  lady marys movements are so deft and noiseless that any observant spectator can see that she was born to wait at table  crichton unbending as he eats polly you are a very smart girl  lady mary bridling but naturally gratified la  crichton smiling and im not the first youve heard it from ill swear  lady mary wriggling oh god  crichton got any followers on the island polly  lady mary tossing her head certainly not  crichton i thought that perhaps john or ernest  lady mary tilting her nose i dont say that its for want of asking  crichton emphatically im sure it isnt perhaps he thinks he has gone too far you may clear  flushed with pleasure she puts before him a bird and vegetables sees that his beaker is fitted with wine and returns to the punkah she would love to continue their conversation but it is for him to decide for a time he seems to have forgotten her  crichton did you lose any arrows today  lady mary only one in firefly grove  crichton you were as far as that how did you get across the black gorge  lady mary i went across on the rope  crichton hand over hand  lady mary swelling at the implied praise i wasnt in the least dizzy  crichton moved you brave girl he sits back in his chair a little agitated but never do that again  lady mary pouting it is such fun gov  crichton decisively i forbid it  lady mary the little rebel i shall  crichton surprised polly he signs to her sharply to step forward but for a moment she holds back petulantly and even when she does come it is less obediently than like a naughty sulky child nevertheless with the forbearance that is characteristic of the man he addresses her with grave gentleness rather than severely you must do as i tell you you know  lady mary strangely passionate i shant  crichton smiling at her fury we shall see frown at me polly there you do it at once clench your little fists stamp your feet bite your ribbonsa student of women or at least of this woman he knows that she is about to do those things and thus she seems to do them to order lady mary screws up her face like a baby and cries he is immediately kind you child of nature was it cruel of me to wish to save you from harm  lady mary drying her eyes im an ungracious wretch oh god i dont try half hard enough to please you im even wearingshe looks down sadlywhen i know you prefer it  crichton thoughtfully i admit i do prefer it perhaps i am a little oldfashioned in these matters her tears again threaten ah dont polly thats nothing  lady mary if i could only please you gov  crichton slowly you do please me child very muchhe half risesvery much indeed if he meant to say more he checks himself he looks at his plate no more thank you the simple island meal is ended save for the walnuts and the wine and crichton is too busy a man to linger long over them but he is a stickler for etiquette end the table is cleared charmingly though with dispatch before they are placed before him lady mary is an artist with the crumbbrush and there are few arts more delightful to watch dusk has come sharply and she turns on the electric light it awakens crichton from a reverie in which he has been regarding her  crichton polly there is only one thing about you that i dont quite like she looks up making a moue if that can be said of one who so well knows her place he explains that action of the hands  lady mary what do i do  crichton solike one washing them i have noticed that the others tend to do it also it seems odd  lady mary archly oh gov have you forgotten  crichton what  lady mary that once upon a time a certain other person did that  crichton groping you mean myself she nods and he shudders horrible  lady mary afraid she has hurt him you havent for a very long time perhaps it is natural to servants  crichton that must be it he rises polly she looks up expectantly but he only sighs and turns away  lady mary gently you sighed gov  crichton did i i was thinking he paces the room and then turns to her agitatedly yet with control over his agitation there is some mournfulness in his voice i have always tried to do the right thing on this island above all polly i want to do the right thing by you  lady mary with shining eyes how we all trust you that is your reward gov  crichton who is having a fight with himself and now i want a greater reward is it fair to you am i playing the game bill crichton would like always to play the game if we were in englandhe pauses so long that she breaks in softly  lady mary we know now that we shall never see england again  crichton i am thinking of two people whom neither of us has seen for a long timelady mary lasenby and one crichton a butler he says the last word bravely a word he once loved though it is the most horrible of all words to him now  lady mary that cold haughty insolent girl gov look around you and forget them both  crichton i had nigh forgotten them he has had a chance pollythat butlerin these two years of becoming a man and he has tried to take it there have been many failures but there has been some success and with it i have let the past drop off me and turned my back on it that butler seems a faraway figure to me now and not myself i hail him but we scarce know each other if i am to bring him back it can only be done by force for in my soul he is now abhorrent to me but if i thought it best for you id haul him back i swear as an honest man i would bring him back with all his obsequious ways and deferential airs and let you see the man you call your gov melt for ever into him who was your servant  lady mary shivering you hurt me you say these things but you say them like a king to me it is the past that was not real  crichton too grandly a king i sometimes feelfor a moment the yellow light gleams in his green eyes we remember suddenly what treherne and ernest said about his regal look he checks himself i say it harshly it is so hard to say and all the time there is another voice within me cryinghe stops  lady mary trembling but not afraid if it is the voice of nature  crichton strongly i know it to be the voice of nature  lady mary in a whisper then if you want to say it very much gov please say it to polly lasenby  crichton again in the grip of an idea a king polly some people hold that the soul but leaves one human tenement for another and so lives on through all the ages i have occasionally thought of late that in some past existence i may have been a king it has all come to me so naturally not as if i had had to work it out butasifiremembered or ever the knightly years were gone with the old world to the grave i was a king in babylon and you were a christian slave it may have been you hear me it may have been  lady mary who is as one fascinated it may have been  crichton i am lord over all they are but hewers of wood and drawers of water for me these shores are mine why should i hesitate i have no longer any doubt i do believe i am doing the right thing dear polly i have grown to love you are you afraid to mate with me she rocks her arms no words will come from her i was a king in babylon and you were a christian slave  lady mary bewitched you are the most wonderful man i have ever known and i am not afraid he takes her to him reverently presently he is seated and she is at his feet looking up adoringly in his face as the tension relaxes she speaks with a smile i want you to tell meevery woman likes to knowwhen was the first time you thought me nicer than the others  crichton who like all big men is simple i think a year ago we were chasing goats on the big slopes and you outdistanced us all you were the first of our party to run a goat down i was proud of you that day  lady mary blushing with pleasure oh gov i only did it to please you everything i have done has been out of the desire to please you suddenly anxious if i thought that in taking a wife from among us you were imperilling your dignity  crichton perhaps a little masterful have no fear of that dear i have thought it all out the wife polly always takes the same position as the husband  lady mary but i am so unworthy it was sufficient to me that i should be allowed to wait on you at that table  crichton you shall wait on me no longer at whatever table i sit polly you shall soon sit there also boyishly come let us try what it will be like  lady mary as your servant at your feet  crichton no as my consort by my side  they are sitting thus when the hatch is again opened and coffee offered but lady mary is no longer there to receive it her sisters peep through in consternation in vain they rattle the cup and saucer agatha brings the coffee to crichton  crichton forgetting for the moment that it is not a month hence help your mistress first girl three women are bereft of speech but he does not notice it he addresses catherine vaguely are you a good girl kitty  catherine when she finds her tongue i try to be gov  crichton still more vaguely thats right he takes command of himself again and signs to them to sit down ernest comes in cheerily but finding crichton here is suddenly weak he subsides on a chair wondering what has happened  crichton surveying him ernest ernest rises you are becoming a little slovenly in your dress ernest i dont like it  ernest respectfully thank you ernest sits again daddy and treherne arrive  crichton daddy i want you  lord loam with a sinking is it because i forgot to clean out the dam  crichton encouragingly no no he pours some wine into a goblet a glass of wine with you daddy  lord loam hastily your health gov he is about to drink but the master checks him  crichton and hers daddy this lady has done me the honour to promise to be my wife  lord loam astounded polly  crichton a little perturbed i ought first to have asked your consent i deeply regretbut nature may i hope i have your approval  lord loam may you gov delighted rather polly he puts his proud arms round her  treherne we all congratulate you gov most heartily  ernest long life to you both sir  there is much shaking of hands all of which is sincere  treherne when will it be gov  crichton after turning to lady mary who whispers to him as soon as the bridal skirt can be prepared his manner has been most indulgent and without the slightest suggestion of patronage but he knows it is best for all that he should keep his place and that his presence hampers them my friends i thank you for your good wishes i thank you all and now perhaps you would like me to leave you to yourselves be joyous let there be song and dance tonight polly i shall take my coffee in the parlouryou understand  he retires with pleasant dignity immediately there is a rush of two girls at lady mary  lady mary oh oh father they are pinching me  lord loam taking her under his protection agatha catherine never presume to pinch your sister again on the other hand she may pinch you henceforth as much as ever she chooses  in the meantime tweeny is weeping softly and the two are not above using her as a weapon  catherine poor tweeny its a shame  agatha after he had almost promised you  tweeny loyally turning on them no he never did he was always honourable as could be twas me as was too vulgar dont you dare say a word agin that man  ernest to lord loam youll get a lot of titbits out of this daddy  lord loam thats what i was thinking  ernest plunged in thought i dare say i shall have to clean out the dam now  lord loam heartlessly i dare say his gay old heart makes him again proclaim that he is a chickety chick he seizes the concertina  treherne eagerly thats the proper spirit he puts his arm round catherine and in another moment they are all dancing to daddys music never were people happier on an island a moments pause is presently created by the return of crichton wearing the wonderful robe of which we have already had dark mention never has he looked more regal never perhaps felt so regal we need not grudge him the one foible of his rule for it is all coming to an end  crichton graciously seeing them hesitate no no i am delighted to see you all so happy go on  treherne we dont like to before you gov  crichton his last order it is my wish  the merrymaking is resumed and soon crichton himself joins in the dance it is when the fun is at its fastest and most furious that all stop abruptly as if turned to stone they have heard the boom of a gun presently they are alive again ernest leaps to the window  treherne huskily it was a ships gun they turn to crichton for confirmation even in that hour they turn to crichton gov  crichton yes  in another moment lady mary and lord loam are alone  lady mary seeing that her father is unconcerned father you heard  lord loam placidly yes my child  lady mary alarmed by his unnatural calmness but it was a gun father  lord loam looking an old man now and shuddering a little yesa guni have often heard it its only a dream you know why dont we go on dancing  she takes his hands which have gone cold  lady mary father dont you see they have all rushed down to the beach come  lord loam rushed down to the beach yes always thati often dream it  lady mary come father come  lord loam only a dream my poor girl  crichton returns he is pale but firm  crichton we can see lights within a mile of the shorea great ship  lord loam a shipalways a ship  lady mary father this is no dream  lord loam looking timidly at crichton its a dream isnt it theres no ship  crichton soothing him with a touch you are awake daddy and there is a ship  lord loam clutching him you are not deceiving me  crichton it is the truth  lord loam reeling truea shipat last  he goes after the others pitifully  crichton quietly there is a small boat between it and the island they must have sent it ashore for water  lady mart coming in  crichton no that gun must have been a signal to recall it it is going back they cant hear our cries  lady mary pressing her temples going away so nearso near almost to herself i think im glad  crichton cheerily have no fear i shall bring them back  he goes towards the table on which is the electrical apparatus  lady mary standing on guard as it were between him and the table what are you going to do  crichton to fire the beacons  lady mary stop she faces him dont you see what it means  crichton firmly it means that our life on the island has come to a natural end  lady mary husky gov let the ship go  crichton the old manyou saw what it means to him  lady mary but i am afraid  crichton adoringly dear polly  lady mary gov let the ship go  crichton she clings to him but though it is his death sentence he loosens her hold bill crichton has got to play the game he pulls the levers soon through the window one of the beacons is seen flaring red there is a long pause shouting is heard ernest is the first to arrive  ernest polly gov the boat has turned back they are english sailors they have landed we are rescued i tell you rescued  lady mary wanly is it anything to make so great a todo about  ernest staring eh  lady mary have we not been happy here  ernest happy lord yes  lady mary catching hold of his sleeve ernest we must never forget all that the gov has done for us  ernest stoutly forget it the man who could forget it would be a selfish wretch and abut i say this makes a difference  lady mary quickly no it doesnt  ernest his mind tottering a mighty difference  the others come running in some weeping with joy others boisterous we see bluejackets gazing through the window at the curious scene lord loam comes accompanied by a naval officer whom he is continually shaking by the hand  lord loam and here sir is our little home let me thank you in the name of us all again and again and again  officer very proud my lord it is indeed an honour to have been able to assist so distinguished a gentleman as lord loam  lord loam a glorious glorious day i shall show you our other room come my pets come crichton  he has not meant to be cruel he does not know he has said it it is the old life that has come back to him they all go all leave crichton except lady mary  lady mary stretching out her arms to him dear gov i will never give you up  there is a salt smile on his face as he shakes his head to her he lets the cloak slip to the ground she will not take this for an answer again her arms go out to him then comes the great renunciation by an effort of will he ceases to be an erect figure he has the humble bearing of a servant his hands come together as if he were washing them  crichton it is the speech of his life my lady  she goes away there is none to salute him now unless we do it   end of act iii     act iv the other island   some months have elapsed and we have again the honour of waiting upon lord loam in his london home it is the room of the first act but with a new scheme of decoration for on the walls are exhibited many interesting trophies from the island such as skins stuffed birds and weapons of the chase labelled shot by lord loam hon ernest woolleys blowpipe etc there are also two large glass cases containing other odds and ends including curiously enough the bucket in which ernest was first dipped but there is no label calling attention to the incident it is not yet time to dress for dinner and his lordship is on a couch hastily yet furtively cutting the pages of a new book with him are his two younger daughters and his nephew and they also are engaged in literary pursuits that is to say the ladies are eagerly but furtively reading the evening papers of which ernest is sitting complacently but furtively on an endless number and doling them out as called for note the frequent use of the word furtive it implies that they do not wish to be discovered by their butler say at their otherwise delightful task  agatha reading aloud with emphasis on the wrong words in conclusion we most heartily congratulate the hon ernest woolley this book of his regarding the adventures of himself and his brave companions on a desert isle stirs the heart like a trumpet  evidently the book referred to is the one in lord loams hands  ernest handing her a pink paper here is another  catherine reading from the first to the last of mr woolleys engrossing pages it is evident that he was an ideal man to be wrecked with and a true hero largeeyed ernest  ernest calmly thats how it strikes them you know heres another one  agatha reading there are many kindly references to the two servants who were wrecked with the family and mr woolley pays the butler a glowing tribute in a footnote  some one coughs uncomfortably  lord loam who has been searching the index for the letter l excellent excellent at the same time i must say ernest that the whole book is about yourself  ernest genially as the author  lord loam certainly certainly still you know as a peer of the realmwith dignityi think ernest you might have given me one of your adventures  ernest i say it was you who taught us how to obtain a fire by rubbing two pieces of stick together  lord loam beaming do you do you i call that very handsome what page  here the door opens and the wellbred crichton enters with the evening papers as subscribed for by the house those we have already seen have perhaps been introduced by ernest up his waistcoat every one except the intruder is immediately selfconscious and when he withdraws there is a general sigh of relief they pounce on the new papers ernest evidently gets a shock from one which he casts contemptuously on the floor  agatha more fortunate father see page 81 it was a tigercat says mr woolley of the largest size death stared lord loam in the face but he never flinched  lord loam searching his book eagerly page 81  agatha with presence of mind only equalled by his courage he fixed an arrow in his bow  lord loam thank you ernest thank you my boy  agatha unfortunately he missed  lord loam eh  agatha but by great good luck i heard his cries  lord loam my cries  agathaand rushing forward with drawn knife i stabbed the monster to the heart  lord loam shuts his book with a pettish slam there might be a scene here were it not that crichton reappears and goes to one of the glass cases all are at once on the alert and his lordship is particularly sly  lord loam anything in the papers catherine  catherine no father nothingnothing at all  ernest it pops out as of yore the papers the papers are guides that tell us what we ought to do and then we dont do it  crichton having opened the glass case has taken out the bucket and ernest looking round for applause sees him carrying it off and is undone for a moment of time he forgets that he is no longer on the island and with a sigh he is about to follow crichton and the bucket to a retired spot the door closes and ernest comes to himself  lord loam uncomfortably i told him to take it away  ernest i thoughthe wipes his browi shall go and dress he goes  catherine father its awful having crichton here its like living on tiptoe  lord loam gloomily while he is here we are sitting on a volcano  agatha how mean of you i am sure he has only stayed on with us toto help us through it would have looked so suspicious if he had gone at once  catherine revelling in the worst but suppose lady brocklehurst were to get at him and pump him shes the most terrifying suspicious old creature in england and crichton simply cant tell a lie  lord loam my dear that is the volcano to which i was referring he has evidently something to communicate its all marys fault she said to me yesterday that she would break her engagement with brocklehurst unless i told him aboutyou know what  all conjure up the vision of crichton  agatha is she mad  lord loam she calls it common honesty  catherine father have you told him  lord loam heavily she thinks i have but i couldnt shes sure to find out tonight  unconsciously he leans on the island concertina which he has perhaps been lately showing to an interviewer as something he made for tweeny it squeaks and they all jump  catherine its like a bird of illomen  lord loam vindictively i must have it taken away it has done that twice  lady mary comes in she is in evening dress undoubtedly she meant to sail in but she forgets and despite her garments it is a manly entrance she is properly ashamed of herself she tries again and has an encouraging success she indicates to her sisters that she wishes to be alone with papa  agatha all right but we know what its about come along kit  they go lady mary thoughtlessly sits like a boy and again corrects herself she addresses her father but he is in a brown study and she seeks to draw his attention by whistling this troubles them both  lady mary how horrid of me  lord loam depressed if you would try to remember  lady mary sighing i do but there are so many things to remember  lord loam sympathetically there arein a whisper do you know mary i constantly find myself secreting hairpins  lady mary i find it so difficult to go up steps one at a time  lord loam i was dining with half a dozen members of our party last thursday mary and they were so eloquent that i couldnt help wondering all the time how many of their heads he would have put in the bucket  lady mary i use so many of his phrases and my appetite is so scandalous father i usually have a chop before we sit down to dinner  lord loam as for my clotheswriggling my dear you cant think how irksome collars are to me nowadays  lady mary they cant be half such an annoyance father asshe looks dolefully at her skirt  lord loam hurriedly quite soquite so you have dressed early tonight mary  lady mary that reminds me i had a note from brocklehurst saying that he would come a few minutes before his mother asas he wanted to have a talk with me he didnt say what about but of course we know his lordship fidgets with feeling it was good of you to tell him father oh it is horrible to mecovering her face it seemed so natural at the time  lord loam petulantly never again make use of that word in this house mary  lady mary with an effort father brocklehurst has been so loyal to me for these two years that i should despise myself were i to keep mymy extraordinary lapse from him had brocklehurst been a little less good then you need not have told him my strange little secret  lord loam weakly pollyi mean maryit was all crichtons fault he  lady mary with decision no father no not a word against him though i havent the pluck to go on with it i cant even understand how it ever was father do you not still hear the surf do you see the curve of the beach  lord loam i have begun to forgetin a low voice but they were happy days there was something magical about them  lady mary it was glamour father i have lived arabian nights i have sat out a dance with the evening star but it was all in a past existence in the days of babylon and i am myself again but he has been chivalrous always if the slothful indolent creature i used to be has improved in any way i owe it all to him i am slipping back in many ways but i am determined not to slip back altogetherin memory of him and his island that is why i insisted on your telling brocklehurst he can break our engagement if he chooses proudly mary lasenby is going to play the game  lord loam but my dear  lord brocklehurst is announced  lady mary meaningly father dear oughtnt you to be dressing  lord loam very unhappy the fact isbefore i goi want to say  lord brocklehurst loam if you dont mind i wish very specially to have a word with mary before dinner  lord loam but  lady mary yes father she induces him to go and thus courageously faces lord brocklehurst to hear her fate i am ready george  lord brocklehurst who is so agitated that she ought to see he is thinking not of her but of himself it is a painful matteri wish i could have spared you this mary  lady mary please go on  lord brocklehurst in common fairness of course this should be remembered that two years had elapsed you and i had no reason to believe that we should ever meet again  this is more considerate than she had expected  lady mary softening i was so lost to the world george  lord brocklehurst with a groan at the same time the thing is utterly and absolutely inexcusable  lady mary recovering her hauteur oh  lord brocklehurst and so i have already said to mother  lady mary disdaining him you have told her  lord brocklehurst certainly mary certainly i tell mother everything  lady mary curling her lip and what did she say  lord brocklehurst to tell the truth mother rather poohpoohed the whole affair  lady mary incredulous lady brocklehurst poohpoohed the whole affair  lord brocklehurst she said mary and i will have a good laugh over this  lady mary outraged george your mother is a hateful depraved old woman  lord brocklehurst mary  lady mary turning away laugh indeed when it will always be such a pain to me  lord brocklehurst with strange humility if only you would let me bear all the pain mary  lady mary who is taken aback george i think you are the noblest man  she is touched and gives him both her hands unfortunately he simpers  lord brocklehurst she was a pretty little thing she stares but he marches to his doom ah not beautiful like you i assure you it was the merest flirtation there were a few letters but we have got them back it was all owing to the boat being so late at calais you see she had such large helpless eyes  lady mary fixing him george when you lunched with father today at the club  lord brocklehurst i didnt he wired me that he couldnt come  lady mary with a tremor but he wrote you  lord brocklehurst no  lady mary a bird singing in her breast you havent seen him since  lord brocklehurst no  she is saved is he to be let off also not at all she bears down on him like a ship of war  lady mary george who and what is this woman  lord brocklehurst cowering she wasshe isthe shame of ita ladysmaid  lady mary properly horrified a what  lord brocklehurst a ladysmaid a mere servant mary lady mary whirls round so that he shall not see her face i first met her at this house when you were entertaining the servants so you see it was largely your fathers fault  lady mary looking him up and down a ladysmaid  lord brocklehurst degraded her name was fisher  lady mary my maid  lord brocklehurst with open hands can you forgive me mary  lady mary oh george george  lord brocklehurst mother urged me not to tell you anything about it but  lady mary from her heart i am so glad you told me  lord brocklehurst you see there was nothing wrong in it  lady mary thinking perhaps of another incident no indeed  lord brocklehurst inclined to simper again and she behaved awfully well she quite saw that it was because the boat was late i suppose the glamour to a girl in service of a man in high position  lady mary glamouryes yes that was it  lord brocklehurst mother says that a girl in such circumstances is to be excused if she loses her head  lady mary impulsively george i am so sorry if i said anything against your mother i am sure she is the dearest old thing  lord brocklehurst in calm waters at last of course for women of our class she has a very different standard  lady mary grown tiny of course  lord brocklehurst you see knowing how good a woman she is herself she was naturally anxious that i should marry some one like her that is what has made her watch your conduct so jealously mary  lady mary hurriedly thinking things out i know ii think george that before your mother comes i should like to say a word to father  lord brocklehurst nervously about this  lady mary oh no i shant tell him of this about something else  lord brocklehurst and you do forgive me mary  lady mary smiling on him yes yes ii am sure the boat was very late george  lord brocklehurst earnestly it really was  lady mary i am even relieved to know that you are not quite perfect dear she rests her hands on his shoulders she has a moment of contrition george when we are married we shall try to be not an entirely frivolous couple wont we we must endeavour to be of some little use dear  lord brocklehurst the ass noblesse oblige  lady mary haunted by the phrases of a better man mary lasenby is determined to play the game george  perhaps she adds to herself except just this once a kiss closes this episode of the two lovers and soon after the departure of lady mary the countess of brocklehurst is announced she is a very formidable old lady  lady brocklehurst alone george  lord brocklehurst mother i told her all she has behaved magnificently  lady brocklehurst who has not shared his fears silly boy she casts a supercilious eye on the island trophies so these are the wonders they brought back with them gone away to dry her eyes i suppose  lord brocklehurst proud of his mate she didnt cry mother  lady brocklehurst no she reflects youre quite right i wouldnt have cried cold icy yes that was it  lord brocklehurst who has not often contradicted her i assure you mother that wasnt it at all she forgave me at once  lady brocklehurst opening her eyes sharply to the full oh  lord brocklehurst she was awfully nice about the boat being late she even said she was relieved to find that i wasnt quite perfect  lady brocklehurst pouncing she said that  lord brocklehurst she really did  lady brocklehurst i mean i wouldnt now if i had said that what would have made me say it suspiciously george is mary all we think her  lord brocklehurst with unexpected spirit if she wasnt mother you would know it  lady brocklehurst hold your tongue boy we dont really know what happened on that island  lord brocklehurst you were reading the book all the morning  lady brocklehurst how can i be sure that the book is true  lord brocklehurst they all talk of it as true  lady brocklehurst how do i know that they are not lying  lord brocklehurst why should they lie  lady brocklehurst why shouldnt they she reflects again if i had been wrecked on an island i think it highly probable that i should have lied when i came back werent some servants with them  lord brocklehurst crichton the butler he is surprised to see her ring the bell why mother you are not going to  lady brocklehurst yes i am pointedly george watch whether crichton begins any of his answers to my questions with the fact is  lord brocklehurst why  lady brocklehurst because that is usually the beginning of a lie  lord brocklehurst as crichton opens the door mother you cant do these things in other peoples houses  lady brocklehurst coolly to crichton it was i who rang surveying him through her eyeglass so you were one of the castaways crichton  crichton yes my lady  lady brocklehurst delightful book mr woolley has written about your adventures crichton bows dont you think so  crichton i have not read it my lady  lady brocklehurst odd that they should not have presented you with a copy  lord brocklehurst presumably crichton is no reader  lady brocklehurst by the way crichton were there any books on the island  crichton i had one my ladyhenleys poems  lord brocklehurst never heard of him  crichton again bows  lady brocklehurst who has not heard of him either i think you were not the only servant wrecked  crichton there was a young woman my lady  lady brocklehurst i want to see her crichton bows but remains fetch her up he goes  lord brocklehurst almost standing up to his mother this is scandalous  lady brocklehurst defining her position i am a mother  catherine and agatha enter in dazzling confections and quake in secret to find themselves practically alone with lady brocklehurst  even as she greets them how dyou do catherineagatha you didnt dress like this on the island i expect by the way how did you dress  they have thought themselves prepared but  agatha notnot so well of course but quite the same idea  they are relieved by the arrival of treherne who is in clerical dress  lady brocklehurst how do you do mr treherne there is not so much of you in the book as i had hoped  treherne modestly there wasnt very much of me on the island lady brocklehurst  lady brocklehurst how dye mean he shrugs his honest shoulders  lord brocklehurst i hear you have got a living treherne congratulations  treherne thanks  lord brocklehurst is it a good one  treherne soso they are rather weak in bowling but its a good bit of turf confidence is restored by the entrance of ernest who takes in the situation promptly and of course knows he is a match for any old lady  ernest with ease how do you do lady brocklehurst  lady brocklehurst our brilliant author  ernest impervious to satire oh i dont know  lady brocklehurst it is as engrossing mr woolley as if it were a work of fiction  ernest suddenly uncomfortable thanks awfully recovering the fact ishe is puzzled by seeing the brocklehurst family exchange meaning looks  catherine to the rescue lady brocklehurst mr treherne and iwe are engaged  agatha and ernest and i  lady brocklehurst grimly i see my dears thought it wise to keep the island in the family  an awkward moment this for the entrance of lord loam and lady mary who after a private talk upstairs are feeling happy and secure  lord loam with two hands for his distinguished guest aha ha ha younger than any of them emily  lady brocklehurst flatterer to lady mary you seem in high spirits mary  lady mary gaily i am  lady brocklehurst with a significant glance at lord brocklehurst after  lady mary ii mean the fact is  again that disconcerting glance between the countess and her son  lord loam humorously she hears wedding bells emily ha ha  lady brocklehurst coldly do you mary cant say i do but im hard of hearing  lady mary instantly her match if you dont lady brocklehurst im sure i dont  lord loam nervously tut tut seen our curios from the island emily i should like you to examine them  lady brocklehurst thank you henry i am glad you say that for i have just taken the liberty of asking two of them to step upstairs there is an uncomfortable silence which the entrance of crichton with tweeny does not seem to dissipate crichton is impenetrable but tweeny hangs back in fear  lord brocklehurst stoutly loam i have no hand in this  lady brocklehurst undisturbed pooh what have i done you always begged me to speak to the servants henry and i merely wanted to discover whether the views you used to hold about equality were adopted on the island it seemed a splendid opportunity but mr woolley has not a word on the subject  all eyes turn to ernest  ernest with confidence the fact is  the fatal words again  lord loam not quite certain what he is to assure her of i assure you emily  lady mary as cold as steel father nothing whatever happened on the island of which i for one am ashamed and i hope crichton will be allowed to answer lady brocklehursts questions  lady brocklehurst to be sure theres nothing to make a fuss about and were a family party to crichton now truthfully my man  crichton calmly i promise that my lady  some hearts sink the hearts that could never understand a crichton  lady brocklehurst sharply well were you all equal on the island  crichton no my lady i think i may say there was as little equality there as elsewhere  lady brocklehurst ah the social distinctions were preserved  crichton as at home my lady  lady brocklehurst the servants  crichton they had to keep their place  lady brocklehurst wonderful how was it managed with an inspiration you girl tell me that  can there be a more critical moment  tweeny in agony if you please my lady it was all the govs doing  they give themselves up for lost lord loam tries to sink out of sight  crichton in the regrettable slang of the servants hall my lady the master is usually referred to as the gov  lady brocklehurst i see she turns to lord loam you  lord loam reappearing yes i understand that is what they call me  lady brocklehurst to crichton you didnt even take your meals with the family  crichton no my lady i dined apart  is all safe  lady brocklehurst alas you girl also did you dine with crichton  tweeny scared no your ladyship  lady brocklehurst fastening on her with whom  tweeny i took my bit of supper withwith daddy and polly and the rest  vae victis  ernest leaping into the breach dear old daddyhe was our monkey you remember our monkey agatha  agatha rather what a funny old darling he was  catherine thus encouraged and dont you think polly was the sweetest little parrot mary  lady brocklehurst ah i understand animals you had domesticated  lord loam heavily quite soquite so  lady brocklehurst the servants teas that used to take place here once a month  crichton they did not seem natural on the island my lady and were discontinued by the govs orders  lord brocklehurst a clear proof loam that they were a mistake here  lord loam seeing the opportunity for a diversion i admit it frankly i abandon them emily as the result of our experiences on the island i think of going over to the tories  lady brocklehurst i am delighted to hear it  lord loam expanding thank you crichton thank you that is all  he motions to them to go but the time is not yet  lady brocklehurst one moment there is a universal but stifled groan young people crichton will be young people even on an island now i suppose there was a certain amount ofshall we say sentimentalising going on  crichton yes my lady there was  lord brocklehurst ashamed mother  lady brocklehurst disregarding him which gentleman to tweeny you girl tell me  tweeny confused if you please my lady  ernest hurriedly the fact ishe is checked as before and probably says dn to himself but he has saved the situation  tweeny gasping it was himmr ernest your ladyship  lady brocklehurst counsel for the prosecution with which lady  agatha i have already told you lady brocklehurst that ernest and i  lady brocklehurst yes now but you were two years on the island looking at lady mary was it this lady  tweeny no your ladyship  lady brocklehurst then i dont care which of the others it was tweeny gurgles well i suppose that will do  lord brocklehurst do i hope you are ashamed of yourself mother to crichton who is going you are an excellent fellow crichton and if after we are married you ever wish to change your place come to us  lady mary losing her head for the only time oh no impossible  lady brocklehurst at once suspicious why impossible lady mary cannot answer or perhaps she is too proud do you see why it should be impossible my man  he can make or mar his unworthy mary now have you any doubt of him  crichton yes my lady i had not told you my lord but as soon as your lordship is suited i wish to leave service they are all immensely relieved except poor tweeny  treherne the only curious one what will you do crichton crichton shrugs his shoulders god knows it may mean  crichton shall i withdraw my lord he withdraws without a tremor tweeny accompanying him they can all breathe again the thunderstorm is over  lady brocklehurst thankful to have made herself unpleasant horrid of me wasnt it but if one wasnt disagreeable now and again it would be horribly tedious to be an old woman he will soon be yours mary and thenthink of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to me on that understanding my dear dont you think we might their cold lips meet  lord loam vaguely quite soquite so crichton announces dinner and they file out lady mary stays behind a moment and impulsively holds out her hand  lady mary to wish you every dear happiness  crichton an enigma to the last the same to you my lady  lady mary do you despise me crichton the man who could never tell a lie makes no answer you are the best man among us  crichton on an island my lady perhaps but in england no  lady mary then theres something wrong with england  crichton my lady not even from you can i listen to a word against england  lady mary tell me one thing you have not lost your courage  crichton no my lady  she goes he turns out the lights
